8450,study region austria study focus using publicly available data for the main components of the hydrological cycle we use standardization to calculate countrywide and regional averages of groundwater levels stream stages and precipitation these averages get analyzed for the occurrence of trends compared with each other and the austrian water use over time new hydrological insights for the region it is shown that groundwater levels trend downwards until the 1980s from whereon they recover precipitation follows this track but the downward trend is much less severe river stages lack data for the downward trending period but follow the upward trend too the trend in groundwater is a reverse of the trends observed in water use and we hypothesize that the discrepancy between average precipitation and average groundwater pre 1980s could be caused by the increasing water use in this period especially since austrias water demands are mostly sourced from groundwater keywords sgi spi srsi austria trend analysis hydrologic cycle time series analysis 1 introduction groundwater is an important resource for public industrial and agricultural water use which is interlinked with other components of the hydrological cycle and thus replenished by infiltrating precipitation or surface waters in some regions of the world groundwater resources are under stress as the exploitation appears to be critically high relative to the rate of replenishment oki and kanae 2006 in austria renewable freshwater resources overall exceed by far water use in particular within the alps yet towards the pannonian climate zone in the eastern part of the country considerably lower precipitation and thus lower groundwater recharge prevails in addition the alpine region is expected to be particularly affected by climate change and its impacts as warming since the late 19th century was twice as high as the northern hemispheric and global average auer et al 2007 gobiet et al 2014 as a result groundwater resources may be temporarily stressed in some regions e g under drought conditions and future changes in climate land use and water management e g as considered by hohmann et al 2018 potentially can have adverse effects on both the replenishment and the exploitation of groundwater resources thus aggravating water stress in order to improve our understanding how groundwater levels respond to changes in hydrometeorological variables we have previously used standardized time series of groundwater levels stream stages and precipitation to compare the correlations of these variables in alpine and prealpine subregions of a river basin haas and birk 2017 this standardization of groundwater levels uses the standardized groundwater level index sgi bloomfield and marchant 2013 and allows averaging time series of groundwater levels from different observation wells fig 1 shows the average of the standardized groundwater levels calculated using the longest running time series available from the webportal of the austrian hydrographic service http ehyd gv at bmlfuw 2016 this country wide sgi exhibits a distinct falling trend from 1960s onwards which appears to turn into an increasing trend in the 1980s this finding poses a series of questions which we try to address in this paper are these trends just artifacts stemming from the low number of observation wells used for calculating the mean long term sgi or do they still hold when adding a larger number of wells into the dataset how does a change in the number of wells in the dataset affect the validity of the found trends are these apparent countrywide trends also visible in all parts of the country or just a result of imbalances in the local distribution of observation wells are those trends a result of climatic conditions or do we see effects of groundwater exploitation which is generally known to rise with gdp until a certain point from whereon it tends to drop again jia et al 2006 in order to contribute to an answer of these questions we consider the representativeness of a single time series for a whole country which is made up from different geographical and climatic regions by looking at local averages and by comparing the already mentioned groundwater sgi with precipitation spi mckee et al 1993 and surface water srsi haas and birk 2017 groundwater levels are impacted by precipitation and river stages which are linked to climate change and in the case of rivers various man made changes for flood protection power production and for the danube the use as a major shipping route which demand special consideration the spatial distribution of the underlying time series and its change over time caused by the development of monitoring infrastructure over time is also possibly affecting the validity of the observed trends so we compare datasets with a changing number of measurements with datasets where the number of measurements is fixed regarding the possible effects of water use we try to give a short summary of austrias recent water use history to our knowledge few studies have been conducted using a similar approach to ours or focusing on austria livada and assimakopoulos 2007 and abdou and thierry 2009 have used average spis but for greece and the sahel region respectively regarding austria schöner et al 2011 gives a detailed overview for the long term development for all components of the water cycle e g also including temperature and glaciers for austria including pre 1900 data and modeling approaches for the possible future development and adaption strategies aimed at policy makers however these authors did not compare the different components of the water cycle using standardization or did not consider averages of multiple time series as attempted here another groundwater issue which has also been considered by schöner et al 2011 is groundwater temperature where benz et al 2018 provide a more recent overview 2 data and methods 2 1 data most of the data used herein is sourced from the ehyd gv at website which is the official public gateway to the austrian precipitation surface water and groundwater data bmlfuw 2016 for a more detailed discussion of the ehyd website the interested reader is referred to haas and birk 2017 and the references therein further for long term precipitation data we use the zamg histalp dataset http zamg ac at histalp index php auer et al 2007 as of 2018 the ehyd website allows for access to 950 precipitation measurement time series and thus corresponding to 950 measurement stations 800 surface water level measurement time series and 3040 groundwater level measurement time series since we are interested in the long term development and since standardization needs a certain minimum length of record see section 2 2 we chose only the stations that have data available from 1980 on which results in a subset of 599 precipitation time series 426 river level time series and 1017 groundwater level time series from all of austria see fig 2 due to the development of the austrian measurement network see also section 3 3 this number of stations is not static in time while there are more measurements available for younger data e g the 3040 groundwater levels mentioned above this also means that for older time series there are less measurements available a short overview of these numbers is given in table 1 and a plot highlighting the development over time is shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 2 groundwater observation wells tend to be clustered in the large valleys and the plains outside of the alps compared to a more uniform distribution of precipitation and river stages gauges though naturally those also tend to show a lower density in the high and remote mountain regions the regions with many groundwater observation wells are also the main settlement regions of austria thus the groundwater observation wells map pretty well most of the austrian population its main industry centers and most of the non mountain farming agriculture while they are not spatially representative for the whole country we deem them representative for the settled or used part of the country and we would estimate similar conditions in densely populated valleys such as the inn or enns valley for which there is no long term data available the subset of the 24 oldest wells see fig 2 shows a good distribution across the country albeit with a bias towards the east and towards rural regions however since the largest population clusters are in the same regions as these oldest wells and since they tend to be situated in large unconsolidated aquifer bodies we do deem them valid for an insight into the historical water levels across austria an introduction into the history of water use and monitoring in austria is discussed in more detail in section 3 3 2 1 1 erroneous data data from the histalp dataset is already homogenized and quality improved see http zamg ac at histalp about php thus we use this data as is according to bmlfuw 2016 the ehyd dataset is also reviewed and error corrected however this includes flagging missing data in a time series as nan since there can be considerable amounts of such missing data we have multiple steps of checking a dataset a time series is not used if there are more than 14 consecutive missing days daily data or if there are more than 3 consecutive missing months monthly data and if there are more than 10 of the data missing throughout the time series critical missing in table 1 the numbers stated in the previous section thus already exclude these series with a large share of erroneous data for time series below this threshold the missing data gets filled with a linear interpolation between the last existing datapoints which applies to 216 time series for groundwater 7 time series for rivers and 56 time series for precipitation from ehyd small missing in table 1 2 2 standardization in order to be able to compare different locations and different types of data we are working with standardized time series this allows for the comparison of say precipitation in millimeters with groundwater levels in meters above sea level on the same scale further this allows to calculate an average over a whole standardized dataset such as for example all austrian precipitation measurements or all the groundwater observation wells in a certain province while we already discard data with a large number of errors see previous section this averaging also reduces the effects of the interpolation fill over small amounts of missing data for this standardization we use the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the closely related standardized groundwater level index sgi bloomfield and marchant 2013 and the standardized river stages index srsi sgi applied to river stages haas and birk 2017 as sgi and srsi are build on the same approach as the spi they are expected to exhibit similar strengths and weaknesses while the spi has already been used for countrywide or regional averages e g livada and assimakopoulos 2007 for greece and abdou and thierry 2009 for the sahel region there are limitations for the needed lengths of time series and their suitability in comparing time series of different lengths the spi is a widely used and recommended index see e g svoboda et al 2012 however it is know to have certain weaknesses apart from mckee et al 1993 s original demand for at least 30 years of data wu et al 2005 also highlight the need for long time series because the spi is a probability related index the longer the length of record the more confidence there is in the stability of the underlying statistics which is echoed by similar reservations in svoboda et al 2012 hence we are only using long 30 years time series for the analysis presented herein in order to lessen possible negative effects from too short time series besides these demands for a certain minimum length different lengths of time series can also cause different standardized values for a certain event due to differences in the shape and scale parameters of the fitted gamma or other distribution for different length records bloomfield and marchant 2013 wu et al 2005 show that this can possibly cause large discrepancies for a single event standardized with a 13 month spi when using approximately 30 years compared to 100 years of data but in most cases the discrepancies are minor monthly sgi values are frequently found to correlate with the spi accumulated over periods of several months for data from the mur valley which is part of the data set explored herein haas and birk 2017 found the highest correlation with sgi for an spi accumulation period of six months spi6 although the accumulation period yielding the highest sgi spi correlation varies depending on the aquifer characteristics six months appears to be a typical value at other sites too e g kumar et al 2016 we have tested the averaged dataset used herein and also found that the spi6 shows the highest correlations in this work we therefore focus on spi6 this standardization and analysis is done in the python scripting language using the well known pandas mckinney 2010 numpy van der walt et al 2011 and matplotlib hunter 2007 packages a detailed description of this work as well as executable code can be found in haas et al 2018 2 3 trend analysis besides visual identification from plots methods such as the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 or regression analysis are generally used to identify trends in time series however these methods require various assumptions or data pre processing which might invalidate their results şen 2012 şen 2017 in order to avoid these shortcomings şen 2012 with further details in şen 2017 proposed an innovative trend analysis methodology that plots two sorted halves of the time series against each other on a cartesian coordinate system as shown in fig 4 this results in an increasing trend light gray line plotting in the upper left part of the plot light gray stars whereas a decreasing trend would plot in the lower right not shown for comparison a trendless time series black line plots on a 45 straight line black dots if various phenomena are found in the time series as often the case in hydrologic observations a şen plot can serve to highlight these for instance fig 4 shows a synthetic time series gray dashed line where the high values increase whereas the low values decrease which could be for example a river discharge showing a trend towards more extremes while the trends in the examples in fig 4 are quite obvious this method can robustly analyze real noisy data where underlying trends are not as apparent further when applied to datasets split in time it can serve to highlight differences in behavior over time in this paper we use this approach to explore the differences before and after 1980 further this method also allows to test these trends for significance as explained in şen 2017 however it has to be noted that this significance test uses a single slope for the whole time series in question for many hydrological time series as described herein a purely linear trend might not be the best interpretation of a trend as highlighted by the increasing and decreasing time series in fig 4 for which the method looses the information about two opposing trends in the series in an average slope which in this case is also insignificant due to this the simple significances quoted in the figures have to be interpreted with caution besides this quantitative method we also use smoothed plots of the country or province means to help with visual trend or tipping point identification for this we use the savitzky golay filter savitzky and golay 1964 the scipy community 2018 with a window size of 10 years plus one month due to technical reasons in order to be able to smooth over the full time series the used method defaults to fitting a degree polyorder polynomial to the ends of the time series the scipy community 2018 which results in the noticeably rising or falling ends of the smoothed series since this method cannot fore or backcast the first and last 5 years of the smoothed time series do have to be interpreted with caution 3 results and discussion 3 1 standardization of time series of different lengths as mentioned in section 2 2 the standardization methods employed herein show certain weaknesses in order to see whether our dataset suffers from these issues we have taken the 24 oldest wells in the dataset approximately 95 to 65 years of data and standardized them twice once for their whole period and once cut to a 35 year period from 1980 on as can be seen in fig 5 the mean sgi values for this set of wells between 1980 and 2015 do differ however the differences are minor thus we deem it suitable to use the full period for the sgi and other indices in the following sections albeit with the caveat that the changing number of wells in the early time periods can affect their meaningfulness for the srsi with its two regime shifts see fig 10 the second of which also coincides with a large increase in the number of gauging stations the difference between the time series of different lengths however is strong thus we only use a shortened time series for most of the discussion of river levels the precipitation time series available to us all histalp data or mostly ehyd data have the same length so they are not strongly affected by these possible issues 3 2 development over time 3 2 1 groundwater 3 2 1 1 countrywide fig 6 shows the mean sgi for all of austria as well as the mean sgi smoothed with a 121 month savitzky golay filter as already discussed in the introduction the sgi appears to be falling until the mid 80s and shows a rising trend following that which appears to fit well with the trends in water use and the fact that most of the austrian water is sourced from groundwater since this long dataset possibly contains some artifacts due to the changing number of time series and their differing lengths the declining trend towards the 1980s has to be interpreted with caution see also section 3 1 in order to test our dataset for such possible effects we have split the dataset into various subsets for a trend analysis with şen plots as shown in fig 7 the falling trend before 1980 differs considerably depending on the subset of data ignoring the very high sgi period before 1950 obviously reduces the falling trend as does using a subset of data with a vastly changing number of wells the rise from 1980 on however is much more stable since there is neither a possibility for a large change in the number of wells nor is there a possibility to compare time periods of differing lengths different periods used for the standardization of data do affect the trend too but only in an minor way these trends shown in fig 7 are partly different from the trends observed by schöner et al 2011 who analyzed the 1956 2006 and 1976 2006 periods using yearly data and counting the number of time series showing a trend they found that for the short period 24 of measurements show a significant falling trend whereas only 10 show a rising one the long time period on the other hand has 42 of time series that show a falling trend the latter is consistent with the visual assessment of the sgi values in fig 6 suggesting a decreasing trend from 1956 to 2006 and with our finding of a decrease before 1980 that is more pronounced than the subsequent increase in contrast the low number of wells showing an increasing trend from 1976 to 2006 appears to be different from our finding of an increasing trend after 1980 yet a direct comparison of these results is difficult as the approach employed by schöner et al 2011 differs in several aspects from the one used here groundwater levels of individual wells vs average of standardized values different time periods and numbers of time series different handling of errors and gaps in the data etc 3 2 1 2 provinces as fig 2 shows the groundwater observation wells that cover a long enough time frame for standardization are mostly situated close to austrias major population centers in its lowlands with a strong bias towards the northeast yet fig 8 shows that the falling trend towards 1980 and the reversal afterwards as discussed in the previous section also holds true for province mean sgis albeit the rises after 1980 are less prominent or might even not be rises for some provinces while we have shown see section 3 1 that the artifacts from a changing number of data points are likely minor this is still something to be considered a şen trend analysis see fig 9 reveals that the rise and fall for the oldest wells are very consistent and affect all three provinces in this subset apart from some extreme values in styria the falling trend before 1980 for the whole dataset also appears to show in almost all provinces besides salzburg and the mid low values for upper austria however this subset of the data shows a large variation in the number of wells 0 220 and length of available data 5 50 years highlighted by the case of salzburg where the apparent clear rise is only due to 28 wells for the 5 year period of 1975 1979 using the stable dataset from 1980 on the rising trend that appears to be small but consistent for all but the medium values in fig 7 splits into provinces that show mostly a rising trend lower austria vienna vorarlberg burgenland upper austria mostly a falling trend carinthia and differing or no trends styria salzburg where the rising provinces make up the largest number of wells and thus dominate the countrywide average other phenomena visible in fig 9 are that all provinces besides salzburg show an increase in positive extremes and that the provinces that show the most decreases albeit only for low values in the case of styria are situated in the south of the country 3 2 2 rivers 3 2 2 1 countrywide due to its intensive use and importance the danube is the most measured river in the dataset with 15 out of the 426 gauging stations being on the danube followed by the mur and the traun with 9 each the rest being made up from various smaller rivers and streams thus the longest running gauging stations are all along the river danube as can be seen in fig 10 these stations show a long period of negative srsis which includes a first distinct change to higher but still slightly negative values around 1940 followed by a second regime shift between 1970 and 1980 hohensinner and jungwirth 2016 mentions a similar phenomenon for the beginning of the 19th century where natural erosion and the beginning of the danube regulation caused changes in the river s water level which led to a recalibration of the gauging stations in 1854 we do not know the cause for the shifts observed herein but suspect that the second shift is related to the adaptions of the danube for its role as a shipping route and for power production since the lowest values become noticeably less and the increase falls in the period with most intense power plant building verbund ag 2018 these power plants use approximately 73 of the danubes height drop of approximately 160 m over austrias 356 km of the stream verbund ag 2018 making the danube a central european electric power bastion sinclair 1964 besides power plants directly on the river danube there are multiple power plants in its tributaries including various large reservoirs in the alps their operation also changes the behavior of their downstream river which then propagates through the system so that it even is still noticeable at the vienna gauge kling et al 2012 from 1976 onward the danube represents only 15 of 426 gauging stations in the data set there have been four run of river power plants under construction on the danube since 1976 likewise there have been or still are underway a multitude of mid sized small and even micro water power projects on many of the austrian streams rivers and creeks which are all featured in the data while the effects of these human impacts hamper any interpretation of the time series with regard to climate impacts on river flow one still might suspect that the changing stream stages have impacts on the variability and trends of groundwater levels of the corresponding alluvial aquifers for the period after 1976 i e after the second regime shift there is a general rising trend of the river water levels as indicated by the lower right inset of fig 10 3 2 2 2 provinces as the old gauging stations are only found along the river danube and the interpretation of the data from these stations is complicated by regime shifts before 1976 we focus on the data from 1976 on for further analysis compared to the groundwater observation wells the river gauging stations have a much better spatial coverage and tend to be more uniformly distributed across austria see fig 2 as shown in fig 12 all of the provinces show a rising trend besides carinthia where the mid lower values are trending downwards and styria and the river danube where some low extreme values trend downwards the rise is most prominent in lower austria and in the upper values for the burgenland also noticeable are increases in the lowest values for tyrol and vienna as well as in the highest for vienna the danube and upper austria when assessing fig 11 the most notable features of the dataset are the maximum for tyrol around the year 2000 and burgenlands maximum around 1997 the minima at 2003 04 and the rise towards 2010 as well as the heavy impacts of the 2002 floods and 2003 drought on all province wide averages apart from tyrol for 2003 3 2 3 precipitation 3 2 3 1 countrywide the data available from ehyd only starts in the early 1970s and it takes until approx 1980 for the number of measurements in the dataset to stabilize thus we supplement our analysis of precipitation with the long term data from histalp auer et al 2007 which only varies between 44 and 47 measurement stations thus avoiding artifacts from a changing dataset and is available for times going back even earlier than 1900 due to this smaller number of measurements the regional coverage is not as good as in the ehyd dataset and whereas ehyd has most of its stations in the northeastern province of lower austria histalp has most stations in the southern province of carinthia as well as a higher proportion of alpine stations see fig 2 the countrywide spi6 appears to show a decreasing trend followed by a rising trend fig 13 which is confirmed by the şen plot fig 14 even though there are visible differences between the ehyd and the histalp data in fig 13 which are likely caused by their different geographical distribution the rise after 1980 is confirmed by fig 14 due to the nature of precipitation we deem these identified trends to represent the natural variability in precipitation and thus climate the 2002 floods and 2003 drought is very visible in the countrywide average with both showing some of the highest and lowest values for the datasets 3 2 3 2 provinces the rise and fall in the countrywide average histalp data shown in the previous section are not as clearly visible in the smoothed plot for the austrian provinces whereas the rising trend after 1980 is clearly visible in the province level ehyd data fig 15 the şen plots fig 16 however do confirm that the pre and post 1980 trends are also a feature of most of the histalp data comparing ehyd with histalp the most obvious feature is the differing post 1980 trend in the province of burgenland where histalp shows a strongly falling trend opposed to a mostly rising trend in ehyd in order to interpret this finding it hast to be mentioned that histalp only has one measurement station in burgenland compared to ehyds 49 so this single station is likely not to be deemed representative for the whole province 3 3 comparison of different components of the water cycle as is generally known the different components of the hydrological cycle are interlinked with each other when observing the features discussed in the previous sections first similarities can be easily observed besides the original hypothesis that the fall and rise in groundwater level might be related to water use one can also observe a similarity to the behavior observed in precipitation or surface water some more local features such as for example the sgi and srsi behavior in the burgenland between approximately 1995 and 2010 see figs 8 and 11 also appear related when comparing the countrywide averages the highest correlations with groundwater and river stages that have been identified for the spi6 in haas and birk 2017 still hold fig 17 shows two main features a discrepancy in their values and trends for the sgi spi6 and srsi before 1980 but similarities between various events from 1980 on the dataset except the long srsi shows stark similarities both in level long term trends and events in general fig 17 after 1980 appears to show an expected behavior of the hydrologic cycle precipitation tends to show the most extreme reactions to drought and flood events whereas surface water and groundwater react in a more dampened fashion however groundwater appears to be more affected by smaller negative events which tend to accumulate into larger drought periods when looking at the smoothed curves e g around 1992 93 especially so when looking at the 24 oldest wells only as precipitation and its natural variations are the source of the hydrologic cycle one would assume that the other components follow it which is however not the case for the pre 1980 trends here groundwater shows a falling trend and surface water shows no distinct trend but with increasing peaks followed by a regime shift whereas the falling trend towards 1980 in precipitation is only clearly visible in the şen plot see fig 14 when setting 1980 as an inflection point the high variability of the unsmoothed early srsi the oldest sgi as well as the histalp spi6 are likely caused by the comparatively low numbers of measurements contained in these datasets regarding the srsi as discussed in section 3 2 2 we do not know the cause of the instationarity so we are not discussing this data further the discrepancy between precipitation and groundwater before 1980 leaves a possibility for water use having caused the decreasing trend in groundwater this possibility is supported by assessing the smoothed curve for the 24 oldest wells in the dataset which show a longer decreasing period and are reaching a lower minimum these oldest wells are mostly situated in a rural environment 14 wells of which 8 are situated in the marchfeld region 3 of the wells are clearly in an urban area whereas the remaining 7 wells are in the outskirts of larger cities showing vicinities with mixed residential industrial and agricultural use this distribution highlights the history of austrian water use and thus the development of the measuring network as described in section 2 1 groundwater monitoring tends to focus on the large aquifers where austrias population industry and agriculture also clusters historically many rural communities and households relied on house wells and while this practice became less common with the rise of public water supply it still is used in many parts of austria thus many former house wells got integrated into the official measurement network it is safe to assume that most if not all of the 24 oldest wells were in use as local water supply at least in the early period of the data but their purpose then got superseded by central water supply so that they turned into monitoring only wells data cited in schönbäck et al 2003 supports this showing a countrywide decrease in households supplied by house wells from 13 3 in 1980 to 11 9 in 1998 albeit with large local differences vienna 0 3 upper austria 2 wells 24 8 and lower austria 16 wells 15 6 of these 16 wells in lower austria 8 are situated in the marchfeld region and another 8 in the tullnerfeld both regions where schönbäck et al 2003 lists the highest percentages of single suppliers with over 30 supported by a statement in flamm 2010 who considers the marchfeld population to be predominantly supplied by house wells further the observation that groundwater tends to accumulate droughts for the period after 1980 fits the observations by stoll et al 2011 who explain similar observations by soil water depletion due to precipitation deficits and higher temperatures combined with increased water demand leading to groundwater drawdowns on top of naturally low groundwater levels during such periods again this feature is most visible in the oldest wells which are likely situated in an aquifer with a long history of exploitation thus a detailed look into the austrian water use is warranted as is commonly known water usage used to rise until the 1980s 90s from whereon it dropped due to the rise of environmentalism technological advances and a move towards a higher share in economic output of the tertiary sector jia et al 2006 which would fit the observed groundwater levels this pattern should affect all three big water users agriculture industry and domestic use worldwide agriculture is the main water user however in austria irrigated agriculture is a niche application 5 of the austrian water use bmlfuw 2007 though of regional importance in the marchfeld region and estimated to be rising in importance with a changing climate industrial use however is responsible for 56 of austrian water use which makes it the most important use case for austria bmlfuw 2007 unfortunately the data availability for these water uses is very low steurer 1992 wriedt et al 2009 so a comparison of water use with water level is not possible however wriedt et al 2009 for agriculture and fritsch et al 2011 proxy data from german industry make it at least plausible that water use could follow the expected pattern the second most important and most documented water use 39 of total bmlfuw 2007 for austria is domestic and small business use which is sourced almost completely from groundwater with a 50 50 split between wells and tapped springs published data for austria is rather rare but due to the cultural similarities we deem it reasonable to use west german data where fritsch et al 2011 s estimate for 2011 compares favorable to the one from neunteufel and richard 2012 for austria and sets the peak water use between 1980 and 1990 however it has to be noted that other sources show higher differences e g karger and hoffmann 2013 and schönbäck et al 2003 the latter setting peak water use at 1992 as highlighted there is high uncertainty in the sheer numbers of water use but since the root cause for the reduction in domestic use goes back to the oil crisis in 1973 roth et al 2013 it is reasonable to assume that a rise stagnation reduction trend opposite to the groundwater level trend holds this inverse correlation of groundwater levels and groundwater use does not necessarily proof a causation though yet for the marchfeld region where 8 of the 24 oldest wells of the data set analyzed here are situated the human impact on groundwater levels and water quality is well known and understood the marchfeld is the countries most important vegetable growing region bmnt 2018 and one of the regions where as of 2000 house wells still are the backbone of the water supply schönbäck et al 2003 flamm 2010 the region has a long history of groundwater fed irrigation and water scarcity see e g kozlowski 1965 which lead to a drop in groundwater levels of 2 5 m from 1945 to 1995 combined with high concentrations of fertilizer sourced nitrate in the groundwater ernegger et al 1998 these issues led to the planning and construction of the marchfeldkanal in various steps between 1983 and 2004 with the flooding of the canal taking place in 1992 betriebsgesellschaft marchfeldkanal 2018 ernegger et al 1998 neudorfer and weyermayer 2007 whose main purpose is to provide water for groundwater recharge facilities in the central marchfeld as a consequence the groundwater levels in this region have risen again during the last decades regarding future changes in water use besides economic incentives for further industrial water use reduction roth et al 2013 for germany states that the technical means in appliances are very small but neunteufel and richard 2012 expects ongoing water savings due to replacement of old appliances for austria for another 20 40 years however both authors state that changing uses and settlement structures have potential not only for further reductions but also for increases for the medium term neunteufel and richard 2012 expects a further water use reduction in austria mainly still due to technical means which already does include a rise in the water use for house gardens and due to the dissemination of private swimming pools up to 2100 no further technical reductions are expected so a further rise of outdoor water use will result in an increase in the total use if the connection between water use and groundwater level holds decreasing groundwater levels thus could be expected again that this is possible is shown by the above marchfeld where this link has been closely investigated in the marchfeld this was rectified by technical means while such technical means are plausible for many other austrian locations the potential for decreasing groundwater levels deserves to be investigated in more detail especially considering that austrias water supply is vastly depending on groundwater use 4 future work as described in section 3 3 the development of the austrian measurement network is linked to the history and locations of the austrian water use leading to the issue that only that what is used is also measured thus a thorough history of the development of this network and how it is linked to the development of water use and exploitation would be a welcome addition to the body of scientific literature in recent times there has been a push to monitor more areas of the country compare for example the current distribution of measurement wells at ehyd gv at with the long term wells shown in fig 2 but the observation wells still tend to follow the population centers thus this poses the question what happens in the unmonitored aquifers while often of limited extend austrias reliance on a large percentage of spring water from such aquifers lends particular importance to these often alpine and hardrock aquifers while we do show that trends exist and offer possible explanations for those trends we cannot yet offer a statistically sound proof whether these explanations or true or false a starting point for such a proof could be the assessment of a single location with a good monitoring well infrastructure where extraction rates of a local water plant are available combined with information about population growth industrial development and agricultural practices and development this would allow for such a location to assess how much of an aquifer is affected by extraction activities possibly resulting in a sound understanding of how many wells are representative for the human factor and for how many are showing background natural fluctuations 5 conclusions it is shown that groundwater levels show an almost countrywide falling trend until the 1980s followed by a rising trend that affects the majority of austria while the rising groundwater levels after 1980 run in parallel with climatic bounds precipitation and in its extension surface water there is a large discrepancy between precipitation and possibly surface water and groundwater in the time before the 1980s the estimated water use runs contrary to the measured groundwater levels raising the possibility that water use affected groundwater levels while there is no full data available for austrias country wide water use we have shown via literature review that a rise and fall opposite the groundwater level trends for austrias total water use is plausible the countrywide falling groundwater levels before the 1980s appear to be quite strong whereas the rising trend afterwards is less distinct while the dataset before 1980 contains a vastly changing number of wells this number after 1980 is mostly constant however a fixed subset of the 24 oldest wells shows an even stronger falling trend for most of the water levels the falling trends before 1980 are much more robust when assessing province levels but again might be affected by artifacts from a changing number of wells however the small long term data set with a fixed number of wells shows these trends to be robust for the oldest wells in the dataset after 1980 some province wide groundwater levels also show falling or partly falling trends most notably in the southern province of carinthia or the southeastern province styria whereas the other provinces do mostly show the rising trend observed in the countrywide average this rising trend appears most robust when assessing only the oldest 24 wells while we deem the oldest wells representative for the insights shown herein it has to be noted that almost all of the groundwater measurements herein come from the large basins and valleys that are the primary settlement industry and agricultural regions of austria thus the conclusions drawn from this study are representative for the populated and thus anthropogenically affected part of the country the hard rock aquifers of the alpine peaks and ranges as well as the small valley fill aquifers of unsettled or sparsely populated valleys might still show natural conditions but since the monitoring of nature without any economic interest is a rather new phenomenon we do not have sufficient data to enable a full assessment of these regions for surface waters there is a rising trend in the countrywide average from 1976 on which has a high similarity with precipitation trends and natural variations on a province level the rising trend is robust apart for some exceptions for again the southern province of carinthia and the river danube for the danube we have shown that there is a long history of hydraulic constructions for flood protection and shipping as well as the construction of numerous power plants using now over 70 of its height drop similar developments minus the use as shipping route have happened for many other austrian rivers and streams thus adding a human dimension to the surface water signal these human interventions are now embedded into the nature of most streams and thus suspected to propagate into connected groundwater bodies for precipitation we have analyzed the histalp dataset and the data available from ehyd with only histalp offering time series before 1971 thus the trend analysis before 1980 is only done on the comparatively small histalp dataset here we see a falling trend in the countrywide average this is followed by a clear countrywide rising trend from 1980 on in both datasets the falling trend before 1980 is valid for most of the country but the northern and western provinces of upper austria and vorarlberg differ the rising trend after 1980 shows in most provinces except for burgenland and the lower extremes of most provinces in the histalp dataset this dataset however only contains very few measurements on a province level unlike groundwater and surface water we assume that there are no direct human impacts on the precipitation amounts so these trends and variations are seen as the natural background for the regions while standardizing comparing and averaging time series of different lengths and locations has some weaknesses we have shown that those are likely to be minor in our case and are further decreased by using datasets that are close to stable in their numbers for most analysis in summary the country of austria shows clear trends in countrywide average standardized groundwater levels river stages and precipitation even though austria has a diverse and differing geography these observed trends hold for almost all regional subsets however since most measurement follows human use large parts of the country mainly the alpine regions in groundwater are still missing from long term measurement while we have not proven a causal link between these long term trends and the water use the example of the marchfeld region shows that human induced lowering of groundwater levels has happened in austria while this appears to have been fixed by technical means

8450,study region austria study focus using publicly available data for the main components of the hydrological cycle we use standardization to calculate countrywide and regional averages of groundwater levels stream stages and precipitation these averages get analyzed for the occurrence of trends compared with each other and the austrian water use over time new hydrological insights for the region it is shown that groundwater levels trend downwards until the 1980s from whereon they recover precipitation follows this track but the downward trend is much less severe river stages lack data for the downward trending period but follow the upward trend too the trend in groundwater is a reverse of the trends observed in water use and we hypothesize that the discrepancy between average precipitation and average groundwater pre 1980s could be caused by the increasing water use in this period especially since austrias water demands are mostly sourced from groundwater keywords sgi spi srsi austria trend analysis hydrologic cycle time series analysis 1 introduction groundwater is an important resource for public industrial and agricultural water use which is interlinked with other components of the hydrological cycle and thus replenished by infiltrating precipitation or surface waters in some regions of the world groundwater resources are under stress as the exploitation appears to be critically high relative to the rate of replenishment oki and kanae 2006 in austria renewable freshwater resources overall exceed by far water use in particular within the alps yet towards the pannonian climate zone in the eastern part of the country considerably lower precipitation and thus lower groundwater recharge prevails in addition the alpine region is expected to be particularly affected by climate change and its impacts as warming since the late 19th century was twice as high as the northern hemispheric and global average auer et al 2007 gobiet et al 2014 as a result groundwater resources may be temporarily stressed in some regions e g under drought conditions and future changes in climate land use and water management e g as considered by hohmann et al 2018 potentially can have adverse effects on both the replenishment and the exploitation of groundwater resources thus aggravating water stress in order to improve our understanding how groundwater levels respond to changes in hydrometeorological variables we have previously used standardized time series of groundwater levels stream stages and precipitation to compare the correlations of these variables in alpine and prealpine subregions of a river basin haas and birk 2017 this standardization of groundwater levels uses the standardized groundwater level index sgi bloomfield and marchant 2013 and allows averaging time series of groundwater levels from different observation wells fig 1 shows the average of the standardized groundwater levels calculated using the longest running time series available from the webportal of the austrian hydrographic service http ehyd gv at bmlfuw 2016 this country wide sgi exhibits a distinct falling trend from 1960s onwards which appears to turn into an increasing trend in the 1980s this finding poses a series of questions which we try to address in this paper are these trends just artifacts stemming from the low number of observation wells used for calculating the mean long term sgi or do they still hold when adding a larger number of wells into the dataset how does a change in the number of wells in the dataset affect the validity of the found trends are these apparent countrywide trends also visible in all parts of the country or just a result of imbalances in the local distribution of observation wells are those trends a result of climatic conditions or do we see effects of groundwater exploitation which is generally known to rise with gdp until a certain point from whereon it tends to drop again jia et al 2006 in order to contribute to an answer of these questions we consider the representativeness of a single time series for a whole country which is made up from different geographical and climatic regions by looking at local averages and by comparing the already mentioned groundwater sgi with precipitation spi mckee et al 1993 and surface water srsi haas and birk 2017 groundwater levels are impacted by precipitation and river stages which are linked to climate change and in the case of rivers various man made changes for flood protection power production and for the danube the use as a major shipping route which demand special consideration the spatial distribution of the underlying time series and its change over time caused by the development of monitoring infrastructure over time is also possibly affecting the validity of the observed trends so we compare datasets with a changing number of measurements with datasets where the number of measurements is fixed regarding the possible effects of water use we try to give a short summary of austrias recent water use history to our knowledge few studies have been conducted using a similar approach to ours or focusing on austria livada and assimakopoulos 2007 and abdou and thierry 2009 have used average spis but for greece and the sahel region respectively regarding austria schöner et al 2011 gives a detailed overview for the long term development for all components of the water cycle e g also including temperature and glaciers for austria including pre 1900 data and modeling approaches for the possible future development and adaption strategies aimed at policy makers however these authors did not compare the different components of the water cycle using standardization or did not consider averages of multiple time series as attempted here another groundwater issue which has also been considered by schöner et al 2011 is groundwater temperature where benz et al 2018 provide a more recent overview 2 data and methods 2 1 data most of the data used herein is sourced from the ehyd gv at website which is the official public gateway to the austrian precipitation surface water and groundwater data bmlfuw 2016 for a more detailed discussion of the ehyd website the interested reader is referred to haas and birk 2017 and the references therein further for long term precipitation data we use the zamg histalp dataset http zamg ac at histalp index php auer et al 2007 as of 2018 the ehyd website allows for access to 950 precipitation measurement time series and thus corresponding to 950 measurement stations 800 surface water level measurement time series and 3040 groundwater level measurement time series since we are interested in the long term development and since standardization needs a certain minimum length of record see section 2 2 we chose only the stations that have data available from 1980 on which results in a subset of 599 precipitation time series 426 river level time series and 1017 groundwater level time series from all of austria see fig 2 due to the development of the austrian measurement network see also section 3 3 this number of stations is not static in time while there are more measurements available for younger data e g the 3040 groundwater levels mentioned above this also means that for older time series there are less measurements available a short overview of these numbers is given in table 1 and a plot highlighting the development over time is shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 2 groundwater observation wells tend to be clustered in the large valleys and the plains outside of the alps compared to a more uniform distribution of precipitation and river stages gauges though naturally those also tend to show a lower density in the high and remote mountain regions the regions with many groundwater observation wells are also the main settlement regions of austria thus the groundwater observation wells map pretty well most of the austrian population its main industry centers and most of the non mountain farming agriculture while they are not spatially representative for the whole country we deem them representative for the settled or used part of the country and we would estimate similar conditions in densely populated valleys such as the inn or enns valley for which there is no long term data available the subset of the 24 oldest wells see fig 2 shows a good distribution across the country albeit with a bias towards the east and towards rural regions however since the largest population clusters are in the same regions as these oldest wells and since they tend to be situated in large unconsolidated aquifer bodies we do deem them valid for an insight into the historical water levels across austria an introduction into the history of water use and monitoring in austria is discussed in more detail in section 3 3 2 1 1 erroneous data data from the histalp dataset is already homogenized and quality improved see http zamg ac at histalp about php thus we use this data as is according to bmlfuw 2016 the ehyd dataset is also reviewed and error corrected however this includes flagging missing data in a time series as nan since there can be considerable amounts of such missing data we have multiple steps of checking a dataset a time series is not used if there are more than 14 consecutive missing days daily data or if there are more than 3 consecutive missing months monthly data and if there are more than 10 of the data missing throughout the time series critical missing in table 1 the numbers stated in the previous section thus already exclude these series with a large share of erroneous data for time series below this threshold the missing data gets filled with a linear interpolation between the last existing datapoints which applies to 216 time series for groundwater 7 time series for rivers and 56 time series for precipitation from ehyd small missing in table 1 2 2 standardization in order to be able to compare different locations and different types of data we are working with standardized time series this allows for the comparison of say precipitation in millimeters with groundwater levels in meters above sea level on the same scale further this allows to calculate an average over a whole standardized dataset such as for example all austrian precipitation measurements or all the groundwater observation wells in a certain province while we already discard data with a large number of errors see previous section this averaging also reduces the effects of the interpolation fill over small amounts of missing data for this standardization we use the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the closely related standardized groundwater level index sgi bloomfield and marchant 2013 and the standardized river stages index srsi sgi applied to river stages haas and birk 2017 as sgi and srsi are build on the same approach as the spi they are expected to exhibit similar strengths and weaknesses while the spi has already been used for countrywide or regional averages e g livada and assimakopoulos 2007 for greece and abdou and thierry 2009 for the sahel region there are limitations for the needed lengths of time series and their suitability in comparing time series of different lengths the spi is a widely used and recommended index see e g svoboda et al 2012 however it is know to have certain weaknesses apart from mckee et al 1993 s original demand for at least 30 years of data wu et al 2005 also highlight the need for long time series because the spi is a probability related index the longer the length of record the more confidence there is in the stability of the underlying statistics which is echoed by similar reservations in svoboda et al 2012 hence we are only using long 30 years time series for the analysis presented herein in order to lessen possible negative effects from too short time series besides these demands for a certain minimum length different lengths of time series can also cause different standardized values for a certain event due to differences in the shape and scale parameters of the fitted gamma or other distribution for different length records bloomfield and marchant 2013 wu et al 2005 show that this can possibly cause large discrepancies for a single event standardized with a 13 month spi when using approximately 30 years compared to 100 years of data but in most cases the discrepancies are minor monthly sgi values are frequently found to correlate with the spi accumulated over periods of several months for data from the mur valley which is part of the data set explored herein haas and birk 2017 found the highest correlation with sgi for an spi accumulation period of six months spi6 although the accumulation period yielding the highest sgi spi correlation varies depending on the aquifer characteristics six months appears to be a typical value at other sites too e g kumar et al 2016 we have tested the averaged dataset used herein and also found that the spi6 shows the highest correlations in this work we therefore focus on spi6 this standardization and analysis is done in the python scripting language using the well known pandas mckinney 2010 numpy van der walt et al 2011 and matplotlib hunter 2007 packages a detailed description of this work as well as executable code can be found in haas et al 2018 2 3 trend analysis besides visual identification from plots methods such as the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 or regression analysis are generally used to identify trends in time series however these methods require various assumptions or data pre processing which might invalidate their results şen 2012 şen 2017 in order to avoid these shortcomings şen 2012 with further details in şen 2017 proposed an innovative trend analysis methodology that plots two sorted halves of the time series against each other on a cartesian coordinate system as shown in fig 4 this results in an increasing trend light gray line plotting in the upper left part of the plot light gray stars whereas a decreasing trend would plot in the lower right not shown for comparison a trendless time series black line plots on a 45 straight line black dots if various phenomena are found in the time series as often the case in hydrologic observations a şen plot can serve to highlight these for instance fig 4 shows a synthetic time series gray dashed line where the high values increase whereas the low values decrease which could be for example a river discharge showing a trend towards more extremes while the trends in the examples in fig 4 are quite obvious this method can robustly analyze real noisy data where underlying trends are not as apparent further when applied to datasets split in time it can serve to highlight differences in behavior over time in this paper we use this approach to explore the differences before and after 1980 further this method also allows to test these trends for significance as explained in şen 2017 however it has to be noted that this significance test uses a single slope for the whole time series in question for many hydrological time series as described herein a purely linear trend might not be the best interpretation of a trend as highlighted by the increasing and decreasing time series in fig 4 for which the method looses the information about two opposing trends in the series in an average slope which in this case is also insignificant due to this the simple significances quoted in the figures have to be interpreted with caution besides this quantitative method we also use smoothed plots of the country or province means to help with visual trend or tipping point identification for this we use the savitzky golay filter savitzky and golay 1964 the scipy community 2018 with a window size of 10 years plus one month due to technical reasons in order to be able to smooth over the full time series the used method defaults to fitting a degree polyorder polynomial to the ends of the time series the scipy community 2018 which results in the noticeably rising or falling ends of the smoothed series since this method cannot fore or backcast the first and last 5 years of the smoothed time series do have to be interpreted with caution 3 results and discussion 3 1 standardization of time series of different lengths as mentioned in section 2 2 the standardization methods employed herein show certain weaknesses in order to see whether our dataset suffers from these issues we have taken the 24 oldest wells in the dataset approximately 95 to 65 years of data and standardized them twice once for their whole period and once cut to a 35 year period from 1980 on as can be seen in fig 5 the mean sgi values for this set of wells between 1980 and 2015 do differ however the differences are minor thus we deem it suitable to use the full period for the sgi and other indices in the following sections albeit with the caveat that the changing number of wells in the early time periods can affect their meaningfulness for the srsi with its two regime shifts see fig 10 the second of which also coincides with a large increase in the number of gauging stations the difference between the time series of different lengths however is strong thus we only use a shortened time series for most of the discussion of river levels the precipitation time series available to us all histalp data or mostly ehyd data have the same length so they are not strongly affected by these possible issues 3 2 development over time 3 2 1 groundwater 3 2 1 1 countrywide fig 6 shows the mean sgi for all of austria as well as the mean sgi smoothed with a 121 month savitzky golay filter as already discussed in the introduction the sgi appears to be falling until the mid 80s and shows a rising trend following that which appears to fit well with the trends in water use and the fact that most of the austrian water is sourced from groundwater since this long dataset possibly contains some artifacts due to the changing number of time series and their differing lengths the declining trend towards the 1980s has to be interpreted with caution see also section 3 1 in order to test our dataset for such possible effects we have split the dataset into various subsets for a trend analysis with şen plots as shown in fig 7 the falling trend before 1980 differs considerably depending on the subset of data ignoring the very high sgi period before 1950 obviously reduces the falling trend as does using a subset of data with a vastly changing number of wells the rise from 1980 on however is much more stable since there is neither a possibility for a large change in the number of wells nor is there a possibility to compare time periods of differing lengths different periods used for the standardization of data do affect the trend too but only in an minor way these trends shown in fig 7 are partly different from the trends observed by schöner et al 2011 who analyzed the 1956 2006 and 1976 2006 periods using yearly data and counting the number of time series showing a trend they found that for the short period 24 of measurements show a significant falling trend whereas only 10 show a rising one the long time period on the other hand has 42 of time series that show a falling trend the latter is consistent with the visual assessment of the sgi values in fig 6 suggesting a decreasing trend from 1956 to 2006 and with our finding of a decrease before 1980 that is more pronounced than the subsequent increase in contrast the low number of wells showing an increasing trend from 1976 to 2006 appears to be different from our finding of an increasing trend after 1980 yet a direct comparison of these results is difficult as the approach employed by schöner et al 2011 differs in several aspects from the one used here groundwater levels of individual wells vs average of standardized values different time periods and numbers of time series different handling of errors and gaps in the data etc 3 2 1 2 provinces as fig 2 shows the groundwater observation wells that cover a long enough time frame for standardization are mostly situated close to austrias major population centers in its lowlands with a strong bias towards the northeast yet fig 8 shows that the falling trend towards 1980 and the reversal afterwards as discussed in the previous section also holds true for province mean sgis albeit the rises after 1980 are less prominent or might even not be rises for some provinces while we have shown see section 3 1 that the artifacts from a changing number of data points are likely minor this is still something to be considered a şen trend analysis see fig 9 reveals that the rise and fall for the oldest wells are very consistent and affect all three provinces in this subset apart from some extreme values in styria the falling trend before 1980 for the whole dataset also appears to show in almost all provinces besides salzburg and the mid low values for upper austria however this subset of the data shows a large variation in the number of wells 0 220 and length of available data 5 50 years highlighted by the case of salzburg where the apparent clear rise is only due to 28 wells for the 5 year period of 1975 1979 using the stable dataset from 1980 on the rising trend that appears to be small but consistent for all but the medium values in fig 7 splits into provinces that show mostly a rising trend lower austria vienna vorarlberg burgenland upper austria mostly a falling trend carinthia and differing or no trends styria salzburg where the rising provinces make up the largest number of wells and thus dominate the countrywide average other phenomena visible in fig 9 are that all provinces besides salzburg show an increase in positive extremes and that the provinces that show the most decreases albeit only for low values in the case of styria are situated in the south of the country 3 2 2 rivers 3 2 2 1 countrywide due to its intensive use and importance the danube is the most measured river in the dataset with 15 out of the 426 gauging stations being on the danube followed by the mur and the traun with 9 each the rest being made up from various smaller rivers and streams thus the longest running gauging stations are all along the river danube as can be seen in fig 10 these stations show a long period of negative srsis which includes a first distinct change to higher but still slightly negative values around 1940 followed by a second regime shift between 1970 and 1980 hohensinner and jungwirth 2016 mentions a similar phenomenon for the beginning of the 19th century where natural erosion and the beginning of the danube regulation caused changes in the river s water level which led to a recalibration of the gauging stations in 1854 we do not know the cause for the shifts observed herein but suspect that the second shift is related to the adaptions of the danube for its role as a shipping route and for power production since the lowest values become noticeably less and the increase falls in the period with most intense power plant building verbund ag 2018 these power plants use approximately 73 of the danubes height drop of approximately 160 m over austrias 356 km of the stream verbund ag 2018 making the danube a central european electric power bastion sinclair 1964 besides power plants directly on the river danube there are multiple power plants in its tributaries including various large reservoirs in the alps their operation also changes the behavior of their downstream river which then propagates through the system so that it even is still noticeable at the vienna gauge kling et al 2012 from 1976 onward the danube represents only 15 of 426 gauging stations in the data set there have been four run of river power plants under construction on the danube since 1976 likewise there have been or still are underway a multitude of mid sized small and even micro water power projects on many of the austrian streams rivers and creeks which are all featured in the data while the effects of these human impacts hamper any interpretation of the time series with regard to climate impacts on river flow one still might suspect that the changing stream stages have impacts on the variability and trends of groundwater levels of the corresponding alluvial aquifers for the period after 1976 i e after the second regime shift there is a general rising trend of the river water levels as indicated by the lower right inset of fig 10 3 2 2 2 provinces as the old gauging stations are only found along the river danube and the interpretation of the data from these stations is complicated by regime shifts before 1976 we focus on the data from 1976 on for further analysis compared to the groundwater observation wells the river gauging stations have a much better spatial coverage and tend to be more uniformly distributed across austria see fig 2 as shown in fig 12 all of the provinces show a rising trend besides carinthia where the mid lower values are trending downwards and styria and the river danube where some low extreme values trend downwards the rise is most prominent in lower austria and in the upper values for the burgenland also noticeable are increases in the lowest values for tyrol and vienna as well as in the highest for vienna the danube and upper austria when assessing fig 11 the most notable features of the dataset are the maximum for tyrol around the year 2000 and burgenlands maximum around 1997 the minima at 2003 04 and the rise towards 2010 as well as the heavy impacts of the 2002 floods and 2003 drought on all province wide averages apart from tyrol for 2003 3 2 3 precipitation 3 2 3 1 countrywide the data available from ehyd only starts in the early 1970s and it takes until approx 1980 for the number of measurements in the dataset to stabilize thus we supplement our analysis of precipitation with the long term data from histalp auer et al 2007 which only varies between 44 and 47 measurement stations thus avoiding artifacts from a changing dataset and is available for times going back even earlier than 1900 due to this smaller number of measurements the regional coverage is not as good as in the ehyd dataset and whereas ehyd has most of its stations in the northeastern province of lower austria histalp has most stations in the southern province of carinthia as well as a higher proportion of alpine stations see fig 2 the countrywide spi6 appears to show a decreasing trend followed by a rising trend fig 13 which is confirmed by the şen plot fig 14 even though there are visible differences between the ehyd and the histalp data in fig 13 which are likely caused by their different geographical distribution the rise after 1980 is confirmed by fig 14 due to the nature of precipitation we deem these identified trends to represent the natural variability in precipitation and thus climate the 2002 floods and 2003 drought is very visible in the countrywide average with both showing some of the highest and lowest values for the datasets 3 2 3 2 provinces the rise and fall in the countrywide average histalp data shown in the previous section are not as clearly visible in the smoothed plot for the austrian provinces whereas the rising trend after 1980 is clearly visible in the province level ehyd data fig 15 the şen plots fig 16 however do confirm that the pre and post 1980 trends are also a feature of most of the histalp data comparing ehyd with histalp the most obvious feature is the differing post 1980 trend in the province of burgenland where histalp shows a strongly falling trend opposed to a mostly rising trend in ehyd in order to interpret this finding it hast to be mentioned that histalp only has one measurement station in burgenland compared to ehyds 49 so this single station is likely not to be deemed representative for the whole province 3 3 comparison of different components of the water cycle as is generally known the different components of the hydrological cycle are interlinked with each other when observing the features discussed in the previous sections first similarities can be easily observed besides the original hypothesis that the fall and rise in groundwater level might be related to water use one can also observe a similarity to the behavior observed in precipitation or surface water some more local features such as for example the sgi and srsi behavior in the burgenland between approximately 1995 and 2010 see figs 8 and 11 also appear related when comparing the countrywide averages the highest correlations with groundwater and river stages that have been identified for the spi6 in haas and birk 2017 still hold fig 17 shows two main features a discrepancy in their values and trends for the sgi spi6 and srsi before 1980 but similarities between various events from 1980 on the dataset except the long srsi shows stark similarities both in level long term trends and events in general fig 17 after 1980 appears to show an expected behavior of the hydrologic cycle precipitation tends to show the most extreme reactions to drought and flood events whereas surface water and groundwater react in a more dampened fashion however groundwater appears to be more affected by smaller negative events which tend to accumulate into larger drought periods when looking at the smoothed curves e g around 1992 93 especially so when looking at the 24 oldest wells only as precipitation and its natural variations are the source of the hydrologic cycle one would assume that the other components follow it which is however not the case for the pre 1980 trends here groundwater shows a falling trend and surface water shows no distinct trend but with increasing peaks followed by a regime shift whereas the falling trend towards 1980 in precipitation is only clearly visible in the şen plot see fig 14 when setting 1980 as an inflection point the high variability of the unsmoothed early srsi the oldest sgi as well as the histalp spi6 are likely caused by the comparatively low numbers of measurements contained in these datasets regarding the srsi as discussed in section 3 2 2 we do not know the cause of the instationarity so we are not discussing this data further the discrepancy between precipitation and groundwater before 1980 leaves a possibility for water use having caused the decreasing trend in groundwater this possibility is supported by assessing the smoothed curve for the 24 oldest wells in the dataset which show a longer decreasing period and are reaching a lower minimum these oldest wells are mostly situated in a rural environment 14 wells of which 8 are situated in the marchfeld region 3 of the wells are clearly in an urban area whereas the remaining 7 wells are in the outskirts of larger cities showing vicinities with mixed residential industrial and agricultural use this distribution highlights the history of austrian water use and thus the development of the measuring network as described in section 2 1 groundwater monitoring tends to focus on the large aquifers where austrias population industry and agriculture also clusters historically many rural communities and households relied on house wells and while this practice became less common with the rise of public water supply it still is used in many parts of austria thus many former house wells got integrated into the official measurement network it is safe to assume that most if not all of the 24 oldest wells were in use as local water supply at least in the early period of the data but their purpose then got superseded by central water supply so that they turned into monitoring only wells data cited in schönbäck et al 2003 supports this showing a countrywide decrease in households supplied by house wells from 13 3 in 1980 to 11 9 in 1998 albeit with large local differences vienna 0 3 upper austria 2 wells 24 8 and lower austria 16 wells 15 6 of these 16 wells in lower austria 8 are situated in the marchfeld region and another 8 in the tullnerfeld both regions where schönbäck et al 2003 lists the highest percentages of single suppliers with over 30 supported by a statement in flamm 2010 who considers the marchfeld population to be predominantly supplied by house wells further the observation that groundwater tends to accumulate droughts for the period after 1980 fits the observations by stoll et al 2011 who explain similar observations by soil water depletion due to precipitation deficits and higher temperatures combined with increased water demand leading to groundwater drawdowns on top of naturally low groundwater levels during such periods again this feature is most visible in the oldest wells which are likely situated in an aquifer with a long history of exploitation thus a detailed look into the austrian water use is warranted as is commonly known water usage used to rise until the 1980s 90s from whereon it dropped due to the rise of environmentalism technological advances and a move towards a higher share in economic output of the tertiary sector jia et al 2006 which would fit the observed groundwater levels this pattern should affect all three big water users agriculture industry and domestic use worldwide agriculture is the main water user however in austria irrigated agriculture is a niche application 5 of the austrian water use bmlfuw 2007 though of regional importance in the marchfeld region and estimated to be rising in importance with a changing climate industrial use however is responsible for 56 of austrian water use which makes it the most important use case for austria bmlfuw 2007 unfortunately the data availability for these water uses is very low steurer 1992 wriedt et al 2009 so a comparison of water use with water level is not possible however wriedt et al 2009 for agriculture and fritsch et al 2011 proxy data from german industry make it at least plausible that water use could follow the expected pattern the second most important and most documented water use 39 of total bmlfuw 2007 for austria is domestic and small business use which is sourced almost completely from groundwater with a 50 50 split between wells and tapped springs published data for austria is rather rare but due to the cultural similarities we deem it reasonable to use west german data where fritsch et al 2011 s estimate for 2011 compares favorable to the one from neunteufel and richard 2012 for austria and sets the peak water use between 1980 and 1990 however it has to be noted that other sources show higher differences e g karger and hoffmann 2013 and schönbäck et al 2003 the latter setting peak water use at 1992 as highlighted there is high uncertainty in the sheer numbers of water use but since the root cause for the reduction in domestic use goes back to the oil crisis in 1973 roth et al 2013 it is reasonable to assume that a rise stagnation reduction trend opposite to the groundwater level trend holds this inverse correlation of groundwater levels and groundwater use does not necessarily proof a causation though yet for the marchfeld region where 8 of the 24 oldest wells of the data set analyzed here are situated the human impact on groundwater levels and water quality is well known and understood the marchfeld is the countries most important vegetable growing region bmnt 2018 and one of the regions where as of 2000 house wells still are the backbone of the water supply schönbäck et al 2003 flamm 2010 the region has a long history of groundwater fed irrigation and water scarcity see e g kozlowski 1965 which lead to a drop in groundwater levels of 2 5 m from 1945 to 1995 combined with high concentrations of fertilizer sourced nitrate in the groundwater ernegger et al 1998 these issues led to the planning and construction of the marchfeldkanal in various steps between 1983 and 2004 with the flooding of the canal taking place in 1992 betriebsgesellschaft marchfeldkanal 2018 ernegger et al 1998 neudorfer and weyermayer 2007 whose main purpose is to provide water for groundwater recharge facilities in the central marchfeld as a consequence the groundwater levels in this region have risen again during the last decades regarding future changes in water use besides economic incentives for further industrial water use reduction roth et al 2013 for germany states that the technical means in appliances are very small but neunteufel and richard 2012 expects ongoing water savings due to replacement of old appliances for austria for another 20 40 years however both authors state that changing uses and settlement structures have potential not only for further reductions but also for increases for the medium term neunteufel and richard 2012 expects a further water use reduction in austria mainly still due to technical means which already does include a rise in the water use for house gardens and due to the dissemination of private swimming pools up to 2100 no further technical reductions are expected so a further rise of outdoor water use will result in an increase in the total use if the connection between water use and groundwater level holds decreasing groundwater levels thus could be expected again that this is possible is shown by the above marchfeld where this link has been closely investigated in the marchfeld this was rectified by technical means while such technical means are plausible for many other austrian locations the potential for decreasing groundwater levels deserves to be investigated in more detail especially considering that austrias water supply is vastly depending on groundwater use 4 future work as described in section 3 3 the development of the austrian measurement network is linked to the history and locations of the austrian water use leading to the issue that only that what is used is also measured thus a thorough history of the development of this network and how it is linked to the development of water use and exploitation would be a welcome addition to the body of scientific literature in recent times there has been a push to monitor more areas of the country compare for example the current distribution of measurement wells at ehyd gv at with the long term wells shown in fig 2 but the observation wells still tend to follow the population centers thus this poses the question what happens in the unmonitored aquifers while often of limited extend austrias reliance on a large percentage of spring water from such aquifers lends particular importance to these often alpine and hardrock aquifers while we do show that trends exist and offer possible explanations for those trends we cannot yet offer a statistically sound proof whether these explanations or true or false a starting point for such a proof could be the assessment of a single location with a good monitoring well infrastructure where extraction rates of a local water plant are available combined with information about population growth industrial development and agricultural practices and development this would allow for such a location to assess how much of an aquifer is affected by extraction activities possibly resulting in a sound understanding of how many wells are representative for the human factor and for how many are showing background natural fluctuations 5 conclusions it is shown that groundwater levels show an almost countrywide falling trend until the 1980s followed by a rising trend that affects the majority of austria while the rising groundwater levels after 1980 run in parallel with climatic bounds precipitation and in its extension surface water there is a large discrepancy between precipitation and possibly surface water and groundwater in the time before the 1980s the estimated water use runs contrary to the measured groundwater levels raising the possibility that water use affected groundwater levels while there is no full data available for austrias country wide water use we have shown via literature review that a rise and fall opposite the groundwater level trends for austrias total water use is plausible the countrywide falling groundwater levels before the 1980s appear to be quite strong whereas the rising trend afterwards is less distinct while the dataset before 1980 contains a vastly changing number of wells this number after 1980 is mostly constant however a fixed subset of the 24 oldest wells shows an even stronger falling trend for most of the water levels the falling trends before 1980 are much more robust when assessing province levels but again might be affected by artifacts from a changing number of wells however the small long term data set with a fixed number of wells shows these trends to be robust for the oldest wells in the dataset after 1980 some province wide groundwater levels also show falling or partly falling trends most notably in the southern province of carinthia or the southeastern province styria whereas the other provinces do mostly show the rising trend observed in the countrywide average this rising trend appears most robust when assessing only the oldest 24 wells while we deem the oldest wells representative for the insights shown herein it has to be noted that almost all of the groundwater measurements herein come from the large basins and valleys that are the primary settlement industry and agricultural regions of austria thus the conclusions drawn from this study are representative for the populated and thus anthropogenically affected part of the country the hard rock aquifers of the alpine peaks and ranges as well as the small valley fill aquifers of unsettled or sparsely populated valleys might still show natural conditions but since the monitoring of nature without any economic interest is a rather new phenomenon we do not have sufficient data to enable a full assessment of these regions for surface waters there is a rising trend in the countrywide average from 1976 on which has a high similarity with precipitation trends and natural variations on a province level the rising trend is robust apart for some exceptions for again the southern province of carinthia and the river danube for the danube we have shown that there is a long history of hydraulic constructions for flood protection and shipping as well as the construction of numerous power plants using now over 70 of its height drop similar developments minus the use as shipping route have happened for many other austrian rivers and streams thus adding a human dimension to the surface water signal these human interventions are now embedded into the nature of most streams and thus suspected to propagate into connected groundwater bodies for precipitation we have analyzed the histalp dataset and the data available from ehyd with only histalp offering time series before 1971 thus the trend analysis before 1980 is only done on the comparatively small histalp dataset here we see a falling trend in the countrywide average this is followed by a clear countrywide rising trend from 1980 on in both datasets the falling trend before 1980 is valid for most of the country but the northern and western provinces of upper austria and vorarlberg differ the rising trend after 1980 shows in most provinces except for burgenland and the lower extremes of most provinces in the histalp dataset this dataset however only contains very few measurements on a province level unlike groundwater and surface water we assume that there are no direct human impacts on the precipitation amounts so these trends and variations are seen as the natural background for the regions while standardizing comparing and averaging time series of different lengths and locations has some weaknesses we have shown that those are likely to be minor in our case and are further decreased by using datasets that are close to stable in their numbers for most analysis in summary the country of austria shows clear trends in countrywide average standardized groundwater levels river stages and precipitation even though austria has a diverse and differing geography these observed trends hold for almost all regional subsets however since most measurement follows human use large parts of the country mainly the alpine regions in groundwater are still missing from long term measurement while we have not proven a causal link between these long term trends and the water use the example of the marchfeld region shows that human induced lowering of groundwater levels has happened in austria while this appears to have been fixed by technical means

8451,study region this study was conducted in dire dawa city ethiopia study focus this study aims to explore the hydrological impacts of land use land cover changes using rational method as to perform land use analysis four decade based satellite imagery were analyzed using erdas imagine the hydrological effect of land cover change and respective surface runoff was calculated using rational method new hydrological insights for the region the trend of land use land cover analysis shows that the city has been experiencing significant decrease in forest land with continuous concomitant increases in bare land and settlements through the study period in response of land use changes the trend of surface runoff showed continuous increasing trend the result of focus group discussion confirms that land use change has significantly affected the trend of surface runoff generation the study also found out that the amount of surface runoff was positively sensitive to forest land and negatively to bare land and settlement classes to demonstrate the future effect of surface runoff the study developed worst and best case scenarios the worst case showed that if the current land use continuous in the coming years the watershed could receive more surface runoff that threaten the existence of the city the best case scenario suggested rehabilitation of bare land cover and rooftop rainwater harvesting as promising condition to drop the amount of surface runoff the output of the study provides environmental friendly surface runoff mitigation strategies that can be adopted at household and community levels keywords environmental friendly flood mitigation land use rational model surface runoff 1 introduction in the coming years extreme floods are expected to be more frequent and devastating due to the effects of climate change and expansion of urbanization that increases the generation of surface runoff opdam and wascher 2004 kostopoulou and jones 2005 thieken et al 2016 nijland 2005 the rainfall runoff relationships show that an increase in surface runoff is a point of concern in many catchments around the world foley et al 2005 surface runoff is governed by various factors such as land use land cover river network morphology and topography xu and zhao 2016 however the main reasons for the increase of surface runoff are resulted from anthropogenic activities such as deforestation overgrazing and urbanization fohrer et al 2001 the decrease in vegetation cover leads to a decrease in interception and modification of the physical soil structure which reduces the infiltration capacity lal 1997 koster 2013 many flood prone areas especially urban centers have been protected by using hard engineered flood defenses such as flood walls and embankments jha et al 2012 chan et al 2018 but the existing defenses may no longer be able to provide the intended level of protection to towns and cities thomas and nisbet 2007 as populations and urban economic assets increased it became increasingly challenging to deliver trustworthy safety standard to protect people and properties located in flood prone areas chan et al 2018 though structural measure has been used as a best strategy researchers began to realize various limitations of structural measures of flood management strategies from different perspectives brody et al 2009 in the first hand structural approaches to flood mitigation such as dams can bring a false sense of security to residents living downstream burby and dalton 1994 white 1936 for the fact that the damage of dam by storm event increases the risk of human casualties and property damage burby et al 1985 secondly structural based defenses of flood managements are expensive and are not regarded as environmentally friendly gardiner and perala gardiner 1996 defra 2010 this calls for a paradigm shift away from mitigating the flood impacts using traditional engineering approaches such as levees and dykes johnson et al 2005 as a result flood defense engineers are now shifting their attention to use soft engineering techniques for more sustainable development tunstall et al 2004 defra 2009 sustainable and environmental friendly flood risk management emphasize the principle of reducing surface runoff from the land following a rainfall event through increasing vegetation that helps to increase infiltration and delay the passage of the flood peak thomas and nisbet 2007 this can be done by improving the land use land cover system strategies of the watershed that can influence the increase or decrease the amount of surface runoff tunstall et al 2004 literatures showed that the increase of vegetation cover significantly enhances flood storage and infiltration capacity of an area thomas and nisbet 2007 dire dawa administration council is surrounded by mountains of oromia regional state highlands of kersa denegego and haramaya districts from where dachatu butuji goro and laga harre rivers moves downstream to the city as a result a heavy rain in the surrounding highlands is flowed by flash flood and cause a severe flood that damage lives and properties of the downstream population geographical location of the city in combination with large amounts of surface runoff generated from degraded upper catchment leads to high rates of erosion to address the effect of land use on surface runoff relatively few studies have been undertaken in east africa specifically analyzing the impacts of land use land cover changes on watershed hydrology guzha et al 2018 to fill this gap this study emphasized the land use land cover analysis of dire dawa city and its watershed in relation to estimation of surface runoff volume to estimate the surface runoff generated from individual land uses the study adopted rational method rational method can help to calculate runoff volume for small catchment areas that in turn helps to design flood management studies needhidasan and nallanathel 2013 therefore this study is aimed at calculating the amount of surface runoff generated from the watershed and to recommend cost effective and environmental friendly ways of flood causing surface runoff minimization 2 methodology 2 1 study area the city of dire dawa is located between 9 26 n and 9 45 n latitude and 41 41 e and 42 07 e longitude dire dawa city is located in the great ethiopian rift valley with an altitude of 1000 1200 m above sea level and surrounded by mountainous districts of oromia regional states these surrounding districts of oromia regional state are known for their dense population distribution as a result people are forced to expand their agricultural lands to inaccessible infertile and hilly areas located in the southern parts of the city the deforestation and degradation on southern part and hill nature of the landform increased the amount of surface runoff and its flow velocity that worsen the problem of flooding as shown in fig 1 dire dawa city is dissected by five large and small rivers dechatu goro melkajabdu laga hare and butuji rivers which made their origin from the southern parts following the occurrence of heavy rainfall in the upper catchments these rivers collect the surface runoff and induce flood hazard when they reach the center of the city dire dawa city watershed is composed of urban dire dawa rural dire dawa some districts of oromia regionl state somli regional state and covered an area of 703 km2 2 2 materials and method this study employed the collection of both primary and secondary data from primary and secondary data sources the primary data were collected through interview and focus group discussions the focus group discussion was conducted with purposely selected 10 elder people who have lived in the city for more than 30 years the main reason behind selection of the elders was to use their 30 40 years back recall of land use land cover information of dire dawa city and the surrounding districts located in the watershed the secondary data were collected from various secondary sources through document analysis and literature review these data includes satellite image digital elevation model dem and meteorological data the secondary data were used to generate surface runoff and land use land cover information to calculate the surface runoff this study employed the application of rational method 1 q cia where q peak flow in cubic meter per second m3 s c runoff coefficient weighted proportion of the rainfall that runs off the surface is obtained from runoff coefficient table i average rainfall intensity for a duration equal to the time of concentration for the area meter per hour that can be obtained from the idf curve of the study area a drainage area in sq km rational model is an appropriate method to estimate the surface runoff from small catchments the watershed area of this study is larger than the capacity on which the rational model can perform to predict surface runoff in this case rather than treating the whole watershed as a single area this study applied rational model on specific individual land uses such as forest agriculture settlement bush grasses bare and riverside sands the analysis of individual land use surface runoff helps for two things 1 to identify the type of land use more responsible for the generation of surface runoff in the area 2 to classify the larger area of the watershed in to manageable size for rational model application hence this study can add a knowledge and option how to apply rational model in larger areas with no good record of hydrologic and hydrological data the rational method used to estimates the peak rate of runoff at any location in a watershed as a function of the drainage area a runoff coefficient c and rainfall intensity i for a duration equal to the time of concentration tc which is the time required for water to flow from the most remote point of the basin to the location being analyzed abam 2014 c runoff coefficient can be obtained by adding the multiplication of areas of each land use with corresponding roughness values of each land use type eq 2 the surface roughness of different land use lies between 0 no runoff and 1 the maximum runoff c is obtained by tabulating the weighted value of the coefficient of each land use land cover for each drainage basin the weighted c value calculated with the following equation 2 c a 1 c 1 a 2 c 2 a 3 c 3 a 4 c 4 a 5 c 5 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 where c is surface roughness of each land use a is an area of each land use the other important parameter for surface runoff estimation is rainfall intensity i intensity which can be obtained from idf intensity drainage frequency curve idf curve is a graph with duration plotted as abscissa intensity as ordinate and a series of curves for each return period the frequency is expressed in terms of return period t which is the average length of time between rainfall events that equal or exceed the design magnitude when dealing with extremes it is important to employ the probability of return period eq 3 to determine the empirical return period t the study employed time series analysis of rainfall data 1953 2016 obtained from dire dawa meteorological stations 3 t n 1 m where m is order or rank of the event n is total number of event in the data t is return period in different methods the probability of occurrence of a particular extreme rainfall is important and such information is obtained by the frequency analysis of rainfall data eq 4 4 p 1 t where t is return period p is probability the decision of the return period was obtained by considering a 61 years of rainfall data to identify years which received highest extreme annual rainfall by correlating the report of identified flooding years and their resulting record of rainfall data 100 mm was considered as a threshold for the occurrence of flooding in the study area accordingly a rainfall data greater or equals to 100 mm was considered as a benchmark to identify extreme events after identification of years with extreme event the recurrence interval between the years was computed using eq 3 the average return period of the extreme events were computed using eq 5 5 average return period y1 y2 y3 ki n where y1 y2 y3 are return periods between years with high rainfall records and n is the number of years with highest rainfall records the land use land cover change is another important parameter to determine surface runoff to identify causes of flooding looking at the past trend of land use land cover of the study area is very important to explore the land use change of dire dawa city watershed the study employed analysis of four decade satellite imageries accordingly the satellite image of 1985 1995 2006 20 114 with 166 53 and 167 54 path and row were analyzed using erdas imagine 9 1 the erdas imagine was used to classify satellite images in to different land use systems and to calculate the areas of each land use the study years were selected to show the possible past land use land cover change trends in relation to government change and census years the land use land cover classes were classified in to five areas of interest which include forest settlement bush and grasses agriculture land bare land and riverside sands 2 3 validation of the rational model the study area meteorological station is ungauaged stations where there are no registered discharges data that can be used to calibrate the rational model as a result the study emphasize on validation of the model accordingly the actual potential accommodation capacity of the open channel was computed on the field to determine the amount of accommodated and left over discharges the actual potential capacity of the channel is determined using the formula 6 q va where v is velocity and a is an area of the channel in the same way the velocity of the channel at different cross section was determined using balloon and stopwatch the time consumed by balloon to travel 100 m was recorded using stopwatch to calculate the observed velocity of the channel this helps to compute the velocity of the river at different specific cross sections the velocity can be calculated using the formula 7 v s t where s is distance and t is the time consumed to travel the distance s similarly the area of the channel at each cross section is determined using the formula 8 a w l where w is the width of the river cross section obtained from field measurement l is the water depth h measured at different cross sections finally the potential carrying capacity of the channel was determined by summing up the four sites cross section carrying capacity of the channel then the potential discharge of the open channel is compared with the discharges obtained through rational model at different decades the percent change of the discharge at different decade is also computed by the formula 9 percent change a final a initial a initial 100 where a final is the discharge at final decade a initial is the discharge at initial decade 3 results 3 1 land use land cover analysis the watershed has been experiencing significant land use land cover changes during the study years to explore the land use land cover changes of dire dawa city watershed the analysis of four decade satellite image was conducted as shown in fig 2 during the four decade study period 1985 to 2016 there have been remarkable changes overall identified land use land covers the built up land has expanded from 17 3 km2 in 1985 to 44 6 km2 in the year 2016 on the same way bare land showed increasing trend from 115 6 km2 in 1985 to 308 km2 in 2016 conversely the forest land has shrunken from 63 7 km2 in 1985 to 37 1 km2 in 2016 similar trend has been observed in bush and grass agriculture and riverside lands and have been decreasing significantly from 1985 to 2016 this shows that land use and land covers which are supposed to increase runoff coefficient and resulting surface runoff were significantly increasing over the study periods the trend analyses of land use land cover and respective area coverage of the study period are presented in table 1 3 2 rainfall intensity the reading of idf curve shown in fig 3 gives the rainfall intensity of the watershed at different return period 5 10 30 50 100 and 300 accordingly the rainfall intensity of dire dawa meteorological station shows 21 38 50 58 62 and 80 mm h for a duration of 1 h at 5 10 30 50 100 and 300 return period respectively fig 3 the other important element to calculate runoff coefficient needs identification of the frequency or the return period of the study area to use the above results of rainfall intensity obtained from idf curve for different return period determining the return period of the town is mandatory to determine frequency or return period of the town the 61 years of annual rainfall data obtained from national meteorological agency were analyzed as shown in table 2 taking the frequency of available return periods the average frequency period is found to be 4 9 years therefore the 5 years return period is considered to compute the rainfall intensity of the study area from the readings of idf curve the rainfall intensity at 5 year return period is estimated to be 21 mm hr 3 3 discharge discharge refers the flow water generated from a given catchment the amount of surface runoff generated from the respective land use land cover of the study area watershed is summarized in table 3 the reference value of runoff coefficient for different land taken from different sources mahmoud and alazba 2015 sarukkalige 2011 is considered as shown in table 3 as the river side land use is ephemeral the runoff coefficient value of the river side is considered to be higher than the bare land and lower than the water bodies the trend of surface runoff generated discharge across the study period is increasing 1404 5 m3 s 1575 4 m3 s 1688 8 m3 s and 1787 7 m3 s for the year 1985 1995 2006 and 2016 respectively the result of discharge analysis shown in fig 4 indicates that bare land bush and grass land and agriculture are generating the higher discharge respectively however though the amount is less due to less area coverage the amount of surface runoff generated from settlement per area is very high moreover since the year 2006 to 2016 more than half of the discharge generated was attributed to bare land use land covers though the amount of discharge generated by bush and grass land is high it is showing a decreasing trend through the whole study period the amounts of discharge generated from a particular land cover during the study period are shown in fig 4 3 4 validation of the rational model to compare the estimated discharge of the catchment obtained through rational model with the actual holding capacity of the river channel actual measurements of velocity depth and discharge was conducted at four a b c and d cross sections of dechatu river as shown in fig 5 the balloon was left to travel 100 ms at different four cross sections a b c and d this measurement was done in months of august which is the rainiest month in the study area the balloon took the velocity that ranges from 4 6 to 6 m s to travel the 100 m distances fig 4 in the same way the respective depth of the river was measured for each cross section in the months of august like velocity the depths of the river were also varies at different cross section and lies between 1 9 to 3 5 m table 4 similarly the width of the rivers which is an input to calculate discharge was also measured at each cross section table 4 finally the actual accommodation potential of the open channel which is in this case dechatu river was determined using velocity depth and widths of the rivers measured at different cross sections is presented under table 4 4 discussion 4 1 the implication of land use on surface runoff and flooding the dynamics of land use land cover pattern in the catchment has direct implication in determining the hydrological condition of the watershed the finding of study showed that the decreases in forest land and increase in bare land increases the amount of surface runoff this shows that the study area watershed is experiencing deforestation as a means of adaptation to support the increasing population the findings of this study complements with previous studies conducted in east africa and ethiopia the review of various studies conducted in east africa confirmed that the increase in vegetation cover decreases the surface runoff guzha et al 2018 similar studies conducted in ethiopia showed that the trend of surface runoff is showing an increasing trend with decreasing forest land cover guzha et al 2018 tesemma et al 2010 kasaye 2015 legesse et al 2003 with constant rainfall intensity and return period this study also identified that surface runoff are gradually showing a rising trend since 1985 this indicates that land use land covers of the study area watershed have been seriously disturbed and affecting the resulting yield of runoff in the same condition of similar rainfall intensity distribution due to substantial reduction of vegetation cover in the upper catchments of the watershed the magnitude and velocity of surface runoff become particularly rapid in view of this the interviewed elders reported that about 40 years back the vegetation cover of the southern highlands during the regime of emperor haile sellassie 1931 1945 was modestly dense it was through time that the people intervened and colonized the forest areas and the upper catchments become devoid of vegetation cover furthermore the analyzed land use land cover results from1985 to 2016 show that high and increasing trend of runoff coefficient values was recorded for settlement and bare land respectively this shows that the two land use systems settlement and bare for urban and rural respectively are expanding in the expense of other land uses therefore to minimize the flood effect of dire dawa city managing the surface runoff generated from the two land use should be emphasized by all concerned organs working on flood hazard management of dire dawa city 4 2 minimizing discharge using land use change and rooftop rain water harvesting to examine the surface runoff effects of each land use type all the fiver land use types were compared in terms of runoff coefficient value and resulted discharge yield from each land use accordingly river side settlement and bare land use land covers with runoff coefficient value of 0 8 0 7 and 0 6 respectively are sensitive to generate high discharge that resulting to flood this implies that these land uses are the central part for surface runoff management planning in rural areas grazing land agriculture and population driven deforestation are threatening the watershed of dire dawa city based on the results of land use land cover and rational method analysis this study tried to develop land use scenarios to manage the contradicting relationship of land use land cover and the resulting surface runoff the study developed two hypotheses of scenario referred as worst and best case scenarios scenario 1 worst case scenario the trend of land use covers obtained from satellite imagery between 1985 and 2016 shows that bare land and settlements are continuously increasing this case scenario tried to predict what will happen if the current land use land cover condition continues for another two decade up to 2038 the result of land use change in table 1 showed that land use land cover change of the study watershed for the last two decades 1995 2016 the result showed that the percentage change of surface runoff discharge was increased by 5 9 for year 2006 to 2016 the worst case scenario predicts that if the trends of the land use land cover continuous like this for the coming two decade the surface runoff of the watershed will rise to 1893 17 m3 s and 2004 86 m3 s by 2026 and 2036 respectively referring to table 3 most of the estimated change in surface runoff of the watershed is resulted from bare land and settlement land uses respectively the model validation result shows that the maximum discharge holding capacity of dechatu river is 1491 505 m3 s that was why flood was not extremely affecting the city before 1985 the most destructive flood was occurred in 2006 when excessive 1688 8 m3 s discharges were generated the registered discharge at 2006 is higher than the carrying capacity of the river by 197 3 m s this tells that unless the flood management strategies are performed as long as surface runoff more than 1491 505 m3 s discharges are registered the possibilities of facing flood induced risks are inevitable scenario 2 best case scenario the trend of land use covers obtained from satellite imagery between the year 1985 and 2016 shows that bare land and settlements are continuously increasing similarly the result of rational method shows that surface runoff discharge is rising during the whole study decades this shows that if the trend of land use goes like before the city will face a higher discharge and sever flood in coming years however an increase in forest area where previously degraded bare land areas and improving the farming system on agricultural land complemented with adoption of landscape based water harvesting strategies in upper catchment and rooftop water harvesting can significantly minimize the effect of surface runoff and flooding for example keeping intensity and other land uses constant if 10 km2 of bare land is converted grasses every year for consecutive 5 years the amount of 2016 surface runoff 1787 7 m3 s can be reduced to 1767 7 m3 s if the activity is repeated for another 5 years the surface runoff discharge can be drop to 1687 7 m3 s the increase of vegetation forest cover can be done across fragile inaccessible and degraded areas which are no more used for agricultural purposes moreover beyond reducing surface runoff the will be forest areas should be planned to provide multipurpose advantages such as food recreational and additional economic benefits the objective of this scenario complies with un millennium development goals griggs et al 2013 among the eight millennium development goals conservation of natural resources and sustainable agriculture with appropriate farming methods was found to be an assignment for the countries to ensure environmental sustainability beside to managing land use land covers the scenario hypothesize rooftop water harvesting mechanisms as another means to reduce surface runoff this activity is proposed mainly for urban areas different studies in africa and ethiopia found out that a roof of one house assumed to have 80 m2 areas adugna et al 2018 aladenola and adeboye 2010 according to csa 2013 housing census of ethiopia exclusive of rural dire dawa and surrounding districts of other regions settlements there are 72 937 housing unit in dire dawa city administration alone using the rational method the housing units generate 23 63 m3 s surface runoff discharge as one of runoff minimization strategy this scenario recommends the harvest of 20 rooftop rain water by individual households for example considering 2016 surface runoff if awareness is created and the proposed 20 of rooftop rain water is harvested by each household about 4 7 m3 s amounts of surface runoff could be managed this shows that complementing to land use land cover change rooftop rainwater harvesting can help to manage surface runoff in dire dawa city and its watersheds 5 conclusion and recommendations the dynamics of land use and land cover affects the volume and velocity of surface runoff generated and transported to downstream specific land use land covers either increase or decrease the generation of surface runoff in order to assess the impacts of land use land cover change on overall hydrological nature of the area the study used the easily applicable approaches rational method and land use land cover analysis the former approach is used to estimate the amount of surface runoff generated from each land use by integrating the area of land use and respective runoff coefficient the latter is used to classify the land use land covers and to estimate the area covered by respective land uses based on 1985 1995 2006 and 2016 analysis of satellite imagery the coverage of settlement and bare land has showed an increasing trend during the study period 1985 2016 conversely the coverage of forest land agriculture bushes and grasses and rivers side land use land covers has been significantly shrinking over the study period the result of the study confirms that the area of land use land covers that minimize surface runoff generation are decreasing in the expense of land uses land covers that exacerbate surface runoff generation and problem of flooding finally the study developed a worst and best case scenarios for coming two decades in the worst case scenario keeping constant the ongoing land use land cover of the study area the problem of flooding will be beyond the control and the damage is forecasted to be severe in the contrary the best case scenario recommended the continuous way of rehabilitation of degraded bare lands and rooftop rainwater harvesting that can significantly minimize the problem of flooding in the coming two decades therefore to sustainably mange the flood problem of dire dawa city it is recommended that government organization ngos policy makers and concerned organs are expected to adopt the best case scenarios results of this study and should work on awareness creation for its implementation both in dire dewa city and its watershed conflict of interest we declare that we have no any conflicting interest 
8451,study region this study was conducted in dire dawa city ethiopia study focus this study aims to explore the hydrological impacts of land use land cover changes using rational method as to perform land use analysis four decade based satellite imagery were analyzed using erdas imagine the hydrological effect of land cover change and respective surface runoff was calculated using rational method new hydrological insights for the region the trend of land use land cover analysis shows that the city has been experiencing significant decrease in forest land with continuous concomitant increases in bare land and settlements through the study period in response of land use changes the trend of surface runoff showed continuous increasing trend the result of focus group discussion confirms that land use change has significantly affected the trend of surface runoff generation the study also found out that the amount of surface runoff was positively sensitive to forest land and negatively to bare land and settlement classes to demonstrate the future effect of surface runoff the study developed worst and best case scenarios the worst case showed that if the current land use continuous in the coming years the watershed could receive more surface runoff that threaten the existence of the city the best case scenario suggested rehabilitation of bare land cover and rooftop rainwater harvesting as promising condition to drop the amount of surface runoff the output of the study provides environmental friendly surface runoff mitigation strategies that can be adopted at household and community levels keywords environmental friendly flood mitigation land use rational model surface runoff 1 introduction in the coming years extreme floods are expected to be more frequent and devastating due to the effects of climate change and expansion of urbanization that increases the generation of surface runoff opdam and wascher 2004 kostopoulou and jones 2005 thieken et al 2016 nijland 2005 the rainfall runoff relationships show that an increase in surface runoff is a point of concern in many catchments around the world foley et al 2005 surface runoff is governed by various factors such as land use land cover river network morphology and topography xu and zhao 2016 however the main reasons for the increase of surface runoff are resulted from anthropogenic activities such as deforestation overgrazing and urbanization fohrer et al 2001 the decrease in vegetation cover leads to a decrease in interception and modification of the physical soil structure which reduces the infiltration capacity lal 1997 koster 2013 many flood prone areas especially urban centers have been protected by using hard engineered flood defenses such as flood walls and embankments jha et al 2012 chan et al 2018 but the existing defenses may no longer be able to provide the intended level of protection to towns and cities thomas and nisbet 2007 as populations and urban economic assets increased it became increasingly challenging to deliver trustworthy safety standard to protect people and properties located in flood prone areas chan et al 2018 though structural measure has been used as a best strategy researchers began to realize various limitations of structural measures of flood management strategies from different perspectives brody et al 2009 in the first hand structural approaches to flood mitigation such as dams can bring a false sense of security to residents living downstream burby and dalton 1994 white 1936 for the fact that the damage of dam by storm event increases the risk of human casualties and property damage burby et al 1985 secondly structural based defenses of flood managements are expensive and are not regarded as environmentally friendly gardiner and perala gardiner 1996 defra 2010 this calls for a paradigm shift away from mitigating the flood impacts using traditional engineering approaches such as levees and dykes johnson et al 2005 as a result flood defense engineers are now shifting their attention to use soft engineering techniques for more sustainable development tunstall et al 2004 defra 2009 sustainable and environmental friendly flood risk management emphasize the principle of reducing surface runoff from the land following a rainfall event through increasing vegetation that helps to increase infiltration and delay the passage of the flood peak thomas and nisbet 2007 this can be done by improving the land use land cover system strategies of the watershed that can influence the increase or decrease the amount of surface runoff tunstall et al 2004 literatures showed that the increase of vegetation cover significantly enhances flood storage and infiltration capacity of an area thomas and nisbet 2007 dire dawa administration council is surrounded by mountains of oromia regional state highlands of kersa denegego and haramaya districts from where dachatu butuji goro and laga harre rivers moves downstream to the city as a result a heavy rain in the surrounding highlands is flowed by flash flood and cause a severe flood that damage lives and properties of the downstream population geographical location of the city in combination with large amounts of surface runoff generated from degraded upper catchment leads to high rates of erosion to address the effect of land use on surface runoff relatively few studies have been undertaken in east africa specifically analyzing the impacts of land use land cover changes on watershed hydrology guzha et al 2018 to fill this gap this study emphasized the land use land cover analysis of dire dawa city and its watershed in relation to estimation of surface runoff volume to estimate the surface runoff generated from individual land uses the study adopted rational method rational method can help to calculate runoff volume for small catchment areas that in turn helps to design flood management studies needhidasan and nallanathel 2013 therefore this study is aimed at calculating the amount of surface runoff generated from the watershed and to recommend cost effective and environmental friendly ways of flood causing surface runoff minimization 2 methodology 2 1 study area the city of dire dawa is located between 9 26 n and 9 45 n latitude and 41 41 e and 42 07 e longitude dire dawa city is located in the great ethiopian rift valley with an altitude of 1000 1200 m above sea level and surrounded by mountainous districts of oromia regional states these surrounding districts of oromia regional state are known for their dense population distribution as a result people are forced to expand their agricultural lands to inaccessible infertile and hilly areas located in the southern parts of the city the deforestation and degradation on southern part and hill nature of the landform increased the amount of surface runoff and its flow velocity that worsen the problem of flooding as shown in fig 1 dire dawa city is dissected by five large and small rivers dechatu goro melkajabdu laga hare and butuji rivers which made their origin from the southern parts following the occurrence of heavy rainfall in the upper catchments these rivers collect the surface runoff and induce flood hazard when they reach the center of the city dire dawa city watershed is composed of urban dire dawa rural dire dawa some districts of oromia regionl state somli regional state and covered an area of 703 km2 2 2 materials and method this study employed the collection of both primary and secondary data from primary and secondary data sources the primary data were collected through interview and focus group discussions the focus group discussion was conducted with purposely selected 10 elder people who have lived in the city for more than 30 years the main reason behind selection of the elders was to use their 30 40 years back recall of land use land cover information of dire dawa city and the surrounding districts located in the watershed the secondary data were collected from various secondary sources through document analysis and literature review these data includes satellite image digital elevation model dem and meteorological data the secondary data were used to generate surface runoff and land use land cover information to calculate the surface runoff this study employed the application of rational method 1 q cia where q peak flow in cubic meter per second m3 s c runoff coefficient weighted proportion of the rainfall that runs off the surface is obtained from runoff coefficient table i average rainfall intensity for a duration equal to the time of concentration for the area meter per hour that can be obtained from the idf curve of the study area a drainage area in sq km rational model is an appropriate method to estimate the surface runoff from small catchments the watershed area of this study is larger than the capacity on which the rational model can perform to predict surface runoff in this case rather than treating the whole watershed as a single area this study applied rational model on specific individual land uses such as forest agriculture settlement bush grasses bare and riverside sands the analysis of individual land use surface runoff helps for two things 1 to identify the type of land use more responsible for the generation of surface runoff in the area 2 to classify the larger area of the watershed in to manageable size for rational model application hence this study can add a knowledge and option how to apply rational model in larger areas with no good record of hydrologic and hydrological data the rational method used to estimates the peak rate of runoff at any location in a watershed as a function of the drainage area a runoff coefficient c and rainfall intensity i for a duration equal to the time of concentration tc which is the time required for water to flow from the most remote point of the basin to the location being analyzed abam 2014 c runoff coefficient can be obtained by adding the multiplication of areas of each land use with corresponding roughness values of each land use type eq 2 the surface roughness of different land use lies between 0 no runoff and 1 the maximum runoff c is obtained by tabulating the weighted value of the coefficient of each land use land cover for each drainage basin the weighted c value calculated with the following equation 2 c a 1 c 1 a 2 c 2 a 3 c 3 a 4 c 4 a 5 c 5 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 where c is surface roughness of each land use a is an area of each land use the other important parameter for surface runoff estimation is rainfall intensity i intensity which can be obtained from idf intensity drainage frequency curve idf curve is a graph with duration plotted as abscissa intensity as ordinate and a series of curves for each return period the frequency is expressed in terms of return period t which is the average length of time between rainfall events that equal or exceed the design magnitude when dealing with extremes it is important to employ the probability of return period eq 3 to determine the empirical return period t the study employed time series analysis of rainfall data 1953 2016 obtained from dire dawa meteorological stations 3 t n 1 m where m is order or rank of the event n is total number of event in the data t is return period in different methods the probability of occurrence of a particular extreme rainfall is important and such information is obtained by the frequency analysis of rainfall data eq 4 4 p 1 t where t is return period p is probability the decision of the return period was obtained by considering a 61 years of rainfall data to identify years which received highest extreme annual rainfall by correlating the report of identified flooding years and their resulting record of rainfall data 100 mm was considered as a threshold for the occurrence of flooding in the study area accordingly a rainfall data greater or equals to 100 mm was considered as a benchmark to identify extreme events after identification of years with extreme event the recurrence interval between the years was computed using eq 3 the average return period of the extreme events were computed using eq 5 5 average return period y1 y2 y3 ki n where y1 y2 y3 are return periods between years with high rainfall records and n is the number of years with highest rainfall records the land use land cover change is another important parameter to determine surface runoff to identify causes of flooding looking at the past trend of land use land cover of the study area is very important to explore the land use change of dire dawa city watershed the study employed analysis of four decade satellite imageries accordingly the satellite image of 1985 1995 2006 20 114 with 166 53 and 167 54 path and row were analyzed using erdas imagine 9 1 the erdas imagine was used to classify satellite images in to different land use systems and to calculate the areas of each land use the study years were selected to show the possible past land use land cover change trends in relation to government change and census years the land use land cover classes were classified in to five areas of interest which include forest settlement bush and grasses agriculture land bare land and riverside sands 2 3 validation of the rational model the study area meteorological station is ungauaged stations where there are no registered discharges data that can be used to calibrate the rational model as a result the study emphasize on validation of the model accordingly the actual potential accommodation capacity of the open channel was computed on the field to determine the amount of accommodated and left over discharges the actual potential capacity of the channel is determined using the formula 6 q va where v is velocity and a is an area of the channel in the same way the velocity of the channel at different cross section was determined using balloon and stopwatch the time consumed by balloon to travel 100 m was recorded using stopwatch to calculate the observed velocity of the channel this helps to compute the velocity of the river at different specific cross sections the velocity can be calculated using the formula 7 v s t where s is distance and t is the time consumed to travel the distance s similarly the area of the channel at each cross section is determined using the formula 8 a w l where w is the width of the river cross section obtained from field measurement l is the water depth h measured at different cross sections finally the potential carrying capacity of the channel was determined by summing up the four sites cross section carrying capacity of the channel then the potential discharge of the open channel is compared with the discharges obtained through rational model at different decades the percent change of the discharge at different decade is also computed by the formula 9 percent change a final a initial a initial 100 where a final is the discharge at final decade a initial is the discharge at initial decade 3 results 3 1 land use land cover analysis the watershed has been experiencing significant land use land cover changes during the study years to explore the land use land cover changes of dire dawa city watershed the analysis of four decade satellite image was conducted as shown in fig 2 during the four decade study period 1985 to 2016 there have been remarkable changes overall identified land use land covers the built up land has expanded from 17 3 km2 in 1985 to 44 6 km2 in the year 2016 on the same way bare land showed increasing trend from 115 6 km2 in 1985 to 308 km2 in 2016 conversely the forest land has shrunken from 63 7 km2 in 1985 to 37 1 km2 in 2016 similar trend has been observed in bush and grass agriculture and riverside lands and have been decreasing significantly from 1985 to 2016 this shows that land use and land covers which are supposed to increase runoff coefficient and resulting surface runoff were significantly increasing over the study periods the trend analyses of land use land cover and respective area coverage of the study period are presented in table 1 3 2 rainfall intensity the reading of idf curve shown in fig 3 gives the rainfall intensity of the watershed at different return period 5 10 30 50 100 and 300 accordingly the rainfall intensity of dire dawa meteorological station shows 21 38 50 58 62 and 80 mm h for a duration of 1 h at 5 10 30 50 100 and 300 return period respectively fig 3 the other important element to calculate runoff coefficient needs identification of the frequency or the return period of the study area to use the above results of rainfall intensity obtained from idf curve for different return period determining the return period of the town is mandatory to determine frequency or return period of the town the 61 years of annual rainfall data obtained from national meteorological agency were analyzed as shown in table 2 taking the frequency of available return periods the average frequency period is found to be 4 9 years therefore the 5 years return period is considered to compute the rainfall intensity of the study area from the readings of idf curve the rainfall intensity at 5 year return period is estimated to be 21 mm hr 3 3 discharge discharge refers the flow water generated from a given catchment the amount of surface runoff generated from the respective land use land cover of the study area watershed is summarized in table 3 the reference value of runoff coefficient for different land taken from different sources mahmoud and alazba 2015 sarukkalige 2011 is considered as shown in table 3 as the river side land use is ephemeral the runoff coefficient value of the river side is considered to be higher than the bare land and lower than the water bodies the trend of surface runoff generated discharge across the study period is increasing 1404 5 m3 s 1575 4 m3 s 1688 8 m3 s and 1787 7 m3 s for the year 1985 1995 2006 and 2016 respectively the result of discharge analysis shown in fig 4 indicates that bare land bush and grass land and agriculture are generating the higher discharge respectively however though the amount is less due to less area coverage the amount of surface runoff generated from settlement per area is very high moreover since the year 2006 to 2016 more than half of the discharge generated was attributed to bare land use land covers though the amount of discharge generated by bush and grass land is high it is showing a decreasing trend through the whole study period the amounts of discharge generated from a particular land cover during the study period are shown in fig 4 3 4 validation of the rational model to compare the estimated discharge of the catchment obtained through rational model with the actual holding capacity of the river channel actual measurements of velocity depth and discharge was conducted at four a b c and d cross sections of dechatu river as shown in fig 5 the balloon was left to travel 100 ms at different four cross sections a b c and d this measurement was done in months of august which is the rainiest month in the study area the balloon took the velocity that ranges from 4 6 to 6 m s to travel the 100 m distances fig 4 in the same way the respective depth of the river was measured for each cross section in the months of august like velocity the depths of the river were also varies at different cross section and lies between 1 9 to 3 5 m table 4 similarly the width of the rivers which is an input to calculate discharge was also measured at each cross section table 4 finally the actual accommodation potential of the open channel which is in this case dechatu river was determined using velocity depth and widths of the rivers measured at different cross sections is presented under table 4 4 discussion 4 1 the implication of land use on surface runoff and flooding the dynamics of land use land cover pattern in the catchment has direct implication in determining the hydrological condition of the watershed the finding of study showed that the decreases in forest land and increase in bare land increases the amount of surface runoff this shows that the study area watershed is experiencing deforestation as a means of adaptation to support the increasing population the findings of this study complements with previous studies conducted in east africa and ethiopia the review of various studies conducted in east africa confirmed that the increase in vegetation cover decreases the surface runoff guzha et al 2018 similar studies conducted in ethiopia showed that the trend of surface runoff is showing an increasing trend with decreasing forest land cover guzha et al 2018 tesemma et al 2010 kasaye 2015 legesse et al 2003 with constant rainfall intensity and return period this study also identified that surface runoff are gradually showing a rising trend since 1985 this indicates that land use land covers of the study area watershed have been seriously disturbed and affecting the resulting yield of runoff in the same condition of similar rainfall intensity distribution due to substantial reduction of vegetation cover in the upper catchments of the watershed the magnitude and velocity of surface runoff become particularly rapid in view of this the interviewed elders reported that about 40 years back the vegetation cover of the southern highlands during the regime of emperor haile sellassie 1931 1945 was modestly dense it was through time that the people intervened and colonized the forest areas and the upper catchments become devoid of vegetation cover furthermore the analyzed land use land cover results from1985 to 2016 show that high and increasing trend of runoff coefficient values was recorded for settlement and bare land respectively this shows that the two land use systems settlement and bare for urban and rural respectively are expanding in the expense of other land uses therefore to minimize the flood effect of dire dawa city managing the surface runoff generated from the two land use should be emphasized by all concerned organs working on flood hazard management of dire dawa city 4 2 minimizing discharge using land use change and rooftop rain water harvesting to examine the surface runoff effects of each land use type all the fiver land use types were compared in terms of runoff coefficient value and resulted discharge yield from each land use accordingly river side settlement and bare land use land covers with runoff coefficient value of 0 8 0 7 and 0 6 respectively are sensitive to generate high discharge that resulting to flood this implies that these land uses are the central part for surface runoff management planning in rural areas grazing land agriculture and population driven deforestation are threatening the watershed of dire dawa city based on the results of land use land cover and rational method analysis this study tried to develop land use scenarios to manage the contradicting relationship of land use land cover and the resulting surface runoff the study developed two hypotheses of scenario referred as worst and best case scenarios scenario 1 worst case scenario the trend of land use covers obtained from satellite imagery between 1985 and 2016 shows that bare land and settlements are continuously increasing this case scenario tried to predict what will happen if the current land use land cover condition continues for another two decade up to 2038 the result of land use change in table 1 showed that land use land cover change of the study watershed for the last two decades 1995 2016 the result showed that the percentage change of surface runoff discharge was increased by 5 9 for year 2006 to 2016 the worst case scenario predicts that if the trends of the land use land cover continuous like this for the coming two decade the surface runoff of the watershed will rise to 1893 17 m3 s and 2004 86 m3 s by 2026 and 2036 respectively referring to table 3 most of the estimated change in surface runoff of the watershed is resulted from bare land and settlement land uses respectively the model validation result shows that the maximum discharge holding capacity of dechatu river is 1491 505 m3 s that was why flood was not extremely affecting the city before 1985 the most destructive flood was occurred in 2006 when excessive 1688 8 m3 s discharges were generated the registered discharge at 2006 is higher than the carrying capacity of the river by 197 3 m s this tells that unless the flood management strategies are performed as long as surface runoff more than 1491 505 m3 s discharges are registered the possibilities of facing flood induced risks are inevitable scenario 2 best case scenario the trend of land use covers obtained from satellite imagery between the year 1985 and 2016 shows that bare land and settlements are continuously increasing similarly the result of rational method shows that surface runoff discharge is rising during the whole study decades this shows that if the trend of land use goes like before the city will face a higher discharge and sever flood in coming years however an increase in forest area where previously degraded bare land areas and improving the farming system on agricultural land complemented with adoption of landscape based water harvesting strategies in upper catchment and rooftop water harvesting can significantly minimize the effect of surface runoff and flooding for example keeping intensity and other land uses constant if 10 km2 of bare land is converted grasses every year for consecutive 5 years the amount of 2016 surface runoff 1787 7 m3 s can be reduced to 1767 7 m3 s if the activity is repeated for another 5 years the surface runoff discharge can be drop to 1687 7 m3 s the increase of vegetation forest cover can be done across fragile inaccessible and degraded areas which are no more used for agricultural purposes moreover beyond reducing surface runoff the will be forest areas should be planned to provide multipurpose advantages such as food recreational and additional economic benefits the objective of this scenario complies with un millennium development goals griggs et al 2013 among the eight millennium development goals conservation of natural resources and sustainable agriculture with appropriate farming methods was found to be an assignment for the countries to ensure environmental sustainability beside to managing land use land covers the scenario hypothesize rooftop water harvesting mechanisms as another means to reduce surface runoff this activity is proposed mainly for urban areas different studies in africa and ethiopia found out that a roof of one house assumed to have 80 m2 areas adugna et al 2018 aladenola and adeboye 2010 according to csa 2013 housing census of ethiopia exclusive of rural dire dawa and surrounding districts of other regions settlements there are 72 937 housing unit in dire dawa city administration alone using the rational method the housing units generate 23 63 m3 s surface runoff discharge as one of runoff minimization strategy this scenario recommends the harvest of 20 rooftop rain water by individual households for example considering 2016 surface runoff if awareness is created and the proposed 20 of rooftop rain water is harvested by each household about 4 7 m3 s amounts of surface runoff could be managed this shows that complementing to land use land cover change rooftop rainwater harvesting can help to manage surface runoff in dire dawa city and its watersheds 5 conclusion and recommendations the dynamics of land use and land cover affects the volume and velocity of surface runoff generated and transported to downstream specific land use land covers either increase or decrease the generation of surface runoff in order to assess the impacts of land use land cover change on overall hydrological nature of the area the study used the easily applicable approaches rational method and land use land cover analysis the former approach is used to estimate the amount of surface runoff generated from each land use by integrating the area of land use and respective runoff coefficient the latter is used to classify the land use land covers and to estimate the area covered by respective land uses based on 1985 1995 2006 and 2016 analysis of satellite imagery the coverage of settlement and bare land has showed an increasing trend during the study period 1985 2016 conversely the coverage of forest land agriculture bushes and grasses and rivers side land use land covers has been significantly shrinking over the study period the result of the study confirms that the area of land use land covers that minimize surface runoff generation are decreasing in the expense of land uses land covers that exacerbate surface runoff generation and problem of flooding finally the study developed a worst and best case scenarios for coming two decades in the worst case scenario keeping constant the ongoing land use land cover of the study area the problem of flooding will be beyond the control and the damage is forecasted to be severe in the contrary the best case scenario recommended the continuous way of rehabilitation of degraded bare lands and rooftop rainwater harvesting that can significantly minimize the problem of flooding in the coming two decades therefore to sustainably mange the flood problem of dire dawa city it is recommended that government organization ngos policy makers and concerned organs are expected to adopt the best case scenarios results of this study and should work on awareness creation for its implementation both in dire dewa city and its watershed conflict of interest we declare that we have no any conflicting interest

range of salinity 48 to 5651 μs cm 1 through chemical composition of groundwater hydrogeochemical modeling through phreeqc allied to chemical ratios cl br ratio and stable isotopes data δ18o and δ2h new hydrological insights for the region the phreeqc modeling showed that high ph and low pe values conditioning the main processes controlling the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in that region the salinity origins should be explained by 4 hypotheses 1 a group related to recharge zones close to the basin headboard or connected to the fractured aquifers from the basement rocks low cl br ratio and predominance of light δ18o and δ2h isotopes 2 a group formed by groundwater with high cl br ratio and predominance of heavy δ18o and δ2h isotopes associated to dissolution processes of tertiary brackish water environment sediments 3 a group formed by groundwater with low cl br ratio high cl concentrations and low δ18o and δ2h related to groundwater under influence of caceribu river high content of domestic effluents and 4 a group composed by groundwater with high salinity high cl concentrations and enrichment of δ18o and δ2h located at a mangrove area where the influence of seawater intrusion in the aquifer is recognized keywords chloride bromide ratio phreeqc hydrochemical modeling guanabara bay porous aquifer regional hydrogeochemistry tertiary quaternary sediments 1 introduction the guanabara bay hydrographic basin mainly composed by the hydrographic basins of macacu and caceribu rivers has an important role for the population of several part of rio de janeiro metropolitan region rjmr as it represents one of the main water supply at northeastern part of this hydrographic basin is located the itaboraí municipality which is undergoing intense urbanization process as consequence of the installation of the petrochemical complex of rio de janeiro comperj started in 2008 at this region it is found an important geological unit of rio de janeiro state the macacu sedimentary basin which is also an important coastal aquifer system macacu coastal aquifer the macacu coastal aquifer is composed by tertiary clastic sediments which can reach depths over than 200 m and quaternary sediments from riverine lacustrine and fluvial marine environments reaching depths about 40 m fig 1 thus the installation of the petrochemical complex became an important issue for the government authorities due to the possible environmental impacts on that region for this reason some environmental studies are in progress mainly focused on the preservation of the water resources generally coastal areas constitute vulnerable ecosystems subject to severe anthropogenic pressure and natural hazards such as sea level rise land subsidence coastal erosion and flooding and salinization of groundwater the intrusion of saltwater into coastal aquifers is a widespread phenomenon that gradually causes the problem of groundwater salinization trabelsi et al 2007 gattacceca et al 2009 ghiglieri et al 2012 giambastiani et al 2013 the monitoring of electrical conductivity ec from groundwater in itaboraí reveals great heterogeneity in concentrations of dissolved constituents which suggests salinization processes by seawater encroachment in macacu coastal aquifer gomes et al 2013 salinization of coastal aquifers is explained generally in terms of lateral seawater intrusion into the aquifer but other processes may be involved such as flow of saline groundwater from adjacent or underlying aquifers anthropogenic contamination due to agriculture or infiltration of sewage effluents gassama et al 2012 farber et al 2007 kass et al 2005 whatever the salt source its recognition is very often masked by the activation of water rock interactions directly related to increase in water ionic strength whose effects overlap those ones caused by the salt source de montety et al 2008 fidelibus and tulipano 1990 ghiglieri et al 2009 giménez and morell 1997 howard and lloyd 1983 yamanaka and kumagai 2006 furthermore there are cases where salinization is due to the presence of connate fossil waters worden et al 2006 saltwater encroachment in groundwater generally is assessed by some ions ratios namely mg ca k na na ca cl hco3 and na cl ratios and mainly cl br ratio zilberbrand et al 2001 vengosh et al 2002 vengosh and rosenthal 1994 vengosh and ben zvi 1994 vengosh and pankratov 1988 hem 1985 these ions ratios are worldwide used because they give important information about dissolution of geological material and other geochemical processes which will influence in the water chemical composition the cl br ratio is an important tool for monitoring the salinization of groundwater due the conservative behavior of these ions alcalá and custodio 2008 lorenzen et al 2012 ortega et al 2015 and its associations with cl concentrations could inform the origin of the groundwater salinity in other words whether the salinity is coming from the marine aerosol or could be influenced by aquifer materials atmospheric precipitation increased by evaporation and anthropic sources custodio and llamas 1983 according to davis et al 1998 the abundancy of cl and br in the environment presents a primordial difference both in water and rock cl is about 40 to 8000 times abundant than br a little change in the dissolved br amount trigger a significant difference in the cl br ratio the same author studied the cl br ratio in shallow aquifers from alberta kansas and arizona usa which ranged from 100 to 200 freshwater influenced by domestic sewage the range was between 300 and 600 in aquifers from urban areas influenced by streets runoff this ratio ranged from 10 to 100 and for groundwater associated to geological unities containing halite the cl br ratio ranged between 1000 and 10 000 for the rainwater in those locations ranged from 50 to 150 davis et al 1998 2001 also demonstrated that coastal aquifers from usa presented cl br ratio of about 400 and the groundwater from the interior presented values 150 in southeastern australia systematic measurement of cl br ratio in rainwater displayed values between 180 and 220 for coastal aquifers influenced by seawater intrusion the ratio values oscillated between 400 and 1300 cartwright et al 2006 for davis et al 1998 2001 the cl br ratio from seawater is about 650 alcalá and custodio 2008 highlighted that aquifers from portugal and spain are directly influenced by seawater encroachment and also have cl br ratio of 655 while in the interior of these countries this ratio ranged from 200 to 500 halite rich aquifers in these countries presented cl br ratio between 5000 and 6000 still in this study the authors showed that agricultural areas affected by pesticides presented this ratio values about 300 additionally the cl br ratio has become an effective tool in studies of surface water and groundwater with low to moderate salinity ortega et al 2015 even cl and br being conservative ions the sorption of br has been reported in some studies tennyson and sttergren 1980 leap 1982 bowman 1984 davis et al 1985 bowman and rice 1985 however generally only 10 of dissolved br is adsorbed by clay minerals soil and organic matter in acid solutions ph 4 7 the sorption can reach about 15 20 boggs and adams 1992 considering the salinity in groundwater is due to the precipitation dissolution process the use of hydrogeochemical modeling could be a valuable tool to describe the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater composition alley 1993 silva filho et al 2009 the stable o and h isotopes δ18o and δ2h together with the cl br ratio could help to understand the interactions among groundwater surface and meteoric water besides to determinate groundwater recharge and discharge areas and also reveal evaporation process or mixing with seawater cary et al 2015 thus the aim of this study is to characterize the groundwater chemistry from macacu coastal aquifer and understand main processes affecting the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in the guanabara bay region 2 study area the study area is located at itaboraí municipality northeastern guanabara bay between the guapi macacu and caceribu rivers fig 1 according to semads 1999 the region weather is classified as subtropical to tropical and the annual temperature average is about 21 c the greatest temperatures occur between december and march but february is the warmest month presenting temperature average of about 25 c july is the coldest month and shows temperature average of about 20 c historic data of rainfall time series of 31 years point out annual average about 1800 mm presenting the wet season between november and january and the dry season between june to august sometimes anticipating to may and extends to september drm 1981 according to semads 1999 the annual average evaporation in the most part of the study region is about 900 mm located at the geological domain of guanabara graben which is inserted in the ribeira fold belt the study area belongs to a neoproterozoic geotectonic domain cprm 2001 according almeida 1977 1981 the ribeira fold belt integrates the geotectonic framework at southeastern brazil surrounding the são francisco craton together to others orogeny as brasília fold belt westward and araçuaí fold belt eastward which took place during brazilian pan african orogenesis the structuration of guanabara graben is dated from the paleocene building up the macacu sedimentary basin at eocene during the graben evolving under strong nw se extensional system ferrari 2001 in eocene the paleocene sediments from macacu basin were reworked contributing to the formation of itambi conglomerate which marks the transition between tertiary and quaternary together with the intense erosion in the northern border of macacu basin showing a marked gap between serra do mar mountains and the basin ecologus agrar 2005 an interesting hydrothermal event in the study area at tanguá municipality was related to the alkaline magmatism dated from neocretaceous to eotertiary which are found in some regions of rio de janeiro state the tanguá alkaline complex is responsible to the lode fluoride mineralization in structures toward ne ene sant anna and riccomini 2001 coelho 1987 sonoki and garda 1988 2 1 hydrostratigraphic units the study area is composed by four hydrostratigraphic units namely the macacu aquifer tertiary sediments the alluvial lacustrine aquifer and the fluvial marine aquifer both sediments of quaternary and the fractured aquifer from the crystalline basement fig 2 according to schlumberger 2007 the alluvial lacustrine aquifer is an unconfined aquifer composed by sandy and clayey sediments with large variety of mineralogical composition and organic matter thickness about 20 m and an extraction discharge from 10 to 20 m3 h 1 the macacu aquifer comprises sand and conglomerates from the macacu formation intercalated to pelitic lacustrine facies constituting in a multilayer semi confined aquifer the extraction discharge from this aquifer has a range from 5 to 42 m3 h 1 with discharge of about 0 9 m3 h 1 m 1 the fluvial marine aquifer is represented by the flooded terrains in the mangrove area from guapimirim environmental protection area epa composed by clay sediments organic matter enriched located in the coastal region and in the end member of the river canals toward sea studies suggest an average extraction discharge from 5 to 10 m3 h 1 ecologus agrar 2005 the main groundwater outflow system of the studied aquifers is through the porous matrix toward guanabara bay which is in concordance with the surficial streams the regional groundwater outflow is given from east to west fig 2 locally those alluvionar aquifers contribute to the maintenance of rivers base level due to the porous hydraulic connection among them schlumberger 2007 3 material and methods six sampling campaigns were carried out monthly between august 2009 and january 2010 n 56 four multilevel wells were monitored p 01 p 02 p 03 and p 04 fig 1 each one with screens installed in two or three different depths according to the different aquifer layers as exemplified in the well log in fig 3 the p 05 installed in the mangrove area has only one groundwater monitoring level located at 15 m depth the table 1 presents a summary of the features from the monitored wells with more than one groundwater monitoring level in different depths ranging from 17 to 148 m therefore the hydrostratigraphic units sampled were the macacu aquifer tertiary the fluvial marine aquifer and the alluvial lacustrine aquifer quaternary for this work the macacu aquifer due to its thickness was divided in three other sub aquifer units namely shallow medium and deep macacu in the field work before to collect the sample it was performed measurements of the water level and the volumes contained in each well in order to perform the purge the water samples were collected using a submersible pump model wsp 12v 4 waterra coupled to a polyethylene hose all samples were filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane and preserved in thermal boxes on temperature about 4 c the parameters electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds temperature ph and eh were performed in situ by a hanna instruments multi parameter probe in laboratory the major ions na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and br were carried out without previous dilution by ion chromatography with the equipment metrohm model 861 with an automatic sampler model 863 the hco3 concentrations were obtained by using methods of volumetric dosage the ion balance error calculated for all samples showed values under 10 accepted error limit for the electrical conductivity range according custódio and llamas 1983 the hydrogeochemical modelling was carried out by phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 which calculated mineral equilibrium and dissolved ion speciation the stable isotopes analysis δ2h and δ18o was performed for 59 samples including 56 from groundwater and 3 from rainwater in the hydrogeology laboratory from université d avignon france by mass spectrometer finnigan delta s all values are referred to the smow standards craig 1961 and the analytical deviation reproducibility of 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δd aiming to identify the marine influence on the study area daily measurements of water table level and ec were performed by pressure transducers divers from october 2009 and january 2010 in the wells p 01c and p 05 which are shallower and closer the coastal line 4 results the data from the monitored wells are shown at table 2 in dry season the lowest ec value is observed in deep macacu aquifer 71 μs cm 1 and the highest one in fluvial marine aquifer 5487 μs cm 1 in rainy season the lowest ec value was 48 μs cm 1 deep macacu aquifer and 5651 μs cm 1 fluvial marine aquifer the fig 4 presents the tridimensional distribution of ec values from the studied aquifers in function of the water level and the distance of the wells from the coastal line the highest ec values are observed in p 05 fluvial marine aquifer the shallower and closer to coast line besides the only one installed in the mangrove area guapimirim epa the lowest ec values are found in p 02b macacu aquifer located at the border of the basin observing the range of ec values it is noticed there is no great difference between dry and wet season regardless of the season and aquifers sampled it is noticed the wells located up to 14 km from the coast line p 01 p 04 and p 05 show ec values higher compared to the other ones this result suggests that those wells are influenced by saltwater intrusion and or other salinization process the ph values ranging from 5 7 to 8 8 in dry season with the highest value for the p 03 a and lowest value in p 02b both in deep macacu aquifer the same wells in the rainy season present ph range similar to the dry season 5 7 8 3 as well as ec behavior the ph range also present large spatial variation however an irrelevant seasonal variation the pe values varied from 0 22 to 5 73 with the highest value in p 02c shallow macacu aquifer and lowest at p 03 a in deep macacu aquifer however considering the average pe values from the studied aquifers the highest is found at shallow macacu aquifer due to the closeness to the land surface and the lowest ones in fluvial marine aquifer obviously due to the mangrove environment the major ions concentrations versus cl concentration fig 5 showed that the fluvial marine aquifer to have the higher values of na mg2 k so4 2 and hco3 while ca2 has its higher concentrations in the alluvial lacustrine aquifer magnesium presents the largest range of concentrations on alluvial lacustrine aquifer varying from 0 57 to 22 84 mg l 1 while the deep macacu aquifer presented concentrations between 0 23 and 18 7 mg l 1 the cl concentrations in the alluvial lacustrine aquifer shallow aquifer show a large range between 9 8 and 158 mg l 1 probably due to the well location relative to the shoreline the cl concentrations show an increase westward lesser in p 03b and higher at p 04b and p 01c allowing to infer different hypothesis as i saline intrusion contamination ii aquifers influenced by surface water contaminated by domestic industrial sewage iii natural salt dissolution from older coastal sediments in the aquifer matrix the major ions concentrations from groundwater represented in piper hill diagrams fig 6 allowed distinguishing three main hydrochemical facies namely ca hco3 na hco3 and na cl types therefore based on these hydrochemical features from groundwater it is possible to notice that 1 in deep aquifer layers close to the headboard of the basin dominance of macacu aquifer predominates the hydrochemical facies ca hco3 p 02 and na hco3 p 03 2 in deep and intermediate aquifers at central part of the basin dominates respectively the na hco3 type p 01 a and p 01b and na cl type p 01c 3 in shallow aquifer at the groundwater discharge area close to coast line predominates na cl type p 03 and p 05 with remarkable influence of na and cl in the basin the rise of the na content and gradual ca2 decrease occurs due to the ion exchange phenomenon caused by the contact of groundwater with clay minerals near to the coast the great enrichment of na and the na cl facies is associated to the presence of salt deposits from ancient sea evaporation as suggested by pinto et al 2006 as well as due to seawater encroachment the cl br ratio values are presented in table 2 the meteoric water sampled displayed cl br ratio of 74 value expected by atmospheric precipitation between 50 and 150 davis et al 1998 the macacu and alluvial lacustrine aquifers presented large variation of the cl br ratio ranging from 122 to 1420 and from 158 to 1071 respectively for fluvial marine aquifer the cl br ratio presented was a short range of values from 274 to 595 relevant variations of cl br ratio versus cl concentrations are verified for these data and could indicate different sources of salinity concerning the stable isotopes data from macacu basin granular aquifers the δ2h ranged from 36 34 to 19 77 v smow and δ18o from 5 92 to 0 08 v smow while the deuterium excess d excess was between 1 72 and 11 8 calculated as d δ2h 8δ18o the fig 7 shows the relationship between δ2h and δ18o from the groundwater samples and they show arrangement on the global meteoric water line gmwl given by the equation δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 the local meteoric water line based on the data from iaea given by δ2h 8 08δ18o 12 63 n 132 monthly average from 1961 to 1985 was also plotted together with gmwl it could be noticed that lmwl is very similar to the gmwl and the most groundwater samples have the same trend the most d excess values found in the study area table 2 were 10 these facts corroborate the hypothesis of groundwater recharge for all area considering the granular aquifers the two rainwater samples from november and december 2009 have less fractioning pointing out high evaporation rate of the sampling period 5 discussion regarding the influence of saline intrusion according to igme 2009 in coastal aquifer with natural conditions there is the contact between fresh groundwater and saltwater considering two immiscible solutions which form a transition zone that mix both solutions progressively by diffusion processes the mixing zone can move according to reducing of fresh groundwater flow toward sea and or a variation of the permeability from the aquifers systems according to the lithological heterogeneity tidal frequency and oscillations sanders et al 2012 because it is a transition environment with similar altimetry to sea level and the mangrove area it was assumed significant influence of seawater upon fresh groundwater in p 05 presenting close relationship to the tidal variation which influence the ec values and water table variation in order to verify this relationship the fig 8 show temporal graphs for p 05 and p 01c close to coastline considering the water level and ec it is possible to notice the water level and ec maximum and minimum values in p 05 are well correlated and could be associated to the tidal oscillation the opposite behavior of p 01c showing the p 05 is located on the mixing zone between fresh groundwater and seawater intrusion 5 1 the controlling of ionic behavior through the hydrogeochemical modeling the hydrogeochemical modeling for the studied area was carried out by phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 considering the physicochemical parameters and the saturation index si data from the different aquifers regarding the aquifers chemical and mineralogical composition the chosen minerals for the modeling were calcite dolomite gypsum and halite the carbonate minerals should come from both the seawater influence and weathering reactions from aquifer materials halite could come from the aquifer materials as well as from seawater influence the sulfate salt also could come from both seawater influence and from the sulfuric gas generation by the organic matter decomposition fig 9 examines the behavior among the main physicochemical parameters ec pe and ph and the fig 10 compares these physicochemical parameters with minerals si observing the graphs a and b fig 9 it is possible to notice the well marked behavior of ec in each studied aquifer system namely the fluvial marine aquifer with the highest ec values followed by the alluvial lacustrine aquifer the deep medium and shallow macacu aquifers samples considering all data there is no significant correlation between ec and ph fig 9 graph a however the pe has evident negative correlation with ec and ph fig 9 graphs b and c suggesting oxidation reducing process mainly along the deep macacu aquifer which displays markedly two main groups one with higher pe and lower ph values represented by the well p 02b and other most samples with lower pe and higher ph values p 01 a p 02 a and p 03 a that behavior difference could be due to the influence of a local structure lineament fig 1 close to the location of p 02b which favor groundwater circulation and mixing among porous aquifers even the fractured aquifer in basement rocks conditioning oxidation and dilution processes decreasing of ec and ph values the other group composed by p 01 a p 02 a and p 03 a has no influence from any structure and presents reduced conditions higher ec values probably due to the larger residence time of groundwater triggering the rise of ph values the shallow macacu aquifer samples present low physicochemical parameters variations mainly for ec and ph because of the direct influence of rainwater and the poor composition of the aquifer material the fluvial marine aquifer samples p 05 also presents low oscillations of physicochemical parameters although it has the highest ec values due to the inflow of marine water and low pe because the reduced mangrove environment the relative lower ph values could be explained by the rapid local rainfall see the δ18o content in table 1 which should dilute the groundwater and oxidize the mangrove sediment presence of h2s and microcrystalline pyrite increasing the hydrogen ions concentration ph the medium macacu aquifer samples could be also separated in two groups one with p 04 a samples presenting higher ec and ph values and lower pe ones and the other group with p 01b samples presenting the opposite behavior from p 04 a in this case the behavior difference between the two groups is the influence of residence time on the well p 04 a giving high values of ec and ph and due to the well depth 90 m where it has little water circulation and consequently low pe values the alluvial lacustrine aquifer samples are well represented by all analyzed physicochemical parameters also displaying two main groups the first one with high ph and pe and median ec values p 03b and other with low ph and pe and high ec values p 01c as before commented p 01c should have influence of older coastal sediments salts present in the aquifer materials besides the significant presence of organic matter corroborating the physicochemical parameters behavior at this well while in p 03b located at the basin border has the opposite behavior observing the fig 10 and considering all samples the si for calcite presents the most samples in equilibrium si 0 and in saturation si 0 from deep macacu aquifer showing that significant residence time of groundwater weathering process contributes more than salt intrusion for that mineral formation samples from fluvial marine aquifer presenting the same behavior trend of calcite the si for dolomite also shows most of deep macacu aquifer samples in equilibrium and in saturation with the solution but some samples from medium macacu alluvial lacustrine and fluvial marine aquifers are found close to the equilibrium the si for gypsum displays all samples in undersaturation si 0 with the solution showing few samples of fluvial marine and alluvial lacustrine aquifers a little closer to the equilibrium zone possibly this mineral could get the equilibrium in groundwater closer the coastline higher influence of seawater intrusion it is worth to notice that halite shows the lowest si values among the selected minerals for geochemical modeling all samples undersaturated si 0 the physicochemical parameters behavior in each aquifer body exerts influence on the si behavior of the chosen minerals once more considering all samples it is noticed the ec has moderate positive correlation with si of the four chosen minerals the ph has good positive correlation with only the carbonate minerals while pe has moderate negative correlation with the carbonate minerals as well those si data suggest the carbonate minerals get the equilibrium at high ph and ec and low pe corroborating the geochemical processes described for most samples from deep macacu aquifer and some samples from fluvial marine medium macacu and alluvial lacustrine aquifers in other words the calcite and dolomite will prevail in case of 1 high residence time of groundwater in the aquifer 2 groundwater close to mixing zone of salt wedge 3 presence of older coastal sediments in the aquifer matrix for gypsum only ec has moderate correlation with si highlighting samples of fluvial marine aquifer which are the closer samples to the equilibrium zone for halite it has moderate correlation with ec showing its highest si values associated to the fluvial marine and deep macacu aquifers which wells are located closer to the coast line p 04 and p 05 observing the fig 10 it is possible to notice the increasing of gypsum si in fluvial marine aquifer supporting the hypothesis of gypsum equilibrium under marine influence ayora et al 1995 moreover gypsum tends to reach equilibrium in mangrove environment due to higher sulfate availability as product of mangrove sediments oxidation or present in seawater although the high concentrations of cl in the fluvial marine and deep macacu aquifers the geochemical modeling showed no equilibrium with halite it could be caused by the dilution of seawater encroachment through the great freshwater availability groundwater and surface water and also due to ion exchange of na with clay minerals tertiary and quaternary sediments 5 2 chloride bromide ratios and isotopic approach considering the seawater intrusion is the responsible to affect only fluvial marine aquifer and its ec increasing significant concentrations of cl and na are observed in other aquifers systems and could have the same origin yamanaka et al 2011 therefore the cl br ratio and the stable isotopes data were used in order to establish the salinity origin in the aquifers systems of the macacu sedimentary basin the cl br ratio values cl concentrations and data of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were plotted in graphs fig 11 pointing out 4 different groups regarding the salinization and origin of groundwater 1 group g1 is constituted by recharge waters which have cl br ratio values between 122 and 539 and cl concentrations lesser than 19 mg l 1 concerning the light waters from this group characterized by δ18o ranging from 5 92 and 4 63 δ2h from 36 34 to 27 36 and ec values ranging from 176 to 376 μs cm 1 suggest less evaporated groundwater light isotopes enrichment and relevant input from meteoric water the wells p 02 a p 03 a and p 01 a from deep macacu aquifer and p 01b from medium macacu aquifer represent this group and suggest the most recharge water come from the basin headboard come from the faulting and fracturing structures of basement rocks fractured aquifer 2 surrounding the p 02 the samples of p 02b and p 02c respectively deep and shallow macacu aquifer presenting higher δ18o values between 4 42 and 3 64 higher δ2h values ranging from 22 77 to 26 03 and ec ranging from 71 to 366 μs cm 1 table 2 those data can indicate mixing through vertical flow with high residence time waters from rio vargem member 3 group g2 formed by groundwater with cl br ratio values between 1007 and 1420 and cl concentrations ranging from 122 to 178 mg l 1 represented by multilevel well p 04 which is located on the alluvial lacustrine and macacu aquifers the increase of cl br ratio values in this group is due to the groundwater flow path reaches the rio vargem member from macacu formation which presents brackish water environment sediments davis et al 1998 suggested cl br ratio values between 1000 and 10 000 are associated to groundwater affected by aquifers containing halite besides this fact there is the influence of seawater encroachment justifying the high values for δ18o 0 08 and δ2h 20 28 associated with high ec value 1120 μs cm 1 4 group g3 is constituted by groundwater with low cl br ratio values from 158 to 591 and high cl concentrations from 443 to 573 mg l 1 representing samples collected in the alluvial lacustrine aquifer p 01c the high cl concentrations observed in this well probably be related to in natura domestic sewage releasing in caceribu river on the other hands the high br concentrations could be related to organic matter in shallow aquifers davis et al 1998 this group is characterized by low δ18o values ranging from 5 52 to 5 18 δ2h from 34 15 to 32 53 and ec values from 1564 to 2302 μs cm 1 the ec values and light isotopic ratios corroborates hypothesis about the influence from the caceribu river naturally light isotopes enriched which is broadly impacted by domestic sewage 5 group g4 is formed by groundwater with cl br ratio values between 274 and 595 and cl concentrations ranging from 803 to 1243 mg l 1 this group represents the fluvial marine aquifer from the mangrove area guapimirim epa this region has clayey sediments enriched in organic matter and as well as group g3 also has significant br concentration nevertheless in this area the seawater intrusion preserves high values of cl br ratio this group displays an enrichment in δ18o ranged 4 06 to 3 91 and δ2h values ranged 21 58 to 19 77 and the highest values for ec between 5348 and 5651 μs cm 1 the higher content for δ18o and δ2h in this area is due to the rapid local rainfall and or the mixing of groundwater and seawater intrusion characterizing the groundwater discharge zone 6 conclusion although the relative small area 375 km2 the aquifer system from macacu sedimentary basin presents a wide range of salinity which reflects in diversified geochemical behaviors the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the macacu sedimentary basin is characterized by a gradual evolving from ca hco3 facies in the recharge areas in the basin border toward the crystalline basement to na hco3 facies in the central region and after to na cl facies near the coast line therefore it is evident a ca decrease concomitant to a na increase and it is due to the ionic exchange between groundwater and aquifer matrix this fact is corroborated by the phreeqc modeling which showed that high ph and low pe values conditioning the main processes controlling the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in that region the groundwater from the study area could be distinguished in four different groups regarding the cl br ratio values which suggests the salinity origin i rapid recharged groundwater which cl br ratio values are similar to rainwater ii discharge area groundwater which are affected by salts dissolution halite from brackish water environment deposits iii groundwater with high cl concentrations and also significant br concentrations due to the influence of organic matter deposits and iv groundwater with highest cl concentrations and highest cl br ratio due to the seawater intrusion based on the hydrodynamics and stable isotopes data the groundwater flow model at macacu basin points out recharge areas on p 01 p 02 and p 03 which represent waters from deep macacu aquifer suggesting different origins and residence times therefore the macacu aquifer system has direct recharge by rainwater as well as by indirect recharge from fractured aquifer crystalline basement causing the mixing among the aquifers systems lastly the basin discharge zone is found in p 04 area and

8452,study region porous aquifer system of northeastern guanabara bay rio de janeiro brazil study focus the present work aimed to comprehend the geochemical processes responsible for the considerable range of salinity 48 to 5651 μs cm 1 through chemical composition of groundwater hydrogeochemical modeling through phreeqc allied to chemical ratios cl br ratio and stable isotopes data δ18o and δ2h new hydrological insights for the region the phreeqc modeling showed that high ph and low pe values conditioning the main processes controlling the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in that region the salinity origins should be explained by 4 hypotheses 1 a group related to recharge zones close to the basin headboard or connected to the fractured aquifers from the basement rocks low cl

introduction the guanabara bay hydrographic basin mainly composed by the hydrographic basins of macacu and caceribu rivers has an important role for the population of several part of rio de janeiro metropolitan region rjmr as it represents one of the main water supply at northeastern part of this hydrographic basin is located the itaboraí municipality which is undergoing intense urbanization process as consequence of the installation of the petrochemical complex of rio de janeiro comperj started in 2008 at this region it is found an important geological unit of rio de janeiro state the macacu sedimentary basin which is also an important coastal aquifer system macacu coastal aquifer the macacu coastal aquifer is composed by tertiary clastic sediments which can reach depths over than 200 m and quaternary sediments from riverine lacustrine and fluvial marine environments reaching depths about 40 m fig 1 thus the installation of the petrochemical complex became an important issue for the government authorities due to the possible environmental impacts on that region for this reason some environmental studies are in progress mainly focused on the preservation of the water resources generally coastal areas constitute vulnerable ecosystems subject to severe anthropogenic pressure and natural hazards such as sea level rise land subsidence coastal erosion and flooding and salinization of groundwater the intrusion of saltwater into coastal aquifers is a widespread phenomenon that gradually causes the problem of groundwater salinization trabelsi et al 2007 gattacceca et al 2009 ghiglieri et al 2012 giambastiani et al 2013 the monitoring of electrical conductivity ec from groundwater in itaboraí reveals great heterogeneity in concentrations of dissolved constituents which suggests salinization processes by seawater encroachment in macacu coastal aquifer gomes et al 2013 salinization of coastal aquifers is explained generally in terms of lateral seawater intrusion into the aquifer but other processes may be involved such as flow of saline groundwater from adjacent or underlying aquifers anthropogenic contamination due to agriculture or infiltration of sewage effluents gassama et al 2012 farber et al 2007 kass et al 2005 whatever the salt source its recognition is very often masked by the activation of water rock interactions directly related to increase in water ionic strength whose effects overlap those ones caused by the salt source de montety et al 2008 fidelibus and tulipano 1990 ghiglieri et al 2009 giménez and morell 1997 howard and lloyd 1983 yamanaka and kumagai 2006 furthermore there are cases where salinization is due to the presence of connate fossil waters worden et al 2006 saltwater encroachment in groundwater generally is assessed by some ions ratios namely mg ca k na na ca cl hco3 and na cl ratios and mainly cl br ratio zilberbrand et al 2001 vengosh et al 2002 vengosh and rosenthal 1994 vengosh and ben zvi 1994 vengosh and pankratov 1988 hem 1985 these ions ratios are worldwide used because they give important information about dissolution of geological material and other geochemical processes which will influence in the water chemical composition the cl br ratio is an important tool for monitoring the salinization of groundwater due the conservative behavior of these ions alcalá and custodio 2008 lorenzen et al 2012 ortega et al 2015 and its associations with cl concentrations could inform the origin of the groundwater salinity in other words whether the salinity is coming from the marine aerosol or could be influenced by aquifer materials atmospheric precipitation increased by evaporation and anthropic sources custodio and llamas 1983 according to davis et al 1998 the abundancy of cl and br in the environment presents a primordial difference both in water and rock cl is about 40 to 8000 times abundant than br a little change in the dissolved br amount trigger a significant difference in the cl br ratio the same author studied the cl br ratio in shallow aquifers from alberta kansas and arizona usa which ranged from 100 to 200 freshwater influenced by domestic sewage the range was between 300 and 600 in aquifers from urban areas influenced by streets runoff this ratio ranged from 10 to 100 and for groundwater associated to geological unities containing halite the cl br ratio ranged between 1000 and 10 000 for the rainwater in those locations ranged from 50 to 150 davis et al 1998 2001 also demonstrated that coastal aquifers from usa presented cl br ratio of about 400 and the groundwater from the interior presented values 150 in southeastern australia systematic measurement of cl br ratio in rainwater displayed values between 180 and 220 for coastal aquifers influenced by seawater intrusion the ratio values oscillated between 400 and 1300 cartwright et al 2006 for davis et al 1998 2001 the cl br ratio from seawater is about 650 alcalá and custodio 2008 highlighted that aquifers from portugal and spain are directly influenced by seawater encroachment and also have cl br ratio of 655 while in the interior of these countries this ratio ranged from 200 to 500 halite rich aquifers in these countries presented cl br ratio between 5000 and 6000 still in this study the authors showed that agricultural areas affected by pesticides presented this ratio values about 300 additionally the cl br ratio has become an effective tool in studies of surface water and groundwater with low to moderate salinity ortega et al 2015 even cl and br being conservative ions the sorption of br has been reported in some studies tennyson and sttergren 1980 leap 1982 bowman 1984 davis et al 1985 bowman and rice 1985 however generally only 10 of dissolved br is adsorbed by clay minerals soil and organic matter in acid solutions ph 4 7 the sorption can reach about 15 20 boggs and adams 1992 considering the salinity in groundwater is due to the precipitation dissolution process the use of hydrogeochemical modeling could be a valuable tool to describe the spatial and temporal variability of groundwater composition alley 1993 silva filho et al 2009 the stable o and h isotopes δ18o and δ2h together with the cl br ratio could help to understand the interactions among groundwater surface and meteoric water besides to determinate groundwater recharge and discharge areas and also reveal evaporation process or mixing with seawater cary et al 2015 thus the aim of this study is to characterize the groundwater chemistry from macacu coastal aquifer and understand main processes affecting the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in the guanabara bay region 2 study area the study area is located at itaboraí municipality northeastern guanabara bay between the guapi macacu and caceribu rivers fig 1 according to semads 1999 the region weather is classified as subtropical to tropical and the annual temperature average is about 21 c the greatest temperatures occur between december and march but february is the warmest month presenting temperature average of about 25 c july is the coldest month and shows temperature average of about 20 c historic data of rainfall time series of 31 years point out annual average about 1800 mm presenting the wet season between november and january and the dry season between june to august sometimes anticipating to may and extends to september drm 1981 according to semads 1999 the annual average evaporation in the most part of the study region is about 900 mm located at the geological domain of guanabara graben which is inserted in the ribeira fold belt the study area belongs to a neoproterozoic geotectonic domain cprm 2001 according almeida 1977 1981 the ribeira fold belt integrates the geotectonic framework at southeastern brazil surrounding the são francisco craton together to others orogeny as brasília fold belt westward and araçuaí fold belt eastward which took place during brazilian pan african orogenesis the structuration of guanabara graben is dated from the paleocene building up the macacu sedimentary basin at eocene during the graben evolving under strong nw se extensional system ferrari 2001 in eocene the paleocene sediments from macacu basin were reworked contributing to the formation of itambi conglomerate which marks the transition between tertiary and quaternary together with the intense erosion in the northern border of macacu basin showing a marked gap between serra do mar mountains and the basin ecologus agrar 2005 an interesting hydrothermal event in the study area at tanguá municipality was related to the alkaline magmatism dated from neocretaceous to eotertiary which are found in some regions of rio de janeiro state the tanguá alkaline complex is responsible to the lode fluoride mineralization in structures toward ne ene sant anna and riccomini 2001 coelho 1987 sonoki and garda 1988 2 1 hydrostratigraphic units the study area is composed by four hydrostratigraphic units namely the macacu aquifer tertiary sediments the alluvial lacustrine aquifer and the fluvial marine aquifer both sediments of quaternary and the fractured aquifer from the crystalline basement fig 2 according to schlumberger 2007 the alluvial lacustrine aquifer is an unconfined aquifer composed by sandy and clayey sediments with large variety of mineralogical composition and organic matter thickness about 20 m and an extraction discharge from 10 to 20 m3 h 1 the macacu aquifer comprises sand and conglomerates from the macacu formation intercalated to pelitic lacustrine facies constituting in a multilayer semi confined aquifer the extraction discharge from this aquifer has a range from 5 to 42 m3 h 1 with discharge of about 0 9 m3 h 1 m 1 the fluvial marine aquifer is represented by the flooded terrains in the mangrove area from guapimirim environmental protection area epa composed by clay sediments organic matter enriched located in the coastal region and in the end member of the river canals toward sea studies suggest an average extraction discharge from 5 to 10 m3 h 1 ecologus agrar 2005 the main groundwater outflow system of the studied aquifers is through the porous matrix toward guanabara bay which is in concordance with the surficial streams the regional groundwater outflow is given from east to west fig 2 locally those alluvionar aquifers contribute to the maintenance of rivers base level due to the porous hydraulic connection among them schlumberger 2007 3 material and methods six sampling campaigns were carried out monthly between august 2009 and january 2010 n 56 four multilevel wells were monitored p 01 p 02 p 03 and p 04 fig 1 each one with screens installed in two or three different depths according to the different aquifer layers as exemplified in the well log in fig 3 the p 05 installed in the mangrove area has only one groundwater monitoring level located at 15 m depth the table 1 presents a summary of the features from the monitored wells with more than one groundwater monitoring level in different depths ranging from 17 to 148 m therefore the hydrostratigraphic units sampled were the macacu aquifer tertiary the fluvial marine aquifer and the alluvial lacustrine aquifer quaternary for this work the macacu aquifer due to its thickness was divided in three other sub aquifer units namely shallow medium and deep macacu in the field work before to collect the sample it was performed measurements of the water level and the volumes contained in each well in order to perform the purge the water samples were collected using a submersible pump model wsp 12v 4 waterra coupled to a polyethylene hose all samples were filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane and preserved in thermal boxes on temperature about 4 c the parameters electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds temperature ph and eh were performed in situ by a hanna instruments multi parameter probe in laboratory the major ions na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and br were carried out without previous dilution by ion chromatography with the equipment metrohm model 861 with an automatic sampler model 863 the hco3 concentrations were obtained by using methods of volumetric dosage the ion balance error calculated for all samples showed values under 10 accepted error limit for the electrical conductivity range according custódio and llamas 1983 the hydrogeochemical modelling was carried out by phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 which calculated mineral equilibrium and dissolved ion speciation the stable isotopes analysis δ2h and δ18o was performed for 59 samples including 56 from groundwater and 3 from rainwater in the hydrogeology laboratory from université d avignon france by mass spectrometer finnigan delta s all values are referred to the smow standards craig 1961 and the analytical deviation reproducibility of 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δd aiming to identify the marine influence on the study area daily measurements of water table level and ec were performed by pressure transducers divers from october 2009 and january 2010 in the wells p 01c and p 05 which are shallower and closer the coastal line 4 results the data from the monitored wells are shown at table 2 in dry season the lowest ec value is observed in deep macacu aquifer 71 μs cm 1 and the highest one in fluvial marine aquifer 5487 μs cm 1 in rainy season the lowest ec value was 48 μs cm 1 deep macacu aquifer and 5651 μs cm 1 fluvial marine aquifer the fig 4 presents the tridimensional distribution of ec values from the studied aquifers in function of the water level and the distance of the wells from the coastal line the highest ec values are observed in p 05 fluvial marine aquifer the shallower and closer to coast line besides the only one installed in the mangrove area guapimirim epa the lowest ec values are found in p 02b macacu aquifer located at the border of the basin observing the range of ec values it is noticed there is no great difference between dry and wet season regardless of the season and aquifers sampled it is noticed the wells located up to 14 km from the coast line p 01 p 04 and p 05 show ec values higher compared to the other ones this result suggests that those wells are influenced by saltwater intrusion and or other salinization process the ph values ranging from 5 7 to 8 8 in dry season with the highest value for the p 03 a and lowest value in p 02b both in deep macacu aquifer the same wells in the rainy season present ph range similar to the dry season 5 7 8 3 as well as ec behavior the ph range also present large spatial variation however an irrelevant seasonal variation the pe values varied from 0 22 to 5 73 with the highest value in p 02c shallow macacu aquifer and lowest at p 03 a in deep macacu aquifer however considering the average pe values from the studied aquifers the highest is found at shallow macacu aquifer due to the closeness to the land surface and the lowest ones in fluvial marine aquifer obviously due to the mangrove environment the major ions concentrations versus cl concentration fig 5 showed that the fluvial marine aquifer to have the higher values of na mg2 k so4 2 and hco3 while ca2 has its higher concentrations in the alluvial lacustrine aquifer magnesium presents the largest range of concentrations on alluvial lacustrine aquifer varying from 0 57 to 22 84 mg l 1 while the deep macacu aquifer presented concentrations between 0 23 and 18 7 mg l 1 the cl concentrations in the alluvial lacustrine aquifer shallow aquifer show a large range between 9 8 and 158 mg l 1 probably due to the well location relative to the shoreline the cl concentrations show an increase westward lesser in p 03b and higher at p 04b and p 01c allowing to infer different hypothesis as i saline intrusion contamination ii aquifers influenced by surface water contaminated by domestic industrial sewage iii natural salt dissolution from older coastal sediments in the aquifer matrix the major ions concentrations from groundwater represented in piper hill diagrams fig 6 allowed distinguishing three main hydrochemical facies namely ca hco3 na hco3 and na cl types therefore based on these hydrochemical features from groundwater it is possible to notice that 1 in deep aquifer layers close to the headboard of the basin dominance of macacu aquifer predominates the hydrochemical facies ca hco3 p 02 and na hco3 p 03 2 in deep and intermediate aquifers at central part of the basin dominates respectively the na hco3 type p 01 a and p 01b and na cl type p 01c 3 in shallow aquifer at the groundwater discharge area close to coast line predominates na cl type p 03 and p 05 with remarkable influence of na and cl in the basin the rise of the na content and gradual ca2 decrease occurs due to the ion exchange phenomenon caused by the contact of groundwater with clay minerals near to the coast the great enrichment of na and the na cl facies is associated to the presence of salt deposits from ancient sea evaporation as suggested by pinto et al 2006 as well as due to seawater encroachment the cl br ratio values are presented in table 2 the meteoric water sampled displayed cl br ratio of 74 value expected by atmospheric precipitation between 50 and 150 davis et al 1998 the macacu and alluvial lacustrine aquifers presented large variation of the cl br ratio ranging from 122 to 1420 and from 158 to 1071 respectively for fluvial marine aquifer the cl br ratio presented was a short range of values from 274 to 595 relevant variations of cl br ratio versus cl concentrations are verified for these data and could indicate different sources of salinity concerning the stable isotopes data from macacu basin granular aquifers the δ2h ranged from 36 34 to 19 77 v smow and δ18o from 5 92 to 0 08 v smow while the deuterium excess d excess was between 1 72 and 11 8 calculated as d δ2h 8δ18o the fig 7 shows the relationship between δ2h and δ18o from the groundwater samples and they show arrangement on the global meteoric water line gmwl given by the equation δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 the local meteoric water line based on the data from iaea given by δ2h 8 08δ18o 12 63 n 132 monthly average from 1961 to 1985 was also plotted together with gmwl it could be noticed that lmwl is very similar to the gmwl and the most groundwater samples have the same trend the most d excess values found in the study area table 2 were 10 these facts corroborate the hypothesis of groundwater recharge for all area considering the granular aquifers the two rainwater samples from november and december 2009 have less fractioning pointing out high evaporation rate of the sampling period 5 discussion regarding the influence of saline intrusion according to igme 2009 in coastal aquifer with natural conditions there is the contact between fresh groundwater and saltwater considering two immiscible solutions which form a transition zone that mix both solutions progressively by diffusion processes the mixing zone can move according to reducing of fresh groundwater flow toward sea and or a variation of the permeability from the aquifers systems according to the lithological heterogeneity tidal frequency and oscillations sanders et al 2012 because it is a transition environment with similar altimetry to sea level and the mangrove area it was assumed significant influence of seawater upon fresh groundwater in p 05 presenting close relationship to the tidal variation which influence the ec values and water table variation in order to verify this relationship the fig 8 show temporal graphs for p 05 and p 01c close to coastline considering the water level and ec it is possible to notice the water level and ec maximum and minimum values in p 05 are well correlated and could be associated to the tidal oscillation the opposite behavior of p 01c showing the p 05 is located on the mixing zone between fresh groundwater and seawater intrusion 5 1 the controlling of ionic behavior through the hydrogeochemical modeling the hydrogeochemical modeling for the studied area was carried out by phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 considering the physicochemical parameters and the saturation index si data from the different aquifers regarding the aquifers chemical and mineralogical composition the chosen minerals for the modeling were calcite dolomite gypsum and halite the carbonate minerals should come from both the seawater influence and weathering reactions from aquifer materials halite could come from the aquifer materials as well as from seawater influence the sulfate salt also could come from both seawater influence and from the sulfuric gas generation by the organic matter decomposition fig 9 examines the behavior among the main physicochemical parameters ec pe and ph and the fig 10 compares these physicochemical parameters with minerals si observing the graphs a and b fig 9 it is possible to notice the well marked behavior of ec in each studied aquifer system namely the fluvial marine aquifer with the highest ec values followed by the alluvial lacustrine aquifer the deep medium and shallow macacu aquifers samples considering all data there is no significant correlation between ec and ph fig 9 graph a however the pe has evident negative correlation with ec and ph fig 9 graphs b and c suggesting oxidation reducing process mainly along the deep macacu aquifer which displays markedly two main groups one with higher pe and lower ph values represented by the well p 02b and other most samples with lower pe and higher ph values p 01 a p 02 a and p 03 a that behavior difference could be due to the influence of a local structure lineament fig 1 close to the location of p 02b which favor groundwater circulation and mixing among porous aquifers even the fractured aquifer in basement rocks conditioning oxidation and dilution processes decreasing of ec and ph values the other group composed by p 01 a p 02 a and p 03 a has no influence from any structure and presents reduced conditions higher ec values probably due to the larger residence time of groundwater triggering the rise of ph values the shallow macacu aquifer samples present low physicochemical parameters variations mainly for ec and ph because of the direct influence of rainwater and the poor composition of the aquifer material the fluvial marine aquifer samples p 05 also presents low oscillations of physicochemical parameters although it has the highest ec values due to the inflow of marine water and low pe because the reduced mangrove environment the relative lower ph values could be explained by the rapid local rainfall see the δ18o content in table 1 which should dilute the groundwater and oxidize the mangrove sediment presence of h2s and microcrystalline pyrite increasing the hydrogen ions concentration ph the medium macacu aquifer samples could be also separated in two groups one with p 04 a samples presenting higher ec and ph values and lower pe ones and the other group with p 01b samples presenting the opposite behavior from p 04 a in this case the behavior difference between the two groups is the influence of residence time on the well p 04 a giving high values of ec and ph and due to the well depth 90 m where it has little water circulation and consequently low pe values the alluvial lacustrine aquifer samples are well represented by all analyzed physicochemical parameters also displaying two main groups the first one with high ph and pe and median ec values p 03b and other with low ph and pe and high ec values p 01c as before commented p 01c should have influence of older coastal sediments salts present in the aquifer materials besides the significant presence of organic matter corroborating the physicochemical parameters behavior at this well while in p 03b located at the basin border has the opposite behavior observing the fig 10 and considering all samples the si for calcite presents the most samples in equilibrium si 0 and in saturation si 0 from deep macacu aquifer showing that significant residence time of groundwater weathering process contributes more than salt intrusion for that mineral formation samples from fluvial marine aquifer presenting the same behavior trend of calcite the si for dolomite also shows most of deep macacu aquifer samples in equilibrium and in saturation with the solution but some samples from medium macacu alluvial lacustrine and fluvial marine aquifers are found close to the equilibrium the si for gypsum displays all samples in undersaturation si 0 with the solution showing few samples of fluvial marine and alluvial lacustrine aquifers a little closer to the equilibrium zone possibly this mineral could get the equilibrium in groundwater closer the coastline higher influence of seawater intrusion it is worth to notice that halite shows the lowest si values among the selected minerals for geochemical modeling all samples undersaturated si 0 the physicochemical parameters behavior in each aquifer body exerts influence on the si behavior of the chosen minerals once more considering all samples it is noticed the ec has moderate positive correlation with si of the four chosen minerals the ph has good positive correlation with only the carbonate minerals while pe has moderate negative correlation with the carbonate minerals as well those si data suggest the carbonate minerals get the equilibrium at high ph and ec and low pe corroborating the geochemical processes described for most samples from deep macacu aquifer and some samples from fluvial marine medium macacu and alluvial lacustrine aquifers in other words the calcite and dolomite will prevail in case of 1 high residence time of groundwater in the aquifer 2 groundwater close to mixing zone of salt wedge 3 presence of older coastal sediments in the aquifer matrix for gypsum only ec has moderate correlation with si highlighting samples of fluvial marine aquifer which are the closer samples to the equilibrium zone for halite it has moderate correlation with ec showing its highest si values associated to the fluvial marine and deep macacu aquifers which wells are located closer to the coast line p 04 and p 05 observing the fig 10 it is possible to notice the increasing of gypsum si in fluvial marine aquifer supporting the hypothesis of gypsum equilibrium under marine influence ayora et al 1995 moreover gypsum tends to reach equilibrium in mangrove environment due to higher sulfate availability as product of mangrove sediments oxidation or present in seawater although the high concentrations of cl in the fluvial marine and deep macacu aquifers the geochemical modeling showed no equilibrium with halite it could be caused by the dilution of seawater encroachment through the great freshwater availability groundwater and surface water and also due to ion exchange of na with clay minerals tertiary and quaternary sediments 5 2 chloride bromide ratios and isotopic approach considering the seawater intrusion is the responsible to affect only fluvial marine aquifer and its ec increasing significant concentrations of cl and na are observed in other aquifers systems and could have the same origin yamanaka et al 2011 therefore the cl br ratio and the stable isotopes data were used in order to establish the salinity origin in the aquifers systems of the macacu sedimentary basin the cl br ratio values cl concentrations and data of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were plotted in graphs fig 11 pointing out 4 different groups regarding the salinization and origin of groundwater 1 group g1 is constituted by recharge waters which have cl br ratio values between 122 and 539 and cl concentrations lesser than 19 mg l 1 concerning the light waters from this group characterized by δ18o ranging from 5 92 and 4 63 δ2h from 36 34 to 27 36 and ec values ranging from 176 to 376 μs cm 1 suggest less evaporated groundwater light isotopes enrichment and relevant input from meteoric water the wells p 02 a p 03 a and p 01 a from deep macacu aquifer and p 01b from medium macacu aquifer represent this group and suggest the most recharge water come from the basin headboard come from the faulting and fracturing structures of basement rocks fractured aquifer 2 surrounding the p 02 the samples of p 02b and p 02c respectively deep and shallow macacu aquifer presenting higher δ18o values between 4 42 and 3 64 higher δ2h values ranging from 22 77 to 26 03 and ec ranging from 71 to 366 μs cm 1 table 2 those data can indicate mixing through vertical flow with high residence time waters from rio vargem member 3 group g2 formed by groundwater with cl br ratio values between 1007 and 1420 and cl concentrations ranging from 122 to 178 mg l 1 represented by multilevel well p 04 which is located on the alluvial lacustrine and macacu aquifers the increase of cl br ratio values in this group is due to the groundwater flow path reaches the rio vargem member from macacu formation which presents brackish water environment sediments davis et al 1998 suggested cl br ratio values between 1000 and 10 000 are associated to groundwater affected by aquifers containing halite besides this fact there is the influence of seawater encroachment justifying the high values for δ18o 0 08 and δ2h 20 28 associated with high ec value 1120 μs cm 1 4 group g3 is constituted by groundwater with low cl br ratio values from 158 to 591 and high cl concentrations from 443 to 573 mg l 1 representing samples collected in the alluvial lacustrine aquifer p 01c the high cl concentrations observed in this well probably be related to in natura domestic sewage releasing in caceribu river on the other hands the high br concentrations could be related to organic matter in shallow aquifers davis et al 1998 this group is characterized by low δ18o values ranging from 5 52 to 5 18 δ2h from 34 15 to 32 53 and ec values from 1564 to 2302 μs cm 1 the ec values and light isotopic ratios corroborates hypothesis about the influence from the caceribu river naturally light isotopes enriched which is broadly impacted by domestic sewage 5 group g4 is formed by groundwater with cl br ratio values between 274 and 595 and cl concentrations ranging from 803 to 1243 mg l 1 this group represents the fluvial marine aquifer from the mangrove area guapimirim epa this region has clayey sediments enriched in organic matter and as well as group g3 also has significant br concentration nevertheless in this area the seawater intrusion preserves high values of cl br ratio this group displays an enrichment in δ18o ranged 4 06 to 3 91 and δ2h values ranged 21 58 to 19 77 and the highest values for ec between 5348 and 5651 μs cm 1 the higher content for δ18o and δ2h in this area is due to the rapid local rainfall and or the mixing of groundwater and seawater intrusion characterizing the groundwater discharge zone 6 conclusion although the relative small area 375 km2 the aquifer system from macacu sedimentary basin presents a wide range of salinity which reflects in diversified geochemical behaviors the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the macacu sedimentary basin is characterized by a gradual evolving from ca hco3 facies in the recharge areas in the basin border toward the crystalline basement to na hco3 facies in the central region and after to na cl facies near the coast line therefore it is evident a ca decrease concomitant to a na increase and it is due to the ionic exchange between groundwater and aquifer matrix this fact is corroborated by the phreeqc modeling which showed that high ph and low pe values conditioning the main processes controlling the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater in that region the groundwater from the study area could be distinguished in four different groups regarding the cl br ratio values which suggests the salinity origin i rapid recharged groundwater which cl br ratio values are similar to rainwater ii discharge area groundwater which are affected by salts dissolution halite from brackish water environment deposits iii groundwater with high cl concentrations and also significant br concentrations due to the influence of organic matter deposits and iv groundwater with highest cl concentrations and highest cl br ratio due to the seawater intrusion based on the hydrodynamics and stable isotopes data the groundwater flow model at macacu basin points out recharge areas on p 01 p 02 and p 03 which represent waters from deep macacu aquifer suggesting different origins and residence times therefore the macacu aquifer system has direct recharge by rainwater as well as by indirect recharge from fractured aquifer crystalline basement causing the mixing among the aquifers systems lastly the basin discharge zone is found in p 04 area and

8453,study region surveys of stable isotopes of water in 121 lakes were conducted between 2007 and 2009 to assist in characterizing baseline hydrology of the south athabasca oil sands area alberta a 35 000 km2 boreal forest region with subdued relief about 70 wetland cover and a mosaic of lakes rivers and buried channel networks the region currently under rapid development for in situ oil sands was close to baseline conditions at the time of survey study focus using an isotope mass balance approach isotope data were applied to estimate water yield to lakes across the region high resolution maps were created to illustrate the spatial distribution of water yield and to compare observed patterns to geologic and physiographic features new hydrological insights for the region site specific differences in water yield were found in relation to geologic and physiographic features notably high water yields were found in lakes underlain by colorado shale lower runoff was found in proximity to incised and buried channels consistent patterns from year to year reveal zones of low runoff which may be more susceptible to development related impacts including changes in surface groundwater interaction and pressurization or depressurization of aquifers or formations the approach may be helpful for informing design of new monitoring programs to ensure runoff variability is considered periodic reassessments are recommended to capture potential development and or climatic change impacts on the water cycle keywords isotopes lakes water balance evaporation runoff boreal oil sands 1 introduction in situ oil sands production in canada currently accounts for over 1 37 million barrels per day with extractable reserves currently estimated at 165 billion barrels capp 2018 about 57 of this production capacity is situated within the south athabasca oil sands area saos alberta 2016 a 35 000 km2 lake and wetland rich boreal forest region situated south of fort mcmurray alberta fig 1 land cover in the saos region is dominated by wetlands including bogs fens and open water numerous lakes and less frequent uplands are also characteristic of the region gibson et al 2015a permanent streams rarely occur upstream of lakes but rather tend to form as drainage channels from lake outlets on the stony mountains shallow recharge and runoff is strongly influenced by the limited infiltration capacity of the cretaceous colorado shale where present both runoff and shallow groundwater flow through overlying quaternary drift tend to be radially or semi radially outwards from the stony mountains topographic high towards incised river channels barson et al 2001 similar patterns are noted for deeper cretaceous formations including the lower grand rapids formation clearwater formation and mcmurray formations with deeper regional flows of saline formation water moving upgradient from southwest to northeast in underlying devonian units barson et al 2001 along incised river valleys including the christina river hangingstone river and house river colorado shale units are absent such that thicker quaternary deposits directly overlie more permeable cretaceous and devonian age sandstones siltstones shales and carbonates allowing for deeper surface groundwater interactions birks et al 2018a in press the occurrence of saline springs and saline groundwater seepage areas in and near the rivers provides evidence of this discharge gibson et al 2013 gue et al 2015 birks et al 2018b bitumen occurs predominantly within the mcmurray formation a poorly cemented sandstone unit which occurs typically at depths exceeding 80 m below surface and that may also serve as an aquitard where it is present a secondary influence on regional groundwater flow patterns is the presence of large buried channels beneath the study area the main ones being the north south trending leismer channel located in the north and the west east trending wiau and christina channels in the central and western portion birks et al 2018a in press these channels have a significant influence on lateral groundwater flow patterns given their comparatively higher hydraulic conductivity and overall draining characteristics but also may affect vertical flow conditions by providing permeable conduits for downward flow into the bedrock formations due to subdued topography and complex hydrological conditions in the region devito et al 2005 suggested that catchment delineation using surface topography may not be entirely representative in some systems particularly for smaller catchments in flat areas dominated by wetlands as principle runoff generating units peatlands can respond variably depending on antecedent moisture condition i e depression storage and vadose zone storage capacities and can behave differently and independently of adjacent hillslopes devito et al 2005 due to difficulties with using conventional hydrometric approaches one important objective of this study was to develop and test new approaches for regional characterization and mapping of important water balance characteristics such as runoff in complex poorly monitored areas because oil sands deposits in the region occur at depths greater than 80 m below surface oil sands production is carried out by in situ methods rather than surface mining mainly using steam assisted gravity drainage sagd techniques this method involves drilling of horizontal well pairs through overburden and confining bedrock layers into the bitumen zone followed by injection of high temperature steam to liquefy viscous bitumen for extraction to the surface alberta 2014 while in situ oil sands development is generally associated with reduced land surface disturbance compared to mining in situ activities may directly affect water levels due to extraction and use of groundwater or may have indirect impacts by pressurization or depressurization of aquifers or formations creation or modification of flow pathways to groundwater or by altering connections between aquifers alberta 2014 water quality may also be affected due to mobilization of metals and organics due to heating or from unlikely release of production fluids or operational upsets alberta 2014 the impact of in situ development on surface water balance and runoff has not been widely discussed but may potentially occur in response to changes in surface groundwater interaction another main objective of this study was to understand potential impacts of in situ oil sands development by establishing conditions prior to widespread implementation and to conduct surveys that would enable future tracking of potential regional impacts over the next few decades a recent isotope mass balance imb assessment of fifty lakes in northeastern alberta by gibson et al 2015a demonstrated that the approach can be an effective at characterizing the long term water balance of lakes including water yield especially useful for site to site comparisons in ungauged basins of these detailed study sites 12 are situated within the saos and have been sampled annually in late summer early fall by the regional aquatics monitoring program since 2002 surface groundwater interactions have also been characterized for one detailed study lake in the area using radon 222 sm8 schmidt et al 2010 notably detailed air photo assessments of land cover were also carried out on these watersheds to rigorously establish wetland classes including permafrost conditions table 1 similar air photo classifications of wetland types are not currently available for the entire saos area for assessment of saos wide water balance conditions similar isotopic surveys were conducted for lakes wetlands and various input water during late summer 2007 2008 and 2009 fig 1 these surveys formed part of a larger water sampling program aimed at characterizing isotopic and geochemical conditions across the saos birks et al 2018a at the time of the surveys the saos region was at an early stage of development for in situ oil sands production 1 of proposed capacity compared to 32 today alberta 2008 2017 but growth was and is is expected to continue to accelerate over the next three decades benchmark surveys included water quality parameters and stable isotopes of water the latter of which provide information on the sources of water in streamflow wetland and lakes and allow for assessment of water balance status in surface water bodies this paper focuses only on describing isotope mass balance for 121 lakes given the large number of lakes sampled across the region it was also possible to determine spatial patterns in runoff that provide additional information on the role of colorado shale and incised and buried channels on runoff across the region establishing conditions at an early stage of development is expected to allow for better assessment of the possible impacts of development on runoff across the region imb has been previously applied to study evaporation inflow water residence times and runoff in the area bennett et al 2008 gibson et al 2010a 2010b a recent review describes application of the imb method gibson et al 2015b while the present study builds upon the methods developed in previous studies it is unique in that it demonstrates high resolution application of the method for mapping of runoff across a 35 000 km2 area which has never before been conducted by sampling in three consecutive years our hypothesis was that change due to development would be minor and that differences between years would be a reflection of interannual runoff variability this is discussed further later on understanding interannual variability in runoff was also considered to be a necessary control if results were eventually to be compared with repeat surveys over a period of several decades in future 2 study sites the saos area is bounded to the west and north by the athabasca and clearwater rivers to the east by the saskatchewan border and to the south by the cold lake beaver river basin fig 1 wide area surveys were selected to establish pre sagd development conditions for lake water balance and runoff but also to ensure geochemical characterization across a representative range of conditions lake areas were used to determine lake classes following an approach similar to henriksen et al 1996 and a representative number of lakes from each size class were selected overall 76 lakes larger than 0 5 km2 were selected with the remainder of lakes ranging from 0 01 to 0 5 km2 drainage basin areas were delineated from a 30 m resolution digital elevation model using arcgis and archydro esri 2008 the lakes are situated predominantly in headwater catchments and range in size from small shallow lakes 1 m depth 0 5km2 to large lakes such as christina lake 17 3 m depth 21 3 km2 mitchell and prepas 1990 and gregoire lake 7 2 m depth 25 8 km2 mitchell and prepas 1990 lakes are underlain by quaternary tills sandstone siltstone shale and carbonates of cretaceous to devonian age many of the lakes are situated in the stony mountains a plateau where the cretaceous colorado shale has weathered dominantly and forms a shallow relatively impervious barrier to vertical groundwater movement land cover in a network of detailed study lakes table 1 fig 1 is considered to be fairly typical of the saos dominated by bog fen open water and upland wetlands occupy 70 of the land area with bogs accounting for about 6 of this total in general bogs occur as slightly elevated platforms with sporadic permafrost often contributing runoff to fens which tend to occupy flatter areas uplands occupy sloping areas bordering streams particularly in the lower elevational ranges a summary of morphometry climate and derived water balance parameters for the detailed study lakes is also included based on a 9 year study presented by gibson et al 2015a table 2 as a similar imb was used this provides important control for the spatial analysis presented here mean annual precipitation across the region ranges from about 560 to 590 mm lake evaporation ranges from 530 to 570 mm and water yield ranges from 70 to 360 mm water residence times for lakes are estimated to range from 4 months to 3 years gibson et al 2015a note that some lakes were found to have water yields in excess of annual precipitation which has been a finding previously attributed to the influence of permafrost melt which has been partially confirmed by results from tritium surveys gibson et al 2016a 3 method 3 1 water sampling and laboratory analysis water samples were collected from float plane or helicopter in 30 ml high density polyethylene bottles with minimal headspace and tightly sealed polypropylene lids to minimize evaporation prior to analysis procedures used for water sampling have been described previously gibson et al 2015a 2010a b for larger lakes accessed by float plane water samples were collected at 0 5 m depth using a kemmerer sampler from near the centre of the lake for lakes sampled by helicopter grab samples were collected at similar depth near the centre of the lake sampling was conducted during early september to early october when larger deeper lakes in the region usually dimictic lakes taranu et al 2010 are expected to be isothermal and therefore well mixed see mitchell and prepas 1990 shallow polymictic lakes also abundant in the area are expected to be continuously well mixed taranu et al 2010 note that use of grab samples to represent the whole water body presumes that the lakes were well mixed and unstratified in any case stratification has been shown to have a limited influence on imb in typical northern alberta lakes gibson et al 2002 in addition to lakes various types of water such as soil water groundwater wetland water and snow were collected and analyzed to provide baseline information for the area wetlands mainly fens were sampled by helicopter along transects from selected lakes water being gathered from open areas by standing on the surface and creating a depression bootwell from which water was collected groundwater was collected by industrial operators from cased wells installed for water supply and or water monitoring of specific aquifers and formations due to significant depth of most industrial wells seasonal variations are expected to be minor soil water from forested soil was collected in summer by digging soil pits to a maximum of 1 m depth moist soil was placed in sealed plastic bags and returned to the laboratory for extraction of soil water by azeotropic distillation using toluene snowpack samples were collected by digging pits and taking a depth integrated sample from a vertical snow face all isotope data were analyzed at the innotech alberta lab in victoria canada within 2 months of collection using a thermo scientific delta v advantage dual inlet system the water sampling containers used have been shown to have hold times of up to one year or more for oxygen 18 and deuterium without refrigeration spangenberg 2012 water samples were analyzed using a gasbench peripheral for oxygen 18 see paul and skrzypek 2006 and an hdevice for deuterium see brand et al 1996 and are reported in δ notation in permil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow results are normalized on the vsmow slap scale standard light arctic precipitation see nelson 2000 routine analytical uncertainty is better than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h all data area reported in gibson et al 2018a in press 3 2 theory isotope mass balance methodology has been described in detail by gibson et al 2015b and has been previously applied in a number of water resources assessments in the region schmidt et al 2010 gibson et al 2010a 2010b gibson et al 2015a across canada and the us arnoux et al 2017 gibson and reid 2014 gibson et al 2016b 2017 gibson et al 2018b brooks et al 2014 jasechko et al 2014 and in europe e g petermann et al 2018 vystavna et al 2018 a brief overview of the technique is presented here annual water loss by evaporation x can be estimated for well mixed lakes in isotopic and hydrologic steady state using 1 x e i δ i δ l δ e δ l dimensionless where i and e are annual lake inflow and evaporation m 3 and δ i δ l and δ e are the isotopic compositions of inflow lake water and evaporation fluxes respectively while inflows and lake water can be characterized by sampling of precipitation and lake water respectively the isotopic composition of evaporate δ e is estimated indirectly based on the craig and gordon 1965 model 2 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where δ a is the isotopic composition of ambient atmospheric vapour h is the relative humidity decimal fraction ε α 1 1000 is the equilibrium isotopic separation α is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation and ε k is the kinetic isotopic separation more details are provided by gibson et al 2015a b substitution of 2 into eq 1

parameterization approaches have been used in the past within the basic theoretical framework presented above to resolve the isotope mass balance for regional assessments for the current application and to be consistent with the method applied for the detailed study lakes table 2 gibson et al 2015a we estimate the isotopic composition of input to the lakes based on the intercept of the edmonton meteoric water line mwl and the local evaporation lines from regression of measured lake data while edmonton is located 350 km south of the saos a recently study at the nearby mildred lake located 43 km north of fort mcmurray proposed a slightly revised local mwl for the area baer et al 2016 use of the mildred amount weighted mwl which has a slightly lower slope and increased intercept with the lel would have resulted in a reduction in water yield by 2 4 for all lakes which is considered to be minor compared to overall uncertainty in the method estimated at 10 15 gibson et al 2005 for consistency with the detailed study lakes approach we elect to present the results based on the edmonton mwl note that the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture is estimated from a partial equilibrium model k 0 4 based on a best fit to the local evaporation line see gibson et al 2015a b petermann et al 2018 a similar atmospheric moisture composition is obtained by assuming equilibrium with average soil water δ 18 o 15 41 δ 2 h 123 9 both approaches converge on representative values for isotopic composition of precipitation and atmospheric moisture during the warm months when evaporative enrichment is occurring such seasonally weighted values have been shown to be more appropriate for isotope balance in cold regions than models assuming isotopic equilibrium with annual precipitation gibson et al 2008 interpolation of monthly climate data from the north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 is used to assemble required estimates of climatological data for each lake site the narr dataset is a long term dynamically consistent high resolution high frequency atmospheric and land surface hydrology dataset for the north american domain this model dataset has a horizontal resolution of 32 km and 45 vertical layers providing a much higher resolution than the global reanalysis datasets firstly monthly and annual open water precipitation and evaporation were estimated for each site and then the latter was used as the basis for calculating evaporation flux weighted values of annual temperature and relative humidity both at 2 m height as described previously by gibson et al 2015a evaporation inflow x was then estimated from eq 3 and water yield was estimated from eq 7 for plotting values for δ which is the limiting isotopic enrichment that a water approaches as volume v 0 were based on eq 5 it is important to note that water yield derived using this approach provides a combined estimate of surface water and groundwater input to the lakes rather than a method for differentiating these quantities finally lake areas la and watershed areas w a were estimated for each sampling site in the arcgis program using the archydro tools where each watershed was delineated upstream of a lake outlet planimetric areas were calculated using equal area projections drainage basin areas see fig 1 were calculated as a residual i e d b a w a l a note that due to low relief in some areas delineation of watersheds may be subject to variable errors while high degree of spatial autocorrelation observed initially suggested that site to site delineation errors are likely not a substantial limitation the water yield data are provided in gibson et al 2018b to permit further geospatial assessment 4 results and discussion 4 1 isotope characteristics isotope data for groundwater soil water snow lakes and wetlands are summarized in fig 2 a b data are also provided in gibson et al 2018a soil water and groundwaters are shown to plot along a line with a slope close to 8 but slightly below the global meteoric water line gmwl δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 of craig 1961 and close to the mwl for edmonton δ 2 h 7 71 δ 18 o 0 03 and the amount weighted mildred lake mwl δ 2h 7 2δ 18o 10 3 which are included for comparison fig 2a lake waters plot along distinct local evaporation lines lel with fairly consistent slopes of between 4 56 and 4 72 from year to year fig 2b which appears to be representative of the saos area wetlands plot close to the lel for lakes but with less overall enrichment presumably due to open water evaporation being less important for wetlands than lakes soil waters are found to be enriched relative to groundwaters and mean annual precipitation fig 2a the latter estimated as the intercept of the edmonton mwl and lel being a useful approximation of long term input to the lakes soil water enrichment in the first metre below surface is likely reflective of summer precipitation sources at the time of sampling but may also reflect some evaporation from soil or depression storage prior to recharge limited sampling from precipitation collectors has been carried out at selected sites in the saos see bennett 2006 tattrie 2011 although samples were evidently affected by evaporation from the sampler and so are not used snowpack samples vallarino 2014 are found to be depleted relative to groundwaters and mean annual precipitation quaternary aquifer quaternary channel and regional formation waters grand rapids formation tend to be more depleted than mean annual precipitation as much of the groundwater system has been significantly recharged by glacial meltwater sources see grasby and chen 2008 under colder climate conditions isotopic signatures were likely significantly depleted relative to mean annual precipitation today for lakes isotopic offset along the lel from the mwl intercept fig 2b has been shown to occur in response to evaporation losses whereby offset is generally proportionate to the fraction of water loss by evaporation from each lake gibson et al 2015a b from maps of isotopic composition in lakes across the saos area fairly consistent enrichment patterns are seen suggesting similar water balance from year to year in most lakes fig 3 mwl intercepts are also fairly similar for year to year lels calculated evaporation inflow and water yield distributions and areal mapping of water yield are presented in the following sections 4 2 evaporation inflow and water yield distributions an overall impression of the distributions of the isotopic data evaporation inflow estimates and water yield are provided in fig 4 similar distributions in isotopic composition and evaporation inflow were found for 2008 and 2009 not shown positively skewed distributions are noted for water yield as found in several previous assessments gibson et al 2010a 2010b 2015a which reflects the tendency for most watersheds to have lower runoff with fewer watersheds being more dynamic we attribute this to poorly organized drainage in vast low relief wetland dominated areas although more dynamic zones may occur along incised streams due to greater relief or presumably in some cases due to buried channels 4 3 water yield water yields fig 5 were found to be distinct from evaporation inflow patterns the latter which closely mimic variation in isotopic composition of lakes across the region fig 3 similar spatial trends in water yield were also noted from year to year in general high water yields are predicted in the stony mountains in the vicinity north and south of gordon lake along the southeasterrn boundary of the saos and to the west of winefred lake fig 1 high water yields also occur in zones between buried channels i e between christina and wiau channel and in the vicinity of leismer channel the high water yield zone mapped for the stony mountains also appears to terminate abruptly at the leismer channel to the east and south which is particularly evident in 2007 and 2009 areas of lower runoff include the christina river and hangingstone river corridors areas characterized by incised river channels extensive tracts of the largest buried channels namely the christina and wiau channels appear to be overlain by lakes with moderate rather than high or low water yield the main conclusion that we reach based on observing the spatial distribution of runoff is that both buried and incised channels appear to play a significant role in determining runoff or water yield and may influence its variability channels likely serve as regional drains that promote vertical seepage rather than lateral flow which can lead to water being directed downward away from lakes in contrast plateaus or uplands especially those underlain by relatively impervious shale tend to promote lateral flow to lakes we find a weak positive relationship between elevation and water yield which varies inter annually fig 6 this pattern does not support simple use of elevation to interpolate runoff to lakes as suggested by some previous studies in the region wrs 2004 water yield to lakes was evidently lower in 2007 compared with 2008 and 2009 as noted by gibson et al 2010a and revealed by the data shown in gibson et al 2015a table 2 2007 is found to be a low runoff year to lakes in the stony mountains as well as most lake sub regions near fort mcmurray 4 4 comparison with gauge data river discharge is routinely monitored at hydrometric gauging stations by water survey of canada and is the standard method for estimating annual water yield while water yield data exist for 7 stations located within or near the saos table 3 only 5 stations record runoff conditions in the saos itself and 3 of these stations have since been discontinued however three stations were operational at the time of the lake surveys including christina river at chard pony river near chard and hangingstone river near the mouth while these are important monitoring stations for both seasonal and long term studies they do not provide a perspective of spatial variations in water yield across the saos water yield values based on the hydrometric gauges in the area ranged from 90 to 170 mm year with a mean of 137 mm year n 3 during 2007 to 2009 in comparison basin average estimates based on imb ranged between 105 and 154 mm year with a similar overall average of 130 mm year bennett et al 2008 also reported good agreement between water yield determined from water survey gauging stations and imb in the fort mcmurray area inter annual variability is also an important characteristic with standard deviation ranging between about 20 and 80 mm year for long term hydrometric gauging which brackets the range observed for imb slightly higher variability may be expected for lakes in the long term due to the typically smaller area of the lake watersheds the median watershed area for the imb assessments being 12 km2 as compared to 54 to 31 000 km2 for hydrometric gauging overall while there is agreement between hydrometric gauging and imb in terms of general magnitude of runoff see 2007 2009 averages table 4 the agreement between the two methods is not as good for the christina river basin as it is for the hangingstone river basin with imb seemingly underestimating christina river basin runoff by roughly 20 given that the christina river basin has a more extensive buried channel network than the hangingstone river basin this underestimation may simply reflect runoff bypass of lakes due to increased infiltration and deeper pathways of water flow via buried channels that connect to the incised channels an important finding is that imb offers a method for high spatial resolution mapping of long term water yield and potentially for monitoring temporal changes over time fig 5 one important consideration is that the temporal signal of imb is expected to be controlled by the residence time of lake water and so is inherently variable from lake to lake across the region note that residence time is estimated to range from 4 month to 3 years in the detailed study lakes where volume was measured taking a closer look at water yield during the study years we note that gauged discharge data measured for the hangingstone and christina rivers does not necessarily follow trends indicated by imb during 2007 to 2009 see table 4 this may suggest that residence time plays a significant role in temporal weighting of the runoff estimates and may potentially invoke a lag effect as well our assessment also reveals that shallower lateral drainage may be prevalent for lakes whereas rivers are expected to include greater input from deep groundwater sources especially where channels are incised previous lake assessments using radon 222 have also shown dominance of shallow peatland drainage to lakes as compared to waters in contact with mineral soils schmidt et al 2010 unpublished river surveys have also revealed significantly higher radon 222 in some river reaches such as the gregoire and christina rivers schmidt pers comm which confirms deeper groundwater contributions conceptually we emphasize that runoff to lakes is measured at different nodes in the hydrological network than water yield to rivers and therefore needs to be regarded as a distinct hydrological flux one that is more meaningful to lake water budgets than river budgets while residence time effects may be a complicating factor in spatial analysis several benefits of the imb perspective on regional runoff are clear i information is site specific ii it can be applied at high resolution ii it offers capability to quantitatively link isotope based monitoring with an underlying hydrologic response and iv it provides a method for observing both climatic and development related changes in hydrological regimes while hydrometric gauging targets response in rivers imb in this application is shown to target lakes although similar models could be applied to rivers provided detailed temporal sampling is carried out to establish the flux weighted isotopic composition of river discharge this has already been partially demonstrated that is for estimating evaporation losses from watersheds and gross primary productivity in previous studies ferguson et al 2007 but the same principles could be applied to estimate water yield 4 5 regional hydrology and implications as demonstrated imb can be used within regional surveys to gain a higher resolution perspective of water yield to lakes than hydrometric gauging alone as well it can help to constrain other hydrological processes such as evaporation loss our results show for example that spatial patterns in water yield are consistent from year to year with the stony mountains plateau an area with relatively thin 50 m thick quaternary tills overlying relatively impermeable colorado group shales being a high water yield zone typical interannual shifts in water yield were lower on the shale substrate plateaus with standard deviation most commonly less than 40 mm year as compared to lower elevation areas including incised valleys ranging upwards to 90 mm year relative stability in runoff on the plateaus is attributed mainly to abundance of bogs and fens in those areas which have a high storage capacity within peat and effectively produce higher runoff and reduce variability one important implication of this study is that areas currently under sagd development along the christina r valley are in an area that is characterized by naturally lower runoff and may therefore be more sensitive to climatic changes or development related changes that might arise from alteration of surface groundwater interaction or pressurization of bedrock formations however these areas are also characterized by higher interannual variability in water yield so confirming the underlying causes of subtle future changes may remain a challenge spatial sampling of stable isotopes of water in lakes and rivers as part of a regional monitoring network may be one way to track potential changes over time and may provide more information on the underlying cause of water cycle variability than hydrometric gauging alone the approach may also provide useful information for selection of detailed monitoring or study sites to ensure representativeness of the range of hydrologic conditions expected across the region in principle similar lake surveys could be practically applied to characterize and monitor runoff variability in other areas of rapid development such as the north athabasca oil sands area cold lake beaver river watershed and peace river region regional surveys of this type have already been applied to the contiguous united states for ecological monitoring brooks et al 2014 and across canada for critical loads assessment see gibson et al 2010a 2010b 2017 gibson et al 2018a sensitivity of the method to uncertainty in watershed delineation in low relief catchments is a problematic issue raised by devito et al 2005 for conducting hydrologic investigations in the boreal plains region which affects imb as well as conventional hydrometric gauging we suggest that this issue may be partially resolved using the imb approach as a greater number of watersheds can be investigated providing a more powerful statistical basis for spatial comparisons for example in table 4 we compare available data for the christina and hangingstone river basins which includes only 3 gauged watersheds as compared to 86 sub catchments using imb estimates which clearly suggests that the latter will have a greater chance to identify anomalies and provide more robust average values 5 conclusions the main finding of this study is that isotope mass balance offers a practical method for characterizing water yield variability to lakes on the boreal plain as demonstrated for the southern athabasca oil sands area a 35 000 km2 region characterized by a mosaic of lakes rivers wetlands and buried channels the current analysis also contributes to better understanding of the regional hydrology demonstrating systematically higher runoff in areas underlain by impermeable shales in contrast to better vertical drainage and hence lower lateral runoff associated with buried and incised channels development of groundwater resources is not likely to directly affect surface groundwater interaction characteristics of lakes in areas such as the stony mountains that are underlain by colorado shale but may be more of an issue for lakes situated along buried or incised channels that communicate more directly with aquifers and deeper groundwater formations indirect impacts such as depressurization or pressurization of confined aquifers may still be influential both on the stony mountains along the christina river valley and adjacent areas waste disposal thermal heating of aquifer material and potential escape of steam and or contaminated water to surface and or buried channels remain important development risks particularly in corridors of rapid development the main limitation of the imb technique is that both spatial and temporal water yield footprints are inherently different for each lake as determined mainly by the lake residence time and cannot be easily adjusted to obtain higher frequency outputs while differences in spatial footprint of watersheds is a familiar concept for hydrologists the consequences of using a long term residence time weighted signal is perhaps less intuitive nevertheless a long term perspective of water yield variations across the region is expected to be of particular value for design of monitoring networks to ensure that both high and low runoff areas are characterized ongoing work includes a complete geochemical

8453,study region surveys of stable isotopes of water in 121 lakes were conducted between 2007 and 2009 to assist in characterizing baseline hydrology of the south athabasca oil sands area alberta a 35 000 km2 boreal forest region with subdued relief about 70 wetland cover and a mosaic of lakes rivers and buried channel networks the region currently under rapid development for in situ oil sands was close to baseline conditions at the time of survey study focus using an isotope mass balance approach isotope data were applied to estimate water yield to lakes across the region high resolution maps were created to illustrate the spatial distribution of water yield and to compare observed patterns to geologic and physiographic features new hydrological insights for the region site specific differences in water yield were found in relation to geologic and physiographic features notably high water yields were found in lakes underlain by colorado shale lower runoff was found in proximity to incised and buried channels consistent patterns from year to year reveal zones of low runoff which may be more susceptible to development related impacts including changes in surface groundwater interaction and pressurization or depressurization of aquifers or formations the approach may be helpful for informing design of new monitoring programs to ensure runoff variability is considered periodic reassessments are recommended to capture potential development and or climatic change impacts on the water cycle keywords isotopes lakes water balance evaporation runoff boreal oil sands 1 introduction in situ oil sands production in canada currently accounts for over 1 37 million barrels per day with extractable reserves currently estimated at 165 billion barrels capp 2018 about 57 of this production capacity is situated within the south athabasca oil sands area saos alberta 2016 a 35 000 km2 lake and wetland rich boreal forest region situated south of fort mcmurray alberta fig 1 land cover in the saos region is dominated by wetlands including bogs fens and open water numerous lakes and less frequent uplands are also characteristic of the region gibson et al 2015a permanent streams rarely occur upstream of lakes but rather tend to form as drainage channels from lake outlets on the stony mountains shallow recharge and runoff is strongly influenced by the limited infiltration capacity of the cretaceous colorado shale where present both runoff and shallow groundwater flow through overlying quaternary drift tend to be radially or semi radially outwards from the stony mountains topographic high towards incised river channels barson et al 2001 similar patterns are noted for deeper cretaceous formations including the lower grand rapids formation clearwater formation and mcmurray formations with deeper regional flows of saline formation water moving upgradient from southwest to northeast in underlying devonian units barson et al 2001 along incised river valleys including the christina river hangingstone river and house river colorado shale units are absent such that thicker quaternary deposits directly overlie more permeable cretaceous and devonian age sandstones siltstones shales and carbonates allowing for deeper surface groundwater interactions birks et al 2018a in press the occurrence of saline springs and saline groundwater seepage areas in and near the rivers provides evidence of this discharge gibson et al 2013 gue et al 2015 birks et al 2018b bitumen occurs predominantly within the mcmurray formation a poorly cemented sandstone unit which occurs typically at depths exceeding 80 m below surface and that may also serve as an aquitard where it is present a secondary influence on regional groundwater flow patterns is the presence of large buried channels beneath the study area the main ones being the north south trending leismer channel located in the north and the west east trending wiau and christina channels in the central and western portion birks et al 2018a in press these channels have a significant influence on lateral groundwater flow patterns given their comparatively higher hydraulic conductivity and overall draining characteristics but also may affect vertical flow conditions by providing permeable conduits for downward flow into the bedrock formations due to subdued topography and complex hydrological conditions in the region devito et al 2005 suggested that catchment delineation using surface topography may not be entirely representative in some systems particularly for smaller catchments in flat areas dominated by wetlands as principle runoff generating units peatlands can respond variably depending on antecedent moisture condition i e depression storage and vadose zone storage capacities and can behave differently and independently of adjacent hillslopes devito et al 2005 due to difficulties with using conventional hydrometric approaches one important objective of this study was to develop and test new approaches for regional characterization and mapping of important water balance characteristics such as runoff in complex poorly monitored areas because oil sands deposits in the region occur at depths greater than 80 m below surface oil sands production is carried out by in situ methods rather than surface mining mainly using steam assisted gravity drainage sagd techniques this method involves drilling of horizontal well pairs through overburden and confining bedrock layers into the bitumen zone followed by injection of high temperature steam to liquefy viscous bitumen for extraction to the surface alberta 2014 while in situ oil sands development is generally associated with reduced land surface disturbance compared to mining in situ activities may directly affect water levels due to extraction and use of groundwater or may have indirect impacts by pressurization or depressurization of aquifers or formations creation or modification of flow pathways to groundwater or by altering connections between aquifers alberta 2014 water quality may also be affected due to mobilization of metals and organics due to heating or from unlikely release of production fluids or operational upsets alberta 2014 the impact of in situ development on surface water balance and runoff has not been widely discussed but may potentially occur in response to changes in surface groundwater interaction another main objective of this study was to understand potential impacts of in situ oil sands development by establishing conditions prior to widespread implementation and to conduct surveys that would enable future tracking of potential regional impacts over the next few decades a recent isotope mass balance imb assessment of fifty lakes in northeastern alberta by gibson et al 2015a demonstrated that the approach can be an effective at characterizing the long term water balance of lakes including water yield especially useful for site to site comparisons in ungauged basins of these detailed study sites 12 are situated within the saos and have been sampled annually in late summer early fall by the regional aquatics monitoring program since 2002 surface groundwater interactions have also been characterized for one detailed study lake in the area using radon 222 sm8 schmidt et al 2010 notably detailed air photo assessments of land cover were also carried out on these watersheds to rigorously establish wetland classes including permafrost conditions table 1 similar air photo classifications of wetland types are not currently available for the entire saos area for assessment of saos wide water balance conditions similar isotopic surveys were conducted for lakes wetlands and various input water during late summer 2007 2008 and 2009 fig 1 these surveys formed part of a larger water sampling program aimed at characterizing isotopic and geochemical conditions across the saos birks et al 2018a at the time of the surveys the saos region was at an early stage of development for in situ oil sands production 1 of proposed capacity compared to 32 today alberta 2008 2017 but growth was and is is expected to continue to accelerate over the next three decades benchmark surveys included water quality parameters and stable isotopes of water the latter of which provide information on the sources of water in streamflow wetland and lakes and allow for assessment of water balance status in surface water bodies this paper focuses only on describing isotope mass balance for 121 lakes given the large number of lakes sampled across the region it was also possible to determine spatial patterns in runoff that provide additional information on the role of colorado shale and incised and buried channels on runoff across the region establishing conditions at an early stage of development is expected to allow for better assessment of the possible impacts of development on runoff across the region imb has been previously applied to study evaporation inflow water residence times and runoff in the area bennett et al 2008 gibson et al 2010a 2010b a recent review describes application of the imb method gibson et al 2015b while the present study builds upon the methods developed in previous studies it is unique in that it demonstrates high resolution application of the method for mapping of runoff across a 35 000 km2 area which has never before been conducted by sampling in three consecutive years our hypothesis was that change due to development would be minor and that differences between years would be a reflection of interannual runoff variability this is discussed further later on understanding interannual variability in runoff was also considered to be a necessary control if results were eventually to be compared with repeat surveys over a period of several decades in future 2 study sites the saos area is bounded to the west and north by the athabasca and clearwater rivers to the east by the saskatchewan border and to the south by the cold lake beaver river basin fig 1 wide area surveys were selected to establish pre sagd development conditions for lake water balance and runoff but also to ensure geochemical characterization across a representative range of conditions lake areas were used to determine lake classes following an approach similar to henriksen et al 1996 and a representative number of lakes from each size class were selected overall 76 lakes larger than 0 5 km2 were selected with the remainder of lakes ranging from 0 01 to 0 5 km2 drainage basin areas were delineated from a 30 m resolution digital elevation model using arcgis and archydro esri 2008 the lakes are situated predominantly in headwater catchments and range in size from small shallow lakes 1 m depth 0 5km2 to large lakes such as christina lake 17 3 m depth 21 3 km2 mitchell and prepas 1990 and gregoire lake 7 2 m depth 25 8 km2 mitchell and prepas 1990 lakes are underlain by quaternary tills sandstone siltstone shale and carbonates of cretaceous to devonian age many of the lakes are situated in the stony mountains a plateau where the cretaceous colorado shale has weathered dominantly and forms a shallow relatively impervious barrier to vertical groundwater movement land cover in a network of detailed study lakes table 1 fig 1 is considered to be fairly typical of the saos dominated by bog fen open water and upland wetlands occupy 70 of the land area with bogs accounting for about 6 of this total in general bogs occur as slightly elevated platforms with sporadic permafrost often contributing runoff to fens which tend to occupy flatter areas uplands occupy sloping areas bordering streams particularly in the lower elevational ranges a summary of morphometry climate and derived water balance parameters for the detailed study lakes is also included based on a 9 year study presented by gibson et al 2015a table 2 as a similar imb was used this provides important control for the spatial analysis presented here mean annual precipitation across the region ranges from about 560 to 590 mm lake evaporation ranges from 530 to 570 mm and water yield ranges from 70 to 360 mm water residence times for lakes are estimated to range from 4 months to 3 years gibson et al 2015a note that some lakes were found to have water yields in excess of annual precipitation which has been a finding previously attributed to the influence of permafrost melt which has been partially confirmed by results from tritium surveys gibson et al 2016a 3 method 3 1 water sampling and laboratory analysis water samples were collected from float plane or helicopter in 30 ml high density polyethylene bottles with minimal headspace and tightly sealed polypropylene lids to minimize evaporation prior to analysis procedures used for water sampling have been described previously gibson et al 2015a 2010a b for larger lakes accessed by float plane water samples were collected at 0 5 m depth using a kemmerer sampler from near the centre of the lake for lakes sampled by helicopter grab samples were collected at similar depth near the centre of the lake sampling was conducted during early september to early october when larger deeper lakes in the region usually dimictic lakes taranu et al 2010 are expected to be isothermal and therefore well mixed see mitchell and prepas 1990 shallow polymictic lakes also abundant in the area are expected to be continuously well mixed taranu et al 2010 note that use of grab samples to represent the whole water body presumes that the lakes were well mixed and unstratified in any case stratification has been shown to have a limited influence on imb in typical northern alberta lakes gibson et al 2002 in addition to lakes various types of water such as soil water groundwater wetland water and snow were collected and analyzed to provide baseline information for the area wetlands mainly fens were sampled by helicopter along transects from selected lakes water being gathered from open areas by standing on the surface and creating a depression bootwell from which water was collected groundwater was collected by industrial operators from cased wells installed for water supply and or water monitoring of specific aquifers and formations due to significant depth of most industrial wells seasonal variations are expected to be minor soil water from forested soil was collected in summer by digging soil pits to a maximum of 1 m depth moist soil was placed in sealed plastic bags and returned to the laboratory for extraction of soil water by azeotropic distillation using toluene snowpack samples were collected by digging pits and taking a depth integrated sample from a vertical snow face all isotope data were analyzed at the innotech alberta lab in victoria canada within 2 months of collection using a thermo scientific delta v advantage dual inlet system the water sampling containers used have been shown to have hold times of up to one year or more for oxygen 18 and deuterium without refrigeration spangenberg 2012 water samples were analyzed using a gasbench peripheral for oxygen 18 see paul and skrzypek 2006 and an hdevice for deuterium see brand et al 1996 and are reported in δ notation in permil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow results are normalized on the vsmow slap scale standard light arctic precipitation see nelson 2000 routine analytical uncertainty is better than 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h all data area reported in gibson et al 2018a in press 3 2 theory isotope mass balance methodology has been described in detail by gibson et al 2015b and has been previously applied in a number of water resources assessments in the region schmidt et al 2010 gibson et al 2010a 2010b gibson et al 2015a across canada and the us arnoux et al 2017 gibson and reid 2014 gibson et al 2016b 2017 gibson et al 2018b brooks et al 2014 jasechko et al 2014 and in europe e g petermann et al 2018 vystavna et al 2018 a brief overview of the technique is presented here annual water loss by evaporation x can be estimated for well mixed lakes in isotopic and hydrologic steady state using 1 x e i δ i δ l δ e δ l dimensionless where i and e are annual lake inflow and evaporation m 3 and δ i δ l and δ e are the isotopic compositions of inflow lake water and evaporation fluxes respectively while inflows and lake water can be characterized by sampling of precipitation and lake water respectively the isotopic composition of evaporate δ e is estimated indirectly based on the craig and gordon 1965 model 2 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where δ a is the isotopic composition of ambient atmospheric vapour h is the relative humidity decimal fraction ε α 1 1000 is the equilibrium isotopic separation α is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation and ε k is the kinetic isotopic separation more details are provided by gibson et al 2015a b substitution of 2 into eq 1

lake area m 2 annual depth of runoff a k a water yield can then calculated as 7 w y r d b a 1000 m m year where d b a is drainage basin area 3 3 model parameterization and assumptions several parameterization approaches have been used in the past within the basic theoretical framework presented above to resolve the isotope mass balance for regional assessments for the current application and to be consistent with the method applied for the detailed study lakes table 2 gibson et al 2015a we estimate the isotopic composition of input to the lakes based on the intercept of the edmonton meteoric water line mwl and the local evaporation lines from regression of measured lake data while edmonton is located 350 km south of the saos a recently study at the nearby mildred lake located 43 km north of fort mcmurray proposed a slightly revised local mwl for the area baer et al 2016 use of the mildred amount weighted mwl which has a slightly lower slope and increased intercept with the lel would have resulted in a reduction in water yield by 2 4 for all lakes which is considered to be minor compared to overall uncertainty in the method estimated at 10 15 gibson et al 2005 for consistency with the detailed study lakes approach we elect to present the results based on the edmonton mwl note that the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture is estimated from a partial equilibrium model k 0 4 based on a best fit to the local evaporation line see gibson et al 2015a b petermann et al 2018 a similar atmospheric moisture composition is obtained by assuming equilibrium with average soil water δ 18 o 15 41 δ 2 h 123 9 both approaches converge on representative values for isotopic composition of precipitation and atmospheric moisture during the warm months when evaporative enrichment is occurring such seasonally weighted values have been shown to be more appropriate for isotope balance in cold regions than models assuming isotopic equilibrium with annual precipitation gibson et al 2008 interpolation of monthly climate data from the north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 is used to assemble required estimates of climatological data for each lake site the narr dataset is a long term dynamically consistent high resolution high frequency atmospheric and land surface hydrology dataset for the north american domain this model dataset has a horizontal resolution of 32 km and 45 vertical layers providing a much higher resolution than the global reanalysis datasets firstly monthly and annual open water precipitation and evaporation were estimated for each site and then the latter was used as the basis for calculating evaporation flux weighted values of annual temperature and relative humidity both at 2 m height as described previously by gibson et al 2015a evaporation inflow x was then estimated from eq 3 and water yield was estimated from eq 7 for plotting values for δ which is the limiting isotopic enrichment that a water approaches as volume v 0 were based on eq 5 it is important to note that water yield derived using this approach provides a combined estimate of surface water and groundwater input to the lakes rather than a method for differentiating these quantities finally lake areas la and watershed areas w a were estimated for each sampling site in the arcgis program using the archydro tools where each watershed was delineated upstream of a lake outlet planimetric areas were calculated using equal area projections drainage basin areas see fig 1 were calculated as a residual i e d b a w a l a note that due to low relief in some areas delineation of watersheds may be subject to variable errors while high degree of spatial autocorrelation observed initially suggested that site to site delineation errors are likely not a substantial limitation the water yield data are provided in gibson et al 2018b to permit further geospatial assessment 4 results and discussion 4 1 isotope characteristics isotope data for groundwater soil water snow lakes and wetlands are summarized in fig 2 a b data are also provided in gibson et al 2018a soil water and groundwaters are shown to plot along a line with a slope close to 8 but slightly below the global meteoric water line gmwl δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 of craig 1961 and close to the mwl for edmonton δ 2 h 7 71 δ 18 o 0 03 and the amount weighted mildred lake mwl δ 2h 7 2δ 18o 10 3 which are included for comparison fig 2a lake waters plot along distinct local evaporation lines lel with fairly consistent slopes of between 4 56 and 4 72 from year to year fig 2b which appears to be representative of the saos area wetlands plot close to the lel for lakes but with less overall enrichment presumably due to open water evaporation being less important for wetlands than lakes soil waters are found to be enriched relative to groundwaters and mean annual precipitation fig 2a the latter estimated as the intercept of the edmonton mwl and lel being a useful approximation of long term input to the lakes soil water enrichment in the first metre below surface is likely reflective of summer precipitation sources at the time of sampling but may also reflect some evaporation from soil or depression storage prior to recharge limited sampling from precipitation collectors has been carried out at selected sites in the saos see bennett 2006 tattrie 2011 although samples were evidently affected by evaporation from the sampler and so are not used snowpack samples vallarino 2014 are found to be depleted relative to groundwaters and mean annual precipitation quaternary aquifer quaternary channel and regional formation waters grand rapids formation tend to be more depleted than mean annual precipitation as much of the groundwater system has been significantly recharged by glacial meltwater sources see grasby and chen 2008 under colder climate conditions isotopic signatures were likely significantly depleted relative to mean annual precipitation today for lakes isotopic offset along the lel from the mwl intercept fig 2b has been shown to occur in response to evaporation losses whereby offset is generally proportionate to the fraction of water loss by evaporation from each lake gibson et al 2015a b from maps of isotopic composition in lakes across the saos area fairly consistent enrichment patterns are seen suggesting similar water balance from year to year in most lakes fig 3 mwl intercepts are also fairly similar for year to year lels calculated evaporation inflow and water yield distributions and areal mapping of water yield are presented in the following sections 4 2 evaporation inflow and water yield distributions an overall impression of the distributions of the isotopic data evaporation inflow estimates and water yield are provided in fig 4 similar distributions in isotopic composition and evaporation inflow were found for 2008 and 2009 not shown positively skewed distributions are noted for water yield as found in several previous assessments gibson et al 2010a 2010b 2015a which reflects the tendency for most watersheds to have lower runoff with fewer watersheds being more dynamic we attribute this to poorly organized drainage in vast low relief wetland dominated areas although more dynamic zones may occur along incised streams due to greater relief or presumably in some cases due to buried channels 4 3 water yield water yields fig 5 were found to be distinct from evaporation inflow patterns the latter which closely mimic variation in isotopic composition of lakes across the region fig 3 similar spatial trends in water yield were also noted from year to year in general high water yields are predicted in the stony mountains in the vicinity north and south of gordon lake along the southeasterrn boundary of the saos and to the west of winefred lake fig 1 high water yields also occur in zones between buried channels i e between christina and wiau channel and in the vicinity of leismer channel the high water yield zone mapped for the stony mountains also appears to terminate abruptly at the leismer channel to the east and south which is particularly evident in 2007 and 2009 areas of lower runoff include the christina river and hangingstone river corridors areas characterized by incised river channels extensive tracts of the largest buried channels namely the christina and wiau channels appear to be overlain by lakes with moderate rather than high or low water yield the main conclusion that we reach based on observing the spatial distribution of runoff is that both buried and incised channels appear to play a significant role in determining runoff or water yield and may influence its variability channels likely serve as regional drains that promote vertical seepage rather than lateral flow which can lead to water being directed downward away from lakes in contrast plateaus or uplands especially those underlain by relatively impervious shale tend to promote lateral flow to lakes we find a weak positive relationship between elevation and water yield which varies inter annually fig 6 this pattern does not support simple use of elevation to interpolate runoff to lakes as suggested by some previous studies in the region wrs 2004 water yield to lakes was evidently lower in 2007 compared with 2008 and 2009 as noted by gibson et al 2010a and revealed by the data shown in gibson et al 2015a table 2 2007 is found to be a low runoff year to lakes in the stony mountains as well as most lake sub regions near fort mcmurray 4 4 comparison with gauge data river discharge is routinely monitored at hydrometric gauging stations by water survey of canada and is the standard method for estimating annual water yield while water yield data exist for 7 stations located within or near the saos table 3 only 5 stations record runoff conditions in the saos itself and 3 of these stations have since been discontinued however three stations were operational at the time of the lake surveys including christina river at chard pony river near chard and hangingstone river near the mouth while these are important monitoring stations for both seasonal and long term studies they do not provide a perspective of spatial variations in water yield across the saos water yield values based on the hydrometric gauges in the area ranged from 90 to 170 mm year with a mean of 137 mm year n 3 during 2007 to 2009 in comparison basin average estimates based on imb ranged between 105 and 154 mm year with a similar overall average of 130 mm year bennett et al 2008 also reported good agreement between water yield determined from water survey gauging stations and imb in the fort mcmurray area inter annual variability is also an important characteristic with standard deviation ranging between about 20 and 80 mm year for long term hydrometric gauging which brackets the range observed for imb slightly higher variability may be expected for lakes in the long term due to the typically smaller area of the lake watersheds the median watershed area for the imb assessments being 12 km2 as compared to 54 to 31 000 km2 for hydrometric gauging overall while there is agreement between hydrometric gauging and imb in terms of general magnitude of runoff see 2007 2009 averages table 4 the agreement between the two methods is not as good for the christina river basin as it is for the hangingstone river basin with imb seemingly underestimating christina river basin runoff by roughly 20 given that the christina river basin has a more extensive buried channel network than the hangingstone river basin this underestimation may simply reflect runoff bypass of lakes due to increased infiltration and deeper pathways of water flow via buried channels that connect to the incised channels an important finding is that imb offers a method for high spatial resolution mapping of long term water yield and potentially for monitoring temporal changes over time fig 5 one important consideration is that the temporal signal of imb is expected to be controlled by the residence time of lake water and so is inherently variable from lake to lake across the region note that residence time is estimated to range from 4 month to 3 years in the detailed study lakes where volume was measured taking a closer look at water yield during the study years we note that gauged discharge data measured for the hangingstone and christina rivers does not necessarily follow trends indicated by imb during 2007 to 2009 see table 4 this may suggest that residence time plays a significant role in temporal weighting of the runoff estimates and may potentially invoke a lag effect as well our assessment also reveals that shallower lateral drainage may be prevalent for lakes whereas rivers are expected to include greater input from deep groundwater sources especially where channels are incised previous lake assessments using radon 222 have also shown dominance of shallow peatland drainage to lakes as compared to waters in contact with mineral soils schmidt et al 2010 unpublished river surveys have also revealed significantly higher radon 222 in some river reaches such as the gregoire and christina rivers schmidt pers comm which confirms deeper groundwater contributions conceptually we emphasize that runoff to lakes is measured at different nodes in the hydrological network than water yield to rivers and therefore needs to be regarded as a distinct hydrological flux one that is more meaningful to lake water budgets than river budgets while residence time effects may be a complicating factor in spatial analysis several benefits of the imb perspective on regional runoff are clear i information is site specific ii it can be applied at high resolution ii it offers capability to quantitatively link isotope based monitoring with an underlying hydrologic response and iv it provides a method for observing both climatic and development related changes in hydrological regimes while hydrometric gauging targets response in rivers imb in this application is shown to target lakes although similar models could be applied to rivers provided detailed temporal sampling is carried out to establish the flux weighted isotopic composition of river discharge this has already been partially demonstrated that is for estimating evaporation losses from watersheds and gross primary productivity in previous studies ferguson et al 2007 but the same principles could be applied to estimate water yield 4 5 regional hydrology and implications as demonstrated imb can be used within regional surveys to gain a higher resolution perspective of water yield to lakes than hydrometric gauging alone as well it can help to constrain other hydrological processes such as evaporation loss our results show for example that spatial patterns in water yield are consistent from year to year with the stony mountains plateau an area with relatively thin 50 m thick quaternary tills overlying relatively impermeable colorado group shales being a high water yield zone typical interannual shifts in water yield were lower on the shale substrate plateaus with standard deviation most commonly less than 40 mm year as compared to lower elevation areas including incised valleys ranging upwards to 90 mm year relative stability in runoff on the plateaus is attributed mainly to abundance of bogs and fens in those areas which have a high storage capacity within peat and effectively produce higher runoff and reduce variability one important implication of this study is that areas currently under sagd development along the christina r valley are in an area that is characterized by naturally lower runoff and may therefore be more sensitive to climatic changes or development related changes that might arise from alteration of surface groundwater interaction or pressurization of bedrock formations however these areas are also characterized by higher interannual variability in water yield so confirming the underlying causes of subtle future changes may remain a challenge spatial sampling of stable isotopes of water in lakes and rivers as part of a regional monitoring network may be one way to track potential changes over time and may provide more information on the underlying cause of water cycle variability than hydrometric gauging alone the approach may also provide useful information for selection of detailed monitoring or study sites to ensure representativeness of the range of hydrologic conditions expected across the region in principle similar lake surveys could be practically applied to characterize and monitor runoff variability in other areas of rapid development such as the north athabasca oil sands area cold lake beaver river watershed and peace river region regional surveys of this type have already been applied to the contiguous united states for ecological monitoring brooks et al 2014 and across canada for critical loads assessment see gibson et al 2010a 2010b 2017 gibson et al 2018a sensitivity of the method to uncertainty in watershed delineation in low relief catchments is a problematic issue raised by devito et al 2005 for conducting hydrologic investigations in the boreal plains region which affects imb as well as conventional hydrometric gauging we suggest that this issue may be partially resolved using the imb approach as a greater number of watersheds can be investigated providing a more powerful statistical basis for spatial comparisons for example in table 4 we compare available data for the christina and hangingstone river basins which includes only 3 gauged watersheds as compared to 86 sub catchments using imb estimates which clearly suggests that the latter will have a greater chance to identify anomalies and provide more robust average values 5 conclusions the main finding of this study is that isotope mass balance offers a practical method for characterizing water yield variability to lakes on the boreal plain as demonstrated for the southern athabasca oil sands area a 35 000 km2 region characterized by a mosaic of lakes rivers wetlands and buried channels the current analysis also contributes to better understanding of the regional hydrology demonstrating systematically higher runoff in areas underlain by impermeable shales in contrast to better vertical drainage and hence lower lateral runoff associated with buried and incised channels development of groundwater resources is not likely to directly affect surface groundwater interaction characteristics of lakes in areas such as the stony mountains that are underlain by colorado shale but may be more of an issue for lakes situated along buried or incised channels that communicate more directly with aquifers and deeper groundwater formations indirect impacts such as depressurization or pressurization of confined aquifers may still be influential both on the stony mountains along the christina river valley and adjacent areas waste disposal thermal heating of aquifer material and potential escape of steam and or contaminated water to surface and or buried channels remain important development risks particularly in corridors of rapid development the main limitation of the imb technique is that both spatial and temporal water yield footprints are inherently different for each lake as determined mainly by the lake residence time and cannot be easily adjusted to obtain higher frequency outputs while differences in spatial footprint of watersheds is a familiar concept for hydrologists the consequences of using a long term residence time weighted signal is perhaps less intuitive nevertheless a long term perspective of water yield variations across the region is expected to be of particular value for design of monitoring networks to ensure that both high and low runoff areas are characterized ongoing work includes a complete geochemical assessment of lakes wetlands and rivers across the region recommended future activities include repeat surveys of isotopic and geochemical tracers that may be helpful for determining the extent of

8454,soil moisture is the key parameter that governs the partitioning of the mass and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere through its influence on surface evaporation runoff albedo and emissivity therefore accurate quantification of soil moisture is critical in the study of the soil plant atmosphere continuum as well as in hydrology and climate change studies however soil moisture remains a challenging hydrometeorological variable to monitor and interpret over high temporal and spatial resolution the cost of setting up operating and maintaining dense soil moisture networks across different agro climatic zones of the african regions is currently financially unattainable due to high competition for resources consequently soil moisture is often estimated indirectly using both remote sensing and hydrological models which provide periodic updates and valuable estimates at lower cost over african continent thus far in recent years huge efforts have been undertaken to install in situ soil moisture monitoring networks to support the satellite retrievals satellite product improvement and modelling in africa however the lack of large and representative in situ soil moisture monitoring networks across different agro climatic zones of the african regions still hinders evaluation and verification of the most promising remote sensing products and hydrological models to estimate soil moisture consequently the need for accurate and continuous real time in situ soil moisture measurements covering a wide range of agro climatic zones of the african continent is indisputable keywords calibration in situ measurements modelling remote sensing validation 1 introduction the high temporal and spatial variability of rainfall that is mostly sporadic and erratic makes the african continent vulnerable to droughts and floods van vuuren 2015 davis and vincent 2017 sonwa et al 2017 therefore insufficient and highly variable rainfall is a serious limitation to agricultural production causing low yields and even crop failure in rainfed farming systems calzadilla et al 2014 moeletsi and walker 2013 climate change models consistently predict increased incidence of droughts and floods across different regions of africa ipcc 2014 climate change will potentially affect the livelihood of the majority smallholder farmers in africa who are highly depended on rain fed agricultural production and have limited adaptation capacity as a result of financial constraints ipcc 2014 consequently the frequent occurrence of droughts and floods posed by climate change threaten the food security and livelihood of the smallholder farmers in africa soil moisture storage is the main water source for plants between rainfall events affecting crop yields brocca et al 2017 farm management decisions such as timing of planting fertilizer application pesticides herbicides and irrigation scheduling are all influenced by the soil moisture status pegram et al 2010 chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 soil moisture governs the partitioning of the mass and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere through its influence on surface evaporation runoff reflectivity and emissivity coefficients brocca et al 2017 everson et al 2017 it is also a significant parameter for weather prediction flood forecasting and drought assessment shang et al 2007 pegram et al 2010 sinclair and pegram 2010 thus soil moisture is a critical indicator parameter for weather induced risks associated with climate change the need for accurate and real time soil moisture estimates covering a wide range of agro climatic zones is becoming more urgent for early warning systems to support efficient drought management agricultural productivity and floods forecasting in africa within the context of climate change pegram et al 2010 seneviratne et al 2010 everson et al 2017 remote sensing and hydrological models provide a unique opportunity for continuous monitoring of valuable soil moisture estimates over high spatial resolution at lower cost mengistu et al 2014 however both remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates are often used without proper validation as a result of the lack of high temporal and spatial in situ measurements in africa and the results are considered questionable everson et al 2017 in the recent years huge efforts were made to support the calibration and validation of remote sensing products and hydrological models and to improve understanding temporal and spatial of soil moisture across the african regions since the beginning of the millennium various african research teams in collaboration with international space agencies have put some effort into investing in the development and expansion of in situ monitoring networks for the long term measurement of soil moisture in africa lebel et al 2009 moeletsi et al 2009 pegram et al 2010 everson et al 2017 several studies were also undertaken to validate and improve the indirect estimation of soil moisture in africa mengistu et al 2014 louvet et al 2015 colliander et al 2017 everson et al 2017 however very few if any studies that have extensively and explicitly reviewed the progress made in soil moisture estimation challenges faced and the novel opportunities in the african continent thus far therefore the main aim of this paper is to provide the present status of soil moisture estimation in the african continent and to identify the commonalities and gaps in the literature firstly we review the theory advantages as well as the limitations of the key techniques that have been extensively used to estimate soil moisture in the african continent secondly we review the evolution of soil moisture estimation in this continent finally the major challenges and the novel opportunities that would be important to address in future investigations are discussed 2 methodology scientific databases such as google scholar sciencedirect and web of science were searched using

most difficult hydrometeorological variable to monitor and interpret as a results of its inherent temporal and spatial variability associated with variations in soil properties landscape and vegetation cover brocca et al 2012 romano 2014 brocca et al 2017 everson et al 2017 the numerous techniques that have been employed to estimate soil moisture in the african continent over the past 40 years can be broadly divided into three categories in situ soil measurements remote sensing and modelling techniques vather et al 2018 the choice of the technique used to estimate soil moisture is highly dependent on the application cost and data input dobriyal et al 2012 3 1 in situ measurement techniques in situ measurement techniques range from conventional methods such as gravimetric nuclear and capacitance to wireless sensors such as cosmic ray probes crp and geophysical measurements walker et al 2004 dobriyal et al 2012 romano 2014 su et al 2014 brocca et al 2017 gravimetric method of klute 1986 involves the collection of soil samples at specific locations and depths known volume and weight of the collected soil samples are oven dried at 105 c for 24 to 72 h and re weighed to determine the weight loss walker et al 2004 the gravimetric soil moisture is then calculated by dividing the mass of water by the mass of dry soil klute 1986 later volumetric soil water content could be derived using the relationship between the gravimetric soil moisture and measured bulk density klute 1986 gravimetric method is the most accurate independent of soil type cost effective and easy in situ measurement approach of estimating soil moisture and is often used as a standard procedure against which other methods are compared walker et al 2004 gebregiorgis and savage 2006 brocca et al 2017 everson et al 2017 however this approach is destructive in nature and cannot be used to track changes in soil moisture over time at the same location walker et al 2004 shang et al 2007 brocca et al 2017 for decades the nuclear sensors have been considered as an alternative to gravimetric method for in situ measurements of moisture content as a result of its accuracy and reliability in making non destructive soil moisture profile measurements walker et al 2004 brocca et al 2017 according to walker et al 2004 nuclear sensors send fast neutrons which collide with the soil media when inserted into the soil most of the fast neutrons collide with hydrogen in the form of water in the soil media and become slow neutrons with each collision su et al 2014 the nuclear sensors measure the volumetric moisture content of the soil by measuring the slow neutrons which is proportional to the moisture content su et al 2014 however nuclear sensors pose health and environmental hazard which let to regulations and permit requirements imposed on these sensors walker et al 2004 romano 2014 su et al 2014 capacitance sensors have been extensively used as an

2017 vather et al 2018 capacitance sensors measure the dielectric constant of the soil which is a strong function of the volumetric moisture content walker et al 2004 generally capacitance sensors are very accurate user friendly portable cheap and easy to maintain dobriyal et al 2012 zerizghy et al 2013 su et al 2014 despite the benefits of capacitance sensors soil salinity and changes in soil temperature influence their measurements matula et al 2016 soil specific calibrations are required to attain a high level of accuracy when measuring soil moisture with capacitance sensors matula et al 2016 bogena et al 2017 capacitance sensors are sensitive to air gaps smaller sphere of influence and has limited applicability in near surface soil moisture brocca et al 2017 damage of capacitance sensors through lightning cables getting cut by mowers or eaten by rodents fire damage to sensors and cables are the major challenges on sensors deployed on the field for continuous soil moisture monitoring tsheko and savage 2005 gebregiorgis and savage 2006 montzka et al 2017a b noted the limited applicability of capacitance sensors in agricultural fields with regular tillage since these sensors are often installed outside the field and the representativeness of soil moisture measurements for the field are considered questionable generally in situ measurements of soil moisture are thought to be more accurate and are often used as a standard procedure against which remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates are compared walker et al 2004 dobriyal et al 2012 su et al 2014 brocca et al 2017 the major limitations of all conventional in situ measurement techniques is that they provide point measurements and do not account for spatial variability of soil moisture and difficult to use with rocky soils brocca et al 2017 everson et al 2017 consequently a large number of measurements are required to obtain representative estimates of soil moisture in larger areas ragab et al 2017 however the cost of setting up operating and maintaining dense soil moisture networks covering a wide range of agro climatic zones of the african regions is currently financially unattainable due to high competition for resources in developing countries pegram et al 2010 ragab et al 2017 thus crp has been recently evaluated in the africa to address the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture e g everson et al 2017 montzka et al 2017a b vather et al 2018 crp operates based on the principle that the fast neutrons that are produced in the air and soil travel in all directions between the air and soil thus creating an equilibrium concentration of neutrons zreda et al 2012 most of the fast neutrons collide with hydrogen in the form of water in the soil media and become slow neutrons with each collision zreda et al 2012 crp uses the low energy cosmic ray neutrons above the soil surface to measure volumetric moisture content as deep as 0 5 m over a 34 ha footprint everson et al 2017 however the sensitivity of crp to additional sources of hydrogen limits the accuracy of its measurements franz et al 2012 bogena et al 2013 crp requires continuous calibration and maintenance for accurate soil moisture measurements which is time consuming and labour intensive zreda et al 2012 everson et al 2017 vather et al 2018 crp techniques are a relatively expensive require extensive operational skill and are currently not feasible for dense in situ soil moisture monitoring networks montzka et al 2017a b 3 2 remote sensing techniques remote sensing techniques generally provide periodic updates of coarse spatial resolution but at moderate temporal resolution global surface soil moisture at a lower cost wagner et al 2007 mohanty et al 2017 estimates of soil moisture are often retrieved from microwave optical and thermal satellite sensors petropoulos et al 2015 mohanty et al 2017 peng and loew 2017 currently there are several satellites such as the soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture and ocean salinity smos metop a b advanced scatterometer ascat advanced microwave scanning radiometer eos amsr e and the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci soil moisture products that have been successfully used to retrieve surface soil moisture at temporal resolution of 2 to 3 days globally lakshmi 2013 ochsner et al 2013 mohanty et al 2017 montzka et al 2017a b peng and loew 2017 chen and wang 2018 the remotely sensed surface soil moisture is then extended to estimate profile soil moisture root zone using process based models and data assimilation schemes mohanty et al 2017 the very shallow soil layer 2 7 cm that is sensed from satellites the coarse spatial resolution of approximately 20 km and the very low quality under certain surface conditions such as dense vegetation and mountainous terrain of the currently available satellite products are the major limitations of remote sensing techniques for estimating soil moisture in this region dostálová et al 2014 brocca et al 2017 3 3 modelling techniques there are several hydrological and land surface models ranging from simple water balance procedures to complex deterministic models that have been successfully applied to estimate soil moisture in the african continent at different spatial and temporal scales dyer et al 1998 van huyssteen et al 2009 pegram et al 2010 sinclair and pegram 2010 mengistu et al 2014 everson et al 2017 famiglietti and wood 1994 argue that both hydrological and land surface models use the same set of equations for simulating the water and energy balance and hence soil moisture content however each model has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of the method theoretical assumptions accuracy complexity and data requirements jong and bootsma 1996 brocca et al 2017 according to brocca et al 2017 the accuracy of simulated soil moisture estimates depends on the type of model and the quality of the input meteorological data used the major limitation of soil moisture models is that they are generally data intensive since these models require meteorological data and detailed hydraulic conductivity water potential functions wilting point and water holding capacity which are not readily available and estimated with great difficulty dyer et al 1998 shang et al 2007 brocca et al 2017 4 evolution of soil moisture estimation in africa in the last decade many studies were dedicated to estimating soil moisture across the african regions in this section we review the major studies that have been undertaken to estimate soil moisture in africa the key techniques used and the outcomes of each project are explained explicitly 4 1 development of daily soil moisture maps using remote sensing in 2002 the european space agency esa launched a tiger initiative which aimed to assist african countries to solve water related problems through earth observation technologies as a response to the world summit of sustainable development bartsch 2008 as part of the tiger initiative esa in collaboration with the international organizations such as african ministerial council on water amcow african water facility awf united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco united nations economic commission for africa un eca world bank wb capacity development in sustainable water management undp capnet and stakeholders from than 40 african including universities research institutes and water authorities funded the soil moisture for hydrometeorologic applications in the southern africa development community region share project siegel 2007 according to bartsch 2008 the share project made use of the scatterometer and synthetic aperture radar sar microwave sensor types these microwave sensors records the backscatter from the earth s surface governed by dielectric properties of the soil which strongly depend on soil moisture content scatterometers have been part of ers satellites and metop a satellite platforms while sar is available from the envisat satellite bartsch 2008 despite the very coarse spatial resolution data of about 25 km scatterometers have a higher temporal coverage of every 2 3 days while sar offers the possibility of weekly monitoring at 1 km resolution globally bartsch 2008 the main aim of the share project was to establish a tool over african regions that determines relative surface soil moisture from envisat data and establish a technique for interpreting the coarser scatterometer data at local scale bartsch 2008 one of the main outcomes of the share project was the development and evaluation of the asar global monitoring gm product that provides estimates of surface soil moisture in the upper soil layer 3 cm over the entire african continent dostálová et al 2014 the maps of the surface soil moisture estimates at 1 km resolution derived from asar gm product were made available on the vienna university of technology tu wien website http www ipf tuwien ac at radar share since 2005 these soil moisture estimates are used in the famine early warning system network fews net which is the world drought monitoring system of the us agency for international development usaid freely available on the website https earlywarning usgs gov fews search africa the production and evaluation of the asar gm product over the agro climatic zones of the african continent was scientifically valuable to reveal new challenges and opportunities for improvements of indirect estimation of soil moisture pegram et al 2010 dostálová et al 2014 therefore huge efforts were made to validate the developed asar gm product and the methods of retrieving soil moisture data from the remote sensing products over diverse agro climatic zones of the african continent within the context of the share project the south african water research commission wrc funded a research project k5 1683 soil moisture from satellites daily maps over rsa which aimed to find a way to estimate the soil moisture over the southern african region in real time at fine spatial resolution and share the results freely in 2005 pegram et al 2010 according to pegram et al 2010 one of the aims of the wrc project was to devise a multi pronged approach to validate remote sensing products which aimed to provide estimates of soil moisture at high spatial and temporal resolution in southern africa therefore the physically based distributed hydrological model topographic kinematic approximation and integration topkapi of liu and todini 2002 was adapted for southern african conditions and coded using algorithms from the literature vischel et al 2008a one of the main outcomes of this project was the development of an automated topkapi hydrological model which provides estimates of soil moisture across southern africa region at a 3 h time step and 12 km spatial resolution vischel et al 2008b pegram et al 2010 the estimates of soil moisture over southern africa based on soil saturation index ssi derived using the topkapi hydrological model have been made freely available on the satellite applications and hydrology group sahg website http sahg ukzn ac za soil moisture sm since october 2007 while the background data are available on request pegram et al 2010 a further focus of the wrc project was to expand the usefulness of the topkapi model by adding a green ampt infiltration module which governs the initial partitioning of water between the soil and overland stores particularly for high rainfall areas sinclair and pegram 2013 since 2013 sahg has continued to perform soil moisture calculations on a monthly basis for the agricultural research council institute for soil climate and water arc iscw as part of the umlindi watchman newsletter available on their website http www arc agric za arc 20newsletters forms allitems aspx which aims to provide the agricultural community with relevant weather information to enhance agricultural productivity sinclair and pegram 2013 these soil moisture estimates are also used on the national flash flood guidance ffg system of the south african weather service saws for the improved floods forecasting available on their website http www weathersa co za warnings 4 2 in situ soil moisture measurement networks for validation of soil moisture estimates since the beginning of the millennium there has been a dramatic increase in the number of remote sensing products which have been developed by various research teams in collaboration with international space agencies which are aimed at estimating soil moisture automatically over large regions pegram et al 2010 however the quality of the remotely sensed soil moisture estimates is influenced by the accuracy and precision of the sensors and the retrieval algorithms used in processing raw data pfeffer et al 2008 gruhier et al 2010 montzka et al 2017a b given the variability of the climatological biogeographical pedological and lithological characteristics over the african regions there is vital need to validate the promising remote sensing soil moisture products against in situ soil moisture data in africa dostálová et al 2014 thus validation of remote sensing soil moisture products over the african regions is expected to reveal new challenges and opportunities for improvements of the accuracy and precision of the satellites and the retrieval algorithms used in processing raw data dostálová et al 2014 in the recent years huge efforts have been undertaken to install in situ soil moisture monitoring networks to support the satellite retrievals satellite product improvement and modelling in africa table 1 some of these network data have been merged in the international soil moisture network ismn and are freely available on the website https ismn geo tuwien ac at to support further validation of remote sensing products globally these sparse in situ soil moisture monitoring networks have been extensively used to validate the remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates for extended periods over the african regions in this section we review the major in situ soil moisture sensor networks that have been installed to validate soil moisture estimates from remote sensing and models in africa 4 2 1 african monsoon multidisciplinary analysis amma network in 2003 the african monsoon multidisciplinary analysis amma project was initiated to investigate the interactions between atmospheric oceanic and terrestrial systems and their joint controls on tropical monsoon dynamics in western africa lebel et al 2009 the main objective of this internationally coordinated amma project was to improve the understanding and modelling capabilities of the effect of land surface processes on monsoon intensity variability and predictability at both regionally and globally redelsperger et al 2006 extended period of intensive in situ measurements and field campaigns together with model developments and improvements were the core pillars to achieve the goals and objectives of the amma project lebel et al 2003 cappelaere et al 2009 as part of the amma project in situ soil moisture monitoring networks were implemented in mali de rosnay et al 2009 niger pellarin et al 2009a and benin pellarin et al 2009a b to understand the soil moisture variability in space and time theta probes ml2x delta t devices ltd cambridge uk and cs616 campbell scientific inc logan ut soil moisture sensors were installed at different depths i e 5 and 30 cm at each site gravimetric method was used for filed calibration of these soil moisture sensors de rosnay et al 2009 the soil moisture dataset from amma project is freely available online at http bd amma catch org and have been extensively used to validate different remote sensing soil moisture products and the methods of retrieving soil moisture data from the remote sensing products and hydrological models at these three diverse agro climatic zones of africa e g gruhier et al 2008 de rosnay et al 2009 gruhier et al 2010 pellarin et al 2009a b baup et al 2011 albergel et al 2012 louvet et al 2015 colliander et al 2017 4 2 2 agricultural research council institute for soil climate and water arc iscw network in a project funded through internal funds arc iscw installed an automated network of soil moisture probes for continuous soil moisture monitoring at 17 sites across south africa from 2008 the main aim of this project was to supply the agricultural community with soil moisture data for planning and efficient crop management to increase their agricultural productivity moeletsi et al 2009 decagon soil moisture probes ech2o were installed at three different depths i e 15 30 and 60 cm at each site however these sensors proved to be unreliable for continuous data capturing moeletsi et al 2009 according to moeletsi et al 2009 the discontinuity in soil moisture dataset was attributed to the need of re setting and re installation of these probes after every two months as they often stopped function after this period therefore a technician had to visit the stations once every two months to reset the sensors manually which was not was not feasible as a results of financial constraints according to moeletsi et al 2009 unreliable soil moisture dataset was attributed to the lack of constant power supply on the decagon sensors which were connected to the same dataloggers of the existed weather station moeletsi et al 2009 however decagon sensors connected on a relative expensive cr1000 datalogger gave out better data than the ones on the cr10x which is used by arc iscw in most of their weather stations moeletsi et al 2009 despite the attempts to resolve data discontinuity by development and installation of the switch device to re set the sensors automatically and also switch the sensors off when the modem is off to save power usage of the sensor the data discontinuity persisted moeletsi et al 2009 in 2015 arc iscw replaced decagon soil moisture probes by multilevel soil moisture temperature and electrical conductivity measuring dfm capacitance probes dfm software solutions south africa through funding from world meteorological organization wmo according to dfm software solutions 2015 these probes can withstand harsh climatic conditions as a result of a pvc cap which protects the electronics and can store data for more than 60 days at time intervals that vary between 1 min to 1 day dfm probe is a stand alone sensor with its own battery and a datalogger which enables users to view and download data graphically in the field or in the office dfm software solutions 2015 to this end arc iscw has about 4 years of continuous soil moisture data covering all the agro climatic zones of south africa using dfm equipment 4 2 3 cosmic ray soil moisture observation system cosmos network the scale difference between point in situ soil moisture measurements and low resolution satellite products hinders validation of remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates montzka et al 2017a b in recent years the emergence of non invasive wireless sensors such as crp with intermediate spatial resolution is the most promising technique to provide in situ soil moisture measurements to validate remote sensing products and hydrological models at high spatial scales which has never been achieved with in situ measurements techniques zreda et al 2012 bogena et al 2015 everson et al 2017 according to ochsner et al 2013 crp is currently the only in situ measurement technique that can obtain the average soil moisture over hundreds of metres and limit the need for dense point in situ soil moisture monitoring networks zreda et al 2012 initiated the cosmic ray soil moisture observation system cosmos networks which aimed to address the mismatch between limited in situ point measurements and remote sensing estimates over large areas using a crp sensors the real time soil moisture data from cosmos networks are available on the website http cosmos hwr arizona edu to this end a total of eight in situ soil moisture networks of crp have been installed in africa to support the validation of remote sensing soil moisture products and improving hydro meteorological forecasting 4 3 validation of remote sensing products and hydrological models indirect techniques of estimating soil moisture still needs to be validated against in situ soil moisture measurements to test their suitability in providing accurate estimates before they can be used with high confidence in africa gruhier et al 2008 pfeffer et al 2008 mengistu et al 2014 everson et al 2017 the availability of in situ measurements from these sparse monitoring networks provided a unique opportunity to validate different number of hydrological models remote sensing products and algorithms used to retrieve soil moisture estimates from satellite measurements across the african regions in this section we review some of the studies that have been undertaken to validate remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates using the in situ measurements in africa pellarin et al 2009a b explored the suitability of a technique based on assimilating amsr e c band measurements into a microwave emission model for the improved rainfall estimates from meteosat geostationary satellite product pellarin et al 2009a b reported an improved soil moisture maps at a spatial resolution of 10 10 km2 and a temporal resolution of 30 min when using assimilation technique and antecedent precipitation index api model over western africa for examples the assimilation technique significantly increases the agreement between estimates and in situ soil moisture measurements coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 28 to 0 59 and root mean square error rmse value 3 1 to 2 1 of volumetric moisture at the wankama site in niger pellarin et al 2009a b their study indicated that assimilation technique could improve the quality of regional soil moisture estimates over western africa pellarin et al 2009a b gruhier et al 2010 evaluated five different types of satellite products using different retrieval approaches against in situ measurements acquired over the 2 year period from 2005 to 2006 inclusive at three different soil moisture network zak eki agt deployed in mali sahel in the framework of amma project comparison between average soil moistures estimates and in situ measurements indicated that all products evaluated captured the seasonal soil moisture variations with average r2 values of 0 59 0 82 0 63 0 52 and 0 72 for amsr e nsidc amsr e vua ers cetp ers tuw tmi vua respectively gruhier et al 2010 their results indicated the superior of the amsr e vua product to provide reliable soil moisture estimates with the least rmse value of 3 33 and bias of 1 27 gruhier et al 2010 however these products over estimated soil moisture values during the dry season although amsr e vua still provided the best estimates with average r2 values of 0 58 and rmse value of 1 75 gruhier et al 2010 their results also indicated that remotely sensed soil moisture estimates are sensitive to the type of sensor as well as its signal frequency and retrieval algorithm gruhier et al 2010 amri et al 2012 evaluated the low resolution soil moisture estimates derived from ascat products of the vienna university of technology tu wien over semi arid region of kairouan plain in central tunisia they reported a reasonable agreement between the soil moisture estimates and in situ measurements acquired over the 3 year period from 2009 to 2011 using theta probes with r2 value of 0 5 and rmse value of 0 043 m3 m 3 amri et al 2012 their study showed the possibilities of assimilating soil moisture estimates derived from ascat moisture products into hydrological models to provide better estimates of soil moisture required for improved drought monitoring and floods forecasting in africa amri et al 2012 zribi et al 2014 explored the suitability of the water cloud model to correct the uncertainties attributed to the vegetation and climatic conditions of the semi arid regions using soil moisture estimates retrieve from the asar data zribi et al 2014 reported a reasonable agreement between the soil moistures estimates and in situ measurements acquired over the 3 year period from 2009 to 2011 at the kairouan plain in central tunisia using theta probes with r2 value of 0 49 and rmse value of 0 13 approximately 3 5 as volumetric moisture their study indicated that more research was required to develop and improve techniques of correcting effects of vegetation and climatic conditions in the semi arid regions of the african continent zribi et al 2014 schneider et al 2014 proposed a two step approach of downscaling soil moisture forecasts from the seasonal ensemble prediction forecasting system of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf their approach involved calibration of the forecast climatology using cumulative density function cdf matching approach of reichle and koster 2004 and the use of the relationship between ascat and asar to downscale seasonal soil moisture forecasts of global grid scale into a 1 km grid they evaluated their approach using weekly mean value of the in situ measurements acquired over the 1 year period from 2011 to 2012 at klee and mpala north sites of the cosmos networks schneider et al 2014 their results indicated that proposed downscaling approach significantly improved the quality of the soil moisture forecasts with r2 value from 0 46 to 0 73 and rmse value from 12 9 to 8 1 at the klee schneider et al 2014 they reported a reasonable improved the quality of the soil moisture forecasts with r2 value from 0 40 to 0 58 and rmse value from 15 6 to 11 9 at mpala north schneider et al 2014 their study demonstrated proposed downscaling approach has a potential to improve the quality of soil moisture forecasts however more research on developing and improving the quality of soil moisture forecasts was required schneider et al 2014 louvet et al 2015 evaluated the smos mission soil moisture level 3 product smos l3sm in western africa against in situ measurements acquired from mali niger and benin sites over the 2 year period from 2010 to 2012 their results indicated the good correlation between the soil moisture estimates derived from the smos l3sm product and in situ measurements with r2 values of 0 7 and 0 77 in niger and mali respectively with a rmse values less than 0 033 m3 m 3 louvet et al 2015 according to louvet et al 2015 the relative larger rmse value of 0 076 m3 m 3 for the benin site was attributed to the presence of a denser vegetation cover louvet et al 2015 their study indicated the limited applicability of smos l3sm product in the dense vegetation louvet et al 2015 recently faridani et al 2017 modified soil moisture analytical relationship smar model which estimates soil moisture content of deeper layers from surface soil moisture using a physically based formulation while assuming linear soil water loss function their modification was based on substituting the water loss coefficient with the soil water loss function proposed by laio et al 2001 to account for non linear water loss over time they use in situ measurements acquired over belenfougou wankama and tondikiboro in niger site of amma network as part of part of their model evaluation their results indicated that there was no significance difference between soil moisture estimates simulated with smar and their modified smar models in tondikiboro and wankama stations located on sandy textured soils faridani et al 2017 however modified smar model outperformed the smar model in belenfougou station located on clay soils with r2 value of 0 964 and rmse value of 0 082 compared to r2 value of 0 935 and rmse value of 0 107 faridani et al 2017 their study suggested that future research should also investigate the possibility of assimilating satellite soil surface moisture data into these two models to improve estimation of soil moisture profile faridani et al 2017 accurate field and satellite scale estimates of soil moisture for the calibration of hydrological models and estimation of the spatial variability of soil moisture at catchment scale was investigated as part of a recent wrc project everson et al 2017 the main aim of which was to assess the suitability of crp in providing data for the continued support of soil moisture modelling in south africa using a hylarsmet model everson et al 2017 everson et al 2017 reported crp measurements ranging from 0 13 and 0 36 mm which compared well to the in situ soil measurements ranging from 0 17 and 0 36 mm at baynesfield site of cosmos network south africa their results indicated that crp is suitable for providing spatial estimates of soil moisture once is properly calibrated everson et al 2017 they reported poor correlation with r2 value of 0 1371 between crp measurements and hylarsmet model simulations although both datasets had similar temporal variation the intercept of 21 3 mm indicated that the hylarsmet model overestimated soil moisture throughout the period everson et al 2017 according to everson et al 2017 the differences between these estimates were attributed to both the large horizontal and vertical scaling differences despite the scaling differences their findings demonstrated that hylarsmet model provide reliable relative soil moisture estimates for the drought and flood forecasting everson et al 2017 more recently vather et al 2018 tested the suitability of crp to provide spatial estimates of soil moisture in cathedral peak catchment vi site of cosmos network in south africa the comparison between the spatial soil moisture estimates derived from the calibrated crp and the in situ soil moisture network data from time domain reflectometry and echo probes indicated a good correlation with r2 value of 0 845 vather et al 2018 their results demonstrated the suitability of crp in providing spatial continuous reliable and accurate estimates of soil moisture over the catchment area once is properly calibrated vather et al 2018 4 4 inter comparisons of soil moisture estimates remote sensing methodologies for estimating soil moisture still need validation with in situ soil moisture measurements which are not readily available across different agro climatic zones of the african regions pfeffer et al 2008 sinclair and pegram 2013 consequently different attempts such as assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture estimates into water balance models inter comparison between different remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates have been undertaken in the past decade to evaluate the suitability of the remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates over the african continent in this section we review some of the attempts that have been undertaken to evaluate the suitability of the remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates in the absence of in situ measurements across the african regions the topkapi hydrological model runs in land surface modelling lsm mode and was first applied in an africa catchment by vischel et al 2008a at liebenbergsvlei in the free state province south africa vischel et al 2008b reported a good agreement between the simulated and the remotely sensed soil moisture estimates derived from ers product over two selected seasons of 8 months with r2 values ranging between 0 68 and 0 92 the good correlation between these two different independent approaches suggested that remotely sensed soil moisture data can be assimilated into hydrological models for improved estimation of soil moisture vischel et al 2008b their results also indicated that the potential of physically based hydrological models to disaggregate the remotely sensed soil moisture estimations down to fine spatial scales vischel et al 2008b sinclair and pegram 2010 compared the remotely sensed soil moisture estimates derived from ascat and simulated estimates from topkapi model at a spatial resolution of 12 5 km for 5 months over several climatic regions in south africa they reported a reasonable agreement between remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates with r2 values of 0 964 0 777 and 0 780 for liebenbergsvlei eastern cape and crocodile sites respectively sinclair and pegram 2010 the consistency between these independent soil moisture estimates suggests that the two techniques could be combined to produce better soil moisture estimations in south africa sinclair and pegram 2010 van huyssteen et al 2009 used a modelling procedure based on the soil water balance to calculate the daily soil moisture content for 28 sites over 6 years at weatherley grassland catchment located in the eastern cape province south africa van huyssteen et al 2009 reported a reasonable agreement between estimated and measured soil moisture datasets with the mean index of agreement of 0 88 and rmse of 6 8 mm of water per 300 mm of soil their study demonstrated that this model could be used to fill data gaps and increase the resolution of irregular in situ soil moisture measurements with a reasonable confidence van huyssteen et al 2009 in a global study by pierdicca et al 2013 the inter comparison between the soil moisture estimates derived from ascat and smos products indicated a reasonable correlation with r2 value of 0 65 and rmse value of 4 3 over the northern africa region their results showed that the consistency of the two products varied with season geographical zone and surface land cover pierdicca et al 2013 dostálová et al 2014 used soil moisture estimates derived amsr e and the noah land surface model from the global land data assimilation system gldas noah to evaluate the surface soil moisture product at a 1 km spatial resolution derived from asar gm product over the african continent comparisons between the soil moisture estimates derived from asar gm product and these products indicated reasonable correlation with r2 values of 0 35 and 0 34 for amsr e and gldas noah respectively dostálová et al 2014 according to dostálová et al 2014 the reported low r2 values were attributed to the lower variability of the surface soil moisture anomalies time series their results demonstrated that asar gm product has a good ability to monitor temporal soil moisture variability in regions with low to medium density vegetation and annual rainfall greater than 250 mm dostálová et al 2014 however some issues attributed to the azimuthal effects were identified in the arid regions dostálová et al 2014 their findings strengthen the understanding of the quality of the asar gm soil moisture product and its potential for data assimilation to improve droughts management and floods forecasting in the semi arid regions of the african continent dostálová et al 2014 another wrc project aimed to provide a spatially explicit validation procedure for the 1 km grid of soil water produced by the sahg and other hydrological models mengistu et al 2014 in this study moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 images were used in the surface energy balance system sebs remote sensing model to derive spatial soil moisture estimates for inter comparison with the hylarsmet model mengistu et al 2014 mengistu et al 2014 reported an average relative soil moisture estimates derived by sebs model of 0 7 and 0 5 mm at the maize and soybean sites respectively on 3rd of april 2012 at baynesfield estate in kwazulu natal province south africa these values were slightly lower than the in situ measurements of 0 8 and 0 6 mm at the maize and soybean sites respectively on the same date mengistu et al 2014 the hylarsmet estimates of soil saturation index ssi estimates followed the drying and wetting patterns of the sebs relative soil moisture mengistu et al 2014 for example on the 23rd of january 2013 an average relative soil moisture estimates derived by sebs model was 0 81 mm compared to 0 78 mm derived from the hylarsmet model mengistu et al 2014 their study demonstrated that estimates derived from the sebs and hylarsmet models compared well and these models could be reliably used in semi arid of south africa to estimate soil moisture mengistu et al 2014 zribi et al 2014 conducted an inter comparison study using soil moisture estimates retrieved from asar ers and ascat products at the kairouan plain in central tunisia they reported good agreement between the estimates derived sar and ers products with r2 value of 0 80 and rmse value of 0 13 inter comparison between the estimates derived from asar and ascat products indicated a strong degree of correlation with r2 value of 0 80 and rmse value of 0 087 zribi et al 2014 the consistency between these independent soil moisture estimates suggested these datasets could be combined for the development of operational soil moisture products with high spatial and temporal resolution and such products could be assimilated into land process models for improved estimation of evapotranspiration in semi arid regions of africa zribi et al 2014 to overcome the coarse resolution of remote sensing techniques used in the estimation of soil moisture there are a number of downscaling techniques that have been developed and successfully used to obtain soil moisture at a finer spatial resolution needed for hydrological applications merlin et al 2008 lakshmi 2013 möller 2014 investigated the downscaling of satellite microwave soil moisture estimates using the universal triangle method and soil water balance modelling at six transects in the semi arid western cape province of south africa as alternatives to in situ soil measurements möller 2014 reported a reasonable agreement between remotely sensed estimates using a universal triangle method and in situ measurements at the six transects with r2 values greater than 0 65 and rmse values ranging from 0 5 to 12 möller 2014 also reported reasonable agreement between simulated estimates and in situ measurements r2 values greater than 0 6 and rmse values ranging from 4 5 to 19 these findings suggested that both downscaled satellite microwave and soil water balance modelling could be reliably used in semi arid of south africa as alternatives to in situ soil measurements möller 2014 5 challenges and recommendations for future research 5 1 challenges and limitations despite the extensive research to improve soil moisture estimation in africa it remains the most difficult hydrometeorological variable to monitor and interpret as a results of its inherent temporal and spatial variability pegram et al 2010 everson et al 2017 in situ measurements of soil moisture are time consuming involve significant financial investment in instrumentation extensive field and laboratory work pegram et al 2010 brocca et al 2012 2017 consequently in situ soil moisture monitoring networks are limited in the africa so it is often estimated indirectly using both remote sensing and hydrological modelling techniques mengistu et al 2014 everson et al 2017 however both remotely sensed and simulated estimates of soil moisture are often used without proper validation or verification as a result of the lack of large and representative in situ soil moisture monitoring networks and the results are considered questionable everson et al 2017 despite previous attempts at developing alternatives to in situ soil measurements to evaluate the suitability and consistency of the remote sensing products and hydrological models the validation of soil moisture estimates remains a major challenge faced in africa mengistu et al 2014 everson et al 2017 the validation of satellite soil moisture products is further complicated by the different spatial scales between in situ measurements and soil moisture estimates derived from satellite products montzka et al 2017a b therefore the need for continuous real time in situ soil moisture measurements at high spatial resolution to validate remote sensing products and hydrological models to estimate soil moisture is indisputable despite the huge efforts been undertaken in recent years to install soil moisture monitoring networks in africa the lack of accurate and continuous in situ soil moisture measurements at high temporal and spatial resolution across different agro climatic zones of the african regions persisted moeletsi et al 2009 noted that some of the capacitance sensors placed permanently in the field were not reliable for continuous monitoring and capturing of soil moisture data van huyssteen et al 2009 showed that a modelling procedure based on the soil water balance equation and the interpretation of the physical properties of soils could be used to fill data gaps and increase the resolution of irregular in suit soil moisture measurements however van huyssteen et al 2009 used weekly in suit soil moisture measurements to evaluate the suitability of the model to simulate daily soil moisture the use of weekly in suit moisture measurements are unlikely to represent the temporal and spatial variability of soil moisture more recent studies have showed that crp method is a promising technique that can provide in situ moisture measurements for calibration and validation of remote sensing soil moisture products and land surface models as a result of its high spatial resolution vather et al 2018 however crp techniques are relatively expensive requiring extensive field calibration and maintenance to ensure accurate estimates of soil moisture everson et al 2017 vather et al 2018 consequently the cost of setting up operating and maintaining dense in situ soil moisture monitoring networks of crp across different agro climatic zones of the african regions is currently financially unattainable montzka et al 2017a b 5 2 novel opportunities and recommendations south for future studies remote sensing and hydrological models are the most successful approaches that have been used to provide relative soil moisture estimates for the early warning systems to support efficient drought management agricultural productivity and floods forecasting over the african continent thus far however remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates still need validation with in situ soil moisture measurements which are assumed to be more accurate and represent the truth walker et al 2004 dobriyal et al 2012 su et al 2014 keesstra et al 2016 brocca et al 2017 consequently the lack of long term records of soil moisture data collected from in situ monitoring networks across different agro climatic zones of the african continent continues to limit the evaluation and verification of the different remote sensing products and hydrological models available to estimate soil moisture more accurate and continuous in situ soil moisture measurements at high temporal and spatial resolution for extended periods are needed the sparse automated monitoring networks of soil moisture probes installed across africa is the most promising initiative to provide in situ soil moisture measurements for calibration and validation of remote sensing products and hydrological models thus the need to develop improve and expand the current in situ soil moisture monitoring networks in africa is indisputable however these monitoring networks utilize a variety of sensors installation and calibration practices which limits the development of soil moisture database in africa there are numerous different types of soil moisture sensors commercially available for continuous soil moisture monitoring extensive research has been conducted on the performance of soil moisture sensors for a wide range of soil types in both field and laboratory conditions internationally e g chandler et al 2004 bogena et al 2017 however very few studies have investigated the performance of the different soil moisture sensors under the climate and soil conditions found in africa e g everson et al 1998 gebregiorgis and savage 2006 there is vital need to identify the cheap accurate rapid simple to install and maintain soil moisture sensor under specific soil and climatic conditions for reliable and continuous in situ measurements for future research it is recommended that the performance and validity of the different soil moisture sensors under different soils and climatic conditions of the african regions are evaluated to inform the choice of type of sensor to be installed in specific monitoring network the fact that the capacitance sensors require soil specific calibration for accurate measurements of soil moisture is one of the major constrain for african practitioners since soil specific calibration is labourer and time consuming and can be expensive moeletsi et al 2009 thus capacitance sensors are often used without proper soil specific calibration and the accuracy of the measurements is questionable for future research the studies that investigate the magnitude of errors and systematic biases introduced into measurements using a manufacturer calibrations equations are recommended to optimize the field techniques used in monitoring networks to ensure accurate in situ soil moisture dataset there is also vital need to develop a feasible cost effective reliable and the least time consuming with minimal disturbance of the soil profile technique that can be used for calibration of soil moisture sensors the modelling procedure based on the soil water balance equation and the interpretation of the physical properties of soils could be incorporated within existing weather stations for continuous estimation of soil moisture from weather data to infill missing soil moisture data under different soils and climate variability of africa there is also a vital need to investing methods for upscaling point scale measurements of soil moisture to resolve the scale mismatch problem during the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture estimates and in situ soil moisture measurements declarations of interest none acknowledgments financial support from the agricultural research council university of kwazulu natal and national research foundation is gratefully acknowledged 
8454,soil moisture is the key parameter that governs the partitioning of the mass and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere through its influence on surface evaporation runoff albedo and emissivity therefore accurate quantification of soil moisture is critical in the study of the soil plant atmosphere continuum as well as in hydrology and climate change studies however soil moisture remains a challenging hydrometeorological variable to monitor and interpret over high temporal and spatial resolution the cost of setting up operating and maintaining dense soil moisture networks across different agro climatic zones of the african regions is currently financially unattainable due to high competition for resources consequently soil moisture is often estimated indirectly using both remote sensing and hydrological models which provide periodic updates and valuable estimates at lower cost over african continent thus far in recent years huge efforts have been undertaken to install in situ soil moisture monitoring networks to support the satellite retrievals satellite product improvement and modelling in africa however the lack of large and representative in situ soil moisture monitoring networks across different agro climatic zones of the african regions still hinders evaluation and verification of the most promising remote sensing products and hydrological models to estimate soil moisture consequently the need for accurate and continuous real time in situ soil moisture measurements covering a wide range of agro climatic zones of the african continent is indisputable keywords calibration in situ measurements modelling remote sensing validation 1 introduction the high temporal and spatial variability of rainfall that is mostly sporadic and erratic makes the african continent vulnerable to droughts and floods van vuuren 2015 davis and vincent 2017 sonwa et al 2017 therefore insufficient and highly variable rainfall is a serious limitation to agricultural production causing low yields and even crop failure in rainfed farming systems calzadilla et al 2014 moeletsi and walker 2013 climate change models consistently predict increased incidence of droughts and floods across different regions of africa ipcc 2014 climate change will potentially affect the livelihood of the majority smallholder farmers in africa who are highly depended on rain fed agricultural production and have limited adaptation capacity as a result of financial constraints ipcc 2014 consequently the frequent occurrence of droughts and floods posed by climate change threaten the food security and livelihood of the smallholder farmers in africa soil moisture storage is the main water source for plants between rainfall events affecting crop yields brocca et al 2017 farm management decisions such as timing of planting fertilizer application pesticides herbicides and irrigation scheduling are all influenced by the soil moisture status pegram et al 2010 chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 soil moisture governs the partitioning of the mass and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere through its influence on surface evaporation runoff reflectivity and emissivity coefficients brocca et al 2017 everson et al 2017 it is also a significant parameter for weather prediction flood forecasting and drought assessment shang et al 2007 pegram et al 2010 sinclair and pegram 2010 thus soil moisture is a critical indicator parameter for weather induced risks associated with climate change the need for accurate and real time soil moisture estimates covering a wide range of agro climatic zones is becoming more urgent for early warning systems to support efficient drought management agricultural productivity and floods forecasting in africa within the context of climate change pegram et al 2010 seneviratne et al 2010 everson et al 2017 remote sensing and hydrological models provide a unique opportunity for continuous monitoring of valuable soil moisture estimates over high spatial resolution at lower cost mengistu et al 2014 however both remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates are often used without proper validation as a result of the lack of high temporal and spatial in situ measurements in africa and the results are considered questionable everson et al 2017 in the recent years huge efforts were made to support the calibration and validation of remote sensing products and hydrological models and to improve understanding temporal and spatial of soil moisture across the african regions since the beginning of the millennium various african research teams in collaboration with international space agencies have put some effort into investing in the development and expansion of in situ monitoring networks for the long term measurement of soil moisture in africa lebel et al 2009 moeletsi et al 2009 pegram et al 2010 everson et al 2017 several studies were also undertaken to validate and improve the indirect estimation of soil moisture in africa mengistu et al 2014 louvet et al 2015 colliander et al 2017 everson et al 2017 however very few if any studies that have extensively and explicitly reviewed the progress made in soil moisture estimation challenges faced and the novel opportunities in the african continent thus far therefore the main aim of this paper is to provide the present status of soil moisture estimation in the african continent and to identify the commonalities and gaps in the literature firstly we review the theory advantages as well as the limitations of the key techniques that have been extensively used to estimate soil moisture in the african continent secondly we review the evolution of soil moisture estimation in this continent finally the major challenges and the novel opportunities that would be important to address in future investigations are discussed 2 methodology scientific databases such as google scholar sciencedirect and web of science were searched using the keywords soil moisture estimation remote sensing of soil moisture modelling of soil moisture calibration and validation of soil moisture estimates to obtain soil moisture studies that have been

most difficult hydrometeorological variable to monitor and interpret as a results of its inherent temporal and spatial variability associated with variations in soil properties landscape and vegetation cover brocca et al 2012 romano 2014 brocca et al 2017 everson et al 2017 the numerous techniques that have been employed to estimate soil moisture in the african continent over the past 40 years can be broadly divided into three categories in situ soil measurements remote sensing and modelling techniques vather et al 2018 the choice of the technique used to estimate soil moisture is highly dependent on the application cost and data input dobriyal et al 2012 3 1 in situ measurement techniques in situ measurement techniques range from conventional methods such as gravimetric nuclear and capacitance to wireless sensors such as cosmic ray probes crp and geophysical measurements walker et al 2004 dobriyal et al 2012 romano 2014 su et al 2014 brocca et al 2017 gravimetric method of klute 1986 involves the collection of soil samples at specific locations and depths known volume and weight of the collected soil samples are oven dried at 105 c for 24 to 72 h and re weighed to determine the weight loss walker et al 2004 the gravimetric soil moisture is then calculated by dividing the mass of water by the mass of dry soil klute 1986 later volumetric soil water content could be derived using the relationship between the gravimetric soil moisture and measured bulk density klute 1986 gravimetric method is the most accurate independent of soil type cost effective and easy in situ measurement approach of estimating soil moisture and is often used as a standard procedure against which other methods are compared walker et al 2004 gebregiorgis and savage 2006 brocca et al 2017 everson et al 2017 however this approach is destructive in nature and cannot be used to track changes in soil moisture over time at the same location walker et al 2004 shang et al 2007 brocca et al 2017 for decades the nuclear sensors have been considered as an alternative to gravimetric method for in situ measurements of moisture content as a result of its accuracy and reliability in making non destructive soil moisture profile measurements walker et al 2004 brocca et al 2017 according to walker et al 2004 nuclear sensors send fast neutrons which collide with the soil media when inserted into the soil most of the fast neutrons collide with hydrogen in the form of water in the soil media and become slow neutrons with each collision su et al 2014 the nuclear sensors measure the volumetric moisture content of the soil by measuring the slow neutrons which is proportional to the moisture content su et al 2014 however nuclear sensors pose health and environmental hazard which let to regulations and permit requirements imposed on these sensors walker et al 2004 romano 2014 su et al 2014 capacitance sensors have been extensively used as an alternatives to make continuous and non destructive soil moisture profile measurements in afrca e g tsheko and savage 2005 gebregiorgis and savage 2006 mengistu et al 2014 möller 2014 everson et al 2017 vather et al 2018 capacitance sensors measure the dielectric constant of the soil which is a strong function of the volumetric moisture content walker et al 2004 generally capacitance sensors are very accurate user friendly portable cheap and easy to maintain dobriyal et al 2012 zerizghy et al 2013 su et al 2014 despite the benefits of capacitance sensors soil salinity and changes in soil temperature influence their measurements matula et al 2016 soil specific calibrations are required to attain a high level of accuracy when measuring soil moisture with capacitance sensors matula et al 2016 bogena et al 2017 capacitance sensors are sensitive to air gaps smaller sphere of influence and has limited applicability in near surface soil moisture brocca et al 2017 damage of capacitance sensors through lightning cables getting cut by mowers or eaten by rodents fire damage to sensors and cables are the major challenges on sensors deployed on the field for continuous soil moisture monitoring tsheko and savage 2005 gebregiorgis and savage 2006 montzka et al 2017a b noted the limited applicability of capacitance sensors in agricultural fields with regular tillage since these sensors are often installed outside the field and the representativeness of soil moisture measurements for the field are considered questionable generally in situ measurements of soil moisture are thought to be more accurate and are often used as a standard procedure against which remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates are compared walker et al 2004 dobriyal et al 2012 su et al 2014 brocca et al 2017 the major limitations of all conventional in situ measurement techniques is that they provide point measurements and do not account for spatial variability of soil moisture and difficult to use with rocky soils brocca et al 2017 everson et al 2017 consequently a large number of measurements are required to obtain representative estimates of soil moisture in larger areas ragab et al 2017 however the cost of setting up operating and maintaining dense soil moisture networks covering a wide range of agro climatic zones of the african regions is currently financially unattainable due to high competition for resources in developing countries pegram et al 2010 ragab et al 2017 thus crp has been recently evaluated in the africa to address the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture e g everson et al 2017 montzka et al 2017a b vather et al 2018 crp operates based on the principle that the fast neutrons that are produced in the air and soil travel in all directions between the air and soil thus creating an equilibrium concentration of neutrons zreda et al 2012 most of the fast neutrons collide with hydrogen in the form of water in the soil media and become slow neutrons with each collision zreda et al 2012 crp uses the low energy cosmic ray neutrons above the soil surface to measure volumetric moisture content as deep as 0 5 m over a 34 ha footprint everson et al 2017 however the sensitivity of crp to additional sources of hydrogen limits the accuracy of its measurements franz et al 2012 bogena et al 2013 crp requires continuous calibration and maintenance for accurate soil moisture measurements which is time consuming and labour intensive zreda et al 2012 everson et al 2017 vather et al 2018 crp techniques are a relatively expensive require extensive operational skill and are currently not feasible for dense in situ soil moisture monitoring networks montzka et al 2017a b 3 2 remote sensing techniques remote sensing techniques generally provide periodic updates of coarse spatial resolution but at moderate temporal resolution global surface soil moisture at a lower cost wagner et al 2007 mohanty et al 2017 estimates of soil moisture are often retrieved from microwave optical and thermal satellite sensors petropoulos et al 2015 mohanty et al 2017 peng and loew 2017 currently there are several satellites such as the soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture and ocean salinity smos metop a b advanced scatterometer ascat advanced microwave scanning radiometer eos amsr e and the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci soil moisture products that have been successfully used to retrieve surface soil moisture at temporal resolution of 2 to 3 days globally lakshmi 2013 ochsner et al 2013 mohanty et al 2017 montzka et al 2017a b peng and loew 2017 chen and wang 2018 the remotely sensed surface soil moisture is then extended to estimate profile soil moisture root zone using process based models and data assimilation schemes mohanty et al 2017 the very shallow soil layer 2 7 cm that is sensed from satellites the coarse spatial resolution of approximately 20 km and the very low quality under certain surface conditions such as dense vegetation and mountainous terrain of the currently available satellite products are the major limitations of remote sensing techniques for estimating soil moisture in this region dostálová et al 2014 brocca et al 2017 3 3 modelling techniques there are several hydrological and land surface models ranging from simple water balance procedures to complex deterministic models that have been successfully applied to estimate soil moisture in the african continent at different spatial and temporal scales dyer et al 1998 van huyssteen et al 2009 pegram et al 2010 sinclair and pegram 2010 mengistu et al 2014 everson et al 2017 famiglietti and wood 1994 argue that both hydrological and land surface models use the same set of equations for simulating the water and energy balance and hence soil moisture content however each model has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of the method theoretical assumptions accuracy complexity and data requirements jong and bootsma 1996 brocca et al 2017 according to brocca et al 2017 the accuracy of simulated soil moisture estimates depends on the type of model and the quality of the input meteorological data used the major limitation of soil moisture models is that they are generally data intensive since these models require meteorological data and detailed hydraulic conductivity water potential functions wilting point and water holding capacity which are not readily available and estimated with great difficulty dyer et al 1998 shang et al 2007 brocca et al 2017 4 evolution of soil moisture estimation in africa in the last decade many studies were dedicated to estimating soil moisture across the african regions in this section we review the major studies that have been undertaken to estimate soil moisture in africa the key techniques used and the outcomes of each project are explained explicitly 4 1 development of daily soil moisture maps using remote sensing in 2002 the european space agency esa launched a tiger initiative which aimed to assist african countries to solve water related problems through earth observation technologies as a response to the world summit of sustainable development bartsch 2008 as part of the tiger initiative esa in collaboration with the international organizations such as african ministerial council on water amcow african water facility awf united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco united nations economic commission for africa un eca world bank wb capacity development in sustainable water management undp capnet and stakeholders from than 40 african including universities research institutes and water authorities funded the soil moisture for hydrometeorologic applications in the southern africa development community region share project siegel 2007 according to bartsch 2008 the share project made use of the scatterometer and synthetic aperture radar sar microwave sensor types these microwave sensors records the backscatter from the earth s surface governed by dielectric properties of the soil which strongly depend on soil moisture content scatterometers have been part of ers satellites and metop a satellite platforms while sar is available from the envisat satellite bartsch 2008 despite the very coarse spatial resolution data of about 25 km scatterometers have a higher temporal coverage of every 2 3 days while sar offers the possibility of weekly monitoring at 1 km resolution globally bartsch 2008 the main aim of the share project was to establish a tool over african regions that determines relative surface soil moisture from envisat data and establish a technique for interpreting the coarser scatterometer data at local scale bartsch 2008 one of the main outcomes of the share project was the development and evaluation of the asar global monitoring gm product that provides estimates of surface soil moisture in the upper soil layer 3 cm over the entire african continent dostálová et al 2014 the maps of the surface soil moisture estimates at 1 km resolution derived from asar gm product were made available on the vienna university of technology tu wien website http www ipf tuwien ac at radar share since 2005 these soil moisture estimates are used in the famine early warning system network fews net which is the world drought monitoring system of the us agency for international development usaid freely available on the website https earlywarning usgs gov fews search africa the production and evaluation of the asar gm product over the agro climatic zones of the african continent was scientifically valuable to reveal new challenges and opportunities for improvements of indirect estimation of soil moisture pegram et al 2010 dostálová et al 2014 therefore huge efforts were made to validate the developed asar gm product and the methods of retrieving soil moisture data from the remote sensing products over diverse agro climatic zones of the african continent within the context of the share project the south african water research commission wrc funded a research project k5 1683 soil moisture from satellites daily maps over rsa which aimed to find a way to estimate the soil moisture over the southern african region in real time at fine spatial resolution and share the results freely in 2005 pegram et al 2010 according to pegram et al 2010 one of the aims of the wrc project was to devise a multi pronged approach to validate remote sensing products which aimed to provide estimates of soil moisture at high spatial and temporal resolution in southern africa therefore the physically based distributed hydrological model topographic kinematic approximation and integration topkapi of liu and todini 2002 was adapted for southern african conditions and coded using algorithms from the literature vischel et al 2008a one of the main outcomes of this project was the development of an automated topkapi hydrological model which provides estimates of soil moisture across southern africa region at a 3 h time step and 12 km spatial resolution vischel et al 2008b pegram et al 2010 the estimates of soil moisture over southern africa based on soil saturation index ssi derived using the topkapi hydrological model have been made freely available on the satellite applications and hydrology group sahg website http sahg ukzn ac za soil moisture sm since october 2007 while the background data are available on request pegram et al 2010 a further focus of the wrc project was to expand the usefulness of the topkapi model by adding a green ampt infiltration module which governs the initial partitioning of water between the soil and overland stores particularly for high rainfall areas sinclair and pegram 2013 since 2013 sahg has continued to perform soil moisture calculations on a monthly basis for the agricultural research council institute for soil climate and water arc iscw as part of the umlindi watchman newsletter available on their website http www arc agric za arc 20newsletters forms allitems aspx which aims to provide the agricultural community with relevant weather information to enhance agricultural productivity sinclair and pegram 2013 these soil moisture estimates are also used on the national flash flood guidance ffg system of the south african weather service saws for the improved floods forecasting available on their website http www weathersa co za warnings 4 2 in situ soil moisture measurement networks for validation of soil moisture estimates since the beginning of the millennium there has been a dramatic increase in the number of remote sensing products which have been developed by various research teams in collaboration with international space agencies which are aimed at estimating soil moisture automatically over large regions pegram et al 2010 however the quality of the remotely sensed soil moisture estimates is influenced by the accuracy and precision of the sensors and the retrieval algorithms used in processing raw data pfeffer et al 2008 gruhier et al 2010 montzka et al 2017a b given the variability of the climatological biogeographical pedological and lithological characteristics over the african regions there is vital need to validate the promising remote sensing soil moisture products against in situ soil moisture data in africa dostálová et al 2014 thus validation of remote sensing soil moisture products over the african regions is expected to reveal new challenges and opportunities for improvements of the accuracy and precision of the satellites and the retrieval algorithms used in processing raw data dostálová et al 2014 in the recent years huge efforts have been undertaken to install in situ soil moisture monitoring networks to support the satellite retrievals satellite product improvement and modelling in africa table 1 some of these network data have been merged in the international soil moisture network ismn and are freely available on the website https ismn geo tuwien ac at to support further validation of remote sensing products globally these sparse in situ soil moisture monitoring networks have been extensively used to validate the remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates for extended periods over the african regions in this section we review the major in situ soil moisture sensor networks that have been installed to validate soil moisture estimates from remote sensing and models in africa 4 2 1 african monsoon multidisciplinary analysis amma network in 2003 the african monsoon multidisciplinary analysis amma project was initiated to investigate the interactions between atmospheric oceanic and terrestrial systems and their joint controls on tropical monsoon dynamics in western africa lebel et al 2009 the main objective of this internationally coordinated amma project was to improve the understanding and modelling capabilities of the effect of land surface processes on monsoon intensity variability and predictability at both regionally and globally redelsperger et al 2006 extended period of intensive in situ measurements and field campaigns together with model developments and improvements were the core pillars to achieve the goals and objectives of the amma project lebel et al 2003 cappelaere et al 2009 as part of the amma project in situ soil moisture monitoring networks were implemented in mali de rosnay et al 2009 niger pellarin et al 2009a and benin pellarin et al 2009a b to understand the soil moisture variability in space and time theta probes ml2x delta t devices ltd cambridge uk and cs616 campbell scientific inc logan ut soil moisture sensors were installed at different depths i e 5 and 30 cm at each site gravimetric method was used for filed calibration of these soil moisture sensors de rosnay et al 2009 the soil moisture dataset from amma project is freely available online at http bd amma catch org and have been extensively used to validate different remote sensing soil moisture products and the methods of retrieving soil moisture data from the remote sensing products and hydrological models at these three diverse agro climatic zones of africa e g gruhier et al 2008 de rosnay et al 2009 gruhier et al 2010 pellarin et al 2009a b baup et al 2011 albergel et al 2012 louvet et al 2015 colliander et al 2017 4 2 2 agricultural research council institute for soil climate and water arc iscw network in a project funded through internal funds arc iscw installed an automated network of soil moisture probes for continuous soil moisture monitoring at 17 sites across south africa from 2008 the main aim of this project was to supply the agricultural community with soil moisture data for planning and efficient crop management to increase their agricultural productivity moeletsi et al 2009 decagon soil moisture probes ech2o were installed at three different depths i e 15 30 and 60 cm at each site however these sensors proved to be unreliable for continuous data capturing moeletsi et al 2009 according to moeletsi et al 2009 the discontinuity in soil moisture dataset was attributed to the need of re setting and re installation of these probes after every two months as they often stopped function after this period therefore a technician had to visit the stations once every two months to reset the sensors manually which was not was not feasible as a results of financial constraints according to moeletsi et al 2009 unreliable soil moisture dataset was attributed to the lack of constant power supply on the decagon sensors which were connected to the same dataloggers of the existed weather station moeletsi et al 2009 however decagon sensors connected on a relative expensive cr1000 datalogger gave out better data than the ones on the cr10x which is used by arc iscw in most of their weather stations moeletsi et al 2009 despite the attempts to resolve data discontinuity by development and installation of the switch device to re set the sensors automatically and also switch the sensors off when the modem is off to save power usage of the sensor the data discontinuity persisted moeletsi et al 2009 in 2015 arc iscw replaced decagon soil moisture probes by multilevel soil moisture temperature and electrical conductivity measuring dfm capacitance probes dfm software solutions south africa through funding from world meteorological organization wmo according to dfm software solutions 2015 these probes can withstand harsh climatic conditions as a result of a pvc cap which protects the electronics and can store data for more than 60 days at time intervals that vary between 1 min to 1 day dfm probe is a stand alone sensor with its own battery and a datalogger which enables users to view and download data graphically in the field or in the office dfm software solutions 2015 to this end arc iscw has about 4 years of continuous soil moisture data covering all the agro climatic zones of south africa using dfm equipment 4 2 3 cosmic ray soil moisture observation system cosmos network the scale difference between point in situ soil moisture measurements and low resolution satellite products hinders validation of remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates montzka et al 2017a b in recent years the emergence of non invasive wireless sensors such as crp with intermediate spatial resolution is the most promising technique to provide in situ soil moisture measurements to validate remote sensing products and hydrological models at high spatial scales which has never been achieved with in situ measurements techniques zreda et al 2012 bogena et al 2015 everson et al 2017 according to ochsner et al 2013 crp is currently the only in situ measurement technique that can obtain the average soil moisture over hundreds of metres and limit the need for dense point in situ soil moisture monitoring networks zreda et al 2012 initiated the cosmic ray soil moisture observation system cosmos networks which aimed to address the mismatch between limited in situ point measurements and remote sensing estimates over large areas using a crp sensors the real time soil moisture data from cosmos networks are available on the website http cosmos hwr arizona edu to this end a total of eight in situ soil moisture networks of crp have been installed in africa to support the validation of remote sensing soil moisture products and improving hydro meteorological forecasting 4 3 validation of remote sensing products and hydrological models indirect techniques of estimating soil moisture still needs to be validated against in situ soil moisture measurements to test their suitability in providing accurate estimates before they can be used with high confidence in africa gruhier et al 2008 pfeffer et al 2008 mengistu et al 2014 everson et al 2017 the availability of in situ measurements from these sparse monitoring networks provided a unique opportunity to validate different number of hydrological models remote sensing products and algorithms used to retrieve soil moisture estimates from satellite measurements across the african regions in this section we review some of the studies that have been undertaken to validate remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates using the in situ measurements in africa pellarin et al 2009a b explored the suitability of a technique based on assimilating amsr e c band measurements into a microwave emission model for the improved rainfall estimates from meteosat geostationary satellite product pellarin et al 2009a b reported an improved soil moisture maps at a spatial resolution of 10 10 km2 and a temporal resolution of 30 min when using assimilation technique and antecedent precipitation index api model over western africa for examples the assimilation technique significantly increases the agreement between estimates and in situ soil moisture measurements coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 28 to 0 59 and root mean square error rmse value 3 1 to 2 1 of volumetric moisture at the wankama site in niger pellarin et al 2009a b their study indicated that assimilation technique could improve the quality of regional soil moisture estimates over western africa pellarin et al 2009a b gruhier et al 2010 evaluated five different types of satellite products using different retrieval approaches against in situ measurements acquired over the 2 year period from 2005 to 2006 inclusive at three different soil moisture network zak eki agt deployed in mali sahel in the framework of amma project comparison between average soil moistures estimates and in situ measurements indicated that all products evaluated captured the seasonal soil moisture variations with average r2 values of 0 59 0 82 0 63 0 52 and 0 72 for amsr e nsidc amsr e vua ers cetp ers tuw tmi vua respectively gruhier et al 2010 their results indicated the superior of the amsr e vua product to provide reliable soil moisture estimates with the least rmse value of 3 33 and bias of 1 27 gruhier et al 2010 however these products over estimated soil moisture values during the dry season although amsr e vua still provided the best estimates with average r2 values of 0 58 and rmse value of 1 75 gruhier et al 2010 their results also indicated that remotely sensed soil moisture estimates are sensitive to the type of sensor as well as its signal frequency and retrieval algorithm gruhier et al 2010 amri et al 2012 evaluated the low resolution soil moisture estimates derived from ascat products of the vienna university of technology tu wien over semi arid region of kairouan plain in central tunisia they reported a reasonable agreement between the soil moisture estimates and in situ measurements acquired over the 3 year period from 2009 to 2011 using theta probes with r2 value of 0 5 and rmse value of 0 043 m3 m 3 amri et al 2012 their study showed the possibilities of assimilating soil moisture estimates derived from ascat moisture products into hydrological models to provide better estimates of soil moisture required for improved drought monitoring and floods forecasting in africa amri et al 2012 zribi et al 2014 explored the suitability of the water cloud model to correct the uncertainties attributed to the vegetation and climatic conditions of the semi arid regions using soil moisture estimates retrieve from the asar data zribi et al 2014 reported a reasonable agreement between the soil moistures estimates and in situ measurements acquired over the 3 year period from 2009 to 2011 at the kairouan plain in central tunisia using theta probes with r2 value of 0 49 and rmse value of 0 13 approximately 3 5 as volumetric moisture their study indicated that more research was required to develop and improve techniques of correcting effects of vegetation and climatic conditions in the semi arid regions of the african continent zribi et al 2014 schneider et al 2014 proposed a two step approach of downscaling soil moisture forecasts from the seasonal ensemble prediction forecasting system of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf their approach involved calibration of the forecast climatology using cumulative density function cdf matching approach of reichle and koster 2004 and the use of the relationship between ascat and asar to downscale seasonal soil moisture forecasts of global grid scale into a 1 km grid they evaluated their approach using weekly mean value of the in situ measurements acquired over the 1 year period from 2011 to 2012 at klee and mpala north sites of the cosmos networks schneider et al 2014 their results indicated that proposed downscaling approach significantly improved the quality of the soil moisture forecasts with r2 value from 0 46 to 0 73 and rmse value from 12 9 to 8 1 at the klee schneider et al 2014 they reported a reasonable improved the quality of the soil moisture forecasts with r2 value from 0 40 to 0 58 and rmse value from 15 6 to 11 9 at mpala north schneider et al 2014 their study demonstrated proposed downscaling approach has a potential to improve the quality of soil moisture forecasts however more research on developing and improving the quality of soil moisture forecasts was required schneider et al 2014 louvet et al 2015 evaluated the smos mission soil moisture level 3 product smos l3sm in western africa against in situ measurements acquired from mali niger and benin sites over the 2 year period from 2010 to 2012 their results indicated the good correlation between the soil moisture estimates derived from the smos l3sm product and in situ measurements with r2 values of 0 7 and 0 77 in niger and mali respectively with a rmse values less than 0 033 m3 m 3 louvet et al 2015 according to louvet et al 2015 the relative larger rmse value of 0 076 m3 m 3 for the benin site was attributed to the presence of a denser vegetation cover louvet et al 2015 their study indicated the limited applicability of smos l3sm product in the dense vegetation louvet et al 2015 recently faridani et al 2017 modified soil moisture analytical relationship smar model which estimates soil moisture content of deeper layers from surface soil moisture using a physically based formulation while assuming linear soil water loss function their modification was based on substituting the water loss coefficient with the soil water loss function proposed by laio et al 2001 to account for non linear water loss over time they use in situ measurements acquired over belenfougou wankama and tondikiboro in niger site of amma network as part of part of their model evaluation their results indicated that there was no significance difference between soil moisture estimates simulated with smar and their modified smar models in tondikiboro and wankama stations located on sandy textured soils faridani et al 2017 however modified smar model outperformed the smar model in belenfougou station located on clay soils with r2 value of 0 964 and rmse value of 0 082 compared to r2 value of 0 935 and rmse value of 0 107 faridani et al 2017 their study suggested that future research should also investigate the possibility of assimilating satellite soil surface moisture data into these two models to improve estimation of soil moisture profile faridani et al 2017 accurate field and satellite scale estimates of soil moisture for the calibration of hydrological models and estimation of the spatial variability of soil moisture at catchment scale was investigated as part of a recent wrc project everson et al 2017 the main aim of which was to assess the suitability of crp in providing data for the continued support of soil moisture modelling in south africa using a hylarsmet model everson et al 2017 everson et al 2017 reported crp measurements ranging from 0 13 and 0 36 mm which compared well to the in situ soil measurements ranging from 0 17 and 0 36 mm at baynesfield site of cosmos network south africa their results indicated that crp is suitable for providing spatial estimates of soil moisture once is properly calibrated everson et al 2017 they reported poor correlation with r2 value of 0 1371 between crp measurements and hylarsmet model simulations although both datasets had similar temporal variation the intercept of 21 3 mm indicated that the hylarsmet model overestimated soil moisture throughout the period everson et al 2017 according to everson et al 2017 the differences between these estimates were attributed to both the large horizontal and vertical scaling differences despite the scaling differences their findings demonstrated that hylarsmet model provide reliable relative soil moisture estimates for the drought and flood forecasting everson et al 2017 more recently vather et al 2018 tested the suitability of crp to provide spatial estimates of soil moisture in cathedral peak catchment vi site of cosmos network in south africa the comparison between the spatial soil moisture estimates derived from the calibrated crp and the in situ soil moisture network data from time domain reflectometry and echo probes indicated a good correlation with r2 value of 0 845 vather et al 2018 their results demonstrated the suitability of crp in providing spatial continuous reliable and accurate estimates of soil moisture over the catchment area once is properly calibrated vather et al 2018 4 4 inter comparisons of soil moisture estimates remote sensing methodologies for estimating soil moisture still need validation with in situ soil moisture measurements which are not readily available across different agro climatic zones of the african regions pfeffer et al 2008 sinclair and pegram 2013 consequently different attempts such as assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture estimates into water balance models inter comparison between different remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates have been undertaken in the past decade to evaluate the suitability of the remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates over the african continent in this section we review some of the attempts that have been undertaken to evaluate the suitability of the remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates in the absence of in situ measurements across the african regions the topkapi hydrological model runs in land surface modelling lsm mode and was first applied in an africa catchment by vischel et al 2008a at liebenbergsvlei in the free state province south africa vischel et al 2008b reported a good agreement between the simulated and the remotely sensed soil moisture estimates derived from ers product over two selected seasons of 8 months with r2 values ranging between 0 68 and 0 92 the good correlation between these two different independent approaches suggested that remotely sensed soil moisture data can be assimilated into hydrological models for improved estimation of soil moisture vischel et al 2008b their results also indicated that the potential of physically based hydrological models to disaggregate the remotely sensed soil moisture estimations down to fine spatial scales vischel et al 2008b sinclair and pegram 2010 compared the remotely sensed soil moisture estimates derived from ascat and simulated estimates from topkapi model at a spatial resolution of 12 5 km for 5 months over several climatic regions in south africa they reported a reasonable agreement between remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates with r2 values of 0 964 0 777 and 0 780 for liebenbergsvlei eastern cape and crocodile sites respectively sinclair and pegram 2010 the consistency between these independent soil moisture estimates suggests that the two techniques could be combined to produce better soil moisture estimations in south africa sinclair and pegram 2010 van huyssteen et al 2009 used a modelling procedure based on the soil water balance to calculate the daily soil moisture content for 28 sites over 6 years at weatherley grassland catchment located in the eastern cape province south africa van huyssteen et al 2009 reported a reasonable agreement between estimated and measured soil moisture datasets with the mean index of agreement of 0 88 and rmse of 6 8 mm of water per 300 mm of soil their study demonstrated that this model could be used to fill data gaps and increase the resolution of irregular in situ soil moisture measurements with a reasonable confidence van huyssteen et al 2009 in a global study by pierdicca et al 2013 the inter comparison between the soil moisture estimates derived from ascat and smos products indicated a reasonable correlation with r2 value of 0 65 and rmse value of 4 3 over the northern africa region their results showed that the consistency of the two products varied with season geographical zone and surface land cover pierdicca et al 2013 dostálová et al 2014 used soil moisture estimates derived amsr e and the noah land surface model from the global land data assimilation system gldas noah to evaluate the surface soil moisture product at a 1 km spatial resolution derived from asar gm product over the african continent comparisons between the soil moisture estimates derived from asar gm product and these products indicated reasonable correlation with r2 values of 0 35 and 0 34 for amsr e and gldas noah respectively dostálová et al 2014 according to dostálová et al 2014 the reported low r2 values were attributed to the lower variability of the surface soil moisture anomalies time series their results demonstrated that asar gm product has a good ability to monitor temporal soil moisture variability in regions with low to medium density vegetation and annual rainfall greater than 250 mm dostálová et al 2014 however some issues attributed to the azimuthal effects were identified in the arid regions dostálová et al 2014 their findings strengthen the understanding of the quality of the asar gm soil moisture product and its potential for data assimilation to improve droughts management and floods forecasting in the semi arid regions of the african continent dostálová et al 2014 another wrc project aimed to provide a spatially explicit validation procedure for the 1 km grid of soil water produced by the sahg and other hydrological models mengistu et al 2014 in this study moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 images were used in the surface energy balance system sebs remote sensing model to derive spatial soil moisture estimates for inter comparison with the hylarsmet model mengistu et al 2014 mengistu et al 2014 reported an average relative soil moisture estimates derived by sebs model of 0 7 and 0 5 mm at the maize and soybean sites respectively on 3rd of april 2012 at baynesfield estate in kwazulu natal province south africa these values were slightly lower than the in situ measurements of 0 8 and 0 6 mm at the maize and soybean sites respectively on the same date mengistu et al 2014 the hylarsmet estimates of soil saturation index ssi estimates followed the drying and wetting patterns of the sebs relative soil moisture mengistu et al 2014 for example on the 23rd of january 2013 an average relative soil moisture estimates derived by sebs model was 0 81 mm compared to 0 78 mm derived from the hylarsmet model mengistu et al 2014 their study demonstrated that estimates derived from the sebs and hylarsmet models compared well and these models could be reliably used in semi arid of south africa to estimate soil moisture mengistu et al 2014 zribi et al 2014 conducted an inter comparison study using soil moisture estimates retrieved from asar ers and ascat products at the kairouan plain in central tunisia they reported good agreement between the estimates derived sar and ers products with r2 value of 0 80 and rmse value of 0 13 inter comparison between the estimates derived from asar and ascat products indicated a strong degree of correlation with r2 value of 0 80 and rmse value of 0 087 zribi et al 2014 the consistency between these independent soil moisture estimates suggested these datasets could be combined for the development of operational soil moisture products with high spatial and temporal resolution and such products could be assimilated into land process models for improved estimation of evapotranspiration in semi arid regions of africa zribi et al 2014 to overcome the coarse resolution of remote sensing techniques used in the estimation of soil moisture there are a number of downscaling techniques that have been developed and successfully used to obtain soil moisture at a finer spatial resolution needed for hydrological applications merlin et al 2008 lakshmi 2013 möller 2014 investigated the downscaling of satellite microwave soil moisture estimates using the universal triangle method and soil water balance modelling at six transects in the semi arid western cape province of south africa as alternatives to in situ soil measurements möller 2014 reported a reasonable agreement between remotely sensed estimates using a universal triangle method and in situ measurements at the six transects with r2 values greater than 0 65 and rmse values ranging from 0 5 to 12 möller 2014 also reported reasonable agreement between simulated estimates and in situ measurements r2 values greater than 0 6 and rmse values ranging from 4 5 to 19 these findings suggested that both downscaled satellite microwave and soil water balance modelling could be reliably used in semi arid of south africa as alternatives to in situ soil measurements möller 2014 5 challenges and recommendations for future research 5 1 challenges and limitations despite the extensive research to improve soil moisture estimation in africa it remains the most difficult hydrometeorological variable to monitor and interpret as a results of its inherent temporal and spatial variability pegram et al 2010 everson et al 2017 in situ measurements of soil moisture are time consuming involve significant financial investment in instrumentation extensive field and laboratory work pegram et al 2010 brocca et al 2012 2017 consequently in situ soil moisture monitoring networks are limited in the africa so it is often estimated indirectly using both remote sensing and hydrological modelling techniques mengistu et al 2014 everson et al 2017 however both remotely sensed and simulated estimates of soil moisture are often used without proper validation or verification as a result of the lack of large and representative in situ soil moisture monitoring networks and the results are considered questionable everson et al 2017 despite previous attempts at developing alternatives to in situ soil measurements to evaluate the suitability and consistency of the remote sensing products and hydrological models the validation of soil moisture estimates remains a major challenge faced in africa mengistu et al 2014 everson et al 2017 the validation of satellite soil moisture products is further complicated by the different spatial scales between in situ measurements and soil moisture estimates derived from satellite products montzka et al 2017a b therefore the need for continuous real time in situ soil moisture measurements at high spatial resolution to validate remote sensing products and hydrological models to estimate soil moisture is indisputable despite the huge efforts been undertaken in recent years to install soil moisture monitoring networks in africa the lack of accurate and continuous in situ soil moisture measurements at high temporal and spatial resolution across different agro climatic zones of the african regions persisted moeletsi et al 2009 noted that some of the capacitance sensors placed permanently in the field were not reliable for continuous monitoring and capturing of soil moisture data van huyssteen et al 2009 showed that a modelling procedure based on the soil water balance equation and the interpretation of the physical properties of soils could be used to fill data gaps and increase the resolution of irregular in suit soil moisture measurements however van huyssteen et al 2009 used weekly in suit soil moisture measurements to evaluate the suitability of the model to simulate daily soil moisture the use of weekly in suit moisture measurements are unlikely to represent the temporal and spatial variability of soil moisture more recent studies have showed that crp method is a promising technique that can provide in situ moisture measurements for calibration and validation of remote sensing soil moisture products and land surface models as a result of its high spatial resolution vather et al 2018 however crp techniques are relatively expensive requiring extensive field calibration and maintenance to ensure accurate estimates of soil moisture everson et al 2017 vather et al 2018 consequently the cost of setting up operating and maintaining dense in situ soil moisture monitoring networks of crp across different agro climatic zones of the african regions is currently financially unattainable montzka et al 2017a b 5 2 novel opportunities and recommendations south for future studies remote sensing and hydrological models are the most successful approaches that have been used to provide relative soil moisture estimates for the early warning systems to support efficient drought management agricultural productivity and floods forecasting over the african continent thus far however remotely sensed and simulated soil moisture estimates still need validation with in situ soil moisture measurements which are assumed to be more accurate and represent the truth walker et al 2004 dobriyal et al 2012 su et al 2014 keesstra et al 2016 brocca et al 2017 consequently the lack of long term records of soil moisture data collected from in situ monitoring networks across different agro climatic zones of the african continent continues to limit the evaluation and verification of the different remote sensing products and hydrological models available to estimate soil moisture more accurate and continuous in situ soil moisture measurements at high temporal and spatial resolution for extended periods are needed the sparse automated monitoring networks of soil moisture probes installed across africa is the most promising initiative to provide in situ soil moisture measurements for calibration and validation of remote sensing products and hydrological models thus the need to develop improve and expand the current in situ soil moisture monitoring networks in africa is indisputable however these monitoring networks utilize a variety of sensors installation and calibration practices which limits the development of soil moisture database in africa there are numerous different types of soil moisture sensors commercially available for continuous soil moisture monitoring extensive research has been conducted on the performance of soil moisture sensors for a wide range of soil types in both field and laboratory conditions internationally e g chandler et al 2004 bogena et al 2017 however very few studies have investigated the performance of the different soil moisture sensors under the climate and soil conditions found in africa e g everson et al 1998 gebregiorgis and savage 2006 there is vital need to identify the cheap accurate rapid simple to install and maintain soil moisture sensor under specific soil and climatic conditions for reliable and continuous in situ measurements for future research it is recommended that the performance and validity of the different soil moisture sensors under different soils and climatic conditions of the african regions are evaluated to inform the choice of type of sensor to be installed in specific monitoring network the fact that the capacitance sensors require soil specific calibration for accurate measurements of soil moisture is one of the major constrain for african practitioners since soil specific calibration is labourer and time consuming and can be expensive moeletsi et al 2009 thus capacitance sensors are often used without proper soil specific calibration and the accuracy of the measurements is questionable for future research the studies that investigate the magnitude of errors and systematic biases introduced into measurements using a manufacturer calibrations equations are recommended to optimize the field techniques used in monitoring networks to ensure accurate in situ soil moisture dataset there is also vital need to develop a feasible cost effective reliable and the least time consuming with minimal disturbance of the soil profile technique that can be used for calibration of soil moisture sensors the modelling procedure based on the soil water balance equation and the interpretation of the physical properties of soils could be incorporated within existing weather stations for continuous estimation of soil moisture from weather data to infill missing soil moisture data under different soils and climate variability of africa there is also a vital need to investing methods for upscaling point scale measurements of soil moisture to resolve the scale mismatch problem during the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture estimates and in situ soil moisture measurements declarations of interest none acknowledgments financial support from the
