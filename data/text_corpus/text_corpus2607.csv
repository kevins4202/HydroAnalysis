13035,this study investigated the impact of two different static biocarriers polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyurethane pu addition in mbr for process performance membrane fouling and microbial community treating municipal wastewater under high and low carbon nitrogen c n ratios the results indicated that pu biocarrier addition could help to accumulate the bacteria for nitrification and denitrification tauera amaricoccus and nitro spira in the mixed liquor and solitalea and sphingobacteriales unclassified on the biocarrier which slightly enhanced the total nitrogen removal especially under a low influent c n ratio of 6 7 additionally the pu biocarrier addition can also alter the bulk sludge characteristics with lower soluble microbial products smp concentration lower smp protein to carbohydrates ratio and bigger particle size leading to lower membrane fouling propensity even under a low influent c n ratio pu biocarrier addition also reduced the relative abundance of extracellular polymer substances eps secretion related bacteria sphingobacterials unclassified and ohtaekwangia and mitigated the membrane fouling propensity however this is not the case with pvc biocarrier addition which might be due to the physical properties of the static biocarrier since pu has higher porosity specific surface area and less negative surface zeta potential than pvc importantly the static biocarrier addition can improve the nitrogen removal especially under a low influent c n ratio and facilitate the membrane fouling control but it depends on the physical characteristics of the biocarriers graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords static biocarriers physical property fouling nitrogen removal microbial community 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbrs have been developed for over three decades and are widely used for municipal wastewater treatment 1 3 the main highlights of the mbr technology include excellent effluent quality small footprint and complete separation of hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt 1 however membrane fouling remains the most challenging issue in mbr operation 1 2 which increases the operating and maintenance costs and attracts considerable attention in the academic community 4 several antifouling methods have been attempted to optimize operational conditions improve bulk sludge characteristics through chemical agents dosing and modify membrane surface 3 5 adding biocarriers such as sponge plastic media granular media and bioaugmented carriers into mbr would constitute a hybrid mbr hmbr 6 7 which provides lower membrane fouling propensity through improving sludge characteristics and enhancing the mechanical scouring to the membrane surface 7 8 however controversial conclusions have been drawn in terms of which one played a predominant role hu et al 9 indicated that it is the biochemical effects of biocarriers on the sludge suspension that mitigates membrane fouling and the physical effects of the biocarriers are minimal on the contrary fu et al 10 suggested that mechanical effects of biocarrier scouring played a more important role for membrane fouling alleviation than physio chemical effects of the mixed liquor suspension in a hybrid mbr therefore it is crucial to evaluate the impact of biocarrier addition for membrane fouling by eliminating the mechanical effects our previous study investigated the impact of polyvinyl formal pvfm biocarrier on membrane fouling and suggested that the static biocarrier is conducive to providing lower fouling propensity 5 however there is still limited study comparing the impacts of different static biocarriers on membrane fouling control recently nitrogen removal in mbr has attracted more attentions due to the increasingly strict discharge standards 11 similar to the conventional activated sludge the nitrogen removal in mbr relies on autotrophic nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification influent carbon to nitrogen ratio c n has been identified as one of the most influential parameters that affect nitrogen removal because the insufficient carbon source will restrict the efficiency of the denitrification process 12 14 additionally a low c n ratio may have an adverse impact on membrane fouling control as cell lysis and hydrolysis with limited available substrates for the microbes may stimulate the smp secretion 5 15 16 it must be pointed out that the influent of most municipal wastewater treatment plants has characteristics of low cod n ratio ranging from 5 0 to 12 5 11 17 18 biocarrier addition in mbr might not only have the potential to mitigate fouling but also facilitate the nitrogen removal with a low influent cod n ratio due to the formation of aerobic and anoxic environment beneficial for the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification processes 7 19 21 to the best of the author s knowledge there are limited studies focusing on the effect of different static biocarriers addition for process performance and membrane fouling under both low and high influent c n ratios the aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the effect of different static biocarriers on municipal wastewater treatment under high and low influent c n ratios and further to understand whether the impact of static biocarrier can improve the treatment performance and facilitate the membrane fouling control the specific objectives were i to compare the impact of polyurethane pu and polyvinyl chloride pvc as the static biocarrier for mbr treatment performance under high and low influent c n ratios ii to evaluate the effect of pu and pvc static biocarrier addition on mixed liquor characteristics and membrane fouling under high and low influent c n ratios and to iii investigate the effect of static biocarrier addition on microbial community and related it with the biocarrier physical properties treatment performance and membrane fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of static biocarriers two different static biocarriers polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyurethane pu were connected in series and evenly hung in the reactors the properties of the pvc and pu biological carrier were as follows porosity of 88 90 and 92 94 the density of 0 20 g cm3 and 0 03 g cm3 the specific surface area of 10 000 14 000 m2 m3 and 16 000 19 000 m2 m3 respectively zeta potential of the pvc and pu were monitored with 21 59 and 19 05 mv respectively table 1 2 2 lab scale membrane bioreactors and operational conditions three identical lab scale submerged mbr reactors were used in the experiment with an effective volume of 21 l fig 1 a flat sheet membrane module made of polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf pore size of 0 1 μm and surface area of 0 1 m2 was installed in the mbr reactor dafu jiangsu china the membrane module was operated with a 9 min permeate time and 1 min relaxation period the permeate was extracted by a peristaltic pump at a flux of 28 l m2 h equivalent to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h transmembrane membrane pressure tmp was monitored by pressure transducers beijing aosheng china and the membrane cycle finished when tmp reached 50 kpa biomass was withdrawn from the mbr reactors to keep mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration between 8 and 9 g l and solids retention time srt of 30 days the reactor temperature was maintained at an average temperature of 25 0 2 0 c air sparging was used with the specific aeration demand sadm of 2 4 m3 m 2 h 1 in order to provide a shear rate for membrane fouling control and keep the dissolved oxygen do of 2 0 mg l synthetic municipal wastewater containing sodium acetate 1292 9 mg l peptone 43 1 mg l nh4cl 98 7 mg l mgso4 13 9 mg l kh2po4 22 8 mg l yeast extract 17 2 mg l mgso4 13 9 mg l mnso4 1 6 mg l and feso4 0 3 mg l was prepared and fed to the reactor through a floating valve 5 22 which kept the constant reactor volume the carbon nitrogen ratio of 20 0 and 6 7 was adjusted by the proportions between sodium acetate and ammonium chloride aladdin shanghai china the experiment was carried out in two phases table 2 in which r1 conventional mbr cmbr r2 hmbr with a filling ratio of 6 pvc and r3 hmbr with a filling ratio of 6 pu were fed with high c n ratio influent of 20 0 phase i 0 30 days and low c n ratio influent of 6 7 phase ii 31 60 days respectively 2 3 cleaning protocols to characterize membrane foulants and critical flux tests after the membrane reached 50 kpa the following cleaning protocols were applied 1 rinse with tap water 2 backwash at a flux of 28 l m2 h with tap water 3 chemical clean with 0 5 sodium hypochlorite naclo solution the clean water permeability tests were subsequently conducted after each step to measure the remaining resistance and the total membrane resistance rt cake layer resistance rc and pore clogging resistance rp can be calculated the flux step method was applied based on applying successive flux increments of 5 l m2 h for 15 min as referred to le clech et al 23 the fouling rate dtmp dt was monitored 2 4 sequence analyses of microbial community the mixed liquor and attached biomass from the static biocarriers were collected at the end of the experimental trial microbial deoxyribonucleic acid dna was extracted using magbind soil dna kit omega usa according to the manufacturing protocols the v3 v4 regions of the bacterial 16 s ribosomal nucleic acid rna genes were amplified by pcr using universal primers 341f 805r illumina miseq sequencing and analyses were performed at lc science hangzhou china 2 5 analytical methods the analyses of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrate nitrite and mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were performed in accordance with the standard method 24 total nitrogen tn was calculated as the sum of ammonia nitrate and nitrite nitrogen do value was measured by a do meter ysi pro 20i usa the surface zeta potential of the biocarrier was tested by zeta potential analyzer anton paar surpass 3 austria the particle size distribution of mixed liquor suspension and the functional groups of membrane foulants were determined by a particle size analyzer lap w2000h yishite xiamen china and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir spectrometer nicoleet is50 thermofisher usa respectively the mass of attached biomass on the static carriers was determined according to the previous study 25 extracellular polymer substances eps were extracted by the thermal method protein and carbohydrate concentrations were measured using modified lowry 26 and phenol sulfuric acid method 27 respectively bovine serum protein bsa and glucose aladdin shanghai china were used as the standard reference for protein and carbohydrates 3 results and discussion 3 1 mbr process performance the organic and nitrogen removal in r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu reactors under both high and low influent c n ratios were shown table 3 excellent cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n removal efficiency of 97 98 and 98 99 were observed for all three reactors feeding with both high and low c n ratio influent consistently low total nitrogen of 2 0 mg l was obtained with high influent c n ratio whilst significantly higher tn of 14 18 mg l was observed with low influent c n ratio the nitrogen removal results indicated an excellent nitrification process but restricted denitrification process which is attributed to the limited carbon source under low influent c n ratio 11 12 this can be further validated by the nitrate no3 n accumulation 14 17 mg l in the mbr system under a low influent c n ratio interestingly hybrid mbr with pu showed significantly lower tn concentration in the effluent than cmbr this might be due to the aerobic anoxic microenvironment formation owing to the biomass attachment and oxygen concentration gradients on the pu static biocarrier 7 19 21 similarly li et al 28 also proved the formation of an anoxic anaerobic microenvironment inside a polyurethane foam biocarrier promoting the denitrification process and total nitrogen removal however this is not the case for hmbr with pvc addition and the difference between r2 and r3 reactors can be explained by the different physical properties of the static biocarriers the pu biocarrier has higher porosity specific surface area and less negative surface zeta potential than pvc table 1 providing better opportunities to the biomass attachment it must be pointed out that the tn removal efficiency is still not satisfied and further studies with modified biocarrier to provide carbon source is warranted 29 3 2 membrane fouling profiles fig 2 showed membrane fouling propensity of cmbr and hmbr with pvc and pu both under high and low influent c n ratios at the high influent c n ratio of 20 0 the r3 reactor with pu biocarrier addition significantly reduces the membrane fouling rate compared with r1 cmbr the membrane operation cycle period was extended from 6 5 to 9 75 days in r3 pu biocarrier which might be attributed to the impact of biocarrier addition on the mixed liquor suspensions 8 30 31 however r2 hmbr with pvc had a similarly high membrane fouling rate with r1 cmbr indicating that not all static biocarriers can effectively reduce the membrane fouling rate and this depends on the physical characterization of the biocarriers during phase ii under a low influent c n ratio of 6 7 higher fouling propensity was obtained for both r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc reactors this shortened the membrane cycle length up to 50 kpa from 6 5 to 7 days to only about 4 5 days and increased the membrane fouling rate from 0 32 to 0 46 kpa h which might be due to the higher smp production under a lower influent c n ratio 5 16 however consistently low fouling propensity of 0 21 0 26 kpa h was observed in hmbr with pu biocarrier regardless of influent c n ratio suggesting that pu biocarrier can mitigate the negative effects of low c n ratio on membrane fouling control to some extent and might be due to the alternation of the mixed liquor suspensions 32 3 3 characteristics of the mixed liquor suspensions the mlss concentrations in the mixed liquor of r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu were 8 8 0 1 g l 8 5 0 1 g l and 8 2 0 1 g l respectively table 2 the attached biomass on pvc and pu biocarrier were 200 mg l and 600 mg l this is similar to previous studies with 650 800 mg l attached biomass 9 10 whilst lee et al 33 reported significantly higher attached biomass of 4 3 17 g l on the polyurethane cubes with activated carbon coating this indicated that pu is easier for biomass attachment than pvc and the physical characteristics of biocarrier have a strong impact on the amount of the attached biomass as mlss was found to contribute to the cake layer formation lower mlss concentration might lead to a lower membrane fouling rate in the r3 reactor hmbr with pu 34 35 the particle size distribution was also affected by the biocarrier addition the particle measurement showed unimodal distributions for the mixed liquor from all three reactors with a corresponding d50 value of 170 5 μm in r3 hmbr with pu and 145 5 μm in r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc fig 3 the larger floc size in r3 indicated better sludge flocculation ability 31 and lower fouling propensity as the larger particles were more difficult to deposit on the membrane surface than smaller particles due to the higher shear induced diffusions 31 32 in terms of the effect of different influent c n ratios there is no noticeable impact on the particle size of mixed liquor suspensions the eps and smp concentration in r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu under high and low influent c n ratios were shown in fig 4 similar eps concentrations were observed in all three reactors indicating the limited effect of biocarrier addition on eps concentration 8 interestingly the reduced influent c n ratio from 20 0 to 6 7 did not affect the eps concentration but the proportions of protein and carbohydrates previous results also indicated that the influent c n ratio has a limited impact on total eps concentration but changed the protein to carbohydrates ratio 5 36 furthermore some studies demonstrated that eps chemical composition of was more critical for membrane fouling development 37 and further study about the impact of biocarrier addition and influent c n ratios on the eps functional groups and inter species interactions in the mixed liquor suspensions should be warranted 38 39 in terms of the smp concentration the pu biocarrier addition slightly reduced the smp concentration and smp p c ratios indicating that pu biocarrier addition can effectively reduce the smp concentrations especially the protein concentrations this is beneficial for membrane fouling control as protein has more hydrophobic properties than carbohydrates 2 the smp concentration and proportion change with pu biocarrier addition might be ascribed to the smp adsorption on the biocarrier 31 or the enrichment of slow growth bacteria using proteins as substrate 10 when the influent c n ratio reduced from 20 0 to 6 7 there was a significant increase of smp concentration for both cmbr and hmbr which might be due to the cell lysis and hydrolysis with limited available substrates 3 it is worth pointing out that the smp concentration in r3 hmbr with pu is still lower than the r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc reactors in order to further validate the impact of static biocarrier addition on the mixed liquor suspensions the critical flux test was conducted and results indicated a higher critical flux of 40 45 l m2 h in r3 hmbr with pu compared with 35 40 l m2 h in r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc fig s1 3 4 characteristic of membrane foulants although the r3 hmbr with pu reactor showed lower fouling propensity than r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc similar membrane resistance resistances distributions and fouling cake characterization was observed for all the three reactors regardless of the influent c n ratios table 4 the cake layer resistance occupied more than 90 of the total resistance which is similar to previous studies 8 16 slightly higher rp rt ratios were observed in r3 hmbr with pu compared with r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc which was most probably due to the extended operational period to reach 50 kpa in r3 even with slightly lower smp concentration slightly lower rc rt and higher rp rt were observed with under a low influent c n ratio of 6 7 which might be ascribed to the higher smp concentration severer pore clogging and higher membrane fouling rate 5 31 the ftir spectra of the membrane foulants are shown in fig s2 indicating similar profiles in all three reactors functional groups such as oh around 3350 cm 1 ch about 2930 cm 1 amides i and ii about 1615 cm 1 and 1537 cm 1 amide iii about 1378 cm 1 and 1240 cm 1 were observed in the membrane foulants 32 the above peaks and the distinct peak near 1050 cm 1 are attributed to the existence of protein and carbohydrates 4 comparing with the three spectra of membrane foulant in r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu it is clear that lower peaks at wavelengths of 1615 cm 1 1537 cm 1 1378 cm 1 1240 cm 1 and 1050 cm 1 were obtained in r3 hmbr with pu biocarrier suggesting lower protein and carbohydrates deposition on the membrane surface and lower fouling rate 3 5 analysis of microbial community to investigate the impact of different biocarriers on the main bacteria species in the mixed liquor and on the biocarriers the high throughput sequencing technology was used fig 5 the dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes nitrospirae and acidobacteria and their total relative abundance in r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu were 86 75 87 45 and 90 31 respectively fig 5a this is in good agreement with the previous studies on the microbial community structure of other biological sewage treatment systems 29 proteobacteria accounted for 48 90 54 46 and 57 16 of the total relative abundance in the mixed liquor of r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu which was considered as the main phyla for nitrification and denitrification 40 bacteroidetes can generally degrade organic matters and potentially release proteinaceous eps 12 41 42 the lower relative abundance of bacteroidetes with 11 84 in r3 reactor compared with 19 69 in r1 and 15 38 in r2 implying less proteinaceous eps secretion lower smp p c ratio and therefore lower membrane fouling rate fig 4 notably nitrospirae occupied 4 75 4 82 and 6 94 in r1 r3 mixed liquor which was mainly responsible for the nitrification process including the autotrophic metabolism and subsequent nitrite oxidizing 40 the significant increase in the relative abundance of these phyla in r3 provided powerful support for the effective nitrification and denitrification in the hmbr reactor with pu biocarrier in terms of the microbial community on the biocarrier of r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu a significantly higher proteobacteria phylum of 45 39 was observed in pu biocarrier compared with 34 90 in pvc biocarrier which was vital in the denitrification process for nitrogen removal 43 45 additionally bacteroidetes was the second predominant phylum on the pu biocarrier which may release protein and help other bacteria attachment to the biocarrier 17 fig 5b describes major classes in the bacterial community in mixed liquors and on biocarriers alphaproteobacteria 19 48 23 72 betaproteobacteria 10 07 22 94 cytophagia 5 09 8 43 sphingobacteria 3 49 8 26 and gammaproteobacteria 7 22 8 96 were the dominant classes in the mixed liquor in r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were considered to have a good denitrification capacity which is conducive for nitrogen removal 46 higher betaproteobacteria and nitrospira classes were obtained in the mixed liquor from the r3 hmbr with pu reactor indicating a better total nitrogen removal which was validated by the treatment performance results table 3 40 47 48 the lower relative abundance of sphingobacteria at class level in r3 hmbr with pu might contribute to less severe membrane fouling 49 furthermore alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and clostridia were the top three bacteria classes on r2 pvc and r3 pu biocarriers occupying about 32 98 and 57 49 of the total relative abundance of the bacterium at the class level higher gammaproteobacteria in r3 pu biocarrier as the pioneer of surface colonization on membranes implying that the pu biocarrier trapped most pioneer microorganisms and might be one of the reasons to have lower fouling propensity 32 50 the enriched clostridia on the r3 pu biocarrier of 20 93 compared with 3 19 on the r2 pvc biocarrier indicated better denitrification performance table 3 as it is known to have nitrate reducing activity 51 the microbial diversity at the genus level was presented fig 5c the static biocarrier addition facilitated the tauera and nitro spira accumulation in the mixed liquor which is more obvious in the r3 hmbr with pu reactor as the above two bacteria at the genus level are closely related to nitrification and denitrification processes 29 40 this result might be used to explain better total nitrogen removal in r3 reactor with pu biocarrier addition even under a low influent c n ratio on the other hand sphingobacterials unclassified and ohtaekwangia were reported to secrete eps and lower relative abundance in the r3 hmbr with pu mixed liquor indicated lower fouling propensity 52 53 in terms of the bacteria community on the biocarrier thauera amaricoccus solitalea and sphingobacteriales unclassified were enriched which participated in nitrification and denitrification 29 54 55 furthermore more sphingobacteriales unclassified amacricoccus and nitrospira were observed on r3 pu than r2 pvc biocarrier this is consistent with the mbr process treatment results indicating better total nitrogen removal in r3 hmbr with pu biocarrier reactor even under a low influent c n ratio table 3 pca analysis based on unweighted unifrac distances was used to compare the whole structure of the mixed liquor and biocarrier microbiomes fig 5d the distance from the pca plot between the mixed liquor and biocarriers were long indicating that microbiomes were different interestingly the pca plot positions of mixed liquor in r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc were close to each other whilst mixed liquor in r3 hmbr with pu were far from the former two reactors suggesting that the pu biocarrier addition significantly influenced the microbial composition in the mixed liquor of mbr moreover the differentiated location of the microbiomes on the r2 pvc and r3 pu biocarrier indicated a distinctive microbiome structure on these two biocarriers 4 conclusions this study investigated the impact of two different static biocarriers pvc and pu addition in mbr for process performance membrane fouling and microbial community treating municipal wastewater under high and low c n ratios the following conclusions can be drawn hmbr with pu biocarrier addition can significantly improve the total nitrogen removal efficiency with a low influent c n ratio of 6 7 whilst pvc addition has a marginally positive effect on mbr process performance hmbr with pu biocarrier can also facilitate the membrane fouling control regardless of the influent c n ratio indicating that pu biocarrier can mitigate the negative effects of low influent c n ratio on membrane fouling control to some extent pu biocarrier addition in the mbr altered the bulk sludge characteristics with lower smp concentration lower smp p c ratio and bigger particle size pu biocarrier addition also changed the microbial community with a higher relative abundance of tauera amaricoccus and nitro spira in the mixed liquor and solitalea and sphingobacteriales unclassified on the biocarrier indicating the enrichment of nitrification and denitrification bacteria pu biocarrier addition also reduced the relative abundance of eps secretion related bacteria sphingobacterials unclassified and ohtaekwangia and mitigated the membrane fouling propensity the dramatically different effect on pu and pvc biocarrier addition in the mbr can be explained by the physical properties of the static biocarrier since pu has higher porosity specific surface area and less negative surface zeta potential than pvc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

biocarrier was tested by zeta potential analyzer anton paar surpass 3 austria the particle size distribution of mixed liquor suspension and the functional groups of membrane foulants were determined by a particle size analyzer lap w2000h yishite xiamen china and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir spectrometer nicoleet is50 thermofisher usa respectively the mass of attached biomass on the static carriers was determined according to the previous study 25 extracellular polymer substances eps were extracted by the thermal method protein and carbohydrate concentrations were measured using modified lowry 26 and phenol sulfuric acid method 27 respectively bovine serum protein bsa and glucose aladdin shanghai china were used as the standard reference for protein and carbohydrates 3 results and discussion 3 1 mbr process performance the organic and nitrogen removal in r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu reactors under both high and low influent c n ratios were shown table 3 excellent cod and ammonia nitrogen nh4 n removal efficiency of 97 98 and 98 99 were observed for all three reactors feeding with both high and low c n ratio influent consistently low total nitrogen of 2 0 mg l was obtained with high influent c n ratio whilst significantly higher tn of 14 18 mg l was observed with low influent c n ratio the nitrogen removal results indicated an excellent nitrification process but restricted denitrification process which is attributed to the limited carbon source under low influent c n ratio 11 12 this can be further validated by the nitrate no3 n accumulation 14 17 mg l in the mbr system under a low influent c n ratio interestingly hybrid mbr with pu showed significantly lower tn concentration in the effluent than cmbr this might be due to the aerobic anoxic microenvironment formation owing to the biomass attachment and oxygen concentration gradients on the pu static biocarrier 7 19 21 similarly li et al 28 also proved the formation of an anoxic anaerobic microenvironment inside a polyurethane foam biocarrier promoting the denitrification process and total nitrogen removal however this is not the case for hmbr with pvc addition and the difference between r2 and r3 reactors can be explained by the different physical properties of the static biocarriers the pu biocarrier has higher porosity specific surface area and less negative surface zeta potential than pvc table 1 providing better opportunities to the biomass attachment it must be pointed out that the tn removal efficiency is still not satisfied and further studies with modified biocarrier to provide carbon source is warranted 29 3 2 membrane fouling profiles fig 2 showed membrane fouling propensity of cmbr and hmbr with pvc and pu both under high and low influent c n ratios at the high influent c n ratio of 20 0 the r3 reactor with pu biocarrier addition significantly reduces the membrane fouling rate compared with r1 cmbr the membrane operation cycle period was extended from 6 5 to 9 75 days in r3 pu biocarrier which might be attributed to the impact of biocarrier addition on the mixed liquor suspensions 8 30 31 however r2 hmbr with pvc had a similarly high membrane fouling rate with r1 cmbr indicating that not all static biocarriers can effectively reduce the membrane fouling rate and this depends on the physical characterization of the biocarriers during phase ii under a low influent c n ratio of 6 7 higher fouling propensity was obtained for both r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc reactors this shortened the membrane cycle length up to 50 kpa from 6 5 to 7 days to only about 4 5 days and increased the membrane fouling rate from 0 32 to 0 46 kpa h which might be due to the higher smp production under a lower influent c n ratio 5 16 however consistently low fouling propensity of 0 21 0 26 kpa h was observed in hmbr with pu biocarrier regardless of influent c n ratio suggesting that pu biocarrier can mitigate the negative effects of low c n ratio on membrane fouling control to some extent and might be due to the alternation of the mixed liquor suspensions 32 3 3 characteristics of the mixed liquor suspensions the mlss concentrations in the mixed liquor of r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu were 8 8 0 1 g l 8 5 0 1 g l and 8 2 0 1 g l respectively table 2 the attached biomass on pvc and pu biocarrier were 200 mg l and 600 mg l this is similar to previous studies with 650 800 mg l attached biomass 9 10 whilst lee et al 33 reported significantly higher attached biomass of 4 3 17 g l on the polyurethane cubes with activated carbon coating this indicated that pu is easier for biomass attachment than pvc and the physical characteristics of biocarrier have a strong impact on the amount of the attached biomass as mlss was found to contribute to the cake layer formation lower mlss concentration might lead to a lower membrane fouling rate in the r3 reactor hmbr with pu 34 35 the particle size distribution was also affected by the biocarrier addition the particle measurement showed unimodal distributions for the mixed liquor from all three reactors with a corresponding d50 value of 170 5 μm in r3 hmbr with pu and 145 5 μm in r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc fig 3 the larger floc size in r3 indicated better sludge flocculation ability 31 and lower fouling propensity as the larger particles were more difficult to deposit on the membrane surface than smaller particles due to the higher shear induced diffusions 31 32 in terms of the effect of different influent c n ratios there is no noticeable impact on the particle size of mixed liquor suspensions the eps and smp concentration in r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu under high and low influent c n ratios were shown in fig 4 similar eps concentrations were observed in all three reactors indicating the limited effect of biocarrier addition on eps concentration 8 interestingly the reduced influent c n ratio from 20 0 to 6 7 did not affect the eps concentration but the proportions of protein and carbohydrates previous results also indicated that the influent c n ratio has a limited impact on total eps concentration but changed the protein to carbohydrates ratio 5 36 furthermore some studies demonstrated that eps chemical composition of was more critical for membrane fouling development 37 and further study about the impact of biocarrier addition and influent c n ratios on the eps functional groups and inter species interactions in the mixed liquor suspensions should be warranted 38 39 in terms of the smp concentration the pu biocarrier addition slightly reduced the smp concentration and smp p c ratios indicating that pu biocarrier addition can effectively reduce the smp concentrations especially the protein concentrations this is beneficial for membrane fouling control as protein has more hydrophobic properties than carbohydrates 2 the smp concentration and proportion change with pu biocarrier addition might be ascribed to the smp adsorption on the biocarrier 31 or the enrichment of slow growth bacteria using proteins as substrate 10 when the influent c n ratio reduced from 20 0 to 6 7 there was a significant increase of smp concentration for both cmbr and hmbr which might be due to the cell lysis and hydrolysis with limited available substrates 3 it is worth pointing out that the smp concentration in r3 hmbr with pu is still lower than the r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc reactors in order to further validate the impact of static biocarrier addition on the mixed liquor suspensions the critical flux test was conducted and results indicated a higher critical flux of 40 45 l m2 h in r3 hmbr with pu compared with 35 40 l m2 h in r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc fig s1 3 4 characteristic of membrane foulants although the r3 hmbr with pu reactor showed lower fouling propensity than r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc similar membrane resistance resistances distributions and fouling cake characterization was observed for all the three reactors regardless of the influent c n ratios table 4 the cake layer resistance occupied more than 90 of the total resistance which is similar to previous studies 8 16 slightly higher rp rt ratios were observed in r3 hmbr with pu compared with r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc which was most probably due to the extended operational period to reach 50 kpa in r3 even with slightly lower smp concentration slightly lower rc rt and higher rp rt were observed with under a low influent c n ratio of 6 7 which might be ascribed to the higher smp concentration severer pore clogging and higher membrane fouling rate 5 31 the ftir spectra of the membrane foulants are shown in fig s2 indicating similar profiles in all three reactors functional groups such as oh around 3350 cm 1 ch about 2930 cm 1 amides i and ii about 1615 cm 1 and 1537 cm 1 amide iii about 1378 cm 1 and 1240 cm 1 were observed in the membrane foulants 32 the above peaks and the distinct peak near 1050 cm 1 are attributed to the existence of protein and carbohydrates 4 comparing with the three spectra of membrane foulant in r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu it is clear that lower peaks at wavelengths of 1615 cm 1 1537 cm 1 1378 cm 1 1240 cm 1 and 1050 cm 1 were obtained in r3 hmbr with pu biocarrier suggesting lower protein and carbohydrates deposition on the membrane surface and lower fouling rate 3 5 analysis of microbial community to investigate the impact of different biocarriers on the main bacteria species in the mixed liquor and on the biocarriers the high throughput sequencing technology was used fig 5 the dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes nitrospirae and acidobacteria and their total relative abundance in r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu were 86 75 87 45 and 90 31 respectively fig 5a this is in good agreement with the previous studies on the microbial community structure of other biological sewage treatment systems 29 proteobacteria accounted for 48 90 54 46 and 57 16 of the total relative abundance in the mixed liquor of r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu which was considered as the main phyla for nitrification and denitrification 40 bacteroidetes can generally degrade organic matters and potentially release proteinaceous eps 12 41 42 the lower relative abundance of bacteroidetes with 11 84 in r3 reactor compared with 19 69 in r1 and 15 38 in r2 implying less proteinaceous eps secretion lower smp p c ratio and therefore lower membrane fouling rate fig 4 notably nitrospirae occupied 4 75 4 82 and 6 94 in r1 r3 mixed liquor which was mainly responsible for the nitrification process including the autotrophic metabolism and subsequent nitrite oxidizing 40 the significant increase in the relative abundance of these phyla in r3 provided powerful support for the effective nitrification and denitrification in the hmbr reactor with pu biocarrier in terms of the microbial community on the biocarrier of r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu a significantly higher proteobacteria phylum of 45 39 was observed in pu biocarrier compared with 34 90 in pvc biocarrier which was vital in the denitrification process for nitrogen removal 43 45 additionally bacteroidetes was the second predominant phylum on the pu biocarrier which may release protein and help other bacteria attachment to the biocarrier 17 fig 5b describes major classes in the bacterial community in mixed liquors and on biocarriers alphaproteobacteria 19 48 23 72 betaproteobacteria 10 07 22 94 cytophagia 5 09 8 43 sphingobacteria 3 49 8 26 and gammaproteobacteria 7 22 8 96 were the dominant classes in the mixed liquor in r1 cmbr r2 hmbr with pvc and r3 hmbr with pu alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were considered to have a good denitrification capacity which is conducive for nitrogen removal 46 higher betaproteobacteria and nitrospira classes were obtained in the mixed liquor from the r3 hmbr with pu reactor indicating a better total nitrogen removal which was validated by the treatment performance results table 3 40 47 48 the lower relative abundance of sphingobacteria at class level in r3 hmbr with pu might contribute to less severe membrane fouling 49 furthermore alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and clostridia were the top three bacteria classes on r2 pvc and r3 pu biocarriers occupying about 32 98 and 57 49 of the total relative abundance of the bacterium at the class level higher gammaproteobacteria in r3 pu biocarrier as the pioneer of surface colonization on membranes implying that the pu biocarrier trapped most pioneer microorganisms and might be one of the reasons to have lower fouling propensity 32 50 the enriched clostridia on the r3 pu biocarrier of 20 93 compared with 3 19 on the r2 pvc biocarrier indicated better denitrification performance table 3 as it is known to have nitrate reducing activity 51 the microbial diversity at the genus level was presented fig 5c the static biocarrier addition facilitated the tauera and nitro spira accumulation in the mixed liquor which is more obvious in the r3 hmbr with pu reactor as the above two bacteria at the genus level are closely related to nitrification and denitrification processes 29 40 this result might be used to explain better total nitrogen removal in r3 reactor with pu biocarrier addition even under a low influent c n ratio on the other hand sphingobacterials unclassified and ohtaekwangia were reported to secrete eps and lower relative abundance in the r3 hmbr with pu mixed liquor indicated lower fouling propensity 52 53 in terms of the bacteria community on the biocarrier thauera amaricoccus solitalea and sphingobacteriales unclassified were enriched which participated in nitrification and denitrification 29 54 55 furthermore more sphingobacteriales unclassified amacricoccus and nitrospira were observed on r3 pu than r2 pvc biocarrier this is consistent with the mbr process treatment results indicating better total nitrogen removal in r3 hmbr with pu biocarrier reactor even under a low influent c n ratio table 3 pca analysis based on unweighted unifrac distances was used to compare the whole structure of the mixed liquor and biocarrier microbiomes fig 5d the distance from the pca plot between the mixed liquor and biocarriers were long indicating that microbiomes were different interestingly the pca plot positions of mixed liquor in r1 cmbr and r2 hmbr with pvc were close to each other whilst mixed liquor in r3 hmbr with pu were far from the former two reactors suggesting that the pu biocarrier addition significantly influenced the microbial composition in the mixed liquor of mbr moreover the differentiated location of the microbiomes on the r2 pvc and r3 pu biocarrier indicated a distinctive microbiome structure on these two biocarriers 4 conclusions this study investigated the impact of two different static biocarriers pvc and pu addition in mbr for process performance membrane fouling and microbial community treating municipal wastewater under high and low c n ratios the following conclusions can be drawn hmbr with pu biocarrier addition can significantly improve the total nitrogen removal efficiency with a low influent c n ratio of 6 7 whilst pvc addition has a marginally positive effect on mbr process performance hmbr with pu biocarrier can also facilitate the membrane fouling control regardless of the influent c n ratio indicating that pu biocarrier can mitigate the negative effects of low influent c n ratio on membrane fouling control to some extent pu biocarrier addition in the mbr altered the bulk sludge characteristics with lower smp concentration lower smp p c ratio and bigger particle size pu biocarrier addition also changed the microbial community with a higher relative abundance of tauera amaricoccus and nitro spira in the mixed liquor and solitalea and sphingobacteriales unclassified on the biocarrier indicating the enrichment of nitrification and denitrification bacteria pu biocarrier addition also reduced the relative abundance of eps secretion related bacteria sphingobacterials unclassified and ohtaekwangia and mitigated the membrane fouling propensity the dramatically different effect on pu and pvc biocarrier addition in the mbr can be explained by the physical properties of the static biocarrier since pu has higher porosity specific surface area and less negative

methods keywords ciprofloxacin removal photocatalytic degradation non clinical environment 1 introduction the presence of pollution in water bodies has increased due to excessive human activities such as the use of pharmaceuticals industrial dyes cosmetics pesticides and non biodegradable materials which have become fundamental uses in the current era researchers and scientists working in this field are concerned about the risks associated with these pollutants for humans and the environment 1 taking into account their extensive use in veterinary and human treatment and their accumulative occurrence in the marine environment personal care products ppcps and pharmaceuticals have been identified as emerging microorganism contaminants over the last 40 years ppcps are discovered at low concentrations in the environment mostly as metabolites secreted by people and animals or waste discharged into wastewater from pharmacies chemical manufacturing facilities and hospitals 2 antibiotics are depleting on the world market on a scale of 100 000 200 000 t per year globally antibiotics reach the world s water systems through various routes including discharge from pharmaceutical and associated businesses hospital effluents and human sewage 3 in 2010 the antibiotic used for the treatment of livestock treatment in livestock reached approximately 63 151 tons and was predicted to increase in 2030 by 67 4 the use of antibiotics in 76 countries from 2000 to 2015 increased by 65 in terms of defined daily doses ddd with approximately 21 35 billion ddd while approximately 39 increased the consumption rate per day 5 one of these serious environmental concerns and hazards is antibiotics which represent a significant threat to global public health caused by their low level toxicity to bacteria at low levels and their ability to build resistance among different species of natural bacterial species as well as the poor technology of wastewater treatment efficiency for their removal 6 these antibiotic related concerns result from improper sample disposal in industrial wastewater and industrial wastewater and the widespread use of antibiotics for human and veterinary medicine 7 8 waste from the animal farms use in aquaculture and wastewater from hospitals urban stream animal manure municipalities domestic and antibiotic industrial are major sources of antimicrobial resistance amr genes in bacterial pathogens and antibiotic pollution in the environment 9 ciprofloxacin cip have ability to inhibits the growth of microorganisms and can represent an important hazard for the environment specifically for soil microbial ecology and it can adversely impact the microbial ecosystem services cip strongly prevents the microbial activities in both systems 10 in low and middle income countries lmics antimicrobial misuse and mismanagement is a public health issue and this practice contributes to antibiotic resistance there is a strong relationship strong and occurrence between several antibiotics present in non clinical samples hospital wastewater home water purification systems wastewater surface water and wastewater planes such as cip norfloxacin doxycycline and lincomycin the presence of these antibiotics in the environment represents a source of bacterial resistance fluoroquinolone fq antibiotics including the market share are largely due to their ability to treat many diseases their market presence and global sales the current paper reviews sustainable methods for removing cip from the non clinical environment and highlights the most efficient techniques used to remove cip numerous studies have been reported about the degradation of cip by different advanced oxidation processes aop systems hassani et al published a paper on electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops this research focuses on sonoelectrochemical processes namely ultrasound assisted electrochemical us electrochemical processing of different organic contaminants 11 another study discussed the application of nanostructured modified layered double hydroxides ldhs materials as emerging catalyst materials with greater anion exchange capacity and inner layer water molecules the ldss are used as catalysts in aops for various organic pollutants removal 12 a photocatalytic degradation is an alternative approach for removing pharmaceutical compounds from water for instance antibiotics due to the poor photocatalysts efficiency achieving an optimum rate is difficult the artificial z scheme photocatalyst generally involves two attached semiconductor photocatalysts according to hassani et al 13 z scheme photocatalysis has become a research hotspot due to its high redox ability charge carrier isolation as well as capacity to utilise visible light since the methods of cip treatment have not completed collected acknowledged and assessed previously the treatment procedures and mechanisms that are influenced by many variables have been presented and analyzed emphasizing the significance of the present work s exclusivity through jupyter notebook software using python codes the novelty of this review paper was the use of the

countries in most publication projects in the field of sustainable methods used for the removal of cip removal from wastewater were china with 19 97 the usa with 9 7 india with 6 97 and germany with 4 54 as presented in fig 1b 3 antibiotics in the fresh market wastewater the presence of antibiotics pollution in the fresh market wastewater as well as the water bodies receiving such wastes has increased as a result of the excessive human activities in the aquaculture industries in malaysia fresh market wastes include the liquid and solid wastes generated from the fresh market centres these wastes have several infectious agents generated from the vegetables fruits and meats in terms of pathogenicity the infectious agents from fresh market wastes have less pathogenicity for human except for those coming from the meats however some of the pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella spp have high ability to infect a wide range of organisms from insects to human antibiotic resistant bacteria in fresh market wastewater are caused by antibiotic overuse in meat and chicken washing processes the bacterial cells have developed a resistance mechanism to antimicrobial agents due to the presence of antibiotics in these wastewaters several studies have shown that antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes such as macrolides erma ermb sulfonamides sul1 sul2 tetracyclines tetm teto tetw tets tetq tetx tetb β lactamase blaoxa blatem blakpc aminoglycosides qepa oqxa oqxb qnrs ampenicols flor cat2 exist in food wastes the most common detected antibiotics are sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethazine quinolones ofloxacin enrofloxacin ciprofloxacin macrolides and fluoroquinolones he et al 2019 chen et al 2021 fig 2 present the listed the antibiotics and arb in the fresh market wastewater based on the bibliometric analysis for database obtained from scopus it was noted that the most four common antibiotics in the fresh market wastewater included gentamicin 9 tetracycline 9 ciprofloxacin 8 5 and ampicillin 7 0 5 fig 2b the most common pathogenic bacteria in fresh market wastewater included salmonella spp 52 4 escherichia coli 10 45 staphylococcus aureus 8 8 halomonas sp campylobacter spp halobacillus spp pseudomonas aeruginosa bacillus subtilis listeria spp and xanthomonas campestris fig 2c among the salmonella spp s enterica strains was the most predominate with 12 4 ciprofloxacin ciprofloxacin cip belongs to the second generation of the fluoroquinolone fq drug class it is a bactericidal antibiotic and one of the most widely used fq antibiotics worldwide with a solubility of 30 g l cip was originally commercially available in 1987 and has been shown to have a wide antibacterial activity 14 according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac cip s entire chemical name is 1 cyclopropyl 6 fluoro 1 4 dihydro 4 oxo 7 1piperazinyl 3 quinoline carboxylic acid its molecular weight is given by 331 4 g mol and its empirical formula is denoted c17h18fn3o3 cip resembles a broad spectrum antibiotic to treat gram negative and gram positive bacterial infections 15 bone and joint infections respiratory tract infections gastroenteritis malignant otitis externa cellulitis urinary tract infections endocarditis chancroid prostatitis and anthrax are generally treated with cip 16 it was recommended for use throughout the 2001 anthrax outbreak and has been applied to treat biological agents of typhoid and legionnaire s disease 17 the last three decades have seen the development of numerous cip derivatives with diverse biological properties as presented in table 1 the antibacterial characteristic remains the most common research area for derivatives of cip 18 the attitude of action of antibiotics was carried out through several mechanisms of action for example immobilize the production of the bacterial cell wall that protects cells from the external environment interfering with protein synthesis by linking the machinery that builds proteins and amino acids from amino acids 19 create disorder with metabolic processes such as folic acid synthesis the b vitamin in which bacteria thrive 20 and preventing dna synthesis 21 the mechanism of cip acts by inhibiting the enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv acquired for the replication repair and transcription of bacterial dna replication repair and transcription 22 cip inhibits proliferative potential by meddling with its ability to proliferate cellular 23 as shown in fig 3 5 cip in the environment according to several previous investigations ciprofloxacin cip has been found on the faces of animals wastewater soil and the aquatic ecosystem 24 26 the origin of cip in the environment is separated into various sources such as pharmaceutical manufacturers human use in the house and in hospitals veterinary applications and the use of antimicrobials in livestock agriculture and aquaculture which were discharged into wastewater treatment plants fig 4 represents the sources pathways and receptors of cip in the environment most sources of cip in the environment are humans and its utilities such as hospitals medical centers and antibiotic production factories fig 4 antibiotics are also used as additives in animal feed chickens and cows can be fed these additives to gain weight and speed up their growth since animals also use only a small portion of the antimicrobial drugs they ingest the spread of antimicrobials from animal waste is a major concern although small holder systems rely less on antibacterial drugs they often use common store medications without consulting a veterinarian excessive and sub lethal doses encourage genetic and phenotypic changes in susceptible bacteria that survive those doses although there are many gaps in understanding antibacterial resistance the evidence of antibacterial resistance in diets is growing and indicates the need for urgent action joint work across all sectors and food production areas from farm to table will provide an important contribution to an integrated approach to address antimicrobial resistance the cip antibiotics and their derivatives are widely used in animal husbandry these antibiotics reach animal waste in high concentrations in the surrounding environment the incidence of these antibiotics in the water leads to the reproduction of antibiotic resistant bacteria accelerating the purification of wastewater and reducing the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria in water and soil is essential short and long term vulnerability to cip in wastewater reduces the efficacy of nitrogen and phosphorus removal and remove nutrients it also affects intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoates and glycogen transformation in the anoxic and oxic treatment stages the mechanism process showed that exposure to phosphorus uptake processes and cip suppressed denitrification 27 shen et al 28 demonstrated the toxicity of cip in zebrafish cip affected cardiac dysfunction by reducing heart rate due to significant inhibition of genes such as the cardiac troponin and catpase atp2a1l gene excess cip consumption results in neurological illnesses diseases and allergies damage to internal organs hemorrhage in the digestive system and blood leukopenia the presence of cip in hospital wastewater 29 sewage treatment plants 30 non environmental clinics 31 rivers 32 and even in the home water system has become common and become very problematic worldwide 33 numerous studies indicate that the small concentration of cip in surface water and wastewater is an environmental hazard as it can cause resistance to bacterial antibiotics 34 numerous studies have indicated and developed modern technologies to remove cip from the aquatic environment including physical chemical and biological treatments physical removal methods include non filtration ultrafiltration reverse osmosis absorption by physicochemical methods 35 the biological removal methods contain hybrid technology aerobic and anaerobic methods 36 chemical removal methods including ion exchange electrocoagulation and advanced oxidation processes aops 37 generally use hydroxyl radicals the ultimate oxidant for the remediation of organic contaminants in wastewater aops could merge with ultraviolet uv irradiation catalyst ozone o3 sonolysis 38 39 photocatalysts 40 sonocatalytic process 41 and nanotechnology 42 to offer a powerful and powerful wastewater treatment as presented in fig 5 some of these methods are limited by their lack of effectiveness the fact that they consume excessive amounts of energy and the complicated implementation method the adoption of such technologies on a wide scale is limited 43 the use of adsorption to remove cip has been extensively and effectively examined throughout the years and was highly efficient with a removal percentage of 95 as long as the correct adsorbent is used 44 it is not expensive to operate does not require complex design and is not adversely affected by toxic substances 45 the ultraviolet cell microbial electrolysis ultraviolet cell meuc method has recently demonstrated its promising ability to extract cip rich from industrial wastewater at concentrations of 6863 79 2 21 μg l and cod 6840 110 mg l when the execution circumstances were controlled at ph 7 8 imposed 0 6 v voltage 10 mw cm 2 uv intensity and 0 005 ml min ml cathodic aeration velocity the meuc procedure achieved 100 expulsion of cip 99 1 cod removal in 12 60 and 30 h accordingly and 100 decolorization 46 6 comparative studies on the concentrations of cip in aquatic bodies the concentration of ciprofloxacin cip in hospital wastewater home water purification systems wastewater and surface water varies from country to country with lower to higher levels table 2 cips with high biodegradation resistance and high solubility are regularly detected in high concentrations in effluents particularly in hospitals and non clinical wastewater environments it was discovered that the highest concentrations of cip are initiated in pharmaceutical factories and hospital wastewater in vietnam with concentrations ranging from 41 000 to 44 000 ng l due to the large amounts of cip disposed of in wastewater 47 49 followed by raw hospital raw wastewater in brazil 34 000 ng l 50 in china minimal concentrations of 2 5 ng l and a range of 3 9 to 5 9 ng l were reported in residential properties and home water purification systems 33 51 minimum concentrations have been recorded in residential land blocks and home water purification systems in china with 2 5 ng l and a range of 3 9 to 5 9 ng l 7 potential removal methods of cip from the non clinical and non clinical environment 7 1 adsorption of cip adsorption is widely used to remove contaminants from water for various purposes the method by which contaminant molecules aggregate on the top of a solid at the interface between the two phases present is termed adsorption the adsorbate is the contaminant that has been adsorbed while the adsorbent is solid several adsorbents all having different efficiencies and adsorption capacities have accomplished the process of removing cip through adsorption table 3 presents the adsorbents the synthesis method and the operational parameters used to remove cip the adsorption capacity of cip ranges from 1 74 mg cip g of multi wall carbon nanotube mwcnt 52 to 427 3 mg cip g of hollow co3s4 53 for many purposes along with the capacity to activate hydrogen peroxide h2o2 molecules adsorbents such as activated carbon or biochar should be treated with physical or chemical treatments to improve their surface area characteristics high surface area and pore volume result in a larger adsorption capacity resulting in superior performance for the removal of cip 54 57 kanjilal et al 58 stated that nanoadsorbents are efficient and cost effective materials that can be derived from waste precursors their pore diameters are typically tiny necessitating more time for cip intraparticle diffusion it has a wide surface area strong reactivity many active site contaminant interactions and is easy to separate 59 carbon based adsorbents produced by thermochemical methods often have heterogeneous surfaces 60 the adsorbent has a range of functional groups where chemical interactions occur with cip and organic compounds such as co co and oh occur which can favorably enhance adsorption 61 yu et al 62 examined the interaction mechanism between carbon nanotubes and cip to ensure that adsorbent adsorption properties of the adsorbent are accurate in wastewater treatment multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt with a 4 7 oxygen content cnt 4 7 o were chosen because of their superior adsorption properties the chemical surface functionalization of mwcnts may have an effect on their ability to adsorb target contaminants the increased adsorption capacity can be attributed to the larger average pore diameter of mwcnts 63 rumman et al 64 demonstrated the effectiveness of mesoporous silica nanoparticles as adsorbents of cip due to their large surface area well structured characteristics regular channel structure and surface modification because of the inclusion of silanol sioh groups this kind of adsorbent has a negatively charged surface making it more suited for cation adsorption since the amine group increases the efficiency of adsorption systems for dyes heavy metals and antibiotics the amination of mcm 41 mcm 41 nh2 has attracted considerable interest in this area according to peñafiel et al 65 organic residues such as corn cob and rice husk products generate a significant volume of lignocellulosic waste with adsorbent capabilities they have been extensively investigated as precursors for the manufacture of activated carbons which are utilized to remove cip from wastewater cip was removed from hospital wastewater using electrocoagulation ec using aluminum electrodes according to ahmadzadeh et al 66 given optimal working conditions of ph 7 78 interelectrode spacing 1 cm reaction period 20 min current density 12 5 ma cm 2 and electrolyte dose of 0 07 m nacl having a baseline cip concentration of 32 5 mg l the ec technique was efficient with removal effectiveness of 88 57 in conclusion the adsorption and biodegradation are the two major removal pathways for antibiotics such as cip 67 7 2 factors affecting cip adsorption numerous factors for instance time temperature adsorbent concentrations cip concentration and ph interact to establish cip adsorption effectiveness additional characteristics such as bed height wastewater flow rate and particle size were studied by 55 cip that is adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent appears to behave like that of heavy metals the adsorbent capacity is seriously influenced by ph which is one of the most crucial process parameters the solution ph affects the adsorptive degree of molecule ionization and surface properties 57 it is eminent that cip is highly soluble in water at both low and high ph levels and that its molecule behaves as an ion either a cation or an anion when the ph differs from 7 5 68 batch studies were used to conduct the removal trials table 4 where the ph used ranges from ph 3 to 12 the best ph to remove the most cip was ph 5 5 the ph pzc point of zero charges and the pka factors affect cip when ph changes 44 at low ph less than pzc 5 5 cationic adsorption occurs while zwitterionic adsorption occurs in a range of ph levels from 5 5 to 7 7 this range is considered the least soluble in which ph at 7 5 is approaching the lowest solubility in water caused by its neutral charge a ph 7 7 is considered anionic it is easy to see that the ionic cip form is attracted to the surface of the adsorbent due to its positive charge which makes it more efficient in the adsorption process 69 referring to previous studies the high adsorption of cip by nickel oxide nanoparticles nio np nanoceria ceo2 nps and acid activated carbon was recorded at ph 3 to ph 5 44 70 referring to the data in table 3 the correlation between factors has been analyzed using the heat map figure generated by jupyter notebook using python code fig 6 illustrates the correlation between the parameters condition and the removal percentage the different types of adsorbent and synthesis processes impact the removal process despite this they were left out of the correlation factor figure the closer the correlation is to 1 0 the stronger the link between the two variables which implies that if one increases the other increases as well the highest percentage that could affect the removal process was the concentration of cip with a correlation coefficient of 0 19 out of 1 0 the adsorption process s lowest percentage that had the least effect was the adsorbents dose these results may differ from many studies and the reason behind that could be the different types of adsorbent and the synthesis method used previous studies showed that it is evident that when the initial concentration of cip increased the adsorption efficiency decreased and the adsorption capacity mg g raised the reason behind this is that is there are only a limited number of adsorption sites available on the surface of the adsorbent surface due to set doses these sites become saturated at higher antibiotic concentrations 71 73 if the adsorbent dosage is increased the adsorption capacity decreases this is because cip exposes and saturates the adsorption sites more quickly at a low adsorbent dosage although using a larger amount of adsorbent results in excess of unoccupied adsorption sites throughout the adsorption process this results in a reduced adsorption capacity 53 70 wu et al 74 stated that the removal effectiveness increases with adsorbent dose this is because the adsorption occurs mostly at active locations at high adsorbent concentrations the elimination process is enhanced as the temperature is decreased from 30 c to 25 c since 0 62 is the negative correlation that is close to 1 0 all other variables are correlated with each other with a higher number and the darker the shade of red or blue in prior findings the contact time parameter has previously been utilized to estimate the amount of cip that diffuses through the solid liquid layer and into particle pores upon crossing past the bulk aqueous layer the cip adsorption capacity increased at the first stated minutes of the adsorption process an increasing period of time will positively affect the removal efficiency and then slowly approach equilibrium which in this phase no longer affects the removal efficiency 44 53 75 according to certain research increasing the temperature to a specific range see table 3 improves the adsorption process efficiency in experiments 72 76 the removal effectiveness was found to be high when low concentrations of cip were used at high temperatures it is reasonable to infer that as the temperature rises the adsorbent pore size of the material can be more active it stops accepting components to adhere to the pores of the adsorbent material after reaching its maximum adsorption 77 the adsorption capacities also increase with temperature 74 7 3 kinetics and isotherms of cip removal several models such as langmuir and freundlich pseudo first order and pseudo second order are used to describe the efficacy and capacity of adsorbents empirically in removing contaminants from effluents at constant temperature and equilibrium these models show how the pollutant s are absorbed and how the chemical kinetics occur studies on the cip kinetics and isotherm depend on the adsorbent s composition the pseudo second order kinetic model was applied to suit cip adsorption of cip utilizing activated carbon chitosan biochar hydrogel beads cbhb mcm 41 sio2 fe3o4 nanoparticles and fe3o4 c composite the langmuir model was connected as best fit isotherm data r2 0 97 0 99 64 69 78 79 the adsorption of cip on the k carrageenan sodium alginate adsorbent fulfilled the pseudo second order kinetic model 80 the langmuir and freundlich models were associated as isotherm data organic residues and ceo2 np discovered that the experimental adsorption data suited the freundlich model 40 najafpoor et al 75 and gulen and demircivi 81 revealed contradictory conclusions using γ al2o3 nanoparticles and montmorillonite mmt for cip adsorption correspondingly the data suited the temkin isotherm and pseudo second order models most of the investigation results showed that cip adsorption took place via the chemisorption process and monolayer adsorption chandrasekaran et al 70 stated that cip adsorption of cip on acid activated carbon from prosopis juliflora matched langmuir with a pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 99 versus the pseudo first order model r2 0 96 pseudo first order model and intra particle diffusion r2 0 63 from table 4 it can be seen that the pseudo second order model fits the kinetics of cip adsorption the best despite some studies that show different models such as thomas and yoon nelson and pseudo first order 55 82 pseudo second order reinforced the concept of cip absorption as it s primarily driven by chemical interactions between cip and the adsorbent the adsorption of cip is dependent on both the concentration of cip in an aqueous solution and the availability of the adsorbent surface availability of the active sites 83 the pseudo second order model is expressed using eq 1 and eq 2 84 1 non linear dq dt k 2 q 2 q t 2 2 linear t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 mg 1 min 1 coefficient of pseudo second order kinetic rate q 2 q t cip removal amount at equilibrium and at any given time t min the langmuir and freundlich isotherms have been fitted with the most studies in table 3 the need to know how they have been calculated is important eqs 3 4 and eqs 5 6 represents both langmuir and freundlich models 84 langmuir isotherm model 3 non linear q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e 4 linear c e q e 1 q max k l c e q max where q e mg g amount of cip removed k l langmuir constant c e mg l the equilibrium concentration q max mg g cip uptake is at its

intensity according to the langmuir isotherm model ions adsorb in a monolayer on the surface with total surface coverage resulting in maximum adsorption 85 multi layer adsorption can be assumed when the freundlich isotherm is regarded as the most appropriate model in which adsorbate has an energetically heterogeneous surface 60 the pseudo second order model that fits the kinetics of cip adsorption is the best the sensitivity of the models was assessed using relative absolute error rae mean absolute error mae mean squared error mse root mean square error rmse standard error of performance sep relative squared error rse root relative squared error rrse according to eqs 6 12 the rae is the difference between the predicted and the actual values in terms of the relative absolute difference predictive models can be evaluated using the rae metric which is based on their rae and due to the arithmetic mean being divided by the average difference 160 this measure is considered to be relative 6 rae p a p 1 n a 6 mae is a statistician s measure of discrepancies between identically paired observations comparisons of projected against actual results subsequent time versus starting time and one measurement procedure versus another are all examples of y versus x a comparison between models can only be made between models whose errors are measured in the same units since it has the same unit as the original data similar to rmse although significantly less in magnitude as a general rule the mae is determined using the following formula 7 mae p a n 7 the average squared error the average squared difference between the estimated and actual values is measured by the mse mse is a risk function that represents the expected squared loss due to an error randomness or a lack of consideration for information that could lead to a more precise estimate are two possibilities for why mse is almost always strictly positive rather than zero 8 mse 1 n i 1 n a p 2 8 when the rmse is used a single value shows how much error there is in a model the metric ignores the difference between overpredicting and underpredicting because it equals the difference 160 9 rmse 1 n i

predictor had been used rrse would have been lower this predictor is just the average of what s actually been done the relative squared error takes the total squared error and divides it by the total squared error of the simple predictor to make it easier to see how big it is rse can be reduced by taking the square root of its relative squared error 11 rrse p a 2 p 1 n a 2 11 estimation accuracy can be measured by the sep keep in mind that the regression line is the one that minimizes the sum of squared deviations between the actual results and the predictions 12 sep 1 n 1 i 1 n a p 2 12 7 4 the mechanism of cip adsorption the zero charge adsorbent point phzc and the adsorbate pka provide researchers with critical information on the chemistry of the solution allowing them to understand better chemical interactions that may occur at various ph levels 83 once the adsorbent surface possesses a net negative charge the protonated amine group can be picked up via cation exchange deprotonated carboxylic groups interact complexly with those with a net positive surface charge 86 cip uptake has been shown to be mediated primarily mediated by electrostatic contacts 81 h bonds hydrophobic interactions 87 π π interactions 88 and pore diffusion 89 as presented in fig 7 which has been investigated in previous research 103 161 162 electrostatic repulsion is the main mechanism for removing cip at low ph 90 mechanisms including electrostatic attraction π π bonding hydrophobic contacts and lewis acid base interactions are used at ph 4 6 electrostatic repulsion and hydrogen bonding are the mechanisms used mechanisms at high ph 91 adsorbate is electrostatically neutral and occurs in the zwitterion form with high cip removal effectiveness between 6 1 and 8 7 ph in the low solubility range 68 the attraction and repulsion that occur between molecules with opposing electric charges are known as electrostatic interactions an attractive force between the adsorbate and the adsorbent would promote cip consumption through electrostatic interaction 92 the cip functions as a donor in the interaction whereas the aromatic rings with phenol hydroxyl groups in adsorbents operate as electron donors given its electron rich nature benzene can have π π interactions with adsorbents provided it is present in the cip structure 93 weak hydrogen bonds denote a unique dipole dipole moment type and they are weak partial intermolecular connections in molecules they may be encountered in ph ranges as negative interactions 94 pore diffusion is usually the regulating mechanism when the adsorbent pores are tiny and the stacking effect of cip is significant this can be recognized by modeling the kinetics of the diffusion model of weber and morris 95 adsorption process offers several benefits including its low cost high performance wide ph range and east of operation and its disadvantage are waste product and weak selectivity 96 8 degradation of cip by different advanced oxidation processes aop systems the classes of water and wastewater treatment processes involved several methods such as advanced oxidation processes aop advanced reduction processes arp and advanced oxidation reduction processes aorp 97 aops are a group of chemical and photochemical treatment methods that aim to remove inorganic and organic contaminants from wastewater and water through an oxidation process involving hydroxyl radicals oh 98 the non selective effects of the oh radical on organic and organometallic pollutants in the aqueous medium with the goal of complete mineralization to co2 water and inorganic ions aops are divided into many categories based on the origin of oh radicals heterogeneous and homogeneous phase photocatalysis o3 based processes h2o2 based processes sonochemical oxidation heterogeneous photocatalysis and electrochemical oxidation are examples of such processes 99 aops based on sulfate radicals have drawn significant attention because of the typical compensations of sulphate radicals such as constancy selectivity its use on the broader ph ranges and higher redox potential around 2 5 3 1 v the persulfate based advanced oxidation process as a viable alternative to h2o2 based processes the collective effect of uv irradiation with persulphate confirms the destruction of a broader range of antibiotics in wastewater 100 given the sulphate radicals typical compensations for instance increased redox potential 2 5 3 1 v usage across a wider ph range selectivity and constancy aops based on sulphate radicals have gotten a lot of interest as a suitable option for h2o2 based methods the persulfate based advanced oxidation process was developed the combined action of uv irradiation and persulphate demonstrates that a wider spectrum of antibiotics is destroyed in wastewater 100 since the approach requires energy as the primary determinant of pollutants treatment integrating ultrasound with electrochemical systems has observed significant development among the numerous types of aops combinations 11 aops are recognized as an effective method for the degradation of antibiotics as they depend on the generation of highly reactive oh via chemical solar or other types of energy options the necessity of post treatment large consumption of chemicals high cost of hydrogen peroxide acidic ph and generation of iron sludge are major disadvantages of homogenous aops 101 the arp process is a method that merges between the aop method and utilizes reductive agents such as na2s2o4 fe 2 so4 2 s2 to create reactive radicals capable of strong reducing reactions hydrated electrons hydrogen h and sulfite radicals so3 aorps are another water treatment method for removing antibiotics that are being increasingly utilized aorps is activated by high energy inputs such as non thermal plasma electric discharges photoionization by utilizing vacuum uv vuv and the ionizing radiations method 97 fig 8 illustrates the classes of water and wastewater treatment for the degradation of cip by different advanced reduction oxidation processes systems multiple investigations have shown that the use of uv h2o2 o3 and its sub processes for instance uv o3 uv o3 h2o2 o3 and uv h2o2 for the degradation of cip degradation in wastewater and water has the possibility of aop technology 102 compared to o3 and uv individually producing aop settings improved the breakdown rate of target chemicals in most situations in the h2o2 o3 and uv h2o2 sub processes the h2o2 concentration was discovered to resemble an essential parameter serving as both an oh initiator and an oh scavenger the primary drawback of aops is their massive price which is related to the usage of expensive reagents such as h2o2 as well as their high energy consumption due to the production of o3 or uv radiation 103 104 cip was only 41 2 disintegrated by uv photolysis and 30 5 by dark chlorination in 30 min according to deng et al 105 whereas the uv chlorine process increased degradation to 98 5 in 9 min the highest cip removal effectiveness by ozonation was 95 6 in the synthetic wastewater sample and 80 1 in the simulated wastewater sample under ideal conditions of ph 3 cip concentration 5 mg l the temperature in 50 min contact time cao2 concentration of 0 025 mg l cao2 concentration and ozonation rate in the synthetic and simulated wastewater samples 106 the highest elimination effectiveness of cip degradation by photocatalytic ozonation which is carried out by tio2 and ozone is 80 58 107 multiple earlier researchers found that combining iron with h2o2 aided in eliminating cip 108 109 taking into account the optimal circumstances of ph 5 8 h2o2 0 80 ppm and iron 0 20 ppm fe3 h2o2 and fe2 h2o2 removed 38 and 64 of cip accordingly in an 80 min response rate 110 hydrodynamic cavitation hc is an innovative and powerful wastewater treatment process for the breakdown of persistent organic pollutants as well as toxicity that integrates the qualities of thermal decomposition and accelerated oxidation hc is characterized by a high synergistic effect with other physical and chemical methods good scalability and effectiveness hc has proven to be a viable solution for large scale disinfection without the use of new chemicals water treatment technologies for example sonochemical and hc have been highly researched and widely employed hc can effectively induce sonochemistry by mechanical means 111 latest improvements in synergistic antibiotic degradation strategies in wastewater and water that mix either biodegradation and adsorption hc and oxidative ultrasound us and photocatalytic or enzymatic strategies the most regularly exploited and cost effective procedures for the comprehensive degradation of persistent organic pollutants in wastewater for instance antibiotics are hydrothermal treatments and aops 112 according to numerous published researches aop can combine with ultraviolet uv irradiation catalyst or ozone o3 to offer an influential treatment of antibiotic removal ozone based aop processes have higher treatment efficiency 113 antibiotic elimination efficiency has been strengthened with the development of several combination therapies for the oxidation of cip in water several aops for instance fe2 h2o2 o3 uv h2o2 uv h2o2 uv uv o3 o3 h2o2 o3 and photocatalysis processes were explored antibiotic elimination is accelerated by aops and combination treatment techniques 114 combining ultrasound methods with additional procedures for instance electrooxidation electro fenton as well as electrocoagulation is crucial for successful organic pollutant degradation in wastewater 11 the findings demonstrate that aop in conjunction with biological treatment provided greater removal effectiveness greater than 80 as an overall efficacy procedure which resulted from higher biological elimination of the biodegradable compounds formed by uv h2o2 treatment as a final stage of treatment uv h2o2 based aop augmentation of biodegradability offers limited benefit combining an aop with a biological approach can successfully extract antibiotics from wastewater a combination of adsorption and aops also have been encouraging performances for cip removal because of its perfect productivity and effectiveness 115 nevertheless separate aops have a number of drawbacks including inefficacy against a broad spectrum of bio resistant organic contaminants a low mineralization level which leads to inadequate degradation as well as the formation of toxic by products 111 considering the iron abundances the cip oxidative degradation by the conventional fenton s process was explored as a promising approach for wastewater treatment whereas hydrogen peroxide is relatively convenient to manage and environmentally benign 116 antibiotics and other toxic contaminants in wastewater can be destroyed employing fenton s reagent 117 magnetic composites mcs in the removal of antibiotics through adsorption and aops was also reported by several previous studies 118 mcs which exploit the combined advantages of easy preparation alternative sources nano scale and separation from wastewater are widely used for catalysis and adsorption 117 9 photocatalytic degradation of cip photolytic techniques for the breakdown of contaminants contained in the water are centered on the delivery of energy to chemical molecules in the radiation that is consumed by various molecules to achieve excited states for the duration required to carry out various chemical reactions 119 molecules absorb radiant energy in quantized units form known as photons providing the energy acquired to agitate particular electrons and generate free radicals which then conduct a sequence of chain reactions to generate reaction products 102 in recent years academics have focused their efforts on developing and improving novel photocatalysts for water purification photocatalytic degradation with catalysts can achieve 100 ciprofloxacin cip removal from wastewater according to the best concentration conditions 120 121 according to sharmaet al 122 the photocatalyst zno bi2wo6 ti3c2 using a two step electrostatic assembly approach exhibited the highest degradation 77 of cip in 160 min a novel hydrangea like cdse se biobr photocatalyst was used to generate h2o2 and break down cip du et al 123 reported that a new cdse se biobr hydrangea like photocatalyst was used to degrade cip and generate h2o2 selvakumar et al 124 effectively produced a photocatalyst of fe3o4 ed rgo with dissolved in heteropoly acid hpv which has numerous active sites and has an optimal activity of 98 43 for the photo degradation of ciprofloxacin navarro aguilar et al 125 utilized wo3 g c3n4 as a photocatalyst element and eliminated cip by a sonochemical method the study found that the sample with 5 wt wo3 had better photoactive behavior for cip than the single wo3 and g c3n4 materials the half time of fe bivo4 as a photocatalyst element with the concentration 1 sample was ten times higher compared to pure bivo4 in cip degradation using new fe impregnated bivo4 126 synthetic and actual samples eliminated 92 81 and 86 57 of the cip under optimal circumstances given ideal circumstances the amount of cip eliminated from the synthetic and actual samples was 92 81 and 86 57 therefore using tio2 as a photocatalyst element immobilized on a glass plate 127 the an efficient z scheme photocatalyst was constructed by several previous researches hassani et al 13 reviwed the integrating graphitic carbon nitride cn and highlighted the ability to reduce graphene oxide rgo with ap as ap rgo cn composite which appear more photocatalytic and anti photocorrosion via a simple facile precipitation method under natural solar light the z scheme heterojunction by the ag agbr decorated bivo4 under visible light irradiation was carried out by a rapid reduction of cr vi and oxidation of refractory cip were accomplished 128 che et al used z scheme cds bi3o4cl heterostructures which exhibit the excellent mineralization ability toward the cip and tc molecule degradation 129 several studies were also reported for the cip photocatalytic degradation process using several photocatalyst elements synthesized methods characterization and results as presented in table 5 and fig 9 the most widely used methods for the photocatalytic degradation of cip were the hydrothermal method 130 simple hydrolysis method 131 chemical substitution hydrothermal sonochemical 132 the characterization of the photocatalytic degradation process was carried out based on powder x ray diffraction xrd diffuse reflectance and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem nitrogen adsorption lc ms instruments photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy photocatalytic degradation technology possesses have several advantages including the complete degradation of pollutants of antibiotics no secondary pollution and environmental protection it also can carry out upon very mild experimental conditions such as low temperature and low pressure the disadvantage and limited of the photocatalytic reactions is that the photochemical side reactions fast back electron transfers processes recombination reactions and the photochemical decomposition of the catalyst may further cycles lead to the fast termination of photocatalytic 10 mechanism of cip degradation during the photoreaction process various earlier studies utilized heterostructure photocatalysts to predict the paths and mechanisms of ciprofloxacin cip degradation through the photoreaction cycle cip agents are photodegraded most often at the f atom piperazine ring cyclopropyl group and carboxyl group 133 134 che et al 129 documented the intermediates routes and mechanism of cip degradation with visible light hplc ms and lc ms studies were performed to investigate the cip throughout the photo degradation reaction the first peak of pic lies at m z 332 and gradually decreases during the degradation reaction indicating that the cip molecule is easily destroyed co2 h2o and additional chemicals were the end products sarkhosh et al 135 proved that uv irradiation uv zno and uv i uzi for 20 min might induce 37 5 58 12 and 61 4 photo degradation of 100 mg l of cip at ph 7 for 5 20 min lc ms was utilized to examine the pathways of cip photo degradation in the uzi process the emission of hydrogen fluoride was identified by lc ms when the fluorine substituent on the ring was replaced with a hydrogen atom co2 nh3 and h2o were mineralized from the linear metabolites photo degradation of cip in aqueous solution was mainly caused by photosubstitution of the fluorine atom by a hydroxyl group defluorination insertion of a hydroxyl group in the piperazine ring as well as the breakage of the piperazine moiety as determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc 74 as shown in fig 10 cip is decomposed into small molecules and it can be seen that the initial peek at m z 332 of cip reduced clearly during the degradation procedure which proposes that the cip molecule is easily decomposed 136 to explore the procedure of cip photo degradation extensively the promising intermediary harvests compounds were analyzed by hplc ms and lc ms the m z of cip 332 then m z 246 10 by oxidation reaction as compound number 1 m z 236 06 by loss of co as compound 2 m z 264 09 by loss of co as compound 3 m z 220 06 by loss of oh as in compound 4 m z 231 09 loss of f and nh2 compound 5 and m z 226 08 by loss of co and ch as compound 6 the intermediate products may further be degraded into co2 nh3 and h2o the pathways and mechanism of degradation of cip were presented in fig 9 from some previous studies 140 144 11 ciprofloxacin removal by three dimensional porous graphene graphene has recently appeared as a significant and intriguing material countless academics have investigated graphene related materials theoretically and experimentally driven by their remarkable characteristics a collection of graphene bound materials containing nanopores in the plane is known as three dimensional 3d porous graphene for water purification 3d porous graphene is utilized to remove various contaminants heavy ions dyes and antibiotics 3d porous graphene has been employed in multiple prior research for ciprofloxacin cip removal an ecologically friendly one step hydrothermal reduction technique was used to make the 3d porous graphene hydrogel gh the possible reduction mechanism analyzed by the environmental scanning electron microscope sem contact angle ftir used for the characterization methods the results from this study indicated that gh has excellent adsorption properties for the removal of cip removal in water purification 137 huang et al 138 utilized graphene oxide kaolinite poly vinyl alcohol compound for the freezing drying process to remove cip from wastewater characterization procedures included x ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ftir here 408 16 mg g was the theoretical highest adsorption capacity liang et al 139 used fe iii doped nial layered double hydroxide nialfe ldh for the removal of cip using simple one step hydrothermal ftir and xps and field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem for characterization approaches after 120 min of illumination with visible light at 25 c in the occurrence of nial0 85fe0 15 ldh rgo according to jie et al 140 the presence of cu ii slightly increases cip adsorption through the bridging effect while high concentrations of cu ii compete with cip for adsorption sites the elimination of cip was 93 cip likely binds to cu ii and forms a gh cip cu ii ternary complex to enhance cu ii adsorption in conclusion gh has excellent adsorption properties for cip 12 conclusion antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin cip have been discovered in increasing amounts in various aquatic habitats in recent times including effluents from wastewater treatment plant effluents groundwater and surface water antibiotic resistance bacteria are emerging as a result of cip detection in water and other environmental surfaces posing a growing threat to animals and human populations the persistence of trace quantities of veterinary and human antibiotics in the ecosystem poses a severe threat to public health all the remedies investigated in this study have the ability to extract cip from water and environmental surfaces though some are more potent than others the hydrothermal method was the most widely used method for photocatalytic degradation of cip to evaluate the effectiveness of cip adsorption multiple factors were recorded for instance time temperature interaction adsorbent concentrations cip concentration and ph additional characteristics such as bed height wastewater flow rate and particle size were also affected several methods carried out the degradation of cip in water and wastewater each method has advantages and disadvantages over other methods according to the price time and toxicity of the products after degradation this review also summarized the removal of cip by photocatalytic degradation three dimensional 3d porous graphene intermediates pathways and mechanism of degradation of the cip according to previous studies the use of adsorption to reduce and remove cip was highly efficient with a removal percentage reaching 95 as long as the correct adsorbent is used it is also not expensive to operate does not require complex design and is not adversely affected by toxic substances the meuc procedure removed 100 of cip 100 decolorized and removed 99 1 of cod in 12 60 and 30 h accordingly advanced oxidation reduction processes are a good and new technology to remove and degrade cip aops and combined treatment methods have better antibiotic removal effects future research should be focused on enhancing the properties of heterogeneous catalysts in aops and cavitation based as a hybrid processes to get synergistic effects we strongly recommend additional investigation on cip residuals and or post treatment processes declaration of competing interest the authors confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial

methods keywords ciprofloxacin removal photocatalytic degradation non clinical environment 1 introduction the presence of pollution in water bodies has increased due to excessive human activities such as the use of pharmaceuticals industrial dyes cosmetics pesticides and non biodegradable materials which have become fundamental uses in the current era researchers and scientists working in this field are concerned about the risks associated with these pollutants for humans and the environment 1 taking into account their extensive use in veterinary and human treatment and their accumulative occurrence in the marine environment personal care products ppcps and pharmaceuticals have been identified as emerging microorganism contaminants over the last 40 years ppcps are discovered at low concentrations in the environment mostly as metabolites secreted by people and animals or waste discharged into wastewater from pharmacies chemical manufacturing facilities and hospitals 2 antibiotics are depleting on the world market on a scale of 100 000 200 000 t per year globally antibiotics reach the world s water systems through various routes including discharge from pharmaceutical and associated businesses hospital effluents and human sewage 3 in 2010 the antibiotic used for the treatment of livestock treatment in livestock reached approximately 63 151 tons and was predicted to increase in 2030 by 67 4 the use of antibiotics in 76 countries from 2000 to 2015 increased by 65 in terms of defined daily doses ddd with approximately 21 35 billion ddd while approximately 39 increased the consumption rate per day 5 one of these serious environmental concerns and hazards is antibiotics which represent a significant threat to global public health caused by their low level toxicity to bacteria at low levels and their ability to build resistance among different species of natural bacterial species as well as the poor technology of wastewater treatment efficiency for their removal 6 these antibiotic related concerns result from improper sample disposal in industrial wastewater and industrial wastewater and the widespread use of antibiotics for human and veterinary medicine 7 8 waste from the animal farms use in aquaculture and wastewater from hospitals urban stream animal manure municipalities domestic and antibiotic industrial are major sources of antimicrobial resistance amr genes in bacterial pathogens and antibiotic pollution in the environment 9 ciprofloxacin cip have ability to inhibits the growth of microorganisms and can represent an important hazard for the environment specifically for soil microbial ecology and it can adversely impact the microbial ecosystem services cip strongly prevents the microbial activities in both systems 10 in low and middle income countries lmics antimicrobial misuse and mismanagement is a public health issue and this practice contributes to antibiotic resistance there is a strong relationship strong and occurrence between several antibiotics present in non clinical samples hospital wastewater home water purification systems wastewater surface water and wastewater planes such as cip norfloxacin doxycycline and lincomycin the presence of these antibiotics in the environment represents a source of bacterial resistance fluoroquinolone fq antibiotics including the market share are largely due to

inner layer water molecules the ldss are used as catalysts in aops for various organic pollutants removal 12 a photocatalytic degradation is an alternative approach for removing pharmaceutical compounds from water for instance antibiotics due to the poor photocatalysts efficiency achieving an optimum rate is difficult the artificial z scheme photocatalyst generally involves two attached semiconductor photocatalysts according to hassani et al 13 z scheme photocatalysis has become a research hotspot due to its high redox ability charge carrier isolation as well as capacity to utilise visible light since the methods of cip treatment have not completed collected acknowledged and assessed previously the treatment procedures and mechanisms that are influenced by many variables have been presented and analyzed emphasizing the significance of the present work s exclusivity through jupyter notebook software using python codes the novelty of this review paper was the use of the

54 as presented in fig 1b 3 antibiotics in the fresh market wastewater the presence of antibiotics pollution in the fresh market wastewater as well as the water bodies receiving such wastes has increased as a result of the excessive human activities in the aquaculture industries in malaysia fresh market wastes include the liquid and solid wastes generated from the fresh market centres these wastes have several infectious agents generated from the vegetables fruits and meats in terms of pathogenicity the infectious agents from fresh market wastes have less pathogenicity for human except for those coming from the meats however some of the pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella spp have high ability to infect a wide range of organisms from insects to human antibiotic resistant bacteria in fresh market wastewater are caused by antibiotic overuse in meat and chicken washing processes the bacterial cells have developed a resistance mechanism to antimicrobial agents due to the presence of antibiotics in these wastewaters several studies have shown that antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes such as macrolides erma ermb sulfonamides sul1 sul2 tetracyclines tetm teto tetw tets tetq tetx tetb β lactamase blaoxa blatem blakpc aminoglycosides qepa oqxa oqxb qnrs ampenicols flor cat2 exist in food wastes the most common detected antibiotics are sulfonamides sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethazine quinolones ofloxacin enrofloxacin ciprofloxacin macrolides and fluoroquinolones he et al 2019 chen et al 2021 fig 2 present the listed the antibiotics and arb in the fresh market wastewater based on the bibliometric analysis for database obtained from scopus it was noted that the most four common antibiotics in the fresh market wastewater included gentamicin 9 tetracycline 9 ciprofloxacin 8 5 and ampicillin 7 0 5 fig 2b the most common pathogenic bacteria in fresh market wastewater included salmonella spp 52 4 escherichia coli 10 45 staphylococcus aureus 8 8 halomonas sp campylobacter spp halobacillus spp pseudomonas aeruginosa bacillus subtilis listeria spp and xanthomonas campestris fig 2c among the salmonella spp s enterica strains was the most predominate with 12 4 ciprofloxacin ciprofloxacin cip belongs to the second generation of the fluoroquinolone fq drug class it is a bactericidal antibiotic and one of the most widely used fq antibiotics worldwide with a solubility of 30 g l cip was originally commercially available in 1987 and has been shown to have a wide antibacterial activity 14 according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac cip s entire chemical name is 1 cyclopropyl 6 fluoro 1 4 dihydro 4 oxo 7 1piperazinyl 3 quinoline carboxylic acid its molecular weight is given by 331 4 g mol and its empirical formula is denoted c17h18fn3o3 cip resembles a broad spectrum antibiotic to treat gram negative and gram positive bacterial infections 15 bone and joint infections respiratory tract infections gastroenteritis malignant otitis externa cellulitis urinary tract infections endocarditis chancroid prostatitis and anthrax are generally treated with cip 16 it was recommended for use throughout the 2001 anthrax outbreak and has been applied to treat biological agents of typhoid and legionnaire s disease 17 the last three decades have seen the development of numerous cip derivatives with diverse biological properties as presented in table 1 the antibacterial characteristic remains the most common research area for derivatives of cip 18 the attitude of action of antibiotics was carried out through several mechanisms of action for example immobilize the production of the bacterial cell wall that protects cells from the external environment interfering with protein synthesis by linking the machinery that builds proteins and amino acids from amino acids 19 create disorder with metabolic processes such as folic acid synthesis the b vitamin in which bacteria thrive 20 and preventing dna synthesis 21 the mechanism of cip acts by inhibiting the enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv acquired for the replication repair and transcription of bacterial dna replication repair and transcription 22 cip inhibits proliferative potential by meddling with its ability to proliferate cellular 23 as shown in fig 3 5 cip in the environment according to several previous investigations ciprofloxacin cip has been found on the faces of animals wastewater soil and the aquatic ecosystem 24 26 the origin of cip in the environment is separated into various sources such as pharmaceutical manufacturers human use in the house and in hospitals veterinary applications and the use of antimicrobials in livestock agriculture and aquaculture which were discharged into wastewater treatment plants fig 4 represents the sources pathways and receptors of cip in the environment most sources of cip in the environment are humans and its utilities such as hospitals medical centers and antibiotic production factories fig 4 antibiotics are also used as additives in animal feed chickens and cows can be fed these additives to gain weight and speed up their growth since animals also use only a small portion of the antimicrobial drugs they ingest the spread of antimicrobials from animal waste is a major concern although small holder systems rely less on antibacterial drugs they often use common store medications without consulting a veterinarian excessive and sub lethal doses encourage genetic and phenotypic changes in susceptible bacteria that survive those doses although there are many gaps in understanding antibacterial resistance the evidence of antibacterial resistance in diets is growing and indicates the need for urgent action joint work across all sectors and food production areas from farm to table will provide an important contribution to an integrated approach to address antimicrobial resistance the cip antibiotics and their derivatives are widely used in animal husbandry these antibiotics reach animal waste in high concentrations in the surrounding environment the incidence of these antibiotics in the water leads to the reproduction of antibiotic resistant bacteria accelerating the purification of wastewater and reducing the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria in water and soil is essential short and long term vulnerability to cip in wastewater reduces the efficacy of nitrogen and phosphorus removal and remove nutrients it also affects intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoates and glycogen transformation in the anoxic and oxic treatment stages the mechanism process showed that exposure to phosphorus uptake processes and cip suppressed denitrification 27 shen et al 28 demonstrated the toxicity of cip in zebrafish cip affected cardiac dysfunction by reducing heart rate due to significant inhibition of genes such as the cardiac troponin and catpase atp2a1l gene excess cip consumption results in neurological illnesses diseases and allergies damage to internal organs hemorrhage in the digestive system and blood leukopenia the presence of cip in hospital wastewater 29 sewage treatment plants 30 non environmental clinics 31 rivers 32 and even in the home water system has become common and become very problematic worldwide 33 numerous studies indicate that the small concentration of cip in surface water and wastewater is an environmental hazard as it can cause resistance to bacterial antibiotics 34 numerous studies have indicated and developed modern technologies to remove cip from the aquatic environment including physical chemical and biological treatments physical removal methods include non filtration ultrafiltration reverse osmosis absorption by physicochemical methods 35 the biological removal methods contain hybrid technology aerobic and anaerobic methods 36 chemical removal methods including ion exchange electrocoagulation and advanced oxidation processes aops 37 generally use hydroxyl radicals the ultimate oxidant for the remediation of organic contaminants in wastewater aops could merge with ultraviolet uv irradiation catalyst ozone o3 sonolysis 38 39 photocatalysts 40 sonocatalytic process 41 and nanotechnology 42 to offer a powerful and powerful wastewater treatment as presented in fig 5 some of these methods are limited by their lack of effectiveness the fact that they consume excessive amounts of energy and the complicated implementation method the adoption of such technologies on a wide scale is limited 43 the use of adsorption to remove cip has been extensively and effectively examined throughout the years and was highly efficient with a removal percentage of 95 as long as the correct adsorbent is used 44 it is not expensive to operate does not require complex design and is not adversely affected by toxic substances 45 the ultraviolet cell microbial electrolysis ultraviolet cell meuc method has recently demonstrated its promising ability to extract cip rich from industrial wastewater at concentrations of 6863 79 2 21 μg l and cod 6840 110 mg l when the execution circumstances were controlled at ph 7 8 imposed 0 6 v voltage 10 mw cm 2 uv intensity and 0 005 ml min ml cathodic aeration velocity the meuc procedure achieved 100 expulsion of cip 99 1 cod removal in 12 60 and 30 h accordingly and 100 decolorization 46 6 comparative studies on the concentrations of cip in aquatic bodies the concentration of ciprofloxacin cip in hospital wastewater home water purification systems wastewater and surface water varies from country to country with lower to higher levels table 2 cips with high biodegradation resistance and high solubility are regularly detected in high concentrations in effluents particularly in hospitals and non clinical wastewater environments it was discovered that the highest concentrations of cip are initiated in pharmaceutical factories and hospital wastewater in vietnam with concentrations ranging from 41 000 to 44 000 ng l due to the large amounts of cip disposed of in wastewater 47 49 followed by raw hospital raw wastewater in brazil 34 000 ng l 50 in china minimal concentrations of 2 5 ng l and a range of 3 9 to 5 9 ng l were reported in residential properties and home water purification systems 33 51 minimum concentrations have been recorded in residential land blocks and home water purification systems in china with 2 5 ng l and a range of 3 9 to 5 9 ng l 7 potential removal methods of cip from the non clinical and non clinical environment 7 1 adsorption of cip adsorption is widely used to remove contaminants from water for various purposes the method by which contaminant molecules aggregate on the top of a solid at the interface between the two phases present is termed adsorption the adsorbate is the contaminant that has been adsorbed while the adsorbent is solid several adsorbents all having different efficiencies and adsorption capacities have accomplished the process of removing cip through adsorption table 3 presents the adsorbents the synthesis method and the operational parameters used to remove cip the adsorption capacity of cip ranges from 1 74 mg cip g of multi wall carbon nanotube mwcnt 52 to 427 3 mg cip g of hollow co3s4 53 for many purposes along with the capacity to activate hydrogen peroxide h2o2 molecules adsorbents such as activated carbon or biochar should be treated with physical or chemical treatments to improve their surface area characteristics high surface area and pore volume result in a larger adsorption capacity resulting in superior performance for the removal of cip 54 57 kanjilal et al 58 stated that nanoadsorbents are efficient and cost effective materials that can be derived from waste precursors their pore diameters are typically tiny necessitating more time for cip intraparticle diffusion it has a wide surface area strong reactivity many active site contaminant interactions and is easy to separate 59 carbon based adsorbents produced by thermochemical methods often have heterogeneous surfaces 60 the adsorbent has a range of functional groups where chemical interactions occur with cip and organic compounds such as co co and oh occur which can favorably enhance adsorption 61 yu et al 62 examined the interaction mechanism between carbon nanotubes and cip to ensure that adsorbent adsorption properties of the adsorbent are accurate in wastewater treatment multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt with a 4 7 oxygen content cnt 4 7 o were chosen because of their superior adsorption properties the chemical surface functionalization of mwcnts may have an effect on their ability to adsorb target contaminants the increased adsorption capacity can be attributed to the larger average pore diameter of mwcnts 63 rumman et al 64 demonstrated the effectiveness of mesoporous silica nanoparticles as adsorbents of cip due to their large surface area well structured characteristics regular channel structure and surface modification because of the inclusion of silanol sioh groups this kind of adsorbent has a negatively charged surface making it more suited for cation adsorption since the amine group increases the efficiency of adsorption systems for dyes heavy metals and antibiotics the amination of mcm 41 mcm 41 nh2 has attracted considerable interest in this area according to peñafiel et al 65 organic residues such as corn cob and rice husk products generate a significant volume of lignocellulosic waste with adsorbent capabilities they have been extensively investigated as precursors for the manufacture of activated carbons which are utilized to remove cip from wastewater cip was removed from hospital wastewater using electrocoagulation ec using aluminum electrodes according to ahmadzadeh et al 66 given optimal working conditions of ph 7 78 interelectrode spacing 1 cm reaction period 20 min current density 12 5 ma cm 2 and electrolyte dose of 0 07 m nacl having a baseline cip concentration of 32 5 mg l the ec technique was efficient with removal effectiveness of 88 57 in conclusion the adsorption and biodegradation are the two major removal pathways for antibiotics such as cip 67 7 2 factors affecting cip adsorption numerous factors for instance time temperature adsorbent concentrations cip concentration and ph interact to establish cip adsorption effectiveness additional characteristics such as bed height wastewater flow rate and particle size were studied by 55 cip that is adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent appears to behave like that of heavy metals the adsorbent capacity is seriously influenced by ph which is one of the most crucial process parameters the solution ph affects the adsorptive degree of molecule ionization and surface properties 57 it is eminent that cip is highly soluble in water at both low and high ph levels and that its molecule behaves as an ion either a cation or an anion when the ph differs from 7 5 68 batch studies were used to conduct the removal trials table 4 where the ph used ranges from ph 3 to 12 the best ph to remove the most cip was ph 5 5 the ph pzc point of zero charges and the pka factors affect cip when ph changes 44 at low ph less than pzc 5 5 cationic adsorption occurs while zwitterionic adsorption occurs in a range of ph levels from 5 5 to 7 7 this range is considered the least soluble in which ph at 7 5 is approaching the lowest solubility in water caused by its neutral charge a ph 7 7 is considered anionic it is easy to see that the ionic cip form is attracted to the surface of the adsorbent due to its positive charge which makes it more efficient in the adsorption process 69 referring to previous studies the high adsorption of cip by nickel oxide nanoparticles nio np nanoceria ceo2 nps and acid activated carbon was recorded at ph 3 to ph 5 44 70 referring to the data in table 3 the correlation between factors has been analyzed using the heat map figure generated by jupyter notebook using python code fig 6 illustrates the correlation between the parameters condition and the removal percentage the different types of adsorbent and synthesis processes impact the removal process despite this they were left out of the correlation factor figure the closer the correlation is to 1 0 the stronger the link between the two variables which implies that if one increases the other increases as well the highest percentage that could affect the removal process was the concentration of cip with a correlation coefficient of 0 19 out of 1 0 the adsorption process s lowest percentage that had the least effect was the adsorbents dose these results may differ from many studies and the reason behind that could be the different types of adsorbent and the synthesis method used previous studies showed that it is evident that when the initial concentration of cip increased the adsorption efficiency decreased and the adsorption capacity mg g raised the reason behind this is that is there are only a limited number of adsorption sites available on the surface of the adsorbent surface due to set doses these sites become saturated at higher antibiotic concentrations 71 73 if the adsorbent dosage is increased the adsorption capacity decreases this is because cip exposes and saturates the adsorption sites more quickly at a low adsorbent dosage although using a larger amount of adsorbent results in excess of unoccupied adsorption sites throughout the adsorption process this results in a reduced adsorption capacity 53 70 wu et al 74 stated that the removal effectiveness increases with adsorbent dose this is because the adsorption occurs mostly at active locations at high adsorbent concentrations the elimination process is enhanced as the temperature is decreased from 30 c to 25 c since 0 62 is the negative correlation that is close to 1 0 all other variables are correlated with each other with a higher number and the darker the shade of red or blue in prior findings the contact time parameter has previously been utilized to estimate the amount of cip that diffuses through the solid liquid layer and into particle pores upon crossing past the bulk aqueous layer the cip adsorption capacity increased at the first stated minutes of the adsorption process an increasing period of time will positively affect the removal efficiency and then slowly approach equilibrium which in this phase no longer affects the removal efficiency 44 53 75 according to certain research increasing the temperature to a specific range see table 3 improves the adsorption process efficiency in experiments 72 76 the removal effectiveness was found to be high when low concentrations of cip were used at high temperatures it is reasonable to infer that as the temperature rises the adsorbent pore size of the material can be more active it stops accepting components to adhere to the pores of the adsorbent material after reaching its maximum adsorption 77 the adsorption capacities also increase with temperature 74 7 3 kinetics and isotherms of cip removal several models such as langmuir and freundlich pseudo first order and pseudo second order are used to describe the efficacy and capacity of adsorbents empirically in removing contaminants from effluents at constant temperature and equilibrium these models show how the pollutant s are absorbed and how the chemical kinetics occur studies on the cip kinetics and isotherm depend on the adsorbent s composition the pseudo second order kinetic model was applied to suit cip adsorption of cip utilizing activated carbon chitosan biochar hydrogel beads cbhb mcm 41 sio2 fe3o4 nanoparticles and fe3o4 c composite the langmuir model was connected as best fit isotherm data r2 0 97 0 99 64 69 78 79 the adsorption of cip on the k carrageenan sodium alginate adsorbent fulfilled the pseudo second order kinetic model 80 the langmuir and freundlich models were associated as isotherm data organic residues and ceo2 np discovered that the experimental adsorption data suited the freundlich model 40 najafpoor et al 75 and gulen and demircivi 81 revealed contradictory conclusions using γ al2o3 nanoparticles and montmorillonite mmt for cip adsorption correspondingly the data suited the temkin isotherm and pseudo second order models most of the investigation results showed that cip adsorption took place via the chemisorption process and monolayer adsorption chandrasekaran et al 70 stated that cip adsorption of cip on acid activated carbon from prosopis juliflora matched langmuir with a pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 99 versus the pseudo first order model r2 0 96 pseudo first order model and intra particle diffusion r2 0 63 from table 4 it can be seen that the pseudo second order model fits the kinetics of cip adsorption the best despite some studies that show different models such as thomas and yoon nelson and pseudo first order 55 82 pseudo second order reinforced the concept of cip absorption as it s primarily driven by chemical interactions between cip and the adsorbent the adsorption of cip is dependent on both the concentration of cip in an aqueous solution and the availability of the adsorbent surface availability of the active sites 83 the pseudo second order model is expressed using eq 1 and eq 2 84 1 non linear dq dt k 2 q 2 q t 2 2 linear t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k 2 mg 1 min 1 coefficient of pseudo second order kinetic rate q 2 q t cip removal amount at equilibrium and at any given time t min the langmuir and freundlich isotherms have been fitted with the most studies in table 3 the need to know how they have been calculated is important eqs 3 4 and eqs 5 6 represents both langmuir and freundlich models 84 langmuir isotherm model 3 non linear

intensity according to the langmuir isotherm model ions adsorb in a monolayer on the surface with total surface coverage resulting in maximum adsorption 85 multi layer adsorption can be assumed when the freundlich isotherm is regarded as the most appropriate model in which adsorbate has an energetically heterogeneous surface 60 the pseudo second order model that fits the kinetics of cip adsorption is the best the sensitivity of the models was assessed using relative absolute error rae mean absolute error mae mean squared error mse root mean square error rmse standard error of performance sep relative squared error rse root relative squared error rrse according to eqs 6 12 the rae is the difference between the predicted and the actual values in terms of the relative absolute difference predictive models can be evaluated using the rae metric which is based on their rae and due to the arithmetic mean being divided by the average difference 160 this measure is considered to be relative 6 rae p a p 1 n a 6 mae is a statistician s measure of discrepancies between identically paired observations comparisons of projected against actual results subsequent time versus starting time and one measurement procedure versus another are all examples of y versus x a comparison between models can only be made between models whose errors are measured in the same units since it has the same unit as the original data similar to rmse although significantly less in magnitude as a general rule the mae is determined using the following formula 7 mae p a n 7 the average squared error the average squared difference between the estimated and actual values is measured by the mse mse is a risk function that represents the expected squared loss due to an error randomness or a lack of consideration for information that could lead to a more precise estimate are two possibilities for why mse is almost always strictly positive rather than zero 8 mse 1 n i 1 n a p 2 8 when the rmse is used a single value shows how much error there is in a model the metric ignores the difference between overpredicting and underpredicting because it equals the difference 160 9 rmse 1 n i

predictor had been used rrse would have been lower this predictor is just the average of what s actually been done the relative squared error takes the total squared error and divides it by the total squared error of the simple predictor to make it easier to see how big it is rse can be reduced by taking the square root of its relative squared error 11 rrse p a 2 p 1 n a 2 11 estimation accuracy can be measured by the sep keep in mind that the regression line is the one that minimizes the sum of squared deviations between the actual results and the predictions 12 sep 1 n 1 i 1 n a p 2 12 7 4 the mechanism of cip adsorption the zero charge adsorbent point phzc and the adsorbate pka provide researchers with critical information on the chemistry of the solution allowing them to understand better chemical interactions that may occur at various ph levels 83 once the adsorbent surface possesses a net negative charge the protonated amine group can be picked up via cation exchange deprotonated carboxylic groups interact complexly with those with a net positive surface charge 86 cip uptake has been shown to be mediated primarily mediated by electrostatic contacts 81 h bonds hydrophobic interactions 87 π π interactions 88 and pore diffusion 89 as presented in fig 7 which has been investigated in previous research 103 161 162 electrostatic repulsion is the main mechanism for removing cip at low ph 90 mechanisms including electrostatic attraction π π bonding hydrophobic contacts and lewis acid base interactions are used at ph 4 6 electrostatic repulsion and hydrogen bonding are the mechanisms used mechanisms at high ph 91 adsorbate is electrostatically neutral and occurs in the zwitterion form with high cip removal effectiveness between 6 1 and 8 7 ph in the low solubility range 68 the attraction and repulsion that occur between molecules with opposing electric charges are known as electrostatic interactions an attractive force between the adsorbate and the adsorbent would promote cip consumption through electrostatic interaction 92 the cip functions as a donor in the interaction whereas the aromatic rings with phenol hydroxyl groups in adsorbents operate as electron donors given its electron rich nature benzene can have π π interactions with adsorbents provided it is present in the cip structure 93 weak hydrogen bonds denote a unique dipole dipole moment type and they are weak partial intermolecular connections in molecules they may be encountered in ph ranges as negative interactions 94 pore diffusion is usually the regulating mechanism when the adsorbent pores are tiny and the stacking effect of cip is significant this can be recognized by modeling the kinetics of the diffusion model of weber and morris 95 adsorption process offers several benefits including its low cost high performance wide ph range and east of operation and its disadvantage are waste product and weak selectivity 96 8 degradation of cip by different advanced oxidation processes aop systems the classes of water and wastewater treatment processes involved several methods such as advanced oxidation processes aop advanced reduction processes arp and advanced oxidation reduction processes aorp 97 aops are a group of chemical and photochemical treatment methods that aim to remove inorganic and organic contaminants from wastewater and water through an oxidation process involving hydroxyl radicals oh 98 the non selective effects of the oh radical on organic and organometallic pollutants in the aqueous medium with the goal of complete mineralization to co2 water and inorganic ions aops are divided into many categories based on the origin of oh radicals heterogeneous and homogeneous phase photocatalysis o3 based processes h2o2 based processes sonochemical oxidation heterogeneous photocatalysis and electrochemical oxidation are examples of such processes 99 aops based on sulfate radicals have drawn significant attention because of the typical compensations of sulphate radicals such as constancy selectivity its use on the broader ph ranges and higher redox potential around 2 5 3 1 v the persulfate based advanced oxidation process as a viable alternative to h2o2 based processes the collective effect of uv irradiation with persulphate confirms the destruction of a broader range of antibiotics in wastewater 100 given the sulphate radicals typical compensations for instance increased redox potential 2 5 3 1 v usage across a wider ph range selectivity and constancy aops based on sulphate radicals have gotten a lot of interest as a suitable option for h2o2 based methods the persulfate based advanced oxidation process was developed the combined action of uv irradiation and persulphate demonstrates that a wider spectrum of antibiotics is destroyed in wastewater 100 since the approach requires energy as the primary determinant of pollutants treatment integrating ultrasound with electrochemical systems has observed significant development among the numerous types of aops combinations 11 aops are recognized as an effective method for the degradation of antibiotics as they depend on the generation of highly reactive oh via chemical solar or other types of energy options the necessity of post treatment large consumption of chemicals high cost of hydrogen peroxide acidic ph and generation of iron sludge are major disadvantages of homogenous aops 101 the arp process is a method that merges between the aop method and utilizes reductive agents such as na2s2o4 fe 2 so4 2 s2 to create reactive radicals capable of strong reducing reactions hydrated electrons hydrogen h and sulfite radicals so3 aorps are another water treatment method for removing antibiotics that are being increasingly utilized aorps is activated by high energy inputs such as non thermal plasma electric discharges photoionization by utilizing vacuum uv vuv and the ionizing radiations method 97 fig 8 illustrates the classes of water and wastewater treatment for the degradation of cip by different advanced reduction oxidation processes systems multiple investigations have shown that the use of uv h2o2 o3 and its sub processes for instance uv o3 uv o3 h2o2 o3 and uv h2o2 for the degradation of cip degradation in wastewater and water has the possibility of aop technology 102 compared to o3 and uv individually producing aop settings improved the breakdown rate of target chemicals in most situations in the h2o2 o3 and uv h2o2 sub processes the h2o2 concentration was discovered to resemble an essential parameter serving as both an oh initiator and an oh scavenger the primary drawback of aops is their massive price which is related to the usage of expensive reagents such as h2o2 as well as their high energy consumption due to the production of o3 or uv radiation 103 104 cip was only 41 2 disintegrated by uv photolysis and 30 5 by dark chlorination in 30 min according to deng et al 105 whereas the uv chlorine process increased degradation to 98 5 in 9 min the highest cip removal effectiveness by ozonation was 95 6 in the synthetic wastewater sample and 80 1 in the simulated wastewater sample under ideal conditions of ph 3 cip concentration 5 mg l the temperature in 50 min contact time cao2 concentration of 0 025 mg l cao2 concentration and ozonation rate in the synthetic and simulated wastewater samples 106 the highest elimination effectiveness of cip degradation by photocatalytic ozonation which is carried out by tio2 and ozone is 80 58 107 multiple earlier researchers found that combining iron with h2o2 aided in eliminating cip 108 109 taking into account the optimal circumstances of ph 5 8 h2o2 0 80 ppm and iron 0 20 ppm fe3 h2o2 and fe2 h2o2 removed 38 and 64 of cip accordingly in an 80 min response rate 110 hydrodynamic cavitation hc is an innovative and powerful wastewater treatment process for the breakdown of persistent organic pollutants as well as toxicity that integrates the qualities of thermal decomposition and accelerated oxidation hc is characterized by a high synergistic effect with other physical and chemical methods good scalability and effectiveness hc has proven to be a viable solution for large scale disinfection without the use of new chemicals water treatment technologies for example sonochemical and hc have been highly researched and widely employed hc can effectively induce sonochemistry by mechanical means 111 latest improvements in synergistic antibiotic degradation strategies in wastewater and water that mix either biodegradation and adsorption hc and oxidative ultrasound us and photocatalytic or enzymatic strategies the most regularly exploited and cost effective procedures for the comprehensive degradation of persistent organic pollutants in wastewater for instance antibiotics are hydrothermal treatments and aops 112 according to numerous published researches aop can combine with ultraviolet uv irradiation catalyst or ozone o3 to offer an influential treatment of antibiotic removal ozone based aop processes have higher treatment efficiency 113 antibiotic elimination efficiency has been strengthened with the development of several combination therapies for the oxidation of cip in water several aops for instance fe2 h2o2 o3 uv h2o2 uv h2o2 uv uv o3 o3 h2o2 o3 and photocatalysis processes were explored antibiotic elimination is accelerated by aops and combination treatment techniques 114 combining ultrasound methods with additional procedures for instance electrooxidation electro fenton as well as electrocoagulation is crucial for successful organic pollutant degradation in wastewater 11 the findings demonstrate that aop in conjunction with biological treatment provided greater removal effectiveness greater than 80 as an overall efficacy procedure which resulted from higher biological elimination of the biodegradable compounds formed by uv h2o2 treatment as a final stage of treatment uv h2o2 based aop augmentation of biodegradability offers limited benefit combining an aop with a biological approach can successfully extract antibiotics from wastewater a combination of adsorption and aops also have been encouraging performances for cip removal because of its perfect productivity and effectiveness 115 nevertheless separate aops have a number of drawbacks including inefficacy against a broad spectrum of bio resistant organic contaminants a low mineralization level which leads to inadequate degradation as well as the formation of toxic by products 111 considering the iron abundances the cip oxidative degradation by the conventional fenton s process was explored as a promising approach for wastewater treatment whereas hydrogen peroxide is relatively convenient to manage and environmentally benign 116 antibiotics and other toxic contaminants in wastewater can be destroyed employing fenton s reagent 117 magnetic composites mcs in the removal of antibiotics through adsorption and aops was also reported by several previous studies 118 mcs which exploit the combined advantages of easy preparation alternative sources nano scale and separation from wastewater are widely used for catalysis and adsorption 117 9 photocatalytic degradation of cip photolytic techniques for the breakdown of contaminants contained in the water are centered on the delivery of energy to chemical molecules in the radiation that is consumed by various molecules to achieve excited states for the duration required to carry out various chemical reactions 119 molecules absorb radiant energy in quantized units form known as photons providing the energy acquired to agitate particular electrons and generate free radicals which then conduct a sequence of chain reactions to generate reaction products 102 in recent years academics have focused their efforts on developing and improving novel photocatalysts for water purification photocatalytic degradation with catalysts can achieve 100 ciprofloxacin cip removal from wastewater according to the best concentration conditions 120 121 according to sharmaet al 122 the photocatalyst zno bi2wo6 ti3c2 using a two step electrostatic assembly approach exhibited the highest degradation 77 of cip in 160 min a novel hydrangea like cdse se biobr photocatalyst was used to generate h2o2 and break down cip du et al 123 reported that a new cdse se biobr hydrangea like photocatalyst was used to degrade cip and generate h2o2 selvakumar et al 124 effectively produced a photocatalyst of fe3o4 ed rgo with dissolved in heteropoly acid hpv which has numerous active sites and has an optimal activity of 98 43 for the photo degradation of ciprofloxacin navarro aguilar et al 125 utilized wo3 g c3n4 as a photocatalyst element and eliminated cip by a sonochemical method the study found that the sample with 5 wt wo3 had better photoactive behavior for cip than the single wo3 and g c3n4 materials the half time of fe bivo4 as a photocatalyst element with the concentration 1 sample was ten times higher compared to pure bivo4 in cip degradation using new fe impregnated bivo4 126 synthetic and actual samples eliminated 92 81 and 86 57 of the cip under optimal circumstances given ideal circumstances the amount of cip eliminated from the synthetic and actual samples was 92 81 and 86 57 therefore using tio2 as a photocatalyst element immobilized on a glass plate 127 the an efficient z scheme photocatalyst was constructed by several previous researches hassani et al 13 reviwed the integrating graphitic carbon nitride cn and highlighted the ability to reduce graphene oxide rgo with ap as ap rgo cn composite which appear more photocatalytic and anti photocorrosion via a simple facile precipitation method under natural solar light the z scheme heterojunction by the ag agbr decorated bivo4 under visible light irradiation was carried out by a rapid reduction of cr vi and oxidation of refractory cip were accomplished 128 che et al used z scheme cds bi3o4cl heterostructures which exhibit the excellent mineralization ability toward the cip and tc molecule degradation 129 several studies were also reported for the cip photocatalytic degradation process using several photocatalyst elements synthesized methods characterization and results as presented in table 5 and fig 9 the most widely used methods for the photocatalytic degradation of cip were the hydrothermal method 130 simple hydrolysis method 131 chemical substitution hydrothermal sonochemical 132 the characterization of the photocatalytic degradation process was carried out based on powder x ray diffraction xrd diffuse reflectance and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem nitrogen adsorption lc ms instruments photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy photocatalytic degradation technology possesses have several advantages including the complete degradation of pollutants of antibiotics no secondary pollution and environmental protection it also can carry out upon very mild experimental conditions such as low temperature and low pressure the disadvantage and limited of the photocatalytic reactions is that the photochemical side reactions fast back electron transfers processes recombination reactions and the photochemical decomposition of the catalyst may further cycles lead to the fast termination of photocatalytic 10 mechanism of cip degradation during the photoreaction process various earlier studies utilized heterostructure photocatalysts to predict the paths and mechanisms of ciprofloxacin cip degradation through the photoreaction cycle cip agents are photodegraded most often at the f atom piperazine ring cyclopropyl group and carboxyl group 133 134 che et al 129 documented the intermediates routes and mechanism of cip degradation with visible light hplc ms and lc ms studies were performed to investigate the cip throughout the photo degradation reaction the first peak of pic lies at m z 332 and gradually decreases during the degradation reaction indicating that the cip molecule is easily destroyed co2 h2o and additional chemicals were the end products sarkhosh et al 135 proved that uv irradiation uv zno and uv i uzi for 20 min might induce 37 5 58 12 and 61 4 photo degradation of 100 mg l of cip at ph 7 for 5 20 min lc ms was utilized to examine the pathways of cip photo degradation in the uzi process the emission of hydrogen fluoride was identified by lc ms when the fluorine substituent on the ring was replaced with a hydrogen atom co2 nh3 and h2o were mineralized from the linear metabolites photo degradation of cip in aqueous solution was mainly caused by photosubstitution of the fluorine atom by a hydroxyl group defluorination insertion of a hydroxyl group in the piperazine ring as well as the breakage of the piperazine moiety as determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc 74 as shown in fig 10 cip is decomposed into small molecules and it can be seen that the initial peek at m z 332 of cip reduced clearly during the degradation procedure which proposes that the cip molecule is easily decomposed 136 to explore the procedure of cip photo degradation extensively the promising intermediary harvests compounds were analyzed by

slightly increases cip adsorption through the bridging effect while high concentrations of cu ii compete with cip for adsorption sites the elimination of cip was 93 cip likely binds to cu ii and forms a gh cip cu ii ternary complex to enhance cu ii adsorption in conclusion gh has excellent adsorption properties for cip 12 conclusion antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin cip have been discovered in increasing amounts in various aquatic habitats in recent times including effluents from wastewater treatment plant effluents groundwater and surface water antibiotic resistance bacteria are emerging as a result of cip detection in water and other environmental surfaces posing a growing threat to animals and human populations the persistence of trace quantities of veterinary and human antibiotics

13037,in this study fe rich sludge obtained from coagulation flocculation of swine wastewater was processed into zero valent iron zvi biochar composites through one pot pyrolysis at 700 c under anoxic mbcn700 and hypoxic mbca700 conditions x ray diffraction analysis revealed that α fe0 and γ fe0 were the dominant fe species in mbcn700 and mbca700 respectively the effects of different process parameters including composite dosage initial cr vi concentration ph dissolved o2 do and contact time on cr vi removal from synthetic solutions were evaluated the results showed that both the acidic initial ph and do contributed to cr vi removal the highest removal rate was observed at ph 3 based on the langmuir isotherm model the predicted maximum removal capacity of mbca700 was greater than that of mbcn700 primarily because of its core shell structure less corrosive zvi and higher degree of graphitization x ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis coupled with fitting of the kinetic pseudo second order and isothermal freundlich data suggested that cr vi removal by mbcn700 occurred via adsorption fec micro electrolysis and co precipitation in contrast the removal mechanism for mbca700 included adsorption reduction and electrostatic attraction thus zvi biochar composites can serve as potential remediators of cr vi contaminated wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords zero valent iron biochar composite hexavalent chromium coagulation flocculation sludge fe c micro electrolysis electron conductor 1 introduction chromium primarily exists in the hexavalent cr vi and trivalent cr iii states compared with cr iii cr vi is more soluble mobile and 500 times more toxic and thus one of the most undesirable and environmentally relevant contaminants 1 2 therefore removing cr vi from effluents of mining textile electroplating leather tanning and cr salt manufacturing industries is crucial 3 to date various treatment processes have been applied to remove toxic cr vi including adsorption membrane filtration ion exchange and electrochemical precipitation 4 among these adsorption is preferred given its high efficiency low cost and simplicity the use of numerous adsorbents have been reported including carbon based materials 5 clay minerals 6 and nanomaterials 7 biochar a carbon material derived from low cost biomass e g sewage sludge agricultural waste and swine manure via pyrolysis under anoxic hypoxic conditions has exhibited remarkable potential for the removal of heavy metals from solutions owing to its large surface area sa abundant surface functional groups and inorganic mineral content 8 9 however the low reduction potential of pristine biochar and the difficulty in separating from solutions after adsorption limit its ability to alleviate cr vi contamination the magnetization of biochar by introducing fe species e g fe0 and fe3o4 is considered an effective solution to overcome the aforementioned limitations 10 11 generally four methods are used for biochar magnetization chemical co precipitation thermal decomposition pyrolysis and hydrothermal synthesis 12 13 the resultant magnetic biochar has the advantages of enhanced reactivity environmental benignancy and easy solid liquid separation characteristics thus rendering it useful for the removal of cr vi from wastewater 14 16 zero valent iron zvi biochar composites are efficient adsorbents for aqueous cr vi removal via synergetic adsorption reduction and precipitation 17 18 as previously reported composites can be prepared using various physical and chemical methods such as borohydride reduction 19 carbothermal reduction 20 ball milling 21 and co pyrolysis 22 among these methods zvi biochar composites are typically fabricated via borohydride reduction of fe ions adsorbed on biochar or direct pyrolysis of the as prepared biomass with fe salts 18 19 nevertheless these methods are complex and expensive because of their high chemical and energy demands for example borohydride reduction requires bh4 and ethanol as well as n2 purging to eliminate dissolved o2 do additionally it produces highly flammable h2 and large quantities of wastewater containing harmful byproducts such as borate 19 the carbothermic reduction process consumes external fe sources and requires considerable operational energy to maintain a high temperature 900 c during pyrolysis 23 therefore alternative low cost biomass and fe resources as well as more facile synthesis strategies are required for the fabrication of zvi biochar composites over the past few decades fe based chemicals have been widely used as effective coagulants for wastewater purification and as catalysts in advanced oxidation processes for sludge dewatering 24 25 this has resulted in the production of large quantities of hazardous fe rich sludge that requires appropriate handling recently the successful synthesis of zvi biochar composites from fe rich sludge via one pot pyrolysis has been reported 26 27 the carbon component and reductive gases co and h2 formed by the decomposition of organic substances in the sludge during pyrolysis favor the conversion of high valent fe species fe ii and fe iii to fe0 23 26 27 given their high electron transfer capacity zvi biochar composites are typically used as catalysts to degrade organic contaminants for example zhu et al synthesized a zvi biochar composite from sludge obtained after drinking water treatment and used it in peroxymonosulfate activation to degrade ciprofloxacin 26 in our previous study we focused on facile methods for recycling the sludge the coagulation flocculation sludge cfs obtained from treating swine manure to fabricate zvi biochar composites via one pot pyrolysis 28 two crystalline phases of zvi were observed in the products obtained at 700 c with γ fe0 dominating the composite obtained under hypoxic conditions mbca700 and α fe0 dominating the product obtained under anoxic conditions mbcn700 notably the ph of mbcn700 was substantially higher than that of mbca700 because of fec micro electrolysis according to previous studies fec micro electrolysis accelerates the cr vi reduction rate and enhances the cr vi removal capacity of the composites in solutions 29 30 however few studies have investigated sludge based zvi biochar composites for cr vi detoxification in aqueous environments furthermore to the best of our knowledge no previous study has examined the structure of γ fe0 biochar composites applied them in aqueous cr vi removal or explored the associated mechanisms in this study we utilized cfs as a feedstock to produce an α fe0 γ fe0 biochar composite via one pot pyrolysis at 700 c and investigated the characteristics and mechanism of cr vi removal by mbcn700 mbca700 were comprehensively investigated the specific objectives of this study were to a identify the properties of the two composites using crystallographic microscopic spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses b estimate and compare their cr vi removal performance by determining the effects of composite dosage initial cr vi concentration initial ph oxic anoxic conditions contact time and 1 10 phenanthroline addition and c investigate the potential mechanisms of cr vi removal by the two composites 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents analytical grade potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 phosphoric acid h3po4 sulfuric acid h2so4 hydrochloric acid hcl 36 sodium hydroxide naoh 1 5 diphenylcarbohydrazide and 1 10 phenanthroline were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china 2 2 preparation of composites the dewatered cfs used in this study was collected from an intensive swine farm in jiaxing city zhejiang province china using fecl3 as the coagulant and cationic polyacrylamide as the flocculant the detailed procedure for the preparation of zvi biochar composites has been described in our previous study 28 a brief scheme for the synthesis of zvi biochar composites is presented in section 1 of the supplementary material sm 2 3 characterization of composites the contents of the major elements c h n s and o in the zvi biochar composites were measured using an automatic elemental analyzer vario el

emmett teller method 31 and apw and tpv were fitted using the barrett joyner halenda method 32 the crystal structures of the composites were identified via x ray diffraction xrd smartlab rigaku japan

vibrating sample magnetometry 7404 lakeshore cryotronics usa at 300 k electrochemical tests including tafel extrapolation electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and linear sweep voltammetry lsv were performed using an electrochemical workstation chi660 ch instruments chenhua china to assess the electron transfer properties of the composites the details of the electrochemical measurements are described in sm section 2 2 4 cr vi removal experiments a stock solution of cr vi 1000 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving 2 892 g k2cr2o7 in 1 l distilled water and refrigerated 4 c until use unless otherwise specified the initial ph of the working solution was 5 all the suspensions were vigorously shaken for 24 h at 25 c using a thermostatic oscillator 180 rpm first to investigate the effect of the composite dosage on cr vi removal different amounts of each composite 0 025 0 150 g were placed in 50 ml of a 50 mg l 1 cr vi solution then a series of experiments were conducted in 150 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 0 1 g zvi biochar composite and 50 ml solution the effects of the initial cr vi concentration were investigated by varying the cr vi concentrations from 10 to 500 mg l 1 and the adsorption isotherm data were simulated using the langmuir and freundlich models sm section 3 to investigate the synergistic effects of the initial ph and do on cr vi removal the ph values of the working solutions 50 mg l 1 were first adjusted between 3 and 8 using diluted naoh 0 1 m or hcl 0 2 m before adding the composites subsequently the effect of oxygen activation on cr vi removal at each ph was evaluated under three atmospheres 1 ar 2 o2 and 3 air under the first condition prior to adding the composites the solutions were purged with ar gas for 30 min to remove o2 after which the flasks were immediately sealed with parafilm under the second condition the solutions were purged with o2 gas for 30 min before adding the composites after which the flasks were immediately sealed with parafilm under the third condition before adding the composites the solution was exposed to air without purging gas after which the flasks were sealed with parafilm to investigate the cr vi removal kinetics the initial concentration of cr vi was 50 mg l 1 and the samples were withdrawn at intervals of 5 10 and 30 min and 1 2 6 12 18 and 24 h the experimental data were fitted to two kinetic models sm section 4 the contribution of the generated fe ii ions to cr vi removal was examined under the same experimental conditions for 24 h after the addition of different concentrations of 1 10 phenanthroline 0 2 and 20 mg l 1 all batch tests were performed in duplicates prior to the cr vi concentration and ph measurements the supernatant of each sample was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose filter to remove the non dissolved particles the cr vi content in the filtrate was determined using a 1 5 diphenylcarbazide colorimetric assay on a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1900 shimadzu japan at 540 nm the ph of the filtrate was measured using a ph meter phs 3c leici china the removal rate r and amount q mg g 1 of cr vi by the zvi biochar composites were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 r c i c t c i 100 2 q c i c t m where c i and c t represent the initial and residual concentrations of cr vi mg l 1 respectively and mis the composite dosage g l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of zvi biochar composites as shown in table 1 the main constituents of the composites were c h n s o and fe among these the fe content approximately 38 was the highest indicating that fe was successfully embedded in the biochar matrix compared with mbca700 mbcn700 had a lower h c but a higher o c atomic ratio indicating that mbcn700 had higher aromaticity and polarity 33 fig 1a shows the raman spectra of mbcn700 and mbca700 in which two characteristic peaks can be observed at 1347 cm 1 d band disordered carbon and 1604 cm 1 g band graphitized carbon 30 respectively the intensity ratio of the d band to the g band id ig is typically used to indicate the degree of carbon disorder the id ig ratio of mbca700 was 4 17 which was considerably higher than that of mbcn700 2 39 indicating the presence of a higher number of sp 2 graphites in mbca700 nevertheless the id ig ratios of the composites were considerably higher than those reported in previous studies 21 22 probably because fe based minerals could catalyze the graphitization of biochar during the carbonization process as previously reported the enhanced graphite like structure of the composite could improve its electrical conductivity thereby improving the electron transfer efficiency 34 the electrochemical properties of the composites were further characterized by tafel extrapolation eis and lsv as depicted in fig 1b d the electrical conductivities of the composites were evaluated using tafel extrapolation and eis fig 1b shows the tafel polarization curves of mbca700 and mbcn700 in a 30 mg l 1 cr vi solution the free corrosion potential of mbcn700 was 0 53 v which had a higher negative value than that of mbca700 0 43 v suggesting that mbcn700 had a higher electron transfer rate in cr vi reduction 34 the lower electrical resistance of mbcn700 was also supported by the nyquist plot of the eis spectra fig 1c the electrical resistance values of mbcn700 and mbca700 were 1 82 and 2 27 ω respectively indicating that mbcn700 had higher conductivity than mbca700 both the tests confirmed that mbcn700 had a higher electron transfer rate furthermore the electron transfer capacity was examined using the lsv and the results are shown in fig 1d a higher current response was observed for mbca700 than for mbcn700 suggesting that mbca700 had a higher electron transfer capacity the results showed that mbca700 had a greater electron transfer capacity but a lower electron transfer rate than mbcn700 which corroborated the results obtained by assessing the cr vi removal kinetics and performance in section 3 2 these findings contradict those of other studies which reported that composites with a higher graphitization degree had higher electron transfer rates and higher transfer capacities 21 22 the sa tpv and apw values of mbcn700 were higher than those of mbca700 suggesting that a more porous structure was formed under the n2 atmosphere table 1 additionally the sa values of mbcn700 and mbca700 reached 136 01 and 101 71 m2 g 1 respectively the composites showed considerably higher sas compared with other zvi biochar composites reported previously 35 36 which is attributed to the fe catalyzed pore structure the calculated apws of mbcn700 and mbca700 were 6 15 nm and 4 52 nm respectively this indicates their mesoporous structure as confirmed by their pore size distributions according to the pore size distribution curves fig s1 most of the pore sizes of mbcn700 and mbca700 were approximately 8 45 nm and 6 62 nm respectively the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were categorized as type iv isotherms with h4 type hysteresis loops at higher relative pressures fig 2a further confirming that both composites had mesoporous structures which provided abundant active sites that promoted the surface interactions between cr vi and the composites 36 the xrd patterns of mbcn700 and mbca700 are shown in fig 2b two different phases of zvi body centered cubic α fe0 2θ 44 7 65 0 and face centered cubic γ fe0 2θ 43 2 50 4 74 1 were detected in the composites 20 37 as mentioned in section 1 α fe0 was dominant in mbcn700 whereas γ fe0 was dominant in mbca700 reportedly γ fe0 has a significantly higher corrosion resistance than α fe0 38 39 resulting in a decreased electron transfer rate for mbca700 therefore the carbon structure in mbca700 could act as an electron shuttle to enhance cr vi reduction the ftir spectra of the composites before and after the reaction are shown in fig 2c the broad band at 3452 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of oh 36 the five absorption peaks at 1639 1597 1342 1040 and 560 cm 1 could be assigned to the stretching vibrations of cc co c n c o c and fe o respectively 28 36 40 the absorption peaks in the spectra were similar indicating that the surface functional groups did not change significantly during the preparation of the composites and their reaction with cr vi nevertheless the peak intensities of the surface functional groups decreased after the reaction suggesting that they participated in the cr vi removal the magnetic hysteresis curves of the composites before and after the reaction were obtained at 300 k fig 2d notably the saturation magnetization value of mbcn700 was 65 07 emu g 1 which was significantly higher than that of mbca700 19 77 emu g 1 thus mbcn700 exhibited better magnetization properties than mbca700 which could be primarily attributed to the different phases of zvi in the composites the magnetic properties of mbcn700 deteriorated significantly after the reaction but those of mbca700 remained almost unchanged this phenomenon was caused by the excess fe released by the micro electrolysis of fe c which then produced non magnetic fe hydro oxides during the reaction the morphologies and microstructures of mbcn700 and mbca700 are shown in fig 3 significant differences were observed between mbcn700 and mbca700 on the microtopographic surfaces fig 3a b mbcn700 exhibited a rough surface with quasi spherical particles embedded in the carbon matrix cubic and irregular polyhedral particles aggregated on the surface of mbca700 as shown in the tem images in fig 3c f zvi particles were encapsulated with the mesoporous carbon in mbca700 exhibiting a core shell structure whereas in mbcn700 the particles were clearly attached to the carbon surface the elemental compositions and surface structures of the composites before and after the reaction are shown in fig s2 after the reaction the surfaces of the composites became rough owing to the formation of white crystals indicating that cr species were successfully attached to the composite surface the eds data for the composites before and after the reaction confirmed this speculation fig s2 3 2 cr vi removal characteristics 3 2 1 effects of composite dosage and initial cr vi concentration the effects of the composite dosage and initial cr vi concentration on the cr vi removal performance are presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a both composites exhibited maximum removal capacities of 2 g l 1 furthermore overdosing resulted in inadequate utilization of surface active sites leading to wastage and higher costs therefore the optimal dosage was selected as 2 g l 1 fig 4b illustrates the performance of the composites in removing cr vi at various initial cr vi concentrations 10 500 mg l 1 the removal rates of mbcn700 and mbca700 decreased from approximately 100 to 10 23 and 11 57 respectively with an increase in initial cr vi concentrations from 10 to 500 mg l 1 however the amount of cr vi removed by mbcn700 and mbca700 increased from 4 98 mg g 1 to 25 86 mg g 1 and 28 94 mg g 1 respectively this was attributed to the enhanced driving force between cr vi and the active sites with an increase in cr vi concentrations 41 additionally mbca700 exhibited superior cr vi removal performance compared with mbcn700 at each initial concentration sm section 5 3 2 2 synergistic effect of ph and do the synergistic effect of do and ph on cr vi removal by mbcn700 mbca700 was evaluated over an initial ph range of 3 8 and under different atmospheres as shown in fig 5a b the cr vi removal rate exhibited considerably different behaviors for mbcn700 and mbca700 for mbcn700 fig 5a the variation trends of the cr vi removal rates under ar air and o2 atmospheres were different with an increase of initial ph from 3 to 8 the removal rate exhibited a downward trend under oxic conditions decreasing from 98 82 to 70 37 however the removal rates in ar and air atmospheres first decreased from 72 43 to 36 75 and 79 50 to 43 70 respectively until the initial ph reached 6 when the initial ph was increased to 8 the removal rates under ar and air increased marginally to 41 71 and 52 84 respectively these variations under ar and air atmospheres are consistent with the findings of previous studies 42 43 for mbca700 fig 5b the cr vi removal rate decreased rapidly as the initial ph increased from 3 to 8 under ar air and o2 atmospheres the removal rates decreased from 93 50 to 35 93 97 14 to 41 79 and 98 98 to 42 36 respectively the removal rates at ph 3 were 2 3 times higher than those observed at ph 8 additionally a higher cr vi removal rate was achieved an under an o2 atmosphere particularly in mbcn700 which has also been reported in previous studies 44 45 as shown in fig 5a and b the final ph of the solution increased substantially owing to proton depletion during cr vi reduction which was further increased by do additionally the extent of increase in the ph for mbcn700 under an o2 atmosphere was considerably higher than that for mbca700 particularly under acidic ph conditions this phenomenon can be explained by the occurrence of fec micro electrolysis during cr vi removal eqs 3 and 4 for mbcn700 consequently the increase in ph for mbcn700 was higher than that for mbca700 3 anode f e 0 2 e fe ⅱ 4 cathode o 2 4 e 2 h 2 o 4 o h based on this findings it was concluded that the low initial ph and do favored cr vi removal by the composites this can be ascribed to the following reasons 1 low ph facilitates the corrosion of fe0 and dissolution of the oxide layers of the composites thereby generating secondary reductants e g fe ii and hydrogen and fresh active sites for the reduction of cr vi eqs 5 and 6 21 35 2 as hcro4 ph 1 6 and cro4 2 ph 6 are the predominant cr vi species in aqueous environments electrostatic adsorption of hcro4 enhanced cr vi removal at a low ph owing to its low adsorption free energy 46 3 when the ph value is less than the value of the point of zero charge phpzc the composite surface is positively charged due to which the negatively charged cr vi species can easily attach to the composites through electrostatic attraction 44 46 4 the presence of o2 can either facilitate the formation of chromite precipitates which are less passivated than cr iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides obtained under anaerobic conditions 44 or enhance zvi erosion to generate more fe ii to reduce cr vi 47 and 5 more cr iii could be precipitated under an o2 atmosphere on the composite surface owing to the higher final ph which is conducive to subsequent cr vi adsorption by electrostatic attraction 43 45 5 2 hcr o 4 3 f e 0 14 h 2 cr ⅲ 3 fe ⅱ 8 h 2 o 6 hcr o 4 3 fe ⅱ 7 h cr ⅲ 3 fe ⅲ 4 h 2 o 3 2 3 cr vi removal kinetics and isotherms the cr vi removal kinetic curves for mbcn700 and mbca700 and the variation in ph during the process are shown in fig 6a the removal process can be divided into three phases 1 rapid reaction 2 declined removal and 3 slow removal the rapid reaction phase of cr vi removal phase 1 was achieved by mbcn700 and mbca700 within 6 h and 2 h respectively with removal efficiencies of 50 18 and 50 33 respectively thereafter in phase 2 the removal efficiencies decreased to 43 31 mbcn700 within 12 h and 43 62 mbca700 within 6 h these findings are consistent with those of a previous study 42 the same variation trends in the ph were observed during these two phases phase 1 and 2 subsequently the removal rates gradually increased to 55 28 mbcn700 and 61 03 mbca700 during phase 3 during this phase the ph decreased in the case of mbcn700 while it gradually increased for mbca700 nevertheless the ph of mbcn700 was significantly higher than that of mbca700 throughout the reaction to analyze the removal process the experimental data were fitted using the pseudo first order fig s3 and pseudo second order pso fig 6b models the relevant parameters are listed in table s1 the kinetics of cr vi removal by the composites could be better described by the pso model owing to its higher regression coefficient r2 value table s1 demonstrating that chemisorption involving electron exchange between the adsorbate and adsorbent was the rate determining process during the reaction 35 48 the equilibrium experimental data for cr vi removal were validated using the langmuir and freundlich models the curves are shown in fig 6c and the values of the relevant parameters are listed in table s2 the adsorption isotherms were better fitted with the freundlich model based on r2 suggesting that the active sites on the composites were not uniform and could adsorb multilayer cr 49 the maximum cr vi removal capacities of mbcn700 and mbca700 calculated from the langmuir model were 27 04 mg g 1 and 29 55 mg g 1 respectively confirming that mbca700 had a higher cr vi removal capacity than mbcn700 moreover both composites had significantly higher cr vi removal capacities than that of pure zvi as reported in a previous study 0 87 mg g 1 50 3 2 4 contribution of aqueous ferrous ion to cr vi removal to determine the contribution of aqueous ferrous ions to cr vi removal 1 10 phenanthroline a ferrous ion complexing ligand was used to inhibit the reaction between ferrous ions and cr vi during the process fig 6d illustrates that the removal rates were slightly reduced with the addition of the complexing agent the removal efficiencies of mbcn700 and mbca700 decreased by 6 44 and 11 05 respectively when 1 10 phenanthroline was added at a concentration of 20 mg l 1 these results indicate that the ferrous ions generated during the reaction were not the main reductants for remediating cr vi 3 3 proposed removal mechanism to clarify the underlying interaction mechanisms between the cr species and composites the surface compositions and chemical states were determined using xps analysis as stated in section 3 2 3 the breakpoints for the removal process were 6 and 12 h for mbcn700 and 2 and 6 h for mbca700 therefore the samples were collected at these reaction times and after the reaction completed typical cr photoelectron peaks were observed in the xps spectra of the composites at these reaction times fig 7a b confirming the attachment of cr to the composite surfaces in addition the variations in the cr peak intensities during the reaction differed considerably between mbcn700 and mbca700 for mbcn700 no remarkable differences were observed between the cr peak intensities at 6 12 and 24 h fig 7a in contrast for mbca700 the cr peak intensity was significantly higher at 24 h than at 2 and 6 h fig 7b this phenomenon was primarily attributed to the different mechanisms of cr vi removal by mbcn700 and mbca700 which is further discussed latter after the deconvolution of the cr 2p spectrum the peaks at 577 23 ev and 587 03 ev were assigned to cr iii and those at 578 52 ev and 588 32 ev were assigned to cr vi 40 51 the results displayed in fig 8a suggest that the percentages of cr iii species attached to mbcn700 at 6 12 and 24 h were 22 87 50 57 and 57 47 respectively showing a considerable increase from 6 h to 12 h combined with the variations in ph and cr vi removal rates at 6 h and 12 h we inferred that a higher amount of cr iii precipitated on the surface of the composite and the adsorbed cr vi was reduced to cr iii by micro electrolysis for mbca700 fig 8b the molar ratio of cr iii species increased from 37 12 to 62 46 with an increase in the reaction time from 2 h to 6 h while the peak intensity of cr 2p remained relatively stable the peak intensity of cr 2p increased considerably after the reaction while the percentage ratio of cr iii decreased slightly to 56 40 the fe 2p spectrum could be split into eight peaks the peaks at 710 75 ev fe 2p3 2 724 35 ev fe 2p1 2 714 18 ev satellite and 726 92 ev satellite corresponded to fe ii and those at 712 23 ev fe 2p3 2 725 83 ev fe 2p1 2 718 62 ev satellite and 733 40 ev satellite corresponded to fe iii fig 8c and d 52 for mbcn700 fig 8c the percentage of surface fe ii first increased from 51 23 to 66 77 as the reaction time increased from 0 to 12 h and then decreased to 42 24 after the reaction which is inconsistent with the findings reported in previous studies 53 54 this result implies that fe ii produced by the micro electrolysis of fe c might have precipitated on the surface of mbcn700 moreover the percentage of surface fe ii decreased from 61 18 to 40 24 during the reaction for mbca700 fig 8d hence cr vi was reduced to cr iii by low valent fe e g zvi and fe ii during the reaction the c 1 s peak of mbcn700 fig s4a was fitted to three major components c c 284 77 ev c o 285 40 ev and co 287 34 ev bonds 21 before the reaction the relative molar contents of c c c o and co were 57 25 21 02 and 21 73 respectively after the reaction the relative molar content of c o increased slightly to 23 63 whereas that of c c and co decreased slightly to 55 45 and 20 92 respectively the c1s peak of mbca700 fig s4b was split into four components c c 284 56 ev c o 285 19 ev c o c 286 64 ev and o c c 288 62 ev bonds 55 after the reaction the contents of c c c o c o c and o c c in mbca700 changed from 39 41 26 87 21 08 and 12 64 to 39 18 27 67 19 82 and 13 33 respectively these values indicate that the changes in the peak intensities of the mbca700 components were almost negligible these results demonstrate that surface complexation had a negligible effect on the removal of aqueous cr vi the o 1 s spectrum of mbcn700 fig 8e can be resolved into two peaks c o fe o 531 41 ev and co 533 40 ev 21 after the reaction a new peak was observed at 529 95 ev which was assigned to cr2o3 suggesting that cr vi ions were reduced to cr iii which then combined with fe ii to form fecr2o4 43 48 additionally the c o fe o molar content increased sharply from 25 73 to 77 02 which could be related to the deposition of fe ions on the composite surfaces owing to fe c micro electrolysis four components existed in the o 1 s spectrum of mbca700 fig 8f fe o at 530 06 ev oh at 531 12 ev c o o c o at 531 74 ev and fe c o at 533 41 ev 56 owing to the core shell structure and less corrosive nature of γ fe0 the relative peak intensity of fe o increased slightly from 15 75 to 17 33 after the reaction however the percentage ratio of oh increased from 17 53 to 23 89 suggesting the formation of cr hydroxide on the surface of mbca700 based on these results we speculate that diverse mechanisms dominate the different phases of the cr vi removal process fig 9 for mbcn700 cr vi was initially adsorbed on the surface of mbcn700 and the micro electrolysis of fe c accelerated the redox reaction via electron transfer to the adsorbed cr vi in phase 1 eqs 7 9 thus the negatively charged cr vi was converted into the positively charged cr iii the ph of the solution increased rapidly because of the depletion of protons and the generation of oh by micro electrolysis as the reaction proceeded the generated cr iii precipitated with fe iii fe ii ions under alkaline conditions eqs 10 12 based on the xps analysis adsorption was the main mechanism of cr vi removal during this phase in phase 2 due to an increase in ph the positively charged surface changed to a negatively charged surface which showed electrostatic repulsion with the cr vi species more cr iii precipitated on the composite surface and the adsorbed cr vi was reduced to cr iii in phase 3 the removal rate decreased because a passivation layer was formed on the surface of mbcn700 consequently reduction could have a major impact on the removal of cr vi during phases 2 and 3 moreover adsorption followed by reduction was considered to be the main reason for the slight variation in cr peak for mbca700 the active sites for cr vi removal were abundant in phase 1 moreover the rapid removal was primarily attributed to simultaneous adsorption and reduction eqs 13 and 14 as the phpzc values of iron oxides on the surface ranged 6 10 45 the separation of cr iii and mbca700 was maintained because of electrostatic repulsion therefore even though reduction was important for the removal of cr vi fewer cr species were attached to the surface of mbca700 when compared to that of mbcn700 in phase1 during phase 2 similar to mbcn700 the surface of mbca700 changed from positive to negative as the ph increased consequently some adsorbed cr vi species were desorbed and cr iii was deposited on the mbca700 surface eq 15 during phase 3 more cr iii precipitated on the surfaces of the composites which could act as cation bridges to adsorb cr vi via electrostatic attraction 43 subsequently the precipitated cr iii further attached with cr vi by electrostatic attraction thereby improving cr vi removal and the molar percentage of cr vi consequently the intensity of the cr peaks at 24 h was significantly higher than that at 2 h and 6 h thus adsorption played a significant role in cr vi removal by mbca700 in phase 2 and 3 anode 7 f e 0 2 e fe ⅱ 8 fe ⅱ e fe ⅲ cathode 9 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 6 e 2 cr ⅲ 7 h 2 o 10 1 x fe ⅲ xcr ⅲ 3 h 2 o c r x f e 1 x oh 3 3 h 11 1

3 4 conclusions in this study two novel zvi biochar composites derived from cfs using a facile one pot synthesis method were used to remove aqueous cr vi the characterization results demonstrated that the composites had mesoporous graphitic carbon structures and embedded α fe0 γ fe0 which served as electron shuttles and donors respectively for cr vi reduction the maximum removal efficiencies of cr vi by the composites were achieved at ph 3 0 under oxic conditions the adsorption process followed the pso kinetic and freundlich isotherm models suggesting that cr vi removal can be primarily ascribed to multilayer chemisorption the properties of mbca700 including a core shell structure less corrosive zvi and a higher degree of graphitization resulted in a higher cr vi removal capacity compared with that of mbcn700 moreover the xps results confirmed that cr vi could be indirectly reduced by zvi via fec micro electrolysis during the removal process for mbcn700 while the carbon of mbca700 could act as an electron shuttle mediator to facilitate cr vi reduction considering the global importance of the circular economy and green development sludge derived zvi biochar composites

13037,in this study fe rich sludge obtained from coagulation flocculation of swine wastewater was processed into zero valent iron zvi biochar composites through one pot pyrolysis at 700 c under anoxic mbcn700 and hypoxic mbca700 conditions x ray diffraction analysis revealed that α fe0 and γ fe0 were the dominant fe species in mbcn700 and mbca700 respectively the effects of different process parameters including composite dosage initial cr vi concentration ph dissolved o2 do and contact time on cr vi removal from synthetic solutions were evaluated the results showed that both the acidic initial ph and do contributed to cr vi removal the highest removal rate was observed at ph 3 based on the langmuir isotherm model the predicted maximum removal capacity of mbca700 was greater than that of mbcn700 primarily because of its core shell structure less corrosive zvi and higher degree of graphitization x ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis coupled with fitting of the kinetic pseudo second order and isothermal freundlich data suggested that cr vi removal by mbcn700 occurred via adsorption fec micro electrolysis and co precipitation in contrast the removal mechanism for mbca700 included adsorption reduction and electrostatic attraction thus zvi biochar composites can serve as potential remediators of cr vi contaminated wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords zero valent iron biochar composite hexavalent chromium coagulation flocculation sludge fe c micro electrolysis electron conductor 1 introduction chromium primarily exists in the hexavalent cr vi and trivalent cr iii states compared with cr iii cr vi is more soluble mobile and 500 times more toxic and thus one of the most undesirable and environmentally relevant contaminants 1 2 therefore removing cr vi from effluents of mining textile electroplating leather tanning and cr salt manufacturing industries is crucial 3 to date various treatment processes have been applied to remove toxic cr vi including adsorption membrane filtration ion exchange and electrochemical precipitation 4 among these adsorption is preferred given its high efficiency low cost and simplicity the use of numerous adsorbents have been reported including carbon based materials 5 clay minerals 6 and nanomaterials 7 biochar a carbon material derived from low cost biomass e g sewage sludge agricultural waste and swine manure via pyrolysis under anoxic hypoxic conditions has exhibited remarkable potential for the removal of heavy metals from solutions owing to its large surface area sa abundant surface functional groups and inorganic mineral content 8 9 however the low reduction potential of pristine biochar and the difficulty in separating from solutions after adsorption limit its ability to alleviate cr vi contamination the magnetization of biochar by introducing fe species e g fe0 and fe3o4 is considered an effective solution to overcome the aforementioned limitations 10 11 generally four methods are used for biochar magnetization chemical co precipitation thermal decomposition pyrolysis and hydrothermal synthesis 12 13 the resultant magnetic biochar has the advantages of enhanced reactivity environmental benignancy and easy solid liquid separation characteristics thus rendering it useful for the removal of cr vi from wastewater 14 16 zero valent iron zvi biochar composites are efficient adsorbents for aqueous cr vi removal via synergetic adsorption reduction and precipitation 17 18 as previously reported composites can be prepared using various physical and chemical methods such as borohydride reduction 19 carbothermal reduction 20 ball milling 21 and co pyrolysis 22 among these methods zvi biochar composites are typically fabricated via borohydride reduction of fe ions adsorbed on biochar or direct pyrolysis of the as prepared biomass with fe salts 18 19 nevertheless these methods are complex and expensive because of their high chemical and energy demands for example borohydride reduction requires bh4 and ethanol as well as n2 purging to eliminate dissolved o2 do additionally it produces highly flammable h2 and large quantities of wastewater containing harmful byproducts such as borate 19 the carbothermic reduction process consumes external fe sources and requires considerable operational energy to maintain a high temperature 900 c during pyrolysis 23 therefore alternative low cost biomass and fe resources as well as more facile synthesis strategies are required for the fabrication of zvi biochar composites over the past few decades fe based chemicals have been widely used as effective coagulants for wastewater purification and as catalysts in advanced oxidation processes for sludge dewatering 24 25 this has resulted in the production of large quantities of hazardous fe rich sludge that requires appropriate handling recently the successful synthesis of zvi biochar composites from fe rich sludge via one pot pyrolysis has been reported 26 27 the carbon component and reductive gases co and h2 formed by the decomposition of organic substances in the sludge during pyrolysis favor the conversion of high valent fe species fe ii and fe iii to fe0 23 26 27 given their high electron transfer capacity zvi biochar composites are typically used as catalysts to degrade organic contaminants for example zhu et al synthesized a zvi biochar composite from sludge obtained after drinking water treatment and used it in peroxymonosulfate activation to degrade ciprofloxacin 26 in our previous study we focused on facile methods for recycling the sludge the coagulation flocculation sludge cfs obtained from treating swine manure to fabricate zvi biochar composites via one pot pyrolysis 28 two crystalline phases of zvi were observed in the products obtained at 700 c with γ fe0 dominating the composite obtained under hypoxic conditions mbca700 and α fe0 dominating the product obtained under anoxic conditions mbcn700 notably the ph of mbcn700 was substantially higher than that of mbca700 because of fec micro electrolysis according to previous studies fec micro electrolysis accelerates the cr vi reduction rate and enhances the cr vi removal capacity of the composites in solutions 29 30 however few studies have investigated sludge based zvi biochar composites for cr vi detoxification in aqueous environments furthermore to the best of our knowledge no previous study has examined the structure of γ fe0 biochar composites applied them in aqueous cr vi removal or explored the associated mechanisms in this study we utilized cfs as a feedstock to produce an α fe0 γ fe0 biochar composite via one pot pyrolysis at 700 c and investigated the characteristics and mechanism of cr vi removal by mbcn700 mbca700 were comprehensively investigated the specific objectives of this study were to a identify the properties of the two composites using crystallographic microscopic spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses b estimate and

dewatered cfs used in this study was collected from an intensive swine farm in jiaxing city zhejiang province china using fecl3 as the coagulant and cationic polyacrylamide as the flocculant the detailed procedure for the preparation of zvi biochar composites has been described in our previous study 28 a brief scheme for the synthesis of zvi biochar composites is presented in section 1 of the supplementary material sm 2 3 characterization of composites the contents of the major elements c h n s and o in the zvi biochar composites were measured using an automatic elemental analyzer vario el

were performed using an electrochemical workstation chi660 ch instruments chenhua china to assess the electron transfer properties of the composites the details of the electrochemical measurements are described in sm section 2 2 4 cr vi removal experiments a stock solution of cr vi 1000 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving 2 892 g k2cr2o7 in 1 l distilled water and refrigerated 4 c until use unless otherwise specified the initial ph of the working solution was 5 all the suspensions were vigorously shaken for 24 h at 25 c using a thermostatic oscillator 180 rpm first to investigate the effect of the composite dosage on cr vi removal different amounts of each composite 0 025 0 150 g were placed in 50 ml of a 50 mg l 1 cr vi solution then a series of experiments were conducted in 150 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 0 1 g zvi biochar composite and 50 ml solution the effects of the initial cr vi concentration were investigated by varying the cr vi concentrations from 10 to 500 mg l 1 and the adsorption isotherm data were simulated using the langmuir and freundlich models sm section 3 to investigate the synergistic effects of the initial ph and do on cr vi removal the ph values of the working solutions 50 mg l 1 were first adjusted between 3 and 8 using diluted naoh 0 1 m or hcl 0 2 m before adding the composites subsequently the effect of oxygen activation on cr vi removal at each ph was evaluated under three atmospheres 1 ar 2 o2 and 3 air under the first condition prior to adding the composites the solutions were purged with ar gas for 30 min to remove o2 after which the flasks were immediately sealed with parafilm under the second condition the solutions were purged with o2 gas for 30 min before adding the composites after which the flasks were immediately sealed with parafilm under the third condition before adding the composites the solution was exposed to air without purging gas after which the flasks were sealed with parafilm to investigate the cr vi removal kinetics the initial concentration of cr vi was 50 mg l 1 and the samples were withdrawn at intervals of 5 10 and 30 min and 1 2 6 12 18 and 24 h the experimental data were fitted to two kinetic models sm section 4 the contribution of the generated fe ii ions to cr vi removal was examined under the same experimental conditions for 24 h after the addition of different concentrations of 1 10 phenanthroline 0 2 and 20 mg l 1 all batch tests were performed in duplicates prior to the cr vi concentration and ph measurements the supernatant of each sample was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose filter to remove the non dissolved particles the cr vi content in the filtrate was determined using a 1 5 diphenylcarbazide colorimetric assay on a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1900 shimadzu japan at 540 nm the ph of the filtrate was measured using a ph meter phs 3c leici china the removal rate r and amount q mg g 1 of cr vi by the zvi biochar composites were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 r c i c t c i 100 2 q c i c t m where c i and c t represent the initial and residual concentrations of cr vi mg l 1 respectively and mis the composite dosage g l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of zvi biochar composites as shown in table 1 the main constituents of the composites were c h n s o and fe among these the fe content approximately 38 was the highest indicating that fe was successfully embedded in the biochar matrix compared with mbca700 mbcn700 had a lower h c but a higher o c atomic ratio indicating that mbcn700 had higher aromaticity and polarity 33 fig 1a shows the raman spectra of mbcn700 and mbca700 in which two characteristic peaks can be observed at 1347 cm 1 d band disordered carbon and 1604 cm 1 g band graphitized carbon 30 respectively the intensity ratio of the d band to the g band id ig is typically used to indicate the degree of carbon disorder the id ig ratio of mbca700 was 4 17 which was considerably higher than that of mbcn700 2 39 indicating the presence of a higher number of sp 2 graphites in mbca700 nevertheless the id ig ratios of the composites were considerably higher than those reported in previous studies 21 22 probably because fe based minerals could catalyze the graphitization of biochar during the carbonization process as previously reported the enhanced graphite like structure of the composite could improve its electrical conductivity thereby improving the electron transfer efficiency 34 the electrochemical properties of the composites were further characterized by tafel extrapolation eis and lsv as depicted in fig 1b d the electrical conductivities of the composites were evaluated using tafel extrapolation and eis fig 1b shows the tafel polarization curves of mbca700 and mbcn700 in a 30 mg l 1 cr vi solution the free corrosion potential of mbcn700 was 0 53 v which had a higher negative value than that of mbca700 0 43 v suggesting that mbcn700 had a higher electron transfer rate in cr vi reduction 34 the lower electrical resistance of mbcn700 was also supported by the nyquist plot of the eis spectra fig 1c the electrical resistance values of mbcn700 and mbca700 were 1 82 and 2 27 ω respectively indicating that mbcn700 had higher conductivity than mbca700 both the tests confirmed that mbcn700 had a higher electron transfer rate furthermore the electron transfer capacity was examined using the lsv and the results are shown in fig 1d a higher current response was observed for mbca700 than for mbcn700 suggesting that mbca700 had a higher electron transfer capacity the results showed that mbca700 had a greater electron transfer capacity but a lower electron transfer rate than mbcn700 which corroborated the results obtained by assessing the cr vi removal kinetics and performance in section 3 2 these findings contradict those of other studies which reported that composites with a higher graphitization degree had higher electron transfer rates and higher transfer capacities 21 22 the sa tpv and apw values of mbcn700 were higher than those of mbca700 suggesting that a more porous structure was formed under the n2 atmosphere table 1 additionally the sa values of mbcn700 and mbca700 reached 136 01 and 101 71 m2 g 1 respectively the composites showed considerably higher sas compared with other zvi biochar composites reported previously 35 36 which is attributed to the fe catalyzed pore structure the calculated apws of mbcn700 and mbca700 were 6 15 nm and 4 52 nm respectively this indicates their mesoporous structure as confirmed by their pore size distributions according to the pore size distribution curves fig s1 most of the pore sizes of mbcn700 and mbca700 were approximately 8 45 nm and 6 62 nm respectively the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were categorized as type iv isotherms with h4 type hysteresis loops at higher relative pressures fig 2a further confirming that both composites had mesoporous structures which provided abundant active sites that promoted the surface interactions between cr vi and the composites 36 the xrd patterns of mbcn700 and mbca700 are shown in fig 2b two different phases of zvi body centered cubic α fe0 2θ 44 7 65 0 and face centered cubic γ fe0 2θ 43 2 50 4 74 1 were detected in the composites 20 37 as mentioned in section 1 α fe0 was dominant in mbcn700 whereas γ fe0 was dominant in mbca700 reportedly γ fe0 has a significantly higher corrosion resistance than α fe0 38 39 resulting in a decreased electron transfer rate for mbca700 therefore the carbon structure in mbca700 could act as an electron shuttle to enhance cr vi reduction the ftir spectra of the composites before and after the reaction are shown in fig 2c the broad band at 3452 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of oh 36 the five absorption peaks at 1639 1597 1342 1040 and 560 cm 1 could be assigned to the stretching vibrations of cc co c n c o c and fe o respectively 28 36 40 the absorption peaks in the spectra were similar indicating that the surface functional groups did not change significantly during the preparation of the composites and their reaction with cr vi nevertheless the peak intensities of the surface functional groups decreased after the reaction suggesting that they participated in the cr vi removal the magnetic hysteresis curves of the composites before and after the reaction were obtained at 300 k fig 2d notably the saturation magnetization value of mbcn700 was 65 07 emu g 1 which was significantly higher than that of mbca700 19 77 emu g 1 thus mbcn700 exhibited better magnetization properties than mbca700 which could be primarily attributed to the different phases of zvi in the composites the magnetic properties of mbcn700 deteriorated significantly after the reaction but those of mbca700 remained almost unchanged this phenomenon was caused by the excess fe released by the micro electrolysis of fe c which then produced non magnetic fe hydro oxides during the reaction the morphologies and microstructures of mbcn700 and mbca700 are shown in fig 3 significant differences were observed between mbcn700 and mbca700 on the microtopographic surfaces fig 3a b mbcn700 exhibited a rough surface with quasi spherical particles embedded in the carbon matrix cubic and irregular polyhedral particles aggregated on the surface of mbca700 as shown in the tem images in fig 3c f zvi particles were encapsulated with the mesoporous carbon in mbca700 exhibiting a core shell structure whereas in mbcn700 the particles were clearly attached to the carbon surface the elemental compositions and surface structures of the composites before and after the reaction are shown in fig s2 after the reaction the surfaces of the composites became rough owing to the formation of white crystals indicating that cr species were successfully attached to the composite surface the eds data for the composites before and after the reaction confirmed this speculation fig s2 3 2 cr vi removal characteristics 3 2 1 effects of composite dosage and initial cr vi concentration the effects of the composite dosage and initial cr vi concentration on the cr vi removal performance are presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4a both composites exhibited maximum removal capacities of 2 g l 1 furthermore overdosing resulted in inadequate utilization of surface active sites leading to wastage and higher costs therefore the optimal dosage was selected as 2 g l 1 fig 4b illustrates the performance of the composites in removing cr vi at various initial cr vi concentrations 10 500 mg l 1 the removal rates of mbcn700 and mbca700 decreased from approximately 100 to 10 23 and 11 57 respectively with an increase in initial cr vi concentrations from 10 to 500 mg l 1 however the amount of cr vi removed by mbcn700 and mbca700 increased from 4 98 mg g 1 to 25 86 mg g 1 and 28 94 mg g 1 respectively this was attributed to the enhanced driving force between cr vi and the active sites with an increase in cr vi concentrations 41 additionally mbca700 exhibited superior cr vi removal performance compared with mbcn700 at each initial concentration sm section 5 3 2 2 synergistic effect of ph and do the synergistic effect of do and ph on cr vi removal by mbcn700 mbca700 was evaluated over an initial ph range of 3 8 and under different atmospheres as shown in fig 5a b the cr vi removal rate exhibited considerably different behaviors for mbcn700 and mbca700 for mbcn700 fig 5a the variation trends of the cr vi removal rates under ar air and o2 atmospheres were different with an increase of initial ph from 3 to 8 the removal rate exhibited a downward trend under oxic conditions decreasing from 98 82 to 70 37 however the removal rates in ar and air atmospheres first decreased from 72 43 to 36 75 and 79 50 to 43 70 respectively until the initial ph reached 6 when the initial ph was increased to 8 the removal rates under ar and air increased marginally to 41 71 and 52 84 respectively these variations under ar and air atmospheres are consistent with the findings of previous studies 42 43 for mbca700 fig 5b the cr vi removal rate decreased rapidly as the initial ph increased from 3 to 8 under ar air and o2 atmospheres the removal rates decreased from 93 50 to 35 93 97 14 to 41 79 and 98 98 to 42 36 respectively the removal rates at ph 3 were 2 3 times higher than those observed at ph 8 additionally a higher cr vi removal rate was achieved an under an o2 atmosphere particularly in mbcn700 which has also been reported in previous studies 44 45 as shown in fig 5a and b the final ph of the solution increased substantially owing to proton depletion during cr vi reduction which was further increased by do additionally the extent of increase in the ph for mbcn700 under an o2 atmosphere was considerably higher than that for mbca700 particularly under acidic ph conditions this phenomenon can be explained by the occurrence of fec micro electrolysis during cr vi removal eqs 3 and 4 for mbcn700 consequently the increase in ph for mbcn700 was higher than that for mbca700 3 anode f e 0 2 e fe ⅱ 4 cathode o 2 4 e 2 h 2 o 4 o h based on this findings it was concluded that the low initial ph and do favored cr vi removal by the composites this can be ascribed to the following reasons 1 low ph facilitates the corrosion of fe0 and dissolution of the oxide layers of the composites thereby generating secondary reductants e g fe ii and hydrogen and fresh active sites for the reduction of cr vi eqs 5 and 6 21 35 2 as hcro4 ph 1 6 and cro4 2 ph 6 are the predominant cr vi species in aqueous environments electrostatic adsorption of hcro4 enhanced cr vi removal at a low ph owing to its low adsorption free energy 46 3 when the ph value is less than the value of the point of zero charge phpzc the composite surface is positively charged due to which the negatively charged cr vi species can easily attach to the composites through electrostatic attraction 44 46 4 the presence of o2 can either facilitate the formation of chromite precipitates which are less passivated than cr iii fe iii hydroxides oxyhydroxides obtained under anaerobic conditions 44 or enhance zvi erosion to generate more fe ii to reduce cr vi 47 and 5 more cr iii could be precipitated under an o2 atmosphere on the composite surface owing to the higher final ph which is conducive to subsequent cr vi adsorption by electrostatic attraction 43 45 5 2 hcr o 4 3 f e 0 14 h 2 cr ⅲ 3 fe ⅱ 8 h 2 o 6 hcr o 4 3 fe ⅱ 7 h cr ⅲ 3 fe ⅲ 4 h 2 o 3 2 3 cr vi removal kinetics and isotherms the cr vi removal kinetic curves for mbcn700 and mbca700 and the variation in ph during the process are shown in fig 6a the removal process can be divided into three phases 1 rapid reaction 2 declined removal and 3 slow removal the rapid reaction phase of cr vi removal phase 1 was achieved by mbcn700 and mbca700 within 6 h and 2 h respectively with removal efficiencies of 50 18 and 50 33 respectively thereafter in phase 2 the removal efficiencies decreased to 43 31 mbcn700 within 12 h and 43 62 mbca700 within 6 h these findings are consistent with those of a previous study 42 the same variation trends in the ph were observed during these two phases phase 1 and 2 subsequently the removal rates gradually increased to 55 28 mbcn700 and 61 03 mbca700 during phase 3 during this phase the ph decreased in the case of mbcn700 while it gradually increased for mbca700 nevertheless the ph of mbcn700 was significantly higher than that of mbca700 throughout the reaction to analyze the removal process the experimental data were fitted using the pseudo first order fig s3 and pseudo second order pso fig 6b models the relevant parameters are listed in table s1 the kinetics of cr vi removal by the composites could be better described by the pso model owing to its higher regression coefficient r2 value table s1 demonstrating that chemisorption involving electron exchange between the adsorbate and adsorbent was the rate determining process during the reaction 35 48 the equilibrium experimental data for cr vi removal were validated using the langmuir and freundlich models the curves are shown in fig 6c and the values of the relevant parameters are listed in table s2 the adsorption isotherms were better fitted with the freundlich model based on r2 suggesting that the active sites on the composites were not uniform and could adsorb multilayer cr 49 the maximum cr vi removal capacities of mbcn700 and mbca700 calculated from the langmuir model were 27 04 mg g 1 and 29 55 mg g 1 respectively confirming that mbca700 had a higher cr vi removal capacity than mbcn700 moreover both composites had significantly higher cr vi removal capacities than that of pure zvi as reported in a previous study 0 87 mg g 1 50 3 2 4 contribution of aqueous ferrous ion to cr vi removal to determine the contribution of aqueous ferrous ions to cr vi removal 1 10 phenanthroline a ferrous ion complexing ligand was used to inhibit the reaction between ferrous ions and cr vi during the process fig 6d illustrates that the removal rates were slightly reduced with the addition of the complexing agent the removal efficiencies of mbcn700 and mbca700 decreased by 6 44 and 11 05 respectively when 1 10 phenanthroline was added at a concentration of 20 mg l 1 these results indicate that the ferrous ions generated during the reaction were not the main reductants for remediating cr vi 3 3 proposed removal mechanism to clarify the underlying interaction mechanisms between the cr species and composites the surface compositions and chemical states were determined using xps analysis as stated in section 3 2 3 the breakpoints for the removal process were 6 and 12 h for mbcn700 and 2 and 6 h for mbca700 therefore the samples were collected at these reaction times and after the reaction completed typical cr photoelectron peaks were observed in the xps spectra of the composites at these reaction times fig 7a b confirming the attachment of cr to the composite surfaces in addition the variations in the cr peak intensities during the reaction differed considerably between mbcn700 and mbca700 for mbcn700 no remarkable differences were observed between the cr peak intensities at 6 12 and 24 h fig 7a in contrast for mbca700 the cr peak intensity was significantly higher at 24 h than at 2 and 6 h fig 7b this phenomenon was primarily attributed to the different mechanisms of cr vi removal by mbcn700 and mbca700 which is further discussed latter after the deconvolution of the cr 2p spectrum the peaks at 577 23 ev and 587 03 ev were assigned to cr iii and those at 578 52 ev and 588 32 ev were assigned to cr vi 40 51 the results displayed in fig 8a suggest that the percentages of cr iii species attached to mbcn700 at 6 12 and 24 h were 22 87 50 57 and 57 47 respectively showing a considerable increase from 6 h to 12 h combined with the variations in ph and cr vi removal rates at 6 h and 12 h we inferred that a higher amount of cr iii precipitated on the surface of the composite and the adsorbed cr vi was reduced to cr iii by micro electrolysis for mbca700 fig 8b the molar ratio of cr iii species increased from 37 12 to 62 46 with an increase in the reaction time from 2 h to 6 h while the peak intensity of cr 2p remained relatively stable the peak intensity of cr 2p increased considerably after the reaction while the percentage ratio of cr iii decreased slightly to 56 40 the fe 2p spectrum could be split into eight peaks the peaks at 710 75 ev fe 2p3 2 724 35 ev fe 2p1 2 714 18 ev satellite and 726 92 ev satellite corresponded to fe ii and those at 712 23 ev fe 2p3 2 725 83 ev fe 2p1 2 718 62 ev satellite and 733 40 ev satellite corresponded to fe iii fig 8c and d 52 for mbcn700 fig 8c the percentage of surface fe ii first increased from 51 23 to 66 77 as the reaction time increased from 0 to 12 h and then decreased to 42 24 after the reaction which is inconsistent with the findings reported in previous studies 53 54 this result implies that fe ii produced by the micro electrolysis of fe c might have precipitated on the surface of mbcn700 moreover the percentage of surface fe ii decreased from 61 18 to 40 24 during the reaction for mbca700 fig 8d hence cr vi was reduced to cr iii by low valent fe e g zvi and fe ii during the reaction the c 1 s peak of mbcn700 fig s4a was fitted to three major components c c 284 77 ev c o 285 40 ev and co 287 34 ev bonds 21 before the reaction the relative molar contents of c c c o and co were 57 25 21 02 and 21 73 respectively after the reaction the relative molar content of c o increased slightly to 23 63 whereas that of c c and co decreased slightly to 55 45 and 20 92 respectively the c1s peak of mbca700 fig s4b was split into four components c c 284 56 ev c o 285 19 ev c o c 286 64 ev and o c c 288 62 ev bonds 55 after the reaction the contents of c c c o c o c and o c c in mbca700 changed from 39 41 26 87 21 08 and 12 64 to 39 18 27 67 19 82 and 13 33 respectively these values indicate that the changes in the peak intensities of the mbca700 components were almost negligible these results demonstrate that surface complexation had a negligible effect on the removal of aqueous cr vi the o 1 s spectrum of mbcn700 fig 8e can be resolved into two peaks c o fe o 531 41 ev and co 533 40 ev 21 after the reaction a new peak was observed at 529 95 ev which was assigned to cr2o3 suggesting that cr vi ions were reduced to cr iii which then combined with fe ii to form fecr2o4 43 48 additionally the c o fe o molar content increased sharply from 25 73 to 77 02 which could be related to the deposition of fe ions on the composite surfaces owing to fe c micro electrolysis four components existed in the o 1 s spectrum of mbca700 fig 8f fe o at 530 06 ev oh at 531 12 ev c o o c o at 531 74 ev and fe c o at 533 41 ev 56 owing to the core shell structure and less corrosive nature of γ fe0 the relative peak intensity of fe o increased slightly from 15 75 to 17 33 after the reaction however the percentage ratio of oh increased from 17 53 to 23 89 suggesting the formation of cr hydroxide on the surface of mbca700 based on these results we speculate that diverse mechanisms dominate the different phases of the cr vi removal process fig 9 for mbcn700 cr vi was initially adsorbed on the surface of mbcn700 and the micro electrolysis of fe c accelerated the redox reaction via electron transfer to the adsorbed cr vi in phase 1 eqs 7 9 thus the negatively charged cr vi was converted into the positively charged cr iii the ph of the solution increased rapidly because of the depletion of protons and the generation of oh by micro electrolysis as the reaction proceeded the generated cr iii precipitated with fe iii fe ii ions under alkaline conditions eqs 10 12 based on the xps analysis adsorption was the main mechanism of cr vi removal during this phase in phase 2 due to an increase in ph the positively charged surface changed to a negatively charged surface which showed electrostatic repulsion with the cr vi species more cr iii precipitated on the composite surface and the adsorbed cr vi was reduced to cr iii in phase 3 the removal rate decreased because a passivation layer was formed on the surface of mbcn700 consequently reduction could have a major impact on the removal of cr vi during phases 2 and 3 moreover adsorption followed by reduction was considered to be the main reason for the slight variation in cr peak for mbca700 the active sites for cr vi removal were abundant in phase 1 moreover the rapid removal was primarily attributed to simultaneous adsorption and reduction eqs 13 and 14 as the phpzc values of iron oxides on the surface ranged 6 10 45 the separation of cr iii and mbca700 was maintained because of electrostatic repulsion therefore even though reduction was important for the removal of cr vi fewer cr species were attached to the surface of mbca700 when compared to that of mbcn700 in phase1 during phase 2 similar to mbcn700 the surface of mbca700 changed from positive to negative as the ph increased consequently some adsorbed cr vi species were desorbed and cr iii was deposited on the mbca700 surface eq 15 during phase 3 more cr iii precipitated on the surfaces of the composites which could act as cation bridges to adsorb cr vi via electrostatic attraction 43 subsequently the precipitated cr iii further attached with cr vi by electrostatic attraction thereby improving cr vi removal and the molar percentage of cr vi consequently the intensity of the cr peaks at 24 h was significantly higher than that at 2 h and 6 h thus adsorption played a significant role in cr vi removal by mbca700 in phase 2 and 3 anode 7 f e 0 2 e fe ⅱ 8 fe ⅱ e fe ⅲ cathode 9 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 6 e 2 cr ⅲ 7 h 2 o 10 1 x fe ⅲ xcr ⅲ 3 h 2 o c r x f e 1 x oh 3 3 h 11 1

3 4 conclusions in this study two novel zvi biochar composites derived from cfs using a facile one pot synthesis method were used to remove aqueous cr vi the characterization results demonstrated that the composites had mesoporous graphitic carbon structures and embedded α fe0 γ fe0 which served as electron shuttles and donors respectively for cr vi reduction the maximum removal efficiencies of cr vi by the composites were achieved at ph 3 0 under oxic conditions the adsorption process followed the pso kinetic and freundlich isotherm models suggesting that cr vi removal can be primarily ascribed to multilayer chemisorption the properties of mbca700 including a core shell structure less corrosive zvi and a higher degree of graphitization resulted in a higher cr vi removal capacity compared with that of mbcn700 moreover the xps results confirmed that cr vi could be indirectly reduced by zvi via fec micro electrolysis during the removal process for mbcn700 while the carbon of mbca700 could act as an electron shuttle mediator to facilitate cr vi reduction considering the global importance of the circular economy and green development sludge derived zvi biochar composites

13038,pathogenic microorganism has always been a major threat to human health which results in infectious diseases and even massive death in the present study the solar light driven photocatalyst ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 was firstly used for water disinfection the results showed the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite completely inactivated 7 40 log10 cfu ml escherichia coli within only 20 min under light irradiation the inactivation mechanism was systematically investigated from the antioxidant enzymes cell membrane intracellular components and active species involved in the disinfection process at the early stage of disinfection the antioxidant system was initiated and increased enzyme activities to fight oxidative attack unfortunately with accumulation of oxidative damage the activities of antioxidant enzymes were suppressed leading to deterioration of defense system after destruction of defense system cell membrane was destroyed gradually monitored by k leakage and microscopic images furthermore severe destruction of cell membrane led to leakage of nucleic acid and proteins suggesting the irreversible death of bacteria the photogenerated active species including superoxide radicals and holes played major roles in bactericidal process in addition the composite exhibited high adaptability for water disinfection at a wide range of environmental factors including light intensity temperature ph and humic acid the slight release of ag 0 1 mg l and high stability of photocatalysts during successive disinfection experiments further implied its great potential for application this work introduced an efficient solar light driven photocatalyst ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 which exhibited a promising prospect for practical application in hope of providing more useful information for water disinfection graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst water disinfection bactericidal process environmental factors safety and stability 1 introduction pathogen in drinking water is the leading cause of various waterborne diseases which has been the most common and widespread health risk countless people were reported to be affected due to the water contaminated by pathogenic bacteria protozoa fungi viruses and prions 1 although traditional methods including ozonation ultraviolet radiation and chlorination have been demonstrated to be effective for water disinfection the various drawbacks of high operational cost regrowth of resistant bacteria and generation of toxic byproducts limit their practical implementation for sustainable development of human society 1 2 therefore development of alternative disinfection process that is effective and environmentally safe is necessary for safeguarding public health and sustainable development recently photocatalytic technology based on semiconductor photocatalysts has caught attention due to its low cost high efficiency non secondary pollution and potential to use solar energy 2 3 tio2 becomes attention grabbing in bacterial decontamination in water since it was firstly reported for its bactericidal activity in photocatalysis in 1985 4 however with a wide band gap of 3 0 3 2 ev tio2 can only respond to the ultraviolet light which accounts for only 4 of the solar light causing a waste of solar energy 5 therefore there is an urgent need to develop the photocatalysts that take full advantage of solar energy to effectively control water contamination caused by pathogens for human health up to date efforts have focused on the development of visible light driven and solar light driven photocatalysts 5 7 bi based photocatalysts have become the focus in photocatalysis application due to their promising visible light absorption high chemical stability and non toxicity 7 9 among them bi2wo6 the simplest member of the aurivillius family n 1 constructed by alternating layers of bi2o2 and perovskite like slab wo4 has excellent intrinsic physical and chemical properties with relatively high photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation 3 8 however its photocatalytic activity is restricted to the limited absorption in wavelength shorter than 460 nm and high recombination rate of electron hole e h pairs 3 compared to the single semiconductors the construction of heterojunction with two or more semiconductors has been demonstrated to reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated e h pairs thereby enhancing photocatalytic activity 7 10 in addition introducing co catalysts with high electron mobility such as graphene oxide and ag species could further optimize the photocatalytic performance via acting as an electron acceptor to suppress the e h recombination 10 12 based on these our lab successfully synthesized solar light driven two dimensional heterostructures ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 in which monolayer bipo4 chemically grew on bi2wo6 nano sheets with ag ag2o nanoparticles 6 in this composite the strong chemical interaction and the adjacent valence bands of bi2wo6 and bipo4 endowed the composite with enhanced charge transfer within the heterostructures and ag ag2o could efficiently trap photoinduced e to separate e h pairs hence accelerating the photocatalytic reaction 6 11 moreover compared to bi2wo6 ag ag2o bi2wo6 and bipo4 bi2wo6 ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity for organic degradation and water oxidation which was clarified due to its highest quantum efficiency and fast charge separation and transfer 6 up to date there is limited information about its application in water disinfection therefore aimed at its excellent photocatalytic activity its disinfection ability of waterborne bacteria is worth further investigation regarding the photocatalytic disinfection it was widely accepted that active species generated by photocatalysts were responsible for sterilization of wastewater 1 hu et al showed that superoxide radicals o2 were primary reactive species for organic degradation by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 6 but due to the complicated biological properties the active species responsible for bacterial disinfection usually varies from those for organic degradation which needs detailed investigation to better understand the photocatalytic disinfection process the investigation of various bacterial activities needs to be considered 13 14 catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod are two important indicators for the oxidative stress which could defend against the oxidative attack encountered by bacteria cells during the photocatalytic inactivation process 14 k leakage is most commonly monitored for the cell membrane integrity which can easily become abnormal once the cell membrane is damaged due to its basic participation in the regulation of polysome content and protein synthesis 15 in addition released proteins and nucleic acid were also measured to describe the cell damage during the disinfection process 2 although many bacterial activities were reported the analysis about the destruction process of bacteria after attacked by active species and the possible bactericidal mechanism of photocatalytic disinfection is still insufficient especially for ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 which requires systematic investigation on the other hand photocatalytic reaction in the actual environment is influenced by many factors such as light intensity temperature and ph 5 16 moreover raw water contains a wide range of natural organic matters nom which are variable in concentration but typically around 2 10 mg l represented by dissolved organic carbon doc 17 humic acid ha is a major component of nom formed by the decomposition of plant and animal material 18 the presence of ha was reported to affect photocatalytic disinfection by competing with bacteria for reactive species and retarding the collision between the bacteria and photocatalysts 19 20 therefore investigating the adaptability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 for various environmental factors is essential for its further application in real water fields herein the solar light driven ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst was synthesized and used for the photocatalytic disinfection on escherichia coli e coli the possible disinfection mechanism was systematically clarified from the bactericidal process and reactive species regarding its application for natural water the effects of various environmental factors light intensity ph temperature and ha on the inactivation efficiency were evaluated in addition the safety and stability of photocatalysts were also elucidated it is expected that this study could provide valuable information for its further practical application in real water disinfection 2 materials and methods 2 1

based on liu et al 5 scavenger study without photocatalyst addition was also performed to eliminate the potential disinfection effect of scavenger compounds the stability of the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst was investigated by consecutive cyclic disinfection experiments under the same condition as described in section 2 2 after each cycle the photocatalysts were collected and washed with 75 ethanol and pbs for several times after drying the harvested photocatalysts were used for next cycle 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of as prepared catalysts the morphologies of bi2wo6 and ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 were visualized by sem as shown in fig s2a b the bare bi2wo6 exhibited a typical plate like structure after modification with ag ag2o and bipo4 the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6

fig s3a the results exhibited the diffraction peaks of pristine bi2wo6 and ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 at 28 3 32 8 47 0 55 8 and 58 5 corresponded to 1 3 1 2 0 0 2 0 2 1 3 3 and 2 6 2 planes respectively based on orthorhombic phase of bi2wo6 jcpds no 39 0256 indicating the unchanged crystalline phase of bi2wo6 in the composites moreover the increased intensity of characteristic peaks in ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 suggested its better crystallinity than bi2wo6 benefiting for its higher photocatalytic activity 26 in addition fig s3b illustrated the uv vis absorption spectrum of as synthesized photocatalysts compared to bi2wo6 ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 exhibited an enhanced absorption in the range of 400 800 nm indicating its strong ability to absorb visible light for photocatalytic activity the pl spectra in fig s3c exhibited the much lower pl intensity of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 than that of bi2wo6 demonstrating its high separation and low recombination of e h pairs which also contributed to its remarkable photocatalytic activity 6 26 moreover the xps was further employed to confirm the existence of ag bi o w and p elements and chemical states of synthesized ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 catalyst fig 1 the binding energies were calibrated based on the c 1s peak at 284 8 ev as shown in fig 1b the peaks at 374 8 ev and 368 9 ev were attributed to ag0 25 27 while the peaks located at 374 4 ev and 367 7 ev indicated the presence of ag of the ag2o 6 27 the two peaks centered at 165 2 ev and 159 8 ev fig 1c are assigned to bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 binding energy of bi3 28 in addition the signals of o 1s fig 1d contained four distinct peaks at 529 8 ev 530 7 ev 531 7 ev and 533 0 ev which belonged to w o bi o p o and oxygen of oh groups respectively 25 29 moreover the peak at 529 8 ev also indicated the ag o bonds in the composites 30 furthermore there were two peaks at 38 0 ev and 35 6 ev of w 4f in fig 1e corresponding to w 4f5 2 and w 4f7 2 respectively 31 and the peak located at 134 9 ev of p 2p fig 1f demonstrated the crystal lattice of p5 25 thus the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 catalyst was successfully synthesized with appreciable photocatalytic properties which has great potential for water disinfection 3 2 photocatalytic disinfection performance the photocatalytic disinfection performance of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 catalyst was investigated by inactivation of e coli under simulated solar light fig 2a as comparison the antibacterial activities of bi2wo6 and commercial tio2 were also explored the results showed that the photocatalyst ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 exhibited high disinfection efficiency toward e coli 7 40 log10 cfu ml under simulated solar light irradiation with complete inactivation observed only within 20 min in contrast only 0 59 log10 and 0 31 log10 reductions of viable cells were observed for bi2wo6 and commercial tio2 under simulated solar light irradiation the obvious difference in inactivation efficiencies of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 bi2wo6 and tio2 photocatalysts were visualized by the photographs of e coli bacteria colony after 20 min treatment under simulated solar light irradiation fig 2b besides chick s model was used to fit the disinfection rates of e coli by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 bi2wo6 and tio2 photocatalysts 21 22 as displayed in fig s4 the disinfection rate of e coli by as prepared photocatalysts fitted well with chick s model with r2 values all greater than 0 99 and the k value of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 0 3718 min 1 was much higher than that of bi2wo6 0 0295 min 1 and tio2 0 0153 min 1 confirming the superior disinfection performance of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 in addition no obvious decrease in e coli cell density was observed in the light control indicating that simulated solar light irradiation has no effect on the cell viability moreover compared to two reference samples ag ag2o bi2wo6 and bipo4 bi2wo6 6 the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite also exhibited the highest photocatalytic disinfection efficiency under simulated solar light irradiation fig s5 then table 1 compared the photocatalytic inactivation efficiency of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 with some bi2wo6 based photocatalysts compared with the most bi2wo6 based photocatalysts such as bi2wo6 bioi 32 bi2wo6 ws2 33 sns bi2wo6 34 and mos2 bi2wo6 35 the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite showed much higher inactivation efficiency to e coli of 2 50 109 cfu g min which was about 32 221 times as high as these photocatalysts these results indicated a remarkable photocatalytic activity of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite for water disinfection which was resulted from its enhanced visible light absorption low e h recombination and fast charge separation 6 the layered heterostructures of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 enabled interfacial contact between different components fig s2b which could shorten the transmission distance of electrons therefore facilitating photo generated charge transfer and quantum efficiency 36 in addition the inductive effects of po4 3 in bipo4 and the surface plasmon resonance spr effect of ag contributed to the separation of e h pairs enhancing its photocatalytic performance 37 interestingly even under dark condition there was also a 1 8 log10 decrease in the viable cell density of e coli caused by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 fig s6 this was probably attributed to the bactericidal roles of both active species produced under dark condition and ag nanoparticles formed on the surface of composites 24 38 39 it was reported that ag nanoparticles possessed bactericidal activity and its presence in the photocatalysts contributed to the generation of active species like o2 even under dark condition 38 40 however negligible inactivation of e coli was observed for commercial tio2 and bi2wo6 under dark condition for 20 min indicating that the commercial tio2 and pristine bi2wo6 were incapable of antibacterial activities without light irradiation furthermore the bactericidal activity of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst at different catalyst dosage 0 25 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 g l were also investigated fig 2c the results showed that the disinfection activity of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite increased from 66 6 to 100 with the increase in catalyst dosage from 0 25 g l to 0 50 g l this was probably due to the enhanced active species generated by more photocatalysts however the antibacterial activity slightly decreased when the catalyst dosage further increased from 0 50 g l to 1 00 g l which was mainly ascribed to the light shielding effect caused by the enhanced turbidity of catalyst solution 5 moreover excessive photocatalysts are prone to form catalyst aggregation which decreases surface active sites and photon absorptivity of catalysts influencing the photocatalytic inactivation ability 42 therefore 0 50 g l was selected as the optimal loading for further assays in this study 3 3 photocatalytic bactericidal process to better understand the bacterial cell damage process induced by the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite the activities of cat and sod were firstly monitored as shown in fig 3a at the beginning of photocatalytic inactivation process the activities of cat and sod exhibited an increased tendency and attained the maximum value at 15 min cat 0 15 mu ml sod 16 18 inhibition rate but the decrease of both cat and sod activities was observed after 15 min of disinfection and continued thereafter cat and sod are two important antioxidant enzymes which convert active species into less or non harmful substances such as water and oxygen protecting bacterial cells from oxidative damage 14 therefore the increased activities of cat and sod observed in the beginning demonstrated that e coli cells initiated the self protection system secreting more antioxidant enzymes to avoid oxidative attack produced by the photocatalysts however with the prolonged treatment by photocatalyst the activities of cat and sod decreased significantly indicating the overwhelmed defense capacity of antioxidant enzymes caused by the accumulation of active species in the disinfection process the destruction of cell defense system was responsible for the subsequent dysfunction of bacterial cells and severe oxidative damage of cell membrane to investigate membrane integrity k leakage was monitored during the disinfection process fig 3b the results showed that the k concentration increased significantly within 10 min and then continued to rise as the irradiation time prolonged in the presence of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite suggesting the notable damage in the cell membrane structure in comparison no obvious fluctuation in k concentration was observed without the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite bacterial cell membrane shows great significance for keeping cell viability which acts as a protective barrier between cell intracellular components and the extracellular environment enveloping the essential organelles due to the important roles in the polysome regulation and protein synthesis k tends to be easily released when the cell membrane is damaged 15 therefore at the start of the disinfection process large amounts of k leaked from e coli cells due to the oxidative attack caused by photocatalysts meanwhile bacteria secreted more cat and sod to defend against the oxidative damage but with prolonged photocatalytic treatment the antioxidant system was destroyed by the accumulated damage of active species resulting in the reduced enzyme activities thereby leading to the destruction of cell membrane undoubtedly severely damaged cells can cause the leakage of nucleic acid and proteins leading to the loss of cell cultivability therefore nucleic acid and proteins leaked from e coli cells were also assayed during the disinfection process fig 3c and d as presented in fig 3c the leakage of nucleic acid increased significantly when the e coli was exposed to ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 catalyst for prolonging the light irradiation time indicating the aggravated damage encountered by e coli cells in contrast slight change of nucleic acid leakage was observed in the light control without photocatalysts similarly the released protein content significantly increased from 1 65 mg l to 15 97 mg l with the treatment of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite under light irradiation fig 3d however no obvious fluctuation in protein content was detected from e coli in the absence of photocatalysts the nucleic acid and protein leakages at the early stage in the system are ascribed to the natural decay of bacteria and the oxidative damage caused by active species due to the self repair and regrowth bacteria could not lose their viability immediately but mobilize related antioxidant enzymes cat and sod to protect themselves with the uninterrupted attack of active species the activities of cat and sod decreased significantly once the defense system was destructed severe damage to the nucleic acid caused complete lethal to bacteria ultimately resulting in the cell death 13 moreover with the prolonged treatment of photocatalysts bacterial cells were further destroyed to pieces leading to more release of nucleic acid and proteins besides toc concentration of e coli suspension was further measured to investigate the decomposition and mineralization of e coli cells during the disinfection process as shown in fig s7 the toc concentration was decreased gradually with increased treatment time of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 under simulated solar light irradiation indicating the decomposition of bacterial cells during disinfection process after 60 min disinfection cell mineralization rate of e coli reached to about 76 8 this suggested that even though the bacterial cell could start defense system to protect themselves at the initial stage of disinfection the bacterial envelope was still damaged by accumulated active species resulting in cell decomposition after the bacteria were inactivated the cell debris and leaked intracellular components such as nucleic acid and proteins could become the targets and continue to be oxidized by active species which caused the continuous reduction of toc concentration in addition the destruction process of e coli cell was also visualized by sem during the inactivation process fig 3e the e coli cell displayed rod shaped morphology with an intact cell membrane before photocatalytic treatment after being treated for 10 min the cells were deformed and contained some pits and bulges on the surface indicating the initial damage of cell membrane caused by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite under light irradiation when the photocatalytic treatment was prolonged to 20 min holes and decomposition of cell membrane were observed implying the serious destruction of e coli cells finally the cells were thoroughly disrupted into debris after 60 min of photocatalytic treatment this observation confirmed that ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite destroyed cell membrane progressively under light irradiation leading to the leakage of intracellular components and eventual collapse of bacteria given the results of the enzymes cat and sod intracellular component leakage k nucleic acid and protein cell mineralization and morphological changes of e coli cells the inactivation process mediated by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 was firstly systematically investigated which was beneficial for the in depth understanding of inactivation mechanism of bacteria 3 4 disinfection mechanism mediated by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 to investigate the disinfection mechanism mediated by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite the scavenger experiments were conducted to clarify the contribution of respective active species during the disinfection system the effects of all applied scavengers on e coli were also evaluated to eliminate their toxicity on bacteria no obvious reduction was observed for viable cell density implying that none of the scavengers showed toxicity for e coil during the disinfection process fig 4a as shown in fig 4b 7 40 log10 cfu ml of e coli was completely inactivated within 20 min by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite under light irradiation in the absence of scavengers a significant decrease of bactericidal effect was observed after addition of tempol suggesting the primary role of o2 involved in the disinfection process moreover the vital role of h was also confirmed by the conspicuous reduction of inactivation efficiency after the introduction of na2c2o4 in the photocatalytic system the negligible effect of isopropanol for antibacterial efficiency indicated the minor role of oh in the process of e coli inactivation the similar results were also obtained by xiang et al in the photocatalytic disinfection system of bi2wo6 bioi photocatalyst 32 o2 involved in the disinfection process can be produced through the reaction of photogenerated e and dissolved o2 which can cause oxidative damage to bacterial cells in addition o2 was reported to be easily accumulated compared to oh due to its longer life span t1 2 1 μs than that of oh t1 2 1 ns 43 moreover the photo generated h on the valence band of photocatalysts possessed strong oxidative ability and could directly damage e coli cells by attacking cell membrane as a result o2 and h played the prominent roles in the disinfection process mediated by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 in addition the released ions ag and bi3 from photocatalysts were also monitored during the disinfection process of e coli to evaluate their possible antibacterial effect as shown in table 2 during the disinfection of 60 min the concentration of ag leakage ranged from 0 06 0 001 mg l to 0 08 0 001 mg l and the released bi3 concentration was lower than 0 03 mg l it was reported that the existence of ag caused bacterial cell damage by the reaction with thiol group of cysteine in proteins 38 a complete inactivation of 6 log10 cfu ml of e coli requires a minimum ag concentration of 10 mg l after 3 h contact time 44 besides li et al also observed negligible effect on e coli inactivation 7 log10 cfu ml by ag of 6 mg l 20 furthermore bi3 exhibited antibacterial effects with inhibitory concentration at 2 10 mm due to its direct and indirect inhibition in enzyme function 45 however the leakage of ag and bi3 in this study was much lower than the reported limit hence the outstanding inactivation performance of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 was mainly ascribed to the photo generated active species instead of the released ag and bi3 during the disinfection process moreover the maximum concentration of ag leakage 0 08 0 001 mg l was lower than the world health organization who drinking water limit 0 1 mg l 46 which might not be toxic for aquatic animals and humans though the bi3 ions released from ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite was detected 0 03 mg l there was limited information about its toxicity for human health to the contrary bi is an ingredient in some pharmaceuticals 47 and some of its compounds are used for cosmetics and pigments 48 therefore the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite is safe and environmentally friendly and could be an appropriate candidate for natural water disinfection based on the above results the possible disinfection mechanism of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst for e coli was proposed in fig 4c in the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite bipo4 was successfully grown on bi2wo6 surface via strong chemical bonds po4 3 and bi with ag ag2o co formed in the heterostructures therefore upon stimulation of solar light the electrons generated from bi2wo6 ag2o and bipo4 were excited to the conduction bands leaving the holes at valence bands the generated electrons on the conduction bands are easily transferred to ag nanoparticles due to the more negative potential of conduction bands of bi2wo6 0 33 ev vs nhe ag2o 0 2 ev vs nhe and bipo4 0 65 ev vs nhe than the fermi level of ag 0 99 ev vs nhe 25 the ag nanoparticles could work with ag2o as an electron pool to accelerate the electron transfer 11 due to the strong spr effect the electrons on the surface of ag nanoparticles could also be excited then large number electrons could be directly injected to conduction band of bipo4 6 in this regard due to the more negative conduction band of bipo4 than the reduction potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe the e gathered on the conduction band of bipo4 could reduce o2 to generate o2 o2 e o2 o2 is strongly involved in the disinfection process of e coli which could penetrate cell membrane leading to the damage of intracellular components on the other hand the holes left on the valence bands of bi2wo6 and bipo4 are shifted to ag2o because of the more positive potential of valence bands of bi2wo6 2 94 ev vs nhe and bipo4 3 2 ev vs nhe than ag2o 1 4 ev vs vhe 25 49 in this regard the holes were accumulated on the valence band of ag2o then the bacterial cells could be directly oxidized by the holes via direct contact with ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite therefore the oxidative stress encountered by e coli mainly resulted from o2 and h in the disinfection process of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite fig 4b to avoid the oxidative attack e coli cells initiated defense system through introduction of antioxidant enzymes cat and sod to deal with the harmful effects of active species so at the first 15 min of disinfection process the activities of cat and sod increased significantly to protect bacteria cells from the attack of o2 and h fig 3a but with the accumulation of active species o2 and h the cat and sod were destroyed gradually reflecting on the decreased activities after 15 min treatment in fig 3a indicating the overwhelmed defense capacity after the destruction of cell defense system the cell membrane integrity and permeability were destroyed resulting in the dysfunction of the k transport systems and the ion channels 50 significant leakage of k was observed from the e coli treated by photocatalysts fig 3b which could further interfere in other physiological activity of e coli 14 with the prolonged treatment e coli cells were damaged severely with holes and decomposition of cell membrane leading to the serious leakage of cytoplasmic substances including proteins and nucleic acid fig 3c e the severe damage to the nucleic acid could cause complete lethal to bacteria ultimately resulting in the cell death 13 with the increase of irradiation time the e coli cells were further disrupted and degraded into debris by active species fig 3e in addition the cell debris and leaked intracellular substances could be further oxidized till complete mineralization in this part the photocatalytic bactericidal mechanism mediated by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite was systematically investigated under solar light irradiation in hope of providing theoretical basis for its practical application for water disinfection 3 5 the environmental applicability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 in view of superior bactericidal capacity the applicability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite for water disinfection was also investigated through evaluating the effects of various environmental factors light intensity temperature ph and ha and the stability of photocatalyst photocatalytic technology is dependent on light intensity which provides the excitation energy for the photocatalysts and played the decisive role in the photocatalytic reaction therefore the effect of light intensity on the disinfection system was evaluated in the intensity range of 500 700 w m2 in this study as shown in fig 5a the antibacterial activity of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite was enhanced significantly with the complete inactivation decreased from 20 min to 10 min when the light intensity was increased from 500 w m2 to 700 w m2 this was attributed to the elevated generation of active species due to the high energy resulted from the increased light intensity generally natural sunlight distributed over the surface of earth seldom exceeds 1000 w m2 and its intensity varies with time season and geographical location 51 even under the environmental average light intensity of 500 w m2 5 ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite achieved 7 4 log10 inactivation of e coli only within 20 min indicating a great potential for the water disinfection under the actual sun light irradiation as the most abundant permanent source of energy solar energy provides unlimited possibilities and profound prospects for solar light driven photocatalysis in water disinfection the effect of temperature showed that all of the e coli cells were inactivated within 20 min when the temperature varied from 20 c to 30 c fig 5b moreover the disinfection efficiency exhibited significant enhancement with complete inactivation time decreased from 20 min to 10 min when the temperature was increased from 30 c to 37 c the increased disinfection performance probably resulted from the change in fatty acid composition of cell membrane caused by temperature 5 52 the fatty acid composition influences the cell membrane fluidity and susceptibility which is mainly determined by the balance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid 52 more unsaturated fatty acid leads to a less rigid cell membrane which is easier to be attacked by active species 5 52 in addition the high temperature could enhance the collision frequency of molecules in the photocatalytic system leading to an improved reaction rate 53 these results suggested that ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite was effective for water disinfection at environmental temperature 20 c 37 c and preferred a temperature range of 30 c 37 c ph is also a crucial factor in the photocatalytic process which influences the generation of active species and the bacterial membrane property therefore the effects of ph on the disinfection performance were also investigated the initial ph of the system was adjusted to 5 5 6 5 7 0 7 5 and 8 5 an enhanced inactivation performance was observed in neutral and slightly alkaline condition 7 0 8 5 fig 5c all of the e coli cells were completely inactivated within 20 min when the initial solution ph was varied from 7 0 to 8 5 when the ph was decreased from 7 0 to 6 5 the complete inactivation time was increased to 30 min further decrease of the initial ph to 5 5 resulted in a slight reduction of disinfection efficiency compared with ph value of 6 5 the difference in the inactivation effect at different ph value was probably ascribed to the generation of active species at different condition o2 is unstable in the acidic condition and easily reacts with h which results in the decreased disinfection performance 54 in addition the proportion of unsaturated fatty acid may increase with the rise in ph which makes the cell membrane vulnerable and easily destroyed by active species leading to efficient disinfection 55 the normal ph of surface water lay within 6 5 8 5 56 therefore the high disinfection ability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite at a wide range of ph 5 5 8 5 indicated a promising prospect for natural water disinfection as a major component of nom contained in the surface water the effects of ha were also explored in this study as shown in fig 5d ha exhibited negligible effect on photocatalytic bactericidal performance at lower concentration 0 5 3 0 mg l with all of the e coli inactivated within 20 min further increase of ha concentration to 5 0 mg l resulted in a decrease of photocatalytic bactericidal activity when the ha concentration varied in a range of 5 0 10 0 mg l all of the e coli cells were eliminated within 30 min the inhibition occurred in the higher concentration of ha could be due to the physical barrier of ha between the photocatalysts and e coli cells as well as the competition with e coli for active species ha easily combines with e coli cells by hydrogen bond and π π stacking interactions retarding the contact frequency of bacteria composites 20 in addition ha could be oxidized by o2 reducing the effective attack of o2 for e coli 57 besides the doc concentration of ha in the present study was measured in the range of 0 22 19 46 mg l which was much wider than the typical nom concentration in the raw water 2 10 mg l 17 the high adaptability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composites for different ha concentration exhibited potential application in the actual inactivation of microbial contaminated water these results indicated that the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite had a wide applicability under various environmental factors which was promising for environmental water disinfection in addition a series of disinfection experiments were conducted using recycled photocatalysts to investigate the stability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite for water disinfection fig 6a the results showed that complete inactivation of e coli cells 7 40 log10 cfu ml was achieved within 20 min for the first three cycles in the fourth cycle the photocatalytic bactericidal activity exhibited a slight reduction with complete inactivation time within 30 min the slight decrease of disinfection was primarily ascribed to the catalyst loss during the washing process of photocatalysts moreover the bacterial residues on the surface of photocatalysts could block the active sites resulting in a decrease of photocatalytic performance given the difficult recovery of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 powders from the solution it is essential to develop an immobilized system in future furthermore the photocatalysts before and after reaction were also characterized by xrd fig 6b notably no difference was observed for the structure of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst before and after inactivation indicating its excellent stability in practical application as discussed before the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite also exhibited remarkable bactericidal efficiency fig 2a and table 1 and high safety table 2 combined with the high adaptability to different environmental factors and excellent stability during long term disinfection the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite has great prospects for applying in environmental water fields 4 conclusions in this study the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst was firstly used for water disinfection under simulated solar light irradiation the photocatalyst showed remarkable bactericidal efficiency toward e coli the photo generated o2 and h played important roles in the disinfection process in addition the bactericidal process specified that cat and sod activities of target bacteria increased at the beginning to avoid oxidative shock but decreased by accumulated damage caused by active species o2 and h the overwhelmed antioxidant system led to subsequent damage of cell membrane causing intracellular component leakage and final collapse of bacterial cells furthermore the excellent photocatalytic bactericidal performance resulted from photocatalytic activity instead of eluted ag and bi3 from photocatalyst moreover the photocatalyst exhibited high adaptability in a wide range of environmental factors and also possessed high safety and excellent stability for practical application this study provides an efficient water disinfection technology with a promising prospect for real water disinfection in addition considering its practical potential efforts will be also made to design a solar light driven immobilized system of ag ag2o bipo4

13038,pathogenic microorganism has always been a major threat to human health which results in infectious diseases and even massive death in the present study the solar light driven photocatalyst ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 was firstly used for water disinfection the results showed the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite completely inactivated 7 40 log10 cfu ml escherichia coli within only 20 min under light irradiation the inactivation mechanism was systematically investigated from the antioxidant enzymes cell membrane intracellular components and active species involved in the disinfection process at the early stage of disinfection the antioxidant system was initiated and increased enzyme activities to fight oxidative attack unfortunately with accumulation of oxidative damage the activities of antioxidant enzymes were suppressed leading to deterioration of defense system after destruction of defense system cell membrane was destroyed gradually monitored by k leakage and microscopic images furthermore severe destruction of cell membrane led to leakage of nucleic acid and proteins suggesting the irreversible death of bacteria the photogenerated active species including superoxide radicals and holes played major roles in bactericidal process in addition the composite exhibited high adaptability for water disinfection at a wide range of environmental factors including light intensity temperature ph and humic acid the slight release of ag 0 1 mg l and high stability of photocatalysts during successive disinfection experiments further implied its great potential for application this work introduced an efficient solar light driven photocatalyst ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 which exhibited a promising prospect for practical application in hope of providing more useful information for water disinfection graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst water disinfection bactericidal process environmental factors safety and stability 1 introduction pathogen in drinking water is the leading cause of various waterborne diseases which has been the most common and widespread health risk countless people were reported to be affected due to the water contaminated by pathogenic bacteria protozoa fungi viruses and prions 1 although traditional methods including ozonation ultraviolet radiation and chlorination have been demonstrated to be effective for water disinfection the various drawbacks of high operational cost regrowth of resistant bacteria and generation of toxic byproducts limit their practical implementation for sustainable development of human society 1 2 therefore development of alternative disinfection process that is effective and environmentally safe is necessary for safeguarding public health and sustainable development recently photocatalytic technology based on semiconductor photocatalysts has caught attention due to its low cost high efficiency non secondary pollution and potential to use solar energy 2 3 tio2 becomes attention grabbing in bacterial decontamination in water since it was firstly reported for its bactericidal activity in photocatalysis in 1985 4 however with a wide band gap of 3 0 3 2 ev tio2 can only respond to the ultraviolet light which accounts for only 4 of the solar light causing a waste of solar energy 5 therefore there is an urgent need to develop the photocatalysts that take full advantage of solar energy to effectively control water contamination caused by pathogens for human health up to date efforts have focused on the development of visible light driven and solar light driven photocatalysts 5 7 bi based photocatalysts have become the focus in photocatalysis application due to their promising visible light absorption high chemical stability and non toxicity 7 9 among them bi2wo6 the simplest member of the aurivillius family n 1 constructed by alternating layers of bi2o2 and perovskite like slab wo4 has excellent intrinsic physical and chemical properties with relatively high photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation 3 8 however its photocatalytic activity is restricted to the limited absorption in wavelength shorter than 460 nm and high recombination rate of electron hole e h pairs 3 compared to the single semiconductors the construction of heterojunction with two or more semiconductors has been demonstrated to reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated e h pairs thereby enhancing photocatalytic activity 7 10 in addition introducing co catalysts with high electron mobility such as graphene oxide and ag species could further optimize the photocatalytic performance via acting as an electron acceptor to suppress the e h recombination 10 12 based on these our lab successfully synthesized solar light driven two dimensional heterostructures ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 in which monolayer bipo4 chemically grew on bi2wo6 nano sheets with ag ag2o nanoparticles 6 in this composite the strong chemical interaction and the adjacent valence bands of bi2wo6 and bipo4 endowed the composite with enhanced charge transfer within the heterostructures and ag ag2o could efficiently trap photoinduced e to separate e h pairs hence accelerating the photocatalytic reaction 6 11 moreover compared to bi2wo6 ag ag2o bi2wo6 and bipo4 bi2wo6 ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity for organic degradation and water oxidation which was clarified due to its highest quantum efficiency and fast charge separation and transfer 6 up to date there is limited information about its application in water disinfection therefore aimed at its excellent photocatalytic activity its disinfection ability of waterborne bacteria is worth further investigation regarding the photocatalytic disinfection it was widely accepted that active species generated by photocatalysts were responsible for sterilization of wastewater 1 hu et al showed that superoxide radicals o2 were primary reactive species for organic degradation by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 6 but due to the complicated biological properties the active species responsible for bacterial disinfection usually varies from those for organic degradation which needs detailed investigation to better understand the photocatalytic disinfection process the investigation of various bacterial activities needs to be considered 13 14 catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod are two important indicators for the oxidative stress which could defend against the oxidative attack encountered by bacteria cells during the photocatalytic inactivation process 14 k leakage is most commonly monitored for the cell membrane integrity which can easily become abnormal once the cell membrane is damaged due to its basic participation in the regulation of polysome content and protein synthesis 15 in addition released proteins and nucleic acid were also measured to describe the cell damage during the disinfection process 2 although many bacterial activities were reported the analysis about the destruction process of bacteria after attacked by active species and the possible bactericidal mechanism of photocatalytic disinfection is still insufficient especially for ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 which requires systematic investigation on the other hand photocatalytic reaction in the actual environment is influenced by many factors such as light intensity temperature and ph 5 16 moreover raw water contains a wide range of natural organic matters nom which are variable in concentration but typically around 2 10 mg l represented by dissolved organic carbon doc 17 humic acid ha is a major component of nom formed by the decomposition of plant and animal material 18 the presence of ha was reported to affect photocatalytic disinfection by competing with bacteria for reactive species and retarding the collision between the bacteria and photocatalysts 19 20 therefore investigating the adaptability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 for various environmental factors is essential for its further application in real water fields herein the solar light driven ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst was synthesized

was adjusted to 7 using nh3 h2o then the obtained solution was transferred to 100 ml teflon lined autoclave and maintained at 160 c for 18 h after that the cooled products were obtained by centrifugation and followed by washing with water and ethanol thoroughly then the obtained precipitate was resuspended in 45 ml of ethanol and followed by adding 2 μmol of ag ag3po4 and agno3 solution which was pre dissolved in 1 m hno3 after the po4 3 content was adjusted to 0 7 with k2hpo4 the obtained suspension was placed in 100 ml teflon lined autoclave and allowed to react at 120 c for 4 h finally the resultant precipitates were collected by washing with water and dried at 80 c for 16 h the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst was successfully synthesized in addition the pure bi2wo6 was

photocatalysts without light irradiation and light control experiment bacterial solution with light irradiation without photocatalysts were also performed moreover kinetics of photocatalytic disinfection was investigated based on chick s model according to yang et al 21 and watts et al 22 in which log n n0 was plotted as a function of time t min the slope of the line was denoted as k the first order inactivation rate constant n n0 was the reduction in the bacterial concentration all the disinfection experiments were conducted in triplicate in the experiments all the glass apparatuses and solutions were autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min to maintain sterile environment for further application of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite in natural water the key factors that could influence the disinfection performance were systematically investigated including light intensity 500 600 and 700 w m2 initial solution ph 5 5 6 5 7 0 7 5 and 8 5 temperature 20 25 30 and 37 c and ha concentration

changes of e coli exposed to the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst under simulated solar light irradiation 0 10 20 and 60 min were visualized by sem fe sem s 4800 edx hitachi japan briefly the bacterial samples were collected and followed by centrifuging at 6000 rpm for 5 min then the residues were fixed by 4 glutaraldehyde for 4 h after washing with pbs three times 5 min each the residues were fixed by 2 glutaraldehyde for 1 h and then rinsed three times with pbs 5 min each then the bacterial cells were subjected to sequential dehydration in graded ethanol 20 50 80 and 100 finally the specimens were freeze dried and platinum sputter coated before visualized with sem 2 5 functional scavenger study and cyclic disinfection experiments to better understand the disinfection mechanism of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 different scavengers were utilized to remove the corresponding active species in the photocatalytic process briefly sodium oxalate na2c2o4 100 mm was used for h elimination isopropanol 5 mm was utilized for hydroxyl radical oh scavenging and 4 hydroxy 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl piperidinyloxy tempol 2 mm was employed for o2 removal 5 24 the concentrations above were optimized based on liu et al 5 scavenger study without photocatalyst addition was also performed to eliminate the potential disinfection effect of scavenger compounds the stability of the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst was investigated by consecutive cyclic disinfection experiments under the same condition as described in section 2 2 after each cycle the photocatalysts were collected and washed with 75 ethanol and pbs for several times after drying the harvested photocatalysts were used for next cycle 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of as prepared catalysts the morphologies of bi2wo6 and ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 were visualized by sem as shown in fig s2a b the bare bi2wo6 exhibited a typical plate like structure after modification with ag ag2o and bipo4 the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 catalyst displayed a hierarchical structure with aggregated nanoflakes which could reinforce interfacial contact beneficial for its charge transfer 6 25 then the tem images of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 in fig s2c displayed the clear lattice spacings of 0 2350 0 2040 0 2362 0 1925 and 0 2731 nm which corresponded to the 1 1 1 plane of ag 2 0 0 plane of ag 2 0 0 plane of ag2o 3 0 1 plane of bipo4 and 0 2 0 plane of bi2wo6 respectively confirming the existence of ag ag2o bipo4 on the bi2wo6 sheets in addition the crystal phases of as synthesized photocatalysts were identified by xrd patterns shown in fig s3a the results exhibited the diffraction peaks of pristine bi2wo6 and ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 at 28 3 32 8 47 0 55 8 and 58 5 corresponded to 1 3 1 2 0 0 2 0 2 1 3 3 and 2 6 2 planes respectively based on orthorhombic phase of bi2wo6 jcpds no 39 0256 indicating the unchanged crystalline phase of bi2wo6 in the composites moreover the increased intensity of characteristic peaks in ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 suggested its better crystallinity than bi2wo6 benefiting for its higher photocatalytic activity 26 in addition fig s3b illustrated the uv vis absorption spectrum of as synthesized photocatalysts compared to bi2wo6 ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 exhibited an enhanced absorption in the range of 400 800 nm indicating its strong ability to absorb visible light for photocatalytic activity the pl spectra in fig s3c exhibited the much lower pl intensity of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 than that of bi2wo6 demonstrating its high separation and low recombination of e h pairs which also contributed to its remarkable photocatalytic activity 6 26 moreover the xps was further employed to confirm the existence of ag bi o w and p elements and chemical states of synthesized ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 catalyst fig 1 the binding energies were calibrated based on the c 1s peak at 284 8 ev as shown in fig 1b the peaks at 374 8 ev and 368 9 ev were attributed to ag0 25 27 while the peaks located at 374 4 ev and 367 7 ev indicated the presence of ag of the ag2o 6 27 the two peaks centered at 165 2 ev and 159 8 ev fig 1c are assigned to bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 binding energy of bi3 28 in addition the signals of o 1s fig 1d contained four distinct peaks at 529 8 ev 530 7 ev 531 7 ev and 533 0 ev which belonged to w o bi o p o and oxygen of oh groups respectively 25 29 moreover the peak at 529 8 ev also indicated the ag o bonds in the composites 30 furthermore there were two peaks at 38 0 ev and 35 6 ev of w 4f in fig 1e corresponding to w 4f5 2 and w 4f7 2 respectively 31 and the peak located at 134 9 ev of p 2p fig 1f demonstrated the crystal lattice of p5 25 thus the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 catalyst was successfully synthesized with appreciable photocatalytic properties which has great potential for water disinfection 3 2 photocatalytic disinfection performance the photocatalytic disinfection performance of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 catalyst was investigated by inactivation of e coli under simulated solar light fig 2a as comparison the antibacterial activities of bi2wo6 and commercial tio2 were also explored the results showed that the photocatalyst ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 exhibited high disinfection efficiency toward e coli 7 40 log10 cfu ml under simulated solar light irradiation with complete inactivation observed only within 20 min in contrast only 0 59 log10 and 0 31 log10 reductions of viable cells were observed for bi2wo6 and commercial tio2 under simulated solar light irradiation the obvious difference in inactivation efficiencies of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 bi2wo6 and tio2 photocatalysts were visualized by the photographs of e coli bacteria colony after 20 min treatment under simulated solar light irradiation fig 2b besides chick s model was used to fit the disinfection rates of e coli by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 bi2wo6 and tio2 photocatalysts 21 22 as displayed in fig s4 the disinfection rate of e coli by as prepared photocatalysts fitted well with chick s model with r2 values all greater than 0 99 and the k value of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 0 3718 min 1 was much higher than that of bi2wo6 0 0295 min 1 and tio2 0 0153 min 1 confirming the superior disinfection performance of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 in addition no obvious decrease in e coli cell density was observed in the light control indicating that simulated solar light irradiation has no effect on the cell viability moreover compared to two reference samples ag ag2o bi2wo6 and bipo4 bi2wo6 6 the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite also exhibited the highest photocatalytic disinfection efficiency under simulated solar light irradiation fig s5 then table 1 compared the photocatalytic inactivation efficiency of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 with some bi2wo6 based photocatalysts compared with the most bi2wo6 based photocatalysts such as bi2wo6 bioi 32 bi2wo6 ws2 33 sns bi2wo6 34 and mos2 bi2wo6 35 the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite showed much higher inactivation efficiency to e coli of 2 50 109 cfu g min which was about 32 221 times as high as these photocatalysts these results indicated a remarkable photocatalytic activity of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite for water disinfection which was resulted from its enhanced visible light absorption low e h recombination and fast charge separation 6 the layered heterostructures of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 enabled interfacial contact between different components fig s2b which could shorten the transmission distance of electrons therefore facilitating photo generated charge transfer and quantum efficiency 36 in addition the inductive effects of po4 3 in bipo4 and the surface plasmon resonance spr effect of ag contributed to the separation of e h pairs enhancing its photocatalytic performance 37 interestingly even under dark condition there was also a 1 8 log10 decrease in the viable cell density of e coli caused by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 fig s6 this was probably attributed to the bactericidal roles of both active species produced under dark condition and ag nanoparticles formed on the surface of composites 24 38 39 it was reported that ag nanoparticles possessed bactericidal activity and its presence in the photocatalysts contributed to the generation of active species like o2 even under dark condition 38 40 however negligible inactivation of e coli was observed for commercial tio2 and bi2wo6 under dark condition for 20 min indicating that the commercial tio2 and pristine bi2wo6 were incapable of antibacterial activities without light irradiation furthermore the bactericidal activity of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst at different catalyst dosage 0 25 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 g l were also investigated fig 2c the results showed that the disinfection activity of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite increased from 66 6 to 100 with the increase in catalyst dosage from 0 25 g l to 0 50 g l this was probably due to the enhanced active species generated by more photocatalysts however the antibacterial activity slightly decreased when the catalyst dosage further increased from 0 50 g l to 1 00 g l which was mainly ascribed to the light shielding effect caused by the enhanced turbidity of catalyst solution 5 moreover excessive photocatalysts are prone to form catalyst aggregation which decreases surface active sites and photon absorptivity of catalysts influencing the photocatalytic inactivation ability 42 therefore 0 50 g l was selected as the optimal loading for further assays in this study 3 3 photocatalytic bactericidal process to better understand the bacterial cell damage process induced by the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite the activities of cat and sod were firstly monitored as shown in fig 3a at the beginning of photocatalytic inactivation process the activities of cat and sod exhibited an increased tendency and attained the maximum value at 15 min cat 0 15 mu ml sod 16 18 inhibition rate but the decrease of both cat and sod activities was observed after 15 min of disinfection and continued thereafter cat and sod are two important antioxidant enzymes which convert active species into less or non harmful substances such as water and oxygen protecting bacterial cells from oxidative damage 14 therefore the increased activities of cat and sod observed in the beginning demonstrated that e coli cells initiated the self protection system secreting more antioxidant enzymes to avoid oxidative attack produced by the photocatalysts however with the prolonged treatment by photocatalyst the activities of cat and sod decreased significantly indicating the overwhelmed defense capacity of antioxidant enzymes caused by the accumulation of active species in the disinfection process the destruction of cell defense system was responsible for the subsequent dysfunction of bacterial cells and severe oxidative damage of cell membrane to investigate membrane integrity k leakage was monitored during the disinfection process fig 3b the results showed that the k concentration increased significantly within 10 min and then continued to rise as the irradiation time prolonged in the presence of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite suggesting the notable damage in the cell membrane structure in comparison no obvious fluctuation in k concentration was observed without the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite bacterial cell membrane shows great significance for keeping cell viability which acts as a protective barrier between cell intracellular components and the extracellular environment enveloping the essential organelles due to the important roles in the polysome regulation and protein synthesis k tends to be easily released when the cell membrane is damaged 15 therefore at the start of the disinfection process large amounts of k leaked from e coli cells due to the oxidative attack caused by photocatalysts meanwhile bacteria secreted more cat and sod to defend against the oxidative damage but with prolonged photocatalytic treatment the antioxidant system was destroyed by the accumulated damage of active species resulting in the reduced enzyme activities thereby leading to the destruction of cell membrane undoubtedly severely damaged cells can cause the leakage of nucleic acid and proteins leading to the loss of cell cultivability therefore nucleic acid and proteins leaked from e coli cells were also assayed during the disinfection process fig 3c and d as presented in fig 3c the leakage of nucleic acid increased significantly when the e coli was exposed to ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 catalyst for prolonging the light irradiation time indicating the aggravated damage encountered by e coli cells in contrast slight change of nucleic acid leakage was observed in the light control without photocatalysts similarly the released protein content significantly increased from 1 65 mg l to 15 97 mg l with the treatment of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite under light irradiation fig 3d however no obvious fluctuation in protein content was detected from e coli in the absence of photocatalysts the nucleic acid and protein leakages at the early stage in the system are ascribed to the natural decay of bacteria and the oxidative damage caused by active species due to the self repair and regrowth bacteria could not lose their viability immediately but mobilize related antioxidant enzymes cat and sod to protect themselves with the uninterrupted attack of active species the activities of cat and sod decreased significantly once the defense system was destructed severe damage to the nucleic acid caused complete lethal to bacteria ultimately resulting in the cell death 13 moreover with the prolonged treatment of photocatalysts bacterial cells were further destroyed to pieces leading to more release of nucleic acid and proteins besides toc concentration of e coli suspension was further measured to investigate the decomposition and mineralization of e coli cells during the disinfection process as shown in fig s7 the toc concentration was decreased gradually with increased treatment time of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 under simulated solar light irradiation indicating the decomposition of bacterial cells during disinfection process after 60 min disinfection cell mineralization rate of e coli reached to about 76 8 this suggested that even though the bacterial cell could start defense system to protect themselves at the initial stage of disinfection the bacterial envelope was still damaged by accumulated active species resulting in cell decomposition after the bacteria were inactivated the cell debris and leaked intracellular components such as nucleic acid and proteins could become the targets and continue to be oxidized by active species which caused the continuous reduction of toc concentration in addition the destruction process of e coli cell was also visualized by sem during the inactivation process fig 3e the e coli cell displayed rod shaped morphology with an intact cell membrane before photocatalytic treatment after being treated for 10 min the cells were deformed and contained some pits and bulges on the surface indicating the initial damage of cell membrane caused by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite under light irradiation when the photocatalytic treatment was prolonged to 20 min holes and decomposition of cell membrane were observed implying the serious destruction of e coli cells finally the cells were thoroughly disrupted into debris after 60 min of photocatalytic treatment this observation confirmed that ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite destroyed cell membrane progressively under light irradiation leading to the leakage of intracellular components and eventual collapse of bacteria given the results of the enzymes cat and sod intracellular component leakage k nucleic acid and protein cell mineralization and morphological changes of e coli cells the inactivation process mediated by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 was firstly systematically investigated which was beneficial for the in depth understanding of inactivation mechanism of bacteria 3 4 disinfection mechanism mediated by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 to investigate the disinfection mechanism mediated by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite the scavenger experiments were conducted to clarify the contribution of respective active species during the disinfection system the effects of all applied scavengers on e coli were also evaluated to eliminate their toxicity on bacteria no obvious reduction was observed for viable cell density implying that none of the scavengers showed toxicity for e coil during the disinfection process fig 4a as shown in fig 4b 7 40 log10 cfu ml of e coli was completely inactivated within 20 min by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite under light irradiation in the absence of scavengers a significant decrease of bactericidal effect was observed after addition of tempol suggesting the primary role of o2 involved in the disinfection process moreover the vital role of h was also confirmed by the conspicuous reduction of inactivation efficiency after the introduction of na2c2o4 in the photocatalytic system the negligible effect of isopropanol for antibacterial efficiency indicated the minor role of oh in the process of e coli inactivation the similar results were also obtained by xiang et al in the photocatalytic disinfection system of bi2wo6 bioi photocatalyst 32 o2 involved in the disinfection process can be produced through the reaction of photogenerated e and dissolved o2 which can cause oxidative damage to bacterial cells in addition o2 was reported to be easily accumulated compared to oh due to its longer life span t1 2 1 μs than that of oh t1 2 1 ns 43 moreover the photo generated h on the valence band of photocatalysts possessed strong oxidative ability and could directly damage e coli cells by attacking cell membrane as a result o2 and h played the prominent roles in the disinfection process mediated by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 in addition the released ions ag and bi3 from photocatalysts were also monitored during the disinfection process of e coli to evaluate their possible antibacterial effect as shown in table 2 during the disinfection of 60 min the concentration of ag leakage ranged from 0 06 0 001 mg l to 0 08 0 001 mg l and the released bi3 concentration was lower than 0 03 mg l it was reported that the existence of ag caused bacterial cell damage by the reaction with thiol group of cysteine in proteins 38 a complete inactivation of 6 log10 cfu ml of e coli requires a minimum ag concentration of 10 mg l after 3 h contact time 44 besides li et al also observed negligible effect on e coli inactivation 7 log10 cfu ml by ag of 6 mg l 20 furthermore bi3 exhibited antibacterial effects with inhibitory concentration at 2 10 mm due to its direct and indirect inhibition in enzyme function 45 however the leakage of ag and bi3 in this study was much lower than the reported limit hence the outstanding inactivation performance of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 was mainly ascribed to the photo generated active species instead of the released ag and bi3 during the disinfection process moreover the maximum concentration of ag leakage 0 08 0 001 mg l was lower than the world health organization who drinking water limit 0 1 mg l 46 which might not be toxic for aquatic animals and humans though the bi3 ions released from ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite was detected 0 03 mg l there was limited information about its toxicity for human health to the contrary bi is an ingredient in some pharmaceuticals 47 and some of its compounds are used for cosmetics and pigments 48 therefore the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite is safe and environmentally friendly and could be an appropriate candidate for natural water disinfection based on the above results the possible disinfection mechanism of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst for e coli was proposed in fig 4c in the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite bipo4 was successfully grown on bi2wo6 surface via strong chemical bonds po4 3 and bi with ag ag2o co formed in the heterostructures therefore upon stimulation of solar light the electrons generated from bi2wo6 ag2o and bipo4 were excited to the conduction bands leaving the holes at valence bands the generated electrons on the conduction bands are easily transferred to ag nanoparticles due to the more negative potential of conduction bands of bi2wo6 0 33 ev vs nhe ag2o 0 2 ev vs nhe and bipo4 0 65 ev vs nhe than the fermi level of ag 0 99 ev vs nhe 25 the ag nanoparticles could work with ag2o as an electron pool to accelerate the electron transfer 11 due to the strong spr effect the electrons on the surface of ag nanoparticles could also be excited then large number electrons could be directly injected to conduction band of bipo4 6 in this regard due to the more negative conduction band of bipo4 than the reduction potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe the e gathered on the conduction band of bipo4 could reduce o2 to generate o2 o2 e o2 o2 is strongly involved in the disinfection process of e coli which could penetrate cell membrane leading to the damage of intracellular components on the other hand the holes left on the valence bands of bi2wo6 and bipo4 are shifted to ag2o because of the more positive potential of valence bands of bi2wo6 2 94 ev vs nhe and bipo4 3 2 ev vs nhe than ag2o 1 4 ev vs vhe 25 49 in this regard the holes were accumulated on the valence band of ag2o then the bacterial cells could be directly oxidized by the holes via direct contact with ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite therefore the oxidative stress encountered by e coli mainly resulted from o2 and h in the disinfection process of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite fig 4b to avoid the oxidative attack e coli cells initiated defense system through introduction of antioxidant enzymes cat and sod to deal with the harmful effects of active species so at the first 15 min of disinfection process the activities of cat and sod increased significantly to protect bacteria cells from the attack of o2 and h fig 3a but with the accumulation of active species o2 and h the cat and sod were destroyed gradually reflecting on the decreased activities after 15 min treatment in fig 3a indicating the overwhelmed defense capacity after the destruction of cell defense system the cell membrane integrity and permeability were destroyed resulting in the dysfunction of the k transport systems and the ion channels 50 significant leakage of k was observed from the e coli treated by photocatalysts fig 3b which could further interfere in other physiological activity of e coli 14 with the prolonged treatment e coli cells were damaged severely with holes and decomposition of cell membrane leading to the serious leakage of cytoplasmic substances including proteins and nucleic acid fig 3c e the severe damage to the nucleic acid could cause complete lethal to bacteria ultimately resulting in the cell death 13 with the increase of irradiation time the e coli cells were further disrupted and degraded into debris by active species fig 3e in addition the cell debris and leaked intracellular substances could be further oxidized till complete mineralization in this part the photocatalytic bactericidal mechanism mediated by ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite was systematically investigated under solar light irradiation in hope of providing theoretical basis for its practical application for water disinfection 3 5 the environmental applicability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 in view of superior bactericidal capacity the applicability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite for water disinfection was also investigated through evaluating the effects of various environmental factors light intensity temperature ph and ha and the stability of photocatalyst photocatalytic technology is dependent on light intensity which provides the excitation energy for the photocatalysts and played the decisive role in the photocatalytic reaction therefore the effect of light intensity on the disinfection system was evaluated in the intensity range of 500 700 w m2 in this study as shown in fig 5a the antibacterial activity of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite was enhanced significantly with the complete inactivation decreased from 20 min to 10 min when the light intensity was increased from 500 w m2 to 700 w m2 this was attributed to the elevated generation of active species due to the high energy resulted from the increased light intensity generally natural sunlight distributed over the surface of earth seldom exceeds 1000 w m2 and its intensity varies with time season and geographical location 51 even under the environmental average light intensity of 500 w m2 5 ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite achieved 7 4 log10 inactivation of e coli only within 20 min indicating a great potential for the water disinfection under the actual sun light irradiation as the most abundant permanent source of energy solar energy provides unlimited possibilities and profound prospects for solar light driven photocatalysis in water disinfection the effect of temperature showed that all of the e coli cells were inactivated within 20 min when the temperature varied from 20 c to 30 c fig 5b moreover the disinfection efficiency exhibited significant enhancement with complete inactivation time decreased from 20 min to 10 min when the temperature was increased from 30 c to 37 c the increased disinfection performance probably resulted from the change in fatty acid composition of cell membrane caused by temperature 5 52 the fatty acid composition influences the cell membrane fluidity and susceptibility which is mainly determined by the balance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid 52 more unsaturated fatty acid leads to a less rigid cell membrane which is easier to be attacked by active species 5 52 in addition the high temperature could enhance the collision frequency of molecules in the photocatalytic system leading to an improved reaction rate 53 these results suggested that ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite was effective for water disinfection at environmental temperature 20 c 37 c and preferred a temperature range of 30 c 37 c ph is also a crucial factor in the photocatalytic process which influences the generation of active species and the bacterial membrane property therefore the effects of ph on the disinfection performance were also investigated the initial ph of the system was adjusted to 5 5 6 5 7 0 7 5 and 8 5 an enhanced inactivation performance was observed in neutral and slightly alkaline condition 7 0 8 5 fig 5c all of the e coli cells were completely inactivated within 20 min when the initial solution ph was varied from 7 0 to 8 5 when the ph was decreased from 7 0 to 6 5 the complete inactivation time was increased to 30 min further decrease of the initial ph to 5 5 resulted in a slight reduction of disinfection efficiency compared with ph value of 6 5 the difference in the inactivation effect at different ph value was probably ascribed to the generation of active species at different condition o2 is unstable in the acidic condition and easily reacts with h which results in the decreased disinfection performance 54 in addition the proportion of unsaturated fatty acid may increase with the rise in ph which makes the cell membrane vulnerable and easily destroyed by active species leading to efficient disinfection 55 the normal ph of surface water lay within 6 5 8 5 56 therefore the high disinfection ability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite at a wide range of ph 5 5 8 5 indicated a promising prospect for natural water disinfection as a major component of nom contained in the surface water the effects of ha were also explored in this study as shown in fig 5d ha exhibited negligible effect on photocatalytic bactericidal performance at lower concentration 0 5 3 0 mg l with all of the e coli inactivated within 20 min further increase of ha concentration to 5 0 mg l resulted in a decrease of photocatalytic bactericidal activity when the ha concentration varied in a range of 5 0 10 0 mg l all of the e coli cells were eliminated within 30 min the inhibition occurred in the higher concentration of ha could be due to the physical barrier of ha between the photocatalysts and e coli cells as well as the competition with e coli for active species ha easily combines with e coli cells by hydrogen bond and π π stacking interactions retarding the contact frequency of bacteria composites 20 in addition ha could be oxidized by o2 reducing the effective attack of o2 for e coli 57 besides the doc concentration of ha in the present study was measured in the range of 0 22 19 46 mg l which was much wider than the typical nom concentration in the raw water 2 10 mg l 17 the high adaptability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composites for different ha concentration exhibited potential application in the actual inactivation of microbial contaminated water these results indicated that the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite had a wide applicability under various environmental factors which was promising for environmental water disinfection in addition a series of disinfection experiments were conducted using recycled photocatalysts to investigate the stability of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite for water disinfection fig 6a the results showed that complete inactivation of e coli cells 7 40 log10 cfu ml was achieved within 20 min for the first three cycles in the fourth cycle the photocatalytic bactericidal activity exhibited a slight reduction with complete inactivation time within 30 min the slight decrease of disinfection was primarily ascribed to the catalyst loss during the washing process of photocatalysts moreover the bacterial residues on the surface of photocatalysts could block the active sites resulting in a decrease of photocatalytic performance given the difficult recovery of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 powders from the solution it is essential to develop an immobilized system in future furthermore the photocatalysts before and after reaction were also characterized by xrd fig 6b notably no difference was observed for the structure of ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst before and after inactivation indicating its excellent stability in practical application as discussed before the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite also exhibited remarkable bactericidal efficiency fig 2a and table 1 and high safety table 2 combined with the high adaptability to different environmental factors and excellent stability during long term disinfection the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 composite has great prospects for applying in environmental water fields 4 conclusions in this study the ag ag2o bipo4 bi2wo6 photocatalyst was firstly used for water disinfection under simulated solar light irradiation the photocatalyst showed remarkable bactericidal efficiency toward e coli the photo generated o2 and h played important roles in the disinfection process in addition the bactericidal process specified that cat and sod activities of target bacteria increased at the beginning to avoid oxidative shock but decreased by accumulated damage caused by active species o2 and h the overwhelmed antioxidant system led to subsequent damage of cell membrane causing intracellular component leakage and final collapse of bacterial cells furthermore the excellent photocatalytic bactericidal performance resulted from photocatalytic activity instead of eluted ag and bi3 from photocatalyst moreover the photocatalyst exhibited high adaptability in a wide range of environmental factors and also possessed high safety and excellent stability for practical application this study provides an efficient water disinfection technology with a promising prospect for real water disinfection in addition considering its practical potential efforts will be also made to design a solar light driven immobilized system of ag ag2o bipo4

photocatalysis chemical pollutants wastewater treatment electrocatalytic activity electrochemical sensors nitrofurantoin 1 introduction worldwide globalization and industrialization are the most emerging causes of environmental pollution and energy crisis a wide variety of pollutants have been well existing in the environment that their uninterrupted persistence is affecting aquatic life as well as human beings 1 5 among all the existing pollutants worldwide pharmaceutical waste is one of the most crucial emerging pollutants that has been introduced in the environment through several ways such as industrial discharge domestic and hospital sewage but wastewater treatment plants are the major source because of its inability to remove these type of pollutant 6 8 the extensive use of antibiotics has led to a massive increase in antibiotic wastes throughout the world which results in antibiotic resistant genes and bacteria 9 10 the world health organization who has classified antibiotic resistance to be a severe hazard to public health furthermore in european countries more than 25 thousand people die yearly due to antibiotic resistant bacterial infections 11 nitrofurantoin nft is one such antibiotic used in human and veterinary medicines for the treatment of gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections utis as well as in animal husbandry as growth promoters and food additives it belongs to the series of nitrofuran derivatives and its overdose leads to serious health effects such as hepatotoxicity neuropathy abdominal pain pulmonary toxicity nausea depression headache 12 13 in the metabolic pathway nft reduces to intermediates that are cytotoxic such as nitro radical hydroxylamine and nitroso derivatives and shows severe mutagenic and carcinogenic effects 14 despite their severe consequences some countries have banned the use of nft but some are still using it because of its effectiveness and low cost 15 therefore there is an immense necessity to develop a system with high sensitivity and selectivity to detect and degrade this pollutant among all the reported methods photocatalysis is reported to be the most effective and efficient process that converts toxic pollutant into the least toxic products 16 the high rate of recombination and less utilization of visible light restrict the applications of several existing photocatalytic materials such as tio2 zno cds the main disadvantage of metal oxide semiconductors is a wide band gap which restricts them from using the solar spectrum efficiently 17 18 in recent years transition metal dichalcogenides tmds have shown extensive growth due to their distinct and unique properties tmds are 2d layered material represented by x m x which is comprised of transition metal m such as molybdenum mo tungsten w sandwiched between two chalcogens x such as sulphur s selenium se s a 19 each layer of tmds is 6 7 å thickness comprised of hexagonally arranged metal atoms joined together by weak van der waals forces with covalent m x bond 20 21 among all 2d materials ws2 emerges as an exceptionally significant nanostructure with peculiar properties such as biocompatibility 22 high surface area efficient photocatalyst 23 24 good electrochemical activity 25 promising electronic properties and high mobility 26 several techniques have been employed for the synthesis of metal oxide and sulphide nanostructures such as liquid exfoliation 27 pulse laser deposition 28 ball milling c 29 cvd 30 sputtering 31 however their requirement of high temperature and complex system restricts their application hydrothermal synthesis was reported to be an efficient method due to the following advantages including low operating temperature large scale production with low cost and the possibility of obtaining various morphology 32 in this paper for the first time we presented the facile hydrothermal synthesis of ws2 nanosheets like structures that exhibited promising photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activity for the detection and degradation of nitrofurantoin nft nanostructure morphology with high surface area and porous nature enhance interfacial sites for efficient and effective electrochemical and photocatalytic reactions 2 material and methods 2 1 materials nitrofurantoin nft was purchased from pharmaceutical co india sodium tungstate dehydrate na2wo4 2h2o 96 and thiourea ch4n2s 98 were obtained from fisher scientific india pvt ltd india ctab c19h42brn 98 and hydroxylamine hydrochloride honh2 hcl 98 were obtained from central drug house pvt ltd india all required chemicals were of analytical grade 2 2 synthesis of ws2 nanosheets in the synthesis of ws2 nanosheets sodium tungstate 0 005 mol thiourea 0 02 mol and hydroxylamine hydrochloride 0 01 mol were dissolved in 30 ml of di water and stirred uniformly after a few minutes of uniform stirring on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature ctab 0 24 g was added to the above solution to form a homogeneous suspension the obtained suspension was placed in the furnace at 180 c for 24 h inside a teflon lined autoclave the obtained product was washed thrice with 1 m naoh solution and then washed with di water to remove any impurities the final sample was dried at 60 c for 8 h as shown in scheme 1 the above procedure for the synthesis of ws2 nanosheets follows the oxidation reduction mechanism as shown in eqs 1 and 2 33 34 1 na 2 wo 4 4 ch 4 n 2 s 4 h 2 o 4 co 2 na 2 ws 4 8 nh 3 2 na 2 ws 4 2 nh 2 oh hcl ws 2 n 2 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 s 2 nacl 2 3 characterization and instrumentation the electrochemical characterization of paper based two electrode system was done using cyclic voltammetry cv and differential pulse voltammetry dpv performed on nova 2 0 autolab high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem techno fei and field emission scanning electron microscope fesem quanta 3d feg were used for the structural morphology functional groups and bonds were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir optik vertex 70 v spectrometer crystal structure and hkl planes were determined by x ray diffraction xrd through rigaku smart lab with cu kα x ray 1 540 å in a 2θ range of 10 70 bet analysis was also performed using nova 1000 version 370 to determine surface area and pore size uv vis spectroscopy was performed to determine the bandgap cary 100 series agilent technologies 2 4 fabrication of electrodes two electrode system were used for the electrochemical determination of nitrofurantoin paper based two electrodes system was fabricated using a stencil screen that has embedded the shape of electrodes conductive ink was used to build this electrode that has a circular disk shaped working electrode and semicircle shape of the counter electrode on paper the working region of the electrode was surrounded by a hydrophobic barrier made of wax to resist the spreading of electrolyte ws2 nanosheets were dispersed in ethanol and drop casted on the working region to perform the electrochemical measurements electrochemical performance is directly influenced by large surface area and porous nature which is a crucial parameter and enhances electrochemical reactions by providing more interfacial reaction sites for performing the electrochemical measurement 0 5 mg μl of ws2 nanosheets were dispersed in ethanol and 10 μl were drop casted on the working region of the paper electrode and allowed to dry at 40 c 2 5 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic behavior of ws2 nanosheets was studied for the degradation of nft the solution was prepared by taking 10 mg of nft in 100 ml of di water with 20 mg of the photocatalyst to obtain the adsorption desorption equilibrium the solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature under dark room conditions the solar illuminator am 1 5 100 mw cm2 was irradiated from a xenon arc lamp on the solution for 120 min 2 ml of the solution was collected after a given period of time and the change in absorbance was examined using a uv vis spectrophotometer the above experiment was repeated using blank 20 mg 40 mg and 60 mg of the photocatalyst 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization methods the sem image of the obtained ws2 nanostructure showed the sheet like morphology with an average length of 300 nm and width of 100 nm as shown in fig 1a fig 1b shows the tem image of ws2 nanostructure which infers the formation of nanosheets of ws2 in accordance with the sem results the ctab concentration plays a significant role in the formation of ws2 nanosheets if the ctab concentration reaches the critical micelle concentration it will form the lamellar micelles which are further assembled to form nanosheets 33 the xrd diffractogram of ws2 was used for the determination of crystal structure and orientation as shown in fig 2a the hkl planes 002 004 101 102 103 104 006 105 110 corresponded to 2θ values of 14 66 28 40 30 07 34 82 38 09 42 38 45 90 50 23 and 59 73 which can be indexed as a hexagonal phase jcpds file 841398 and 87 2417 the lattice constants were calculated using the eq 3 3 1 d 2 4 3 h 2 hk k 2 a 2 l 2 c 2 the calculated lattice parameters were a b 0 36 nm and c 1 21 nm which are in agreement with the reported ws2 lattice constant 35 36 it is clearly evident from the xrd graph that the strength of the 002 diffraction peak is comparatively more than other peaks which depict the formation of 2d nanosheets the synthesized ws2 was also characterized by ftir measurement and the data was shown in fig 2b ftir spectroscopy was used to examine the chemical bonding and functional groups of the synthesized ws2 nanosheets as shown in fig 2 b several peaks associated to significant vibration bands were detected the vibrational bonds at 767 cm 1 and 856 cm 1 are from the ws bending vibrations which describe the chemical bonding between tungsten and sulphur furthermore the substantial peaks at 928 cm 1 1015 cm 1 and 1057 cm 1 related to ss bonds whereas the 1015 cm 1 and 1057 cm 1 peaks showed considerable vibration stretch that clearly referred to elemental sulphur however the peaks at 1378 cm 1 and 1606 cm 1are attributed to hydroxyl group stretching vibrations whereas the peaks at 2855 cm 1 and 2932 cm 1 are assigned to oh vibrations respectively 36 39 the bandgap eg of ws2 nanosheets was estimated by using αhν 1 2 k hν eg where eg represents the bandgap alpha α is the absorption coefficient hν denotes the energy of a photon ev and k is a constant the bandgap of ws2 was calculated by extrapolating the graph between αhν 1 2 and hν the tangent was drawn on the corresponding slope and the energy axis determines the band gap of the ws2 the bandgap eg of ws2 nanosheets was calculated as 1 8 ev which is evident with those in the literature 36 as shown in fig 2c the brunauer emmett teller bet n2adsorption desorption isotherm and barrett joyner halenda bjh were used to determine the surface area and a pore size distribution of the photocatalyst the photocatalyst was then subjected to 100 c for 2 h for outgassing the features of the ws2 can be characterized as type iv isotherm the obtained pore diameter of ws2 is 3 35 nm and the surface area is 37 043 m2 g the obtained pore diameter suggested that ws2 is porous in nature which justifies the classified criteria of porosity 2 nm size 50 nm 40 the high surface area of ws2 is attributed to its porous nature as shown in fig 2d 3 2 photocatalysis the photocatalytic activity of hydrothermally synthesized ws2 nanosheets was evaluated using the photodegradation of nitrofurantoin fig 3 showed the photocatalytic degradation of nft by varying the concentration of the photocatalyst it was evident that with an increase in irradiation time the intensity of the corresponding absorption peak of nft decreases gradually the experiment was also performed without using a photocatalyst also called it as photolysis it was reported that direct photolysis of nitrofurantoin gives rise to two hydrolytic products nitrofuraldehyde nfa and aminohydantoin ahd 8 however photolysis degraded only 35 of nft while using 20 mg of ws2 photocatalyst can degrade 66 of nft in 120 min the amount of photocatalyst used in the reaction plays a significant role and highly influences the rate of the reaction to study the role of dosage parameters on the rate of reaction the amount used was varied by taking 20 mg 40 mg and 60 mg while other parameters were kept constant the degradation efficiency was observed to increase with an increase in the amount of photocatalyst when the amount of photocatalyst increases more photon generation takes place that leading to the formation of more reactive oxygen species as well as more reaction sites for the photodegradation to take place which enhances the degradation efficiency fig 3a showed the c c0 vs time plot for a different amount of ws2 taken which reveals that the highest amount of degradation was done by taking 60 mg of the photocatalyst in 120 min the rate constant was determined by plotting lnc c0 vs time plot and it reveals that the photodegradation follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics given by eq 4 4 ln c co kt here c and c0 are the absorbances at a time t and 0 min respectively and k is the rate constant the obtained rate constants were 0 00346 min 1 0 00857 min 1 0 01273 min 1 and 0 01846 min 1 for blank photolysis 20 mg 40 mg and 60 mg of photocatalyst this is evident from fig 3b that the rate of the reaction is faster for a higher rate constant and using 60 mg of the photocatalyst gives the highest rate constant and therefore the fastest rate of degradation the same results were revealed from fig 3c degradation efficiency vs time plot which showed the efficiency of 35 66 78 and 90 using blank photolysis 20 mg 40 mg and 60 mg of the photocatalyst ws2 nanosheets were successfully used for the effective photodegradation of nft the mechanism for the photodegradation is when the photocatalyst ws2 nanosheets was irradiated with a photon energy equals to or greater than the bandgap energy eg of the photocatalyst the electron e from the valence band is migrated to the conduction band and left behind a hole h eq 5 these holes h react with water molecules to generate hydroxyl radical oh and h ion eq 6 5 ws 2 hv e h 6 h 2 o h oh h 7 o 2 e o 2 8 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 e oh o h similarly superoxide anions o2 are generated from the reaction of the electrons in the conduction band to the oxygen molecule eq 7 further these superoxide anions form superoxide anion radical o2 by losing its electron the superoxide anion radical o2 reacts with h ions to form h2o2 which in turn form hydroxyl radical oh eqs 8 and 9 the reactive oxygen species ros including hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide anion radical o2 reacts with pollutants led to photodegradation of toxic pollutant into less harmful products the rate of photocatalysis highly depends on the surface area and pore size which can be confirmed through bet analysis the surface area is proportional to the rate of surface reaction which is directly related to photocatalysis the large surface area of photocatalyst ws2 nanosheets could absorb more reactants and active species resulting in higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency on the other hand pore diameter also plays a significant role in photocatalysis the larger the pore size higher will be the probability of having active sites which is responsible to reduce the recombination process thus it provides more holes and electrons to form ros species in turn react with the pollutants adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst hence it enhanced the degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst 41 42 3 2 1 rate kinetics to determine the adsorption behavior of nft over ws2 as a photocatalyst these models were proposed to analyze the reaction kinetics using pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics models as evident from fig 4a and b the reaction follows pseudo first order kinetic and is examined by the eqs 10 11 and 12 10 q t q e 1 e kt 11 q e c 0 c e v w 12 q t c 0 c t v w here qt mg g denotes the quantity of antibiotic adsorbed at the time t qe mg g denotes the quantity of antibiotic adsorbed at equilibrium ce corresponds to concentration at equilibrium and ct at the time t v l and w g represent the volume of the solution and the weight of the ws2 used in the reaction the pseudo first order model indicates the presence of a weak adsorption process involving van der waals interaction that represents no chemical interaction between adsorbate nft and adsorbent ws2 43 the obtained rate constant for the pseudo first order is 0 01845 0 02276 and 0 02426 g mg 1 min 1 for 20 mg 40 mg and 60 mg with a value of r2 is 0 96 0 99 and 0 96 which is very high and it indicates that the reaction follows pseudo first order kinetics table 1 the pseudo second order process represents chemisorption which leads to stronger bonds with the surface and this model is represented by the eq 13 44 13 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e as shown in fig 4c the value of r2 is quite low which revealed this reaction could not follow the second order scavengers of reactive oxygen species ros were used in the photocatalysis experiment to investigate the role of dominant ros species in the reaction scavengers such as benzoquinone bz for o2 radical tertbutyl alcohol t buoh for hydroxyl oh radical and potassium iodide ki for hydroxyl radical oh and holes trapping were used in the experiment 45 46 the obtained photodegradation efficiency using 60 mg of ws2 nanosheets without any scavenger is 90 whereas the addition of scavengers led to suppression of rate of photodegradation in the order of 54 41 and 31 using t buoh bz and ki as shown in fig 4d this indicates the dominant involvement of holes and oh than o2 in the photodegradation process the role of ros was in the order of holes o2 oh to investigate the reusability of the ws2 for photocatalytic degradation the experiment was performed for four consecutive cycles under the same condition using 60 mg of the ws2 nanosheets after the first cycle the photocatalyst was centrifuged washed and collected for another cycle degradation efficiency was found to be 89 87 86 and 83 from the first to fourth cycle as shown in fig 4e only 6 efficiency was lost on reaching the fourth cycle which indicates promising stability of ws2 nanosheets some nanomaterial was lost during centrifugation and some sites were occupied by pollutant during the experiment was not able to wash off these two may be the reason for the decrease in photocatalytic degradation efficiency in each cycle the stability of ws2 nanosheets was also confirmed after photodegradation of nft the samples used in the photocatalysis were filtered and washed several times to remove the impurity of the solution the reusability of the photocatalyst was checked after photocatalytic treatment with nft for 120 min the crystal structure planes and intensity of the ws2 nanosheets were observed no change after photocatalytic activity signifying the high stability of ws2 nanosheets as shown in fig 4f 3 3 electrochemical analysis electrochemical analysis of nft is characterized by a redox reaction that occurs with the help of mb as a redox mediator electrochemical reduction results in the formation of phenylhydroxylamine derivative as shown in scheme 2 the appearance of an oxidation peak may be assigned to the formation of nitroso derivative from the oxidation of hydroxylamine in the reduction of nft the mb redox transition was exploited for the detection of nft this redox reaction of mb was coupled with a reduction of nft 14 mb oxidation mb reduction 15 mb reduction nitrofurantoin nitrofurantoin reduction mb oxidation optimization of the modified electrodes was performed using cyclic voltammetry a sensitive technique for surface modification of electrode as shown in fig 5a firstly when ws2 nanosheets modified paper electrode was exposed to spb as an electrolyte led to an insignificant response signal further using methylene blue gives a characteristic oxidation and reduction peak of mb as shown in figure cv profiles were obtained with without nft in mb together with spb mb has been used as a redox indicator in several electrochemical reactions the principle of mb redox indicating system is either the formation of reduced leuco form of mb or this class of redox dyes have the ability to undergo electropolymerization and can be recognized as the excellent electron acceptor or donor hence mb can be used as an excellent electron mediator that helps in the enhancement of the redox signal thus mb drastically enhances the signal in the presence of spb and nft 47 48 as shown in fig 5b the optimization of the concentration of ws2 nanosheets was performed and considered as the important parameter before electrochemical sensing the current density of the deposited ws2 nanosheets was found to be increased with increasing the concentration from 0 1 mg μl to 0 5 mg μl and the highest response was obtained at 0 5 mg μl thus 0 5 mg μl concentration was considered as the optimized concentration because the obtained response from cv was stable above this value cyclic voltammetry was employed for the determination of nitrofurantoin using a paper electrode as shown in fig 6a stages were given that determines the change in the signal after each step the obtained signal depicted that bare paper electrode without ws2 nanosheets was not sufficient to give high sensing signals which predict the poor electron transfer ability of the electrode after drop casting of ws2 nanosheets by physical adsorption leads to enhancement of sensing signal due to promising electron transfer activity high surface area and porous nature the high surface area and porous nature of ws2 nanosheets contribute significantly to the electrochemical performance by enhancing interfacial reaction sites and facilitating amicable paths for penetration of analyte mb was reported to be a great redox mediator which enhances anodic cathodic peaks and facilitate a confined pathway for the transference of electron between nitrofurantoin and electrode hence ws2 nanosheets and methylene blue show synergistic association which enhances the redox mechanism and sensing signal 49 50 when the ws2 drop casted electrode is exposed to nft which gives a strong reduction peak at 0 26 v that indicates the reduction of the nitro group from nft to the hydroxylamine group coupled with redox transition of mb a small oxidation peak has also appeared at 0 06 v in every scan may be assigned to the formation of nitroso derivatives from the oxidation of hydroxylamine 13 14 the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis technique was performed which also shows similar results as cv at various stages to depict the electrode analyte interface interaction as shown in fig 6b ws2 nanosheets modified paper electrode was characterized by surface sensitive electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis modification of the working electrode at various stages results in the alteration in charge transfer resistance rct or impedance in eis spectra the diameter of a semicircle plot represents the value of rct which is inversely proportional to the current corresponding to the kinetics of electron transfer at the interface the nyquist plot showed that the bare paper electrode shows the highest resistance charge transfer rct of 135 103 the rct value at ws2 modified paper electrode decreased to 94 103 which confirms that ws2 nanosheets show fast electron communication the nft enhances the flow of electrons by decreasing the rct value further to 50 103 51 fig 6c showed cyclic voltammetry of nft at various concentrations from 500 μm to 10 μm the obtained current was found to be increased linearly with an increase in concentration the electrochemical performance of nft at various concentrations from 500 μm to 0 01 μm with a detection limit of lod is 0 06 μm was also explored using differential pulse voltammetry the obtained sensing signal at various concentrations increased linearly with an increase in concentration as shown in fig 7a and b the linear regression equation for corresponding linear concentration can be expressed as 16 16 ip c 0 1674 log x 0 27239 r 2 0 96 the strength of the reduction peak was found to be increased after adding each concentration of nft reduction peak current is the characteristic signal for the presence of nft which corresponds to the reduction of the nitro group of nft to phenylhydroxylamine derivative sometimes more than one reduction peak was reported which may be ascribed to consequent two electron reduction of hydroxylamine amine derivatives to the amino group or the formation of imine group c nh from c n n linkage present in nn bond through reductive fission and small oxidation appears may due to the subsequent oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitroso derivatives 52 53 as shown in scheme 2 the ws2 modified paper based electrode was optimized under different scan rates ranging between 20 and 100 mvs 1 in the presence of nft 100 μm as shown in fig 8 a the characteristic reduction current increased linearly on increasing scan rate from 10 to 100 mvs 1 the obtained graph predicts that the process of electrochemical reaction at the interface is diffusion controlled as shown in fig 8b the obtained square root of the scan rate was proportional to the cathodic peak current and expressed by the equation as 17 17 ip c 0 5730 x 2 78251 r 2 0 95 to further confirm the stability and process of diffusion controlled is by plotting a graph between log i c and log v as shown in fig 7c and expressed it as 18 18 logip c 1 183097 x 3 12226 r 2 0 98 the ph response was also optimized by using various ph from 5 8 to 7 8 using cyclic voltammetry at 100mvs 1 spb 0 1 m 0 1 mm mb 10 μ m nft as shown in fig 9a the peak current was maximum at ph 7 4 which was further used as the optimum ph in experiments the selectivity of the proposed sensor was explored by adding paracetamol pcm and cetirizine ctz as interferants the figure illustrates the response recorded for the 10 μm of nft in the presence of a 50 μm concentration of interferants such as paracetamol pcm and cetirizine ctz the results obtained from the interference study revealed that negligible change was observed in the current as well as potential which suggested the good selectivity of the proposed sensor as shown in fig 9 b the stability of the sensor was justified by scanning the same electrode for 7 days and the obtained signal showed a negligible change up to 5 days however further there is a decrease in the sensing signal was observed which suggested promising stability of the electrodes as shown in fig 9c 4 conclusions in conclusion we have proposed electrochemical sensing and photodegradation of nitrofurantoin using ws2 nanosheets synthesized by facile hydrothermal technique the photodegradation studies demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity reusability with a high degradation rate of 90 in 120 min and kinetics depicts that the reaction follows pseudo first order kinetics we also explored the role of ros species responsible for the reaction by using corresponding scavengers the electrochemical studies of the as synthesized ws2 nanosheets were also scrutinized for the determination of nft and exhibited an excellent linear range of 500 μm to 0 01

years transition metal dichalcogenides tmds have shown extensive growth due to their distinct and unique properties tmds are 2d layered material represented by x m x which is comprised of transition metal m such as molybdenum mo tungsten w sandwiched between two chalcogens x such as sulphur s selenium se s a 19 each layer of tmds is 6 7 å thickness comprised of hexagonally arranged metal atoms joined together by weak van der waals forces with covalent m x bond 20 21 among all 2d materials ws2 emerges as an exceptionally significant nanostructure with peculiar properties such as biocompatibility 22 high surface area efficient photocatalyst 23 24 good electrochemical activity 25 promising electronic properties and high mobility 26 several techniques have been employed for the synthesis of metal oxide and sulphide nanostructures such as liquid exfoliation 27 pulse laser deposition 28 ball milling c 29 cvd 30 sputtering 31 however their requirement of high temperature and complex system restricts their application hydrothermal synthesis was reported to be an efficient method due to the following advantages including low operating temperature large scale production with low cost and the possibility of obtaining various morphology 32 in this paper for the first time we presented the facile hydrothermal synthesis of ws2 nanosheets like structures that exhibited promising photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activity for the detection and degradation of nitrofurantoin nft nanostructure morphology with high surface area and porous nature enhance interfacial sites for efficient and effective electrochemical and photocatalytic reactions 2 material and methods 2 1 materials nitrofurantoin nft was purchased from pharmaceutical co india sodium tungstate

solution to form a homogeneous suspension the obtained suspension was placed in the furnace at 180 c for 24 h inside a teflon lined autoclave the obtained product was washed thrice with 1 m naoh solution and then washed with di water to remove any impurities the final sample was dried at 60 c for 8 h as shown in scheme 1 the above procedure for the synthesis of ws2 nanosheets follows the oxidation reduction mechanism as shown in eqs 1 and 2 33 34 1 na 2 wo 4 4 ch 4 n 2 s 4 h 2 o 4 co 2 na 2 ws 4 8 nh 3 2 na 2 ws 4 2 nh 2 oh hcl ws 2 n 2 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 s 2 nacl 2 3 characterization and instrumentation the electrochemical characterization of paper based two electrode system was done using cyclic voltammetry cv and differential pulse voltammetry dpv performed on nova 2 0 autolab high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem techno fei and field emission scanning electron microscope fesem quanta 3d feg were used for the structural morphology functional groups and bonds were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir optik vertex 70 v spectrometer crystal structure and hkl planes were determined by x ray diffraction xrd through rigaku smart lab with cu kα x ray 1 540 å in a 2θ range of 10 70 bet analysis was also performed using nova 1000 version 370 to determine surface area and pore size uv vis spectroscopy was performed to determine the bandgap cary 100 series agilent technologies 2 4 fabrication of electrodes two electrode system were used for the electrochemical determination of nitrofurantoin paper based two electrodes system was fabricated using a stencil screen that has embedded the shape of electrodes conductive ink was used to build this electrode that has a circular disk shaped working electrode and semicircle shape of the counter electrode on paper the working region of the electrode was surrounded by a hydrophobic barrier made of wax to resist the spreading of electrolyte ws2 nanosheets were dispersed in ethanol and drop casted on the working region to perform the electrochemical measurements electrochemical performance is directly influenced by large surface area and porous nature which is a crucial parameter and enhances electrochemical reactions by providing more interfacial reaction sites for performing the electrochemical measurement 0 5 mg μl of ws2 nanosheets were dispersed in ethanol and 10 μl were drop casted on the working region of the paper electrode and allowed to dry at 40 c 2 5 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic behavior of ws2 nanosheets was studied for the degradation of nft the solution was prepared by taking 10 mg of nft in 100 ml of di water with 20 mg of the photocatalyst to obtain the adsorption desorption equilibrium the solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature under dark room conditions the solar illuminator am 1 5 100 mw cm2 was irradiated from a xenon arc lamp on the solution for 120 min 2 ml of the solution was collected after a given period of time and the change in absorbance was examined using a uv vis spectrophotometer the above experiment was repeated using blank 20 mg 40 mg and 60 mg of the photocatalyst 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization methods the sem image of the obtained ws2 nanostructure showed the sheet like morphology with an average length of 300 nm and width of 100 nm as shown in fig 1a fig 1b shows the tem image of ws2 nanostructure which infers the formation of nanosheets of ws2 in accordance with the sem results the ctab concentration plays a significant role in the formation of ws2 nanosheets if the ctab concentration reaches the critical micelle concentration it will form the lamellar micelles which are further assembled to form nanosheets 33 the xrd diffractogram of ws2 was used for the determination of crystal structure and orientation as shown in fig 2a the hkl planes 002 004 101 102 103 104 006 105 110 corresponded to 2θ values of 14 66 28 40 30 07 34 82 38 09 42 38 45 90 50 23 and 59 73 which can be indexed as a hexagonal phase jcpds file 841398 and 87 2417 the lattice constants were calculated using the eq 3 3 1 d 2 4 3 h 2 hk k 2 a 2 l 2 c 2 the calculated lattice parameters were a b 0 36 nm and c 1 21 nm which are in agreement with the reported ws2 lattice constant 35 36 it is clearly evident from the xrd graph that the strength of the 002 diffraction peak is comparatively more than other peaks which depict the formation of 2d nanosheets the synthesized ws2 was also characterized by ftir measurement and the data was shown in fig 2b ftir spectroscopy was used to examine the chemical bonding and functional groups of the synthesized ws2 nanosheets as shown in fig 2 b several peaks associated to significant vibration bands were detected the vibrational bonds at 767 cm 1 and 856 cm 1 are from the ws bending vibrations which describe the chemical bonding between tungsten and sulphur furthermore the substantial peaks at 928 cm 1 1015 cm 1 and 1057 cm 1 related to ss bonds whereas the 1015 cm 1 and 1057 cm 1 peaks showed considerable vibration stretch that clearly referred to elemental sulphur however the peaks at 1378 cm 1 and 1606 cm 1are attributed to hydroxyl group stretching vibrations whereas the peaks at 2855 cm 1 and 2932 cm 1 are assigned to oh vibrations respectively 36 39 the bandgap eg of ws2 nanosheets was estimated by using αhν 1 2 k hν eg where eg represents the bandgap alpha α is the absorption coefficient hν denotes the energy of a photon ev and k is a constant the bandgap of ws2 was calculated by extrapolating the graph between αhν 1 2 and hν the tangent was drawn on the corresponding slope and the energy axis determines the band gap of the ws2 the bandgap eg of ws2 nanosheets was calculated as 1 8 ev which is evident with those in the literature 36 as shown in fig 2c the brunauer emmett teller bet n2adsorption desorption isotherm and barrett joyner halenda bjh were used to determine the surface area and a pore size distribution of the photocatalyst the photocatalyst was then subjected to 100 c for 2 h for outgassing the features of the ws2 can be characterized as type iv isotherm the obtained pore diameter of ws2 is 3 35 nm and the surface area is 37 043 m2 g the obtained pore diameter suggested that ws2 is porous in nature which justifies the classified criteria of porosity 2 nm size 50 nm 40 the high surface area of ws2 is attributed to its porous nature as shown in fig 2d 3 2 photocatalysis the photocatalytic activity of hydrothermally synthesized ws2 nanosheets was evaluated using the photodegradation of nitrofurantoin fig 3 showed the photocatalytic degradation of nft by varying the concentration of the photocatalyst it was evident that with an increase in irradiation time the intensity of the corresponding absorption peak of nft decreases gradually the experiment was also performed without using a photocatalyst also called it as photolysis it was reported that direct photolysis of nitrofurantoin gives rise to two hydrolytic products nitrofuraldehyde nfa and aminohydantoin ahd 8 however photolysis degraded only 35 of nft while using 20 mg of ws2 photocatalyst can degrade 66 of nft in 120 min the amount of photocatalyst used in the reaction plays a significant role and highly influences the rate of the reaction to study the role of dosage parameters on the rate of reaction the amount used was varied by taking 20 mg 40 mg and 60 mg while other parameters were kept constant the degradation efficiency was observed to increase with an increase in the amount of photocatalyst when the amount of photocatalyst increases more photon generation takes place that leading to the formation of more reactive oxygen species as well as more reaction sites for the photodegradation to take place which enhances the degradation efficiency fig 3a showed the c c0 vs time plot for a different amount of ws2 taken which reveals that the highest amount of degradation was done by taking 60 mg of the photocatalyst in 120 min the rate constant was determined by plotting lnc c0 vs time plot and it reveals that the photodegradation follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics given by eq 4 4 ln c co kt here c and c0 are the absorbances at a time t and 0 min respectively and k is the rate constant the obtained rate constants were 0 00346 min 1 0 00857 min 1 0 01273 min 1 and 0 01846 min 1 for blank photolysis 20 mg 40 mg and 60 mg of photocatalyst this is evident from fig 3b that the rate of the reaction is faster for a higher rate constant and using 60 mg of the photocatalyst gives the highest rate constant and therefore the fastest rate of degradation the same results were revealed from fig 3c degradation efficiency vs time plot which showed the efficiency of 35 66 78 and 90 using blank photolysis 20 mg 40 mg and 60 mg of the photocatalyst ws2 nanosheets were successfully used for the effective photodegradation of nft the mechanism for the photodegradation is when the photocatalyst ws2 nanosheets was irradiated with a photon energy equals to or greater than the bandgap energy eg of the photocatalyst the electron e from the valence band is migrated to the conduction band and left behind a hole h eq 5 these holes h react with water molecules to generate hydroxyl radical oh and h ion eq 6 5 ws 2 hv e h 6 h 2 o h oh h 7 o 2 e o 2 8 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 e oh o h similarly superoxide anions o2 are generated from the reaction of the electrons in the conduction band to the oxygen molecule eq 7 further these superoxide anions form superoxide anion radical o2 by losing its electron the superoxide anion radical o2 reacts with h ions to form h2o2 which in turn form hydroxyl radical oh eqs 8 and 9 the reactive oxygen species ros including hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide anion radical o2 reacts with pollutants led to photodegradation of toxic pollutant into less harmful products the rate of photocatalysis highly depends on the surface area and pore size which can be confirmed through bet analysis the surface area is proportional to the rate of surface reaction which is directly related to photocatalysis the large surface area of photocatalyst ws2 nanosheets could absorb more reactants and active species resulting in higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency on the other hand pore diameter also plays a significant role in photocatalysis the larger the pore size higher will be the probability of having active sites which is responsible to reduce the recombination process thus it provides more holes and electrons to form ros species in turn react with the pollutants adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst hence it enhanced the degradation efficiency of the photocatalyst 41 42 3 2 1 rate kinetics to determine the adsorption behavior of nft over ws2 as a photocatalyst these models were proposed to analyze the reaction kinetics using pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics models as evident from fig 4a and b the reaction follows pseudo first order kinetic and is examined by the eqs 10 11 and 12 10 q t q e 1 e kt 11 q e c 0 c e v w 12 q t c 0 c t v w here qt mg g denotes the quantity of antibiotic adsorbed at the time t qe mg g denotes the quantity of antibiotic adsorbed at equilibrium ce corresponds to concentration at equilibrium and ct at the time t v l and w g represent the volume of the solution and the weight of the ws2 used in the reaction the pseudo first order model indicates the presence of a weak adsorption process involving van der waals interaction that represents no chemical interaction between adsorbate nft and adsorbent ws2 43 the obtained rate constant for the pseudo first order is 0 01845 0 02276 and 0 02426 g mg 1 min 1 for 20 mg 40 mg and 60 mg with a value of r2 is 0 96 0 99 and 0 96 which is very high and it indicates that the reaction follows pseudo first order kinetics table 1 the pseudo second order process represents chemisorption which leads to stronger bonds with the surface and this model is represented by the eq 13 44 13 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e as shown in fig 4c the value of r2 is quite low which revealed this reaction could not follow the second order scavengers of reactive oxygen species ros were used in the photocatalysis experiment to investigate the role of dominant ros species in the reaction scavengers such as benzoquinone bz for o2 radical tertbutyl alcohol t buoh for hydroxyl oh radical and potassium iodide ki for hydroxyl radical oh and holes trapping were used in the experiment 45 46 the obtained photodegradation efficiency using 60 mg of ws2 nanosheets without any scavenger is 90 whereas the addition of scavengers led to suppression of rate of photodegradation in the order of 54 41 and 31 using t buoh bz and ki as shown in fig 4d this indicates the dominant involvement of holes and oh than o2 in the photodegradation process the role of ros was in the order of holes o2 oh to investigate the reusability of the ws2 for photocatalytic degradation the experiment was performed for four consecutive cycles under the same condition using 60 mg of the ws2 nanosheets after the first cycle the photocatalyst was centrifuged washed and collected for another cycle degradation efficiency was found to be 89 87 86 and 83 from the first to fourth cycle as shown in fig 4e only 6 efficiency was lost on reaching the fourth cycle which indicates promising stability of ws2 nanosheets some nanomaterial was lost during centrifugation and some sites were occupied by pollutant during the experiment was not able to wash off these two may be the reason for the decrease in photocatalytic degradation efficiency in each cycle the stability of ws2 nanosheets was also confirmed after photodegradation of nft the samples used in the photocatalysis were filtered and washed several times to remove the impurity of the solution the reusability of the photocatalyst was checked after photocatalytic treatment with nft for 120 min the crystal structure planes and intensity of the ws2 nanosheets were observed no change after photocatalytic activity signifying the high stability of ws2 nanosheets as shown in fig 4f 3 3 electrochemical analysis electrochemical analysis of nft is characterized by a redox reaction that occurs with the help of mb as a redox mediator electrochemical reduction results in the formation of phenylhydroxylamine derivative as shown in scheme 2 the appearance of an oxidation peak may be assigned to the formation of nitroso derivative from the oxidation of hydroxylamine in the reduction of nft the mb redox transition was exploited for the detection of nft this redox reaction of mb was coupled with a reduction of nft 14 mb oxidation mb reduction 15 mb reduction nitrofurantoin nitrofurantoin reduction mb oxidation optimization of the modified electrodes was performed using cyclic voltammetry a sensitive technique for surface modification of electrode as shown in fig 5a firstly when ws2 nanosheets modified paper electrode was exposed to spb as an electrolyte led to an insignificant response signal further using methylene blue gives a characteristic oxidation and reduction peak of mb as shown in figure cv profiles were obtained with without nft in mb together with spb mb has been used as a redox indicator in several electrochemical reactions the principle of mb redox indicating system is either the formation of reduced leuco form of mb or this class of redox dyes have the ability to undergo electropolymerization and can be recognized as the excellent electron acceptor or donor hence mb can be used as an excellent electron mediator that helps in the enhancement of the redox signal thus mb drastically enhances the signal in the presence of spb and nft 47 48 as shown in fig 5b the optimization of the concentration of ws2 nanosheets was performed and considered as the important parameter before electrochemical sensing the current density of the deposited ws2 nanosheets was found to be increased with increasing the concentration from 0 1 mg μl to 0 5 mg μl and the highest response was obtained at 0 5 mg μl thus 0 5 mg μl concentration was considered as the optimized concentration because the obtained response from cv was stable above this value cyclic voltammetry was employed for the determination of nitrofurantoin using a paper electrode as shown in fig 6a stages were given that determines the change in the signal after each step the obtained signal depicted that bare paper electrode without ws2 nanosheets was not sufficient to give high sensing signals which predict the poor electron transfer ability of the electrode after drop casting of ws2 nanosheets by physical adsorption leads to enhancement of sensing signal due to promising electron transfer activity high surface area and porous nature the high surface area and porous nature of ws2 nanosheets contribute significantly to the electrochemical performance by enhancing interfacial reaction sites and facilitating amicable paths for penetration of analyte mb was reported to be a great redox mediator which enhances anodic cathodic peaks and facilitate a confined pathway for the transference of electron between nitrofurantoin and electrode hence ws2 nanosheets and methylene blue show synergistic association which enhances the redox mechanism and sensing signal 49 50 when the ws2 drop casted electrode is exposed to nft which gives a strong reduction peak at 0 26 v that indicates the reduction of the nitro group from nft to the hydroxylamine group coupled with redox transition of mb a small oxidation peak has also appeared at 0 06 v in every scan may be assigned to the formation of nitroso derivatives from the oxidation of hydroxylamine 13 14 the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis technique was performed which also shows similar results as cv at various stages to depict the electrode analyte interface interaction as shown in fig 6b ws2 nanosheets modified paper electrode was characterized by surface sensitive electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis modification of the working electrode at various stages results in the alteration in charge transfer resistance rct or impedance in eis spectra the diameter of a semicircle plot represents the value of rct which is inversely proportional to the current corresponding to the kinetics of electron transfer at the interface the nyquist plot showed that the bare paper electrode shows the highest resistance charge transfer rct of 135 103 the rct value at ws2 modified paper electrode decreased to 94 103 which confirms that ws2 nanosheets show fast electron communication the nft enhances the flow of electrons by decreasing the rct value further to 50 103 51 fig 6c showed cyclic voltammetry of nft at various concentrations from 500 μm to 10 μm the obtained current was found to be increased linearly with an increase in concentration the electrochemical performance of nft at various concentrations from 500 μm to 0 01 μm with a detection limit of lod is 0 06 μm was also explored using differential pulse voltammetry the obtained sensing signal at various concentrations increased linearly with an increase in concentration as shown in fig 7a and b the linear regression equation for corresponding linear concentration can be expressed as 16 16 ip c 0 1674 log x 0 27239 r 2 0 96 the strength of the reduction peak was found to be increased after adding each concentration of nft reduction peak current is the characteristic signal for the presence of nft which corresponds to the reduction of the nitro group of nft to phenylhydroxylamine derivative sometimes more than one reduction peak was reported which may be ascribed to consequent two electron reduction of hydroxylamine amine derivatives to the amino group or the formation of imine group c nh from c n n linkage present in nn bond through reductive fission and small oxidation appears may due to the subsequent oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitroso derivatives 52 53 as shown in scheme 2 the ws2 modified paper based electrode was optimized under different scan rates ranging between 20 and 100 mvs 1 in the presence of nft 100 μm as shown in fig 8 a the characteristic reduction current increased linearly on increasing scan rate from 10 to 100 mvs 1 the obtained graph predicts that the process of electrochemical reaction at the interface is diffusion controlled as shown in fig 8b the obtained square root of the scan rate was proportional to the cathodic peak current and expressed by the equation as 17 17 ip c 0 5730 x 2 78251 r 2 0 95 to further confirm the stability and process of diffusion controlled is by plotting a graph between log i c and log v as shown in fig 7c and expressed it as 18 18 logip c 1 183097 x 3 12226 r 2 0 98 the ph response was also optimized by using various ph from 5 8 to 7 8 using cyclic voltammetry at 100mvs 1 spb 0 1 m 0 1 mm mb 10 μ m nft as shown in fig 9a the peak current was maximum at ph 7 4 which was further used as the optimum ph in experiments the selectivity of the proposed sensor was explored by adding paracetamol pcm and cetirizine ctz as interferants the figure illustrates the response recorded for the 10 μm of nft in the presence of a 50 μm concentration of interferants such as paracetamol pcm and cetirizine ctz the results obtained from the interference study revealed that negligible change was observed in the current as well as potential which suggested the good selectivity of the proposed sensor as shown in fig 9 b the stability of the sensor was justified by scanning the same electrode for 7 days and the obtained signal showed a negligible change up to 5 days however further there is a decrease in the sensing signal was observed which suggested promising stability of the electrodes as shown in fig 9c 4 conclusions in conclusion we have proposed electrochemical sensing and photodegradation of nitrofurantoin using ws2 nanosheets synthesized by facile hydrothermal technique the photodegradation studies demonstrated excellent photocatalytic activity reusability with a high degradation rate of 90 in 120 min and kinetics depicts that the reaction follows pseudo first order kinetics we also explored the role of ros species responsible for the reaction by using corresponding scavengers the electrochemical studies of the as synthesized ws2 nanosheets were also scrutinized for the determination of nft and exhibited an excellent linear range of 500 μm to 0 01 μm with a low detection limit of 0 06 μm promising selectivity and stability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
