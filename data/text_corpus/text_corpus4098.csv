assessment of external disturbances and their effect on ug motion characteristics is of significant importance in order to accurately predict ug dynamics and navigation along the glide path being buoyancy driven slow speed vehicles waves play dominant role in disturbing ug dynamics near ocean surface therefore better control systems and vehicle design can be achieved by studying of influence of wave parameters on the motion dynamics of the ug present work evaluates the underwater effects of wave forces on motion characteristics of bwb ug the wave forces acting on bwb ug are calculated in

and amplitudes affect the ug stability and navigation along the glide path keywords wave force underwater glider blended winged body panel method curve fitting analytical formulation 1 introduction the area of the ocean accounts for more than two third of the total surface area of the earth oceans are rich in valuable natural resources such as natural gas petroleum resources and other mineral biological and medical resources however exploration of oceans resources is still far less than that of land because of vast expense of ocean and human limitations in terms of time and development recently the exploration of marine resources and oceanographic surveys gained substantial attention due to gradual depletion of land resources and strategic importance of ocean warfare many countries are heavily investing in developing marine exploration and research different types of sea exploration platforms have been developed based on specific requirement operational range and endurance energy efficiency payload capacity and navigation time at present the main research work on the ocean is the long term environmental monitoring of the oceans including the monitoring of environmental data strategic resources biological species population numbers etc and seawater samples water quality depth ph temperature etc ma et al 2018 manned underwater vehicles have humans on board which increase the risk as well as operational cost so underwater unmanned systems are getting very popular sahoo et al 2019 in efforts to develop energy efficient and long endurance winged autonomous underwater vehicles auv the underwater glider ug is developed that locomote by modulating their buoyancy and attitude instead of using propellers or jet and thus consume a small amount of energy while adjusting its center of gravity and buoyancy these buoyancy driven underwater platforms are ideally suited to oceanographic sensing and sampling missions military patrol and reconnaissance operations and marine exploration and monitoring applications stommel 1989 was the first to develop the idea of ug the first generation of ug developed till 2001 are known as legacy gliders which includes slocum webb et al 2001 seaglider eriksen 2001 and spray sherman et al 2001 a typical ug have pressure bearing hull wings ballast pumps and tanks internal moving masses electronic components and batteries the advantage of this layout is that the cylindrical shell has a larger pressure bearing capacity while the internal space is large and the design and control method are relatively simple zhang 1998 however the legacy gliders have a low lift drag ratio l d and limited gliding efficiency because the hull barely generates any lift force wang et al 2015 after a thorough study of hydrodynamics shape of ug ug similar in shape to air glider were developed compared with the legacy gliders the bwb ug has substantial reduction in the wetted area reducing the skin friction drag the smooth blended wing center body intersection reduce the interference drag and the lift to drag ratio is very high the relative better attributes of bwb ug such as streamlined body low noise long distance easy recycling and high energy efficiency are attracting researchers and investors to explore potential research areas of interest all around the world waves are physical phenomenon in which water particles oscillate in an orbital motion thus transmitting energy along the interface between two fluids of different density the orbital motion of water particles decrease with depth and nearly become negligible at a depth equal to half of wavelength λ 2 known as wave base the longer the wavelength the deeper the wave base v et al 2019 hence wavelength determines the depth of influence of underwater wave effects the underwater effects of wave forces cause unstable dynamic behavior and problems in guidance and control dantas et al 2012 yoon et al 2016 this results in limiting the scope of practical applications of underwater vehicles uv battista et al 2016 moonesun 2017 as ugs are slow speed buoyancy driven uv the analysis of wave effects on ug are of significant importance to predict the dynamics and navigation of ug many efforts can be cited from literature to calculate the wave forces and analyze its effects on underwater vehicles uv fang et al 2006 developed hydrodynamic model including the characteristics of maneuvering and sea keeping to simulate the ascending and descending behavior of the underwater vehicle near the sea surface the wave forces were calculated for nps auv ii using strip theory based on source distribution method considering several wave headings and frequencies the operation of the vehicle in waves is compared with and without pd controller du et al 2011 developed a motion model to simulate the effects of ocean waves and currents on low velocity uuv near sea surface the dynamic motion model is developed using momentum theorem and moment of momentum theorem and wave forces and moments are calculated using integration of pressure filed potential over uuv surface malik et al 2013 used panel method to calculate wave force on auv using 2nd order stokes wave theory and head seas conditions analytical formulation of the wave forces and moments as function of wave amplitude and frequencies and auv depth and pitch and side slip angles are developed using matlab curve fitting tool yoon et al 2018 calculated wave forces and moments for remus using panel method and sparse numerical results of wave forces and wave moments are interpolated numerically to use in continuous cases for wave frequency wave direction and operating depths the motion dynamic equations with numerical interpolation results are used to analyze the effects of dynamic control inputs using stern stabilizers rudders and thruster on the dynamic characteristics of uuv in waves tian et al 2019 analyzed the hydrodynamic performance of auv near sea surface in coupled wave current flow using a two phase computational fluid dynamics cfd method the influence of wave heights reynolds numbers and submerged depths on auv is quantitatively analyzed and the results are validated using experimental data it can be noticed from literature review that most of the research work is done on auvs auvs normally operate at fixed depths with very small pitch angles higher speeds and considering some mechanical driving force like propeller however the ug operate along a saw tooth path with constantly changing depth at very slow speeds have higher pitch angle and the driving force is net buoyancy another important difference between ug and other auvs is glide inflection near sea surface in which ug pitch angle and net buoyancy reverses direction to change ug direction it is therefore important to analyze the influence of wave force on ug three dimensional panel methods based on potential flows are most common numerical tool to analyze the behavior of floating and submerged platforms with reasonable accuracy the surface of the body is divided into small flat panel over which the source strength is assumed to be constant by calculating the source strength the velocities and pressure at centroid of each panel can be easily determined malik et al 2013 as bwb ug is a complex 3d shape therefore numerical method are required to estimate accurate wave force results in this paper ansys hydrodynamic diffraction hd and hydrodynamic time response htr modules based on panel method is used to calculate wave forces and moment on ug long wavelength airy waves with small wave height and steepness are considered in deep water a series of simulations is performed in ansys hd and htr modules for a variety ug depths and pitch angles and wave amplitudes and frequencies the wave force and moment result obtained from simulations are fitted using matlab curve fitting tool to derive their analytical formulations the wave force and moment analytical formulations are coupled with ug motion dynamic equations to analyze the effects of waves on ug dynamic stability and navigation 2 motion model 2 1 problem description and coordinates

with mass m the position r p of sliding mass actuators m m can be changed with respect to body frame o xyz to change center of gravity cg position a variable ballast mass actuator m b fixed at center of buoyancy cb is used to change net buoyancy by modulating inside water mass the total vehicle mass is m v m h m m m b where m h is the uniformly distributed hull mass the position r c g of the mass weighted centroid of the vehicle in body frame o xyz is given by 1 r c g m h r h m m r p m h m b m m as hydrodynamic forces on a ug depend on the velocity and orientation of the ug with respect to fluid a wind frame w xyz is defined to track ug orientation with respect to ug relative velocity through water as shown in fig 3 the wind frame w xyz is defined with its origin at cb and it orientation is defined such that one axis w x is aligned with velocity v and w y is perpendicular to w x and lies in o xy plane the orientation of ug velocity in wind frame w xyz is defined in terms of angle of attack α and side slip angle β as shown in fig 3 it is often convenient and required to calculate motion model parameters in a particular coordinate system and then covert them to required

angular spatial positions in earth fixed frame e xyz ox 0 y 0 z 0 ox 0 y 0 z 0 then the linear velocity b and angular velocity θ in earth fixed frame e xyz ox 0 y 0 z 0 ox 0 y 0 z 0 are given by 10 b x y z t r o e v 11 θ θ ψ φ t ω o e ω as we have expressions for linear velocity b and angular velocity θ of ug in earth fixed frame e xyz so expressions for linear acceleration ɑ e and angular

results of ansys hd are compared with the results of benchmark problem in frequency domain published by chatjigeorgiou 2013 chatjigeorgiou 2013 investigated the linear hydrodynamic scattering problem by a stationary submerged prolate spheroid and presented analytical solution for diffraction forces on prolate spheroid in regular waves and infinite depth as shown in fig 10 the prolate spheroid is modeled with aspect ratio b a of 0 4 and discretized into 1344 quadratic panels as shown in fig 11 in order to maintain consistency of aqwa and published results the simulations are performed at three

are performed considering head sea condition and 1000 m as total depth of water satisfying deep water wave condition h λ 0 5 figs 14 16 shows the variation of surge wave force heave wave force and pitch moment versus wave frequencies at various depths for head sea conditions it can be noticed that the amplitude of wave forces and moment at depth of 2 m increases with increasing wave frequency till 2 2 rad s and then starts decreasing as the depth of ug increases the frequency corresponding to peak values of wave forces and moments decrease it can also be noticed from the trend of the curves that the amplitudes of wave forces and moments decrease with increasing depth this can be explained by the fact that the amplitude of water particles orbital oscillation decreased exponentially with increasing depth i e r ɑ e k h where r is amplitude of water particle oscillation with wave ɑ is wave amplitude h is depth of water and k 2 π λ 4 4 time domain simulations time domain simulations were performed in ansys htr module it is observed that the wave forces and moments increases linearly with wave amplitude so the wave force formulations are developed per unit wave amplitude for a depth range of 1 20 m and for pitch angles ranging from 20 20 with angular interval of 5 since head sea condition is considered so the sway wave force f w z and roll m w x and yaw m w y wave moments are very small and neglected the results of the time domain simulation are fitted as function of time t depth h pitch angles θ and wave frequencies ω using matlab curve fitting tool 4 5 wave force

four selected wave frequencies is shown in figs 17 19 as expected the wave force amplitudes vary exponentially with submergence depth h it is observed that the value of a θ varies with pitch angle θ while the value of k remains almost constant for all values of pitch angles θ at a particular selected wave frequency and identified as wave number corresponding to selected wave frequency it is observed from the results of simulations that the amplitudes of surge wave force amplitude a f w x and heave wave force amplitude a f w y follow a parabolic trend while amplitude of pitch wave moment

phase angle δ is investigated by varying pitch angle θ at different values of depths and frequencies fig 23 shows the initial phase of wave surge force δ f w x wave heave force δ f w y and wave pitch moment δ m w z plotted against pitch angle θ it was revealed after careful observation of simulation results that the wave force initial phase δ is only the function of pitch angle θ the initial phase of wave surge force δ f w x can be fitted as cubic polynomial while that initial phase of wave heave force δ f w y and wave pitch moment δ m w z varies linearly with pitch angle θ in radians as

disturbing the stability and control of ug the wave forces also affect ug navigation along the glide path changing the design dive time and covered distances having coordinate transformation between wind frame w xyz earth fixed frame e xyz and body frame o xyz established the ug motion dynamics equations as given by 60 is no more a second order problem and can be solves by four order runge kutta method provided required initial conditions are available based on the motion model developed in section iv the influence of wave forces on ug dynamics is analyzed for different ug speeds and wave frequencies and amplitudes the obtained results are also compared with without wave case see table 2 5 1 the influence of pitch angle on wave forces and moments as the motion dynamics equations are in body frame o xyz the discussion of wave forces and moment in onward discussion will refer to their values in body fame o xyz unless earth fixed frame e xyz is specifically mentioned in order to analyze the ug dynamic characteristics the variation of wave forces and moments with pitch angle along the glide path is firstly be performed the fluctuating response of ug is analyzed from a depth of 10 m till minimum depth during upward glide and from minimum attained depth till 10 m depth during downward glide the design glide speed v d is 0 75 m s and the wave frequency ω and amplitudes ɑ are selected as 1 04 rad s and 0 3 m respectively the glide path ratio x y of 5 is selected for motion simulation the glide inflection takes place at depth of 3 m during which the sliding mass position and net buoyant mass changes in 12 s the necessary ug parameters for motion simulations are given in table 3 5 1 1 surge wave force in order to analyze the variation of surge wave force f w x b with pitch angle along the glide path the surge wave force along with its comprising wave force components i e f w x c o s θ and f w y s i n θ as given by 97 and corresponding pitch angle are shown in fig 24 above the surge wave force f w x b in body frame o xyz can be expressed as 97 f w x b f w x c o s θ f w y s i n θ it can be noticed that the amplitudes of surge wave force and its comprising components increases with decreasing depth the superposition of f w x c o s θ and f w y s i n θ having small lagging phase difference during upward glide results in increasing the amplitude of surge wave force f w x b during upward glide it is observed that the surge wave force f w x b and its comprising components lags pitch angle the lagging phase difference φsurge is small and its value decreases from t 32 15s and h 10 m to t 67 02s and h 3 3 m with increasing pitch angle the surge wave force amplitude a f w x given by 68 increases heave wave force amplitude a f w y given by 69 decreases c o s θ decreases and s i n θ increases the overlapping of pitch angle and surge wave force f w x b respective maximum and minimum amplitudes results in higher maximum amplitudes of surge wave force f w x b than absolute value of minimum amplitudes resulting in positive mean surge wave force during upward glide due to the higher rising rate of pitch angle maximum amplitude than minimum amplitude and decreasing phase difference φsurge during upward glide the maximum amplitude of surge wave force rises at higher rate than minimum amplitude resulting in an increasing mean surge wave force f w x b the increasing mean surge wave force f w x b increases mean horizontal and consequently increases ug encounter frequency as the pitch angle decreases towards zero from t 68 11s and h 3 m till t 81 45s and h 0 9 m during glide inflection surge wave force amplitude a f w x decreases heave wave force amplitude a f w y increases c o s θ increase and s i n θ decreases resulting in decreasing f w x c o s θ f w y s i n θ and consequently surge wave force f w x b amplitudes the relative smaller decrease of surge wave force f w x b maximum amplitudes than minimum amplitudes results in increasing surge wave force means value from t 67 02s to t 81 45s however it is observed that the decreasing surge wave force amplitudes and increasing lagging phase difference φsurge result in decreasing the rising rate of mean surge wave force fig 25 shows the variation of initial phase angle during glide inflection it can be noticed in fig 25 that the phase angle of surge wave force δ f w x decrease while phase angle of heave wave force δ f w y increase with decreasing pitch angel resulting in decreasing fluctuating frequency of s i n ω t x v w δ f w x and surge wave force f w x and increasing fluctuation frequency of s i n ω t x v w δ f w y and heave wave force f w y it can be noticed in fig 24 that although f w y s i n θ have larger frequency than f w x c o s θ as pitch angle changes direction between t 77 84s and t 85 26s their superposition results in decreasing the fluctuation frequency of surge wave force f w x b due to the larger amplitude of f w x c o s θ as compared to f w y s i n θ however fluctuation frequency of pitch angle increases during glide inflection till minimum depth resulting in increasing phase difference φsurge and consequently a very small value of 180 φsurge between surge wave force f w x b maximum amplitudes and pitch angle minimum amplitudes during downward glide during start of downward glide the initial phase variation and ug acceleration due downward buoyant and mean surge wave forces result in increasing the fluctuating frequencies of s i n ω t x v w δ f w x and s i n ω t x v w δ f w y and consequently increasing the fluctuation frequencies of f w x c o s θ f w y s i n θ and surge wave force f w x b the increasing absolute value of mean pitch angle from zero to a maximum value of 13 85 at time t 94 1s and h 3 6 m result in increasing f w x cos θ f wy sin θ and consequently surge wave force f wxb amplitudes after attaining maximum absolute value the pitch angle absolute values corresponding to maximum and minimum amplitudes start decreasing with increasing depth during downward glide as the negative pitch angle decreases the surge wave force amplitude a f w x given by 68 increases while heave wave force amplitude a f w y given by 69 c o s θ and s i n θ decreases during downward glide due to the small value of φsurge 180 the minimum amplitude of pitch angle overlaps with maximum amplitude of surge wave force f w x b and its components while the maximum amplitude of pitch angle overlaps with minimum amplitude of surge wave force f w x b and its components which results in higher maximum amplitudes of f w x c o s θ f w y s i n θ and surge wave force f w x b as compared to minimum amplitudes and consequently yields positive mean value along downward glide path as the absolute value of mean pitch angle decreases with increasing depth during downward glide the amplitudes and mean values of surge wave force decreases resulting in decreasing mean horizontal velocity and fluctuation frequency of ug 5 1 2 heave wave force in order to analyze the variation of heave wave force with pitch angle along the glide path the heave wave force f w y b calculated in body frame o xyz along with its comprising components i e f w x s i n θ and f w y c o s θ as given by 98 and pitch angle are shown in fig 26 98 f w y b f w x s i n θ f w y c o s θ it can be noticed in fig 26 that the smaller amplitude of surge wave force f w x compared to heave wave f w y and smaller value of s i n θ due to small pitch angle 9 to 17 result in a very small amplitude of f w x s i n θ compared to the amplitude f w y c o s θ and their superposition result in decreasing amplitude of the heave wave forces f w y b due to their almost anti phase nature along the glide path however due to smaller amplitude of f w x s i n θ compared to f w y c o s θ the amplitude and fluctuation frequency of heave wave force f w y b is almost same as f w y c o s θ it is observed that the value of φheave 180 decreases till glide inflection depth and then increases till minimum depth where φheave is the lagging phase difference of heave wave force from pitch angle due to the small value of φheave 180 the amplitude of pitch angle below mean value overlap with positive amplitude of heave wave force f w y b and the amplitude of pitch angle above mean value overlap with the negative amplitude of heave wave force f w y b for most of fluctuating response time as the pitch angle decreases the heave wave force f w y amplitude given by 69 and c o s θ increase due to the overlapping of heave wave force f w y b maximum amplitudes with pitch angle minimum amplitude the maximum amplitude of heave wave force f w y b attains higher value than absolute value of minimum amplitude resulting in a positive mean heave wave force along the upward glide path due to the higher rising rate of maximum amplitude of pitch angle resulting in an increasing mean pitch angle along the upward glide path and decreasing value of φheave 180 the difference between maximum and minimum amplitudes of heave wave force increases resulting in increasing mean heave wave force the decreasing the pitch angle toward zero during the start of glide inflection result in decreasing s i n θ and f w x given by 68 and increasing c o s θ and f w y given by 69 which result in heave wave force f w y b almost having same amplitude and fluctuating frequency as f w y c o s θ due to very small amplitude of very small amplitude of f w x s i n θ the amplitudes of heave wave force f w y b increases with decreasing depth and pitch angle toward zero however it is observed that the increasing value of φheave 180 till minimum depth result in larger increase in minimum amplitude compared to maximum amplitude and consequently decreasing the mean heave wave force as the mean pitch angle changes directions at t 80 5s and h 0 9 m the amplitudes of heave wave force f w y b decrease as the depth and absolute values of pitch angle increases during downward glide however the negative pitch angle results in higher heave wave force minimum amplitude than maximum amplitude resulting in negative mean heave wave force the absolute value of downward mean heave wave force increases in downward direction till the mean pitch angle increase to maximum absolute value of 13 85 as the ug reaches h 3 6 m at t 94 1s the increasing heave wave force initial phase angle δ f w y as given by 84 with decreasing pitch angle results in increasing the fluctuation frequency of heave wave force f w y b from 1 154 rad s at t 69 38s and h 2 66 m during upward glide to 1 17 rad s at t 90 97s and h 2 6 m during downward glide after attaining maximum values the ug pitch angle absolute values corresponding to maximum and minimum amplitudes and mean start decreasing with increasing depth during downward glide the higher fluctuation frequency of heave wave force during glide inflection results in smaller value of φheave 180 during downward glide the overlapping of heave wave force f w y b minimum amplitude with minimum absolute value of pitch angle results in higher minimum heave wave force amplitude than maximum amplitude and consequently resulting in negative mean heave wave force during downward glide with increasing depth and the pitch angle amplitudes and mean absolute values the amplitudes of heave wave force f w y b decreases while the difference between minimum and maximum heave wave force f w y b amplitudes decrease resulting in decreasing mean heave wave force during downward glide 5 1 3 pitch wave moment fig 27 shows the pitch wave moment m w z and pitch angle fluctuating amplitudes and mean values along the glide path it can be noticed that the pitch wave moment m w z and pitch angle are anti phase with small value of 180 φpitch between pitch wave moment m w z maximum amplitude and pitch angle minimum amplitude where φpitch is phase difference between pitch wave moment and pitch angle as pitch angle decreases the pith wave moment m w z amplitude given by 70 increases due to smaller 180 φpitch the pitch wave moment m w z maximum amplitude overlap with pitch angle minimum amplitude and pitch wave moment m w z minimum amplitude overlap with pitch angle maximum amplitude which result in higher maximum pitch wave moment m w z amplitude than minimum amplitude and consequently results in a positive mean pitch wave moment along the upward glide path due to increasing pitch angle values corresponding to maximum and minimum amplitudes and decreasing depth till glide inflection the maximum and minimum pitch wave moment amplitudes and their difference increases resulting in increasing mean pitch wave moment during the glide inflection although the actuators adjustment due to glide inflections completes from 68 11 s to 80 11 due to inertia of ug the mean pitch angle decreases to zero at t 80 5s and then starts increasing in downward direction till t 94 1s it is observed that amplitudes of pitch wave moment m w z increases till minimum depth due to decreasing depth and pitch angle however due to increasing value of 180 φpitch till minimum depth the increase in pitch wave moment minimum amplitude is greater than increase in maximum amplitudes resulting in decreasing mean pitch wave moment the increase in pitch wave moment m w z amplitude with decreasing pitch angle from zero to a minimum value of 13 85 till t 94 1s as given by 70 reduces the rate of decline of pitch wave moment amplitudes with increasing depth during downward glide the overlapping of pitch wave moment m w z maximum amplitude with pitch angle minimum amplitude results in greater the pitch wave moment m w z maximum amplitude than minimum amplitude and consequently positive mean pitch wave moment during downward glide the increasing phase angle as given by 85 with decreasing pitch angle results in increasing fluctuating frequency of pitch wave moment δ m w z during glide inflection the increasing depth during downward glide results in decreasing pitch wave moment m w z amplitudes and consequently the difference between maximum and minimum amplitudes resulting in decreasing mean pitch wave moment 5 2 the influence of wave frequency in order to analyze the effects of wave frequency ω on the dynamic behavior and navigation of ug the ug is simulated in waves and without waves for four wave frequencies ω of 0 57 1 04 1 51 and 1 99 radians per seconds the design glide speed v d of ug is 0 5 m s and the wave amplitude ɑ is selected as 0 2 m the glider is simulated for two glides with maximum depth of 30 m when the ug reaches a depth of 2 m during upward glide the glide inflection starts to change the sliding mass position r p x from 14 8 mm to 14 8 mm and net buoyancy from 18 15 n to 18 15 n in 12 s changing pitch angle and vertical velocity y from positive to negative values fig 28 shows the trajectory of the glide path for four wave frequencies and without wave case it can be noticed that deviation of ug from without wave glide increases with increasing wave frequency and decreasing depth it can be noticed that the total horizontal covered distance for combined upward and downward glides is greater in wave case than without wave case and its value increases with increasing wave frequency table 4 shows the horizontal covered distance x time required to complete each glide and minimum attained depth of ug for the four selected wave frequencies and without wave case the horizontal distance covered during upward glide till the glide inflection depth of 2 m is nearly same for all wave frequencies and without wave case the glide inflection is considered as start of downward glide that results in more horizontal distance during downward glide than upward glide due to additional distance covered during glide inflection during downward glide the horizontal distance covered in wave case is greater than without wave case and its value increases with increasing wave frequency it can also be noticed in table 4 that the ug takes less time in wave case to complete glide than without wave case and its value increases with increasing wave frequency the ug takes more time during downward glide due to the additional time taken during glide inflection fig 28 shows that the minimum depth attained by the ug in wave case is smaller than without wave case and its value decreases with increasing wave frequency fig 29 compares the fluctuating surge wave force f w x b and the horizontal velocities v x responses of ug for the selected four wave frequencies from a depth of 7 m during upward glide to the depth 7 m during downward glide fig 30 compare maximum amplitude and mean values of surge wave forces f w x b and the horizontal velocities v x for selected four wave frequencies from depth of 10 m during the upward till depth of 10 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 29 that the higher that wave frequency the higher surge wave force f w x b and corresponding horizontal velocities v x fluctuating amplitudes mean values and fluctuating frequencies fig 30 shows that the depth of wave base decreases and the rate of rise of surge wave force maximum amplitudes and mean values increase with increasing wave frequency as a result although the ug starts experiencing surge wave force at smaller depth for higher wave frequencies compared to the lower wave frequencies the higher rising rate results in attaining higher maximum amplitude and mean surge wave forces with increasing wave frequency it can be noticed that the rising rate of horizontal velocity demonstrates same behavior as the excitation surge wave force till glide inflection with decreasing pitch angle during glide inflection the maximum and mean surge wave forces first increase then decreases till pitch angel become zero at minimum depth then increase again as the pitch increases in downward direction and consequently decrease as the rate of pitch angle variation decreases and depth of ug increases the mean surge wave force first decreases and then increases as the ug changes direction the wave frequency has almost no effect on the variation behavior of mean and maximum surge wave forces during glide inflection and mainly effect the rate of variation and magnitudes of mean and maximum surge wave forces the higher the wave frequency the higher the rate of variation and maximum values attained by mean and maximum surge wave forces during glide inflection during glide inflection the combined effect of the increasing mean surge wave force with increasing wave frequency and decreasing net buoyancy results in decreasing values of mean horizontal velocity for smaller wave frequencies of 0 57 and 1 04 rad s and increasing values for higher wave frequencies of 1 51 and 1 99 rad s till minimum depth however due to increasing amplitudes and mean values of surge wave force and net downward buoyant force the ug horizontal velocity amplitudes and mean increase for all selected wave frequencies the rate of variation and magnitudes of amplitude and mean horizontal velocity increases with increasing wave frequency during glide inflection the mean and maximum surge wave forces and the corresponding horizontal velocities decrease with increasing depth and the rates of decline increases with increasing wave frequency during downward glide fig 31 compares the surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuating frequencies during upward and downward glides for all wave frequencies due to the forward speed the surge wave force and horizontal velocity have higher excitation frequencies than selected wave frequencies and its value increases with increasing wave frequency the surge wave force and horizontal velocity frequencies first increase then decrease and subsequently increase due to mean horizontal velocity and pitch angle variation during glide inflection and finally decreases with decreasing mean horizontal velocity during downward glide it is observed that the relative decline of fluctuation frequencies during glide inflection increase with increasing wave frequency however due to initial phase variation with changing pitch angle the decline in surge wave force fluctuation frequency is larger than horizontal velocity for all wave frequencies fig 32 shows the time lag of fluctuating horizontal velocity from the excitation surge wave force during upward glide and downward glides respectively it can be noticed that the higher the selected wave frequency the smaller is the time lag during upward and downward glides the lag time first decreases due to increasing surge wave force amplitude with decreasing depth then rise and subsequently decline near minimum depth and then slowly increases with decreasing depth during downward glide the variation behavior of lag time is almost same for all wave frequencies however the higher the wave frequency the smaller is the rise of lag time rise during glide inflection fig 33 shows the excitation heave wave force and vertical velocity response of ug along the glide path from a depth of 7 m during upward glide to the depth 7 m during downward glide fig 34 compares maximum amplitude and mean values of heave wave force f w y b and vertical velocity v y for selected wave frequencies from depth of 10 m during the upward glide till depth of 10 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 33 that the heave wave forces f w y b and vertical velocity v y amplitudes and fluctuating frequencies increases with increasing wave frequency and decreasing depth the difference in magnitudes of ug mean and steady state vertical velocities are very small as compared to ug mean and steady state horizontal velocities for all selected wave frequencies it is observed that although the mean surge and heave wave forces magnitudes are comparable the comparatively bigger value of ug vertical additional mass factor 30 4 than horizontal additional mass factor 0 265 results in smaller increase in vertical velocity of the ug compared to horizontal velocity and consequently resulting in smaller difference in magnitudes of ug mean and steady state vertical velocities it can be noticed in fig 34 that the depth of wave base decreases while the rate of rise of mean and maximum heave wave forces increases with increasing wave frequency the rate of rise of vertical velocity maximum amplitudes with depth demonstrates the same behavior as the heave wave force for all wave frequencies till glide inflection depth during upward glide during glide inflection the heave wave force amplitude increases till minimum depth and then decreases as the pitch angle decreases in the start of downward glide the mean heave wave force first increases then decreases and attain minimum value in downward direction and then increases as the pitch angle variation due to glide inflection decreases and depth of ug increase the increasing wave frequency have almost no effect on the variation behavior of heave wave force mean and maximum amplitude during glide inflection and mainly affect its magnitude and rate of variation during glide inflection the mean vertical velocity first decreases to zero and changes direction then increases after attaining minimum value the maximum absolute values attained by mean vertical velocity increases with increasing wave frequency during glide inflection the magnitude of vertical velocity maximum amplitude increases with increasing wave frequency during glide inflection the heave wave force and horizontal velocity maximum amplitudes decreases with increasing depth during downward glide the mean heave wave force and vertical velocity remains negative and their values increases with increasing depth during downward glide as the heave wave force mean values and amplitudes become nearly zero for all wave frequencies at depth below wave base the amplitudes of vertical velocity decreases to zero while its mean values attain steady state vertical velocity values fig 35 shows the heave wave force and vertical velocity fluctuation frequencies along the glide path during upward and downward glides due to mean horizontal velocity of ug the heave wave force and corresponding vertical velocities have higher fluctuation frequencies than selected wave frequencies it can be noticed that the fluctuation frequency increases due to increasing mean horizontal velocity with decreasing depth and decreases after attaining maximum value during downward glide the heave wave force and vertical velocity fluctuation frequencies increases with increasing wave frequency and the higher the selected wave frequency the higher is the rate of variation of fluctuation frequencies with depth above wave base fig 36 shows the time lag of vertical velocity response from the excitation heave wave force during an upward and downward glides respectively it can be noticed that the time lag decreases with increasing wave frequency the time lag decreases till minimum depth for all wave frequencies the increasing heave wave force amplitude and excitation frequency and decreasing pitch moment due to net buoyant force and inertia of ug the rate of rise of vertical velocity fluctuating frequency increases and consequently the rate of decline of time lag increases during glide inflection the higher the wave frequency the smaller is decline in time lag as the rate of pitch angle variation due to glide inflection decreases and depth of ug increase the lag time increases during downward glide for all wave frequencies fig 37 compares the maximum amplitude and mean value of pitch wave moments and corresponding pitch angular velocities from a depth of 10 m during upward glide till depth of 10 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 34 that the maximum amplitude of pitch wave moment increase till minimum depth while the mean pitch wave moment increases with decreasing depth till glide inflection and then decreases till minimum depth the rate of variation of maximum amplitude and mean value of pitch wave moment increases while depth of wave base decreases as the wave frequency increase the higher the wave frequency the larger is the attained value of maximum amplitude of pitch wave moment at minimum depth the slope of mean pitch wave moment varies from decreasing to increasing with increasing wave frequency during the start of glide inflection and finally the mean pitch wave moment decreases for all wave frequencies the rate of rise of pitch angular velocity maximum amplitudes with depth demonstrates the same behavior as the maximum amplitude of pitch wave moment till glide inflection depth with increasing wave frequency the mean pitch angular velocity varies from negative to positive values and the slope of mean pitch angular velocity increases from negative to positive with increasing wave frequency along upward glide path the rising rate of maximum pitch angular velocity decreases during glide inflection and the decrease in rising rate increases with decreasing wave frequency the mean pitch angular velocity decreases as the ug rotate in clockwise direction and attains maximum absolute value at minimum depth the higher the wave frequency the smaller is the rate of decline of mean pitch angular velocity as the depth of ug start increasing during downward glide the pitch wave moment amplitude decrease while the slope of mean pitch wave moment varies from decreasing to increasing with increasing wave frequency and finally the mean pitch wave moment decreases for all wave frequencies as the pitch angle decreases to its minimum equilibrium value due to glide inflection during downward glide the mean pitch angular velocity increases the rate of rise of mean pitch angular velocity with depth increases as the wave frequency decreases the mean pitch angular velocities fluctuate with very small amplitude about zero value for all wave frequencies and steadily approach to zero as the mean pitch angle variation due to attitude adjustment dies out the slope of maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity varies from increasing to decreasing as the wave frequency increases and finally maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity decreases with increasing depth for all wave frequencies fig 38 shows the ug fluctuating pitch angular response due to excitation pitch wave moment along the glide path from a depth of 7 m during upward glide to the depth 7 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 37 that the amplitudes of pitch angle increase with decreasing depth it can also be noticed that the ug pitch angle have higher absolute mean value than steady state pitch angle absolute values during upward and downward glide and its value increases with decreasing depth for all wave frequencies it is noticed that the pitch angle and pitch angular velocities are at phase angle of 90 with each other fig 39 shows the mean and maximum values of pitch angle during upward and downward glides the maximum amplitude and mean values of pitch angle first increase with decreasing depth then changes direction during glide inflection and attain maximum absolute value in downward direction and then increase with small fluctuations and finally become equal to with wave pitch angle values at depths below wave base it can be noticed that the rate of variation of pitch angle mean and maximum values with depth increases as the wave frequency increases in this section the influence of wave frequencies was analyzed on the glide path and dynamics characteristics of ug the ug was simulated during upward glide glide inflection and downward glide for four selected wave frequencies it was observed from results of motion simulation that the surge and heave wave forces and pitch wave moment have fluctuating amplitudes with mean values the rate of rise of wave forces moment amplitudes and mean values and ug velocities increases with decreasing depth while the depth of wave base decreases with increasing wave frequency the increasing rise rate resulted in higher attained values of wave forces moment and corresponding ug velocities at minimum depth for higher wave frequencies compared with smaller wave frequencies the glide path was significantly affected by wave forces moment during glide inflection due to the mean wave force and moment it was observed that the higher the wave frequency the larger is the deviation of ug from without wave glide path it was also observed that horizontal distance covered and the glide time for combined upward and downward glides increases while the minimum attained depth during glide inflection decreases with increasing wave frequency the excitation frequency of wave forces moment and ug response increases with increasing wave frequency it was noticed that the ug response lag the excitation wave force moment and the lag time decreases with increasing wave frequency 5 3 the influence of wave amplitude in order to analyze the effects of wave amplitude on the glide path and dynamic characteristics of ug the ug is simulated in waves for four wave amplitudes of 0 2 0 25 0 3 and 0 35 m the design glide speed v d of ug along the glide path is 0 75 m s and the wave frequency ω of 1 04 rad s is selected in all simulations the glider is simulated for two glides with maximum and minimum depths of 15 and 3 m respectively when the ug reaches to a depth of 3 m the glide inflection takes place the length of glide inflection is selected as 12 s the trajectory of the glide path for four wave amplitudes is shown in fig 40 it can be noticed that deviation from without wave glide path increases with increasing wave amplitude and maximum deviation occurs at minimum depth near sea surface it can be noticed in fig 40 that the combined horizontal covered distance during upward and downward glides is greater in wave case than without wave case and its value increases as wave amplitude increases table 5 shows the covered horizontal distance and time required to complete each glide and the minimum attained depth for the four selected wave amplitudes and without wave case it can be noticed in table 5 that the horizontal distance covered during upward glide till glide inflection depth is smaller in wave case than without wave case and its value decreases as the slope of glide path increases with increasing wave amplitude and the ug attains glide inflection depth for smaller horizontal distance covered due to the additional distance covered during glide inflection the horizontal distance covered during downward glide is greater than upward glide and its value increases with increasing wave amplitude table 5 shows that the ug takes less time in wave case to complete glide than without wave case for all selected wave amplitudes and the glide time decreases as the wave amplitudes increases due to additional time taken during glide inflection the ug takes more time during downward glide than upward glide the minimum depth attained by the ug in wave case is smaller than without wave case for all selected wave amplitudes fig 41 shows the ug fluctuating surge wave forces and horizontal velocities of ug along the glide path from a depth of 7 m during upward glide to the depth 7 m during downward glide for the selected four wave amplitudes fig 42 shows the mean and maximum surge wave forces and horizontal velocities of ug during upward glide and downward glides it can be noticed in fig 41 that the mean horizontal velocity of ug is higher than design steady state glide speed of 0 75 m s for all selected wave amplitudes it can also be noticed that the surge wave force have almost similar fluctuating response near minimum depth for wave amplitudes of 0 2 m and 0 3 m similarly the wave amplitudes of 0 25 m and 0 35 m have almost similar fluctuating response near minimum depth it can be noticed in fig 42 that the surge wave force and corresponding horizontal velocity maximum amplitude first increases till glide inflection then decreases and subsequently increases due to glide inflection and then decrease as the depth of ug increases during downward glide the mean surge wave force continues to increase for all selected wave amplitude and then decreases after attaining maximum value during glide inflection the mean horizontal velocity demonstrate almost same behavior as maximum amplitude of horizontal velocity along the glide path due to the similar fluctuating responses of wave amplitudes of 0 2 m and 0 3 m their variation behavior is almost same similarly the variation behavior for wave amplitudes of 0 25 m and 0 35 m is almost same along the glide path the wave amplitude also affects the magnitudes and rate of variation of maximum amplitude and mean values of surge wave force and horizontal velocity the higher the wave amplitude the higher the magnitudes and slower the rate of variation of maximum amplitude and mean values of surge wave force and horizontal velocity with depth fig 43 shows the surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies for the four selected wave amplitudes during upward and downward glides it can be seen that the surge wave forces and horizontal velocities have higher excitation frequencies than selected wave frequency of 1 04 rad s for all wave amplitudes and their values first increase with increasing mean horizontal velocity during upward glide then decrease and subsequently increase due to glide inflection and then decrease with increasing depth during downward glide due to the increasing mean horizontal velocity with increasing wave amplitude the higher the wave amplitude the higher surge wave forces and horizontal velocities fluctuation frequencies during upward and downward glides during glide inflection the decline of horizontal velocity fluctuation frequency is less than surge wave force fluctuation frequency due to similar fluctuating behavior of surge wave forces for wave amplitudes of 0 2 m and 0 3 m and wave amplitudes of 0 25 m and 0 35 m respectively their corresponding horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies demonstrate similar behavior fig 44 shows the time lag of horizontal velocity response from the surge wave excitation force during an upward and downward glides it can be noticed that the lag time first decreases till glide inflection then increase and subsequently decrease during glide inflection and then steadily increases with decreasing depth after small fluctuation the lag time is almost same for all wave amplitudes during start of upward glide due to the similar wave frequencies and increases with decreasing wave amplitude till glide inflection during upward glide and during downward glide when the effects of pitch angle variation due to glide inflection decreases during glide inflection the synchronized decline of surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies as shown in fig 43 result in smaller rise and larger subsequent decline of lag time for wave amplitude of 0 25 m as compare to other wave amplitudes the more synchronized the variation of fluctuating frequencies and the smaller the difference between fluctuating frequencies the smaller is the lag time fig 45 shows the fluctuating pitch wave moment on ug along the glide path from a depth of 7 m during upward glide to the depth 7 m during downward glide fig 46 shows the mean and maximum pitch wave moment from depth of 10 m during the upward glide till depth of 10 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 45 that the pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocities fluctuating amplitude and excitation frequencies increases as the selected wave amplitude increases and depth of ug decreases it can also be noticed that mean pitch angular velocity is almost equal to without wave pitch angular velocity value of zero during upward glide till glide inflection and during downward glide after the effects of glide inflection dies out fig 46 shows that the maximum amplitudes and mean values of pitch wave moments increase during upward glide and after attaining maximum values during glide inflection decreases as the depth of ug increases during downward glide for all wave amplitudes the values corresponding to maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity along first increases then decreases and subsequently increases during glide inflection and then decreases as the depth of ug increases the variation law of maximum amplitudes and mean values of pitch wave moments and maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity along the glide path is almost same for all wave amplitudes however their maximum amplitude increases with increasing wave amplitude the maximum amplitudes and mean values of pitch wave moment and maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocities corresponding to a particular depth almost linearly increases as the selected wave amplitude increases during upward glide till glide inflection and during downward glide after the effect of glide inflection dies out however their rate of variation of increases with decreasing wave amplitude during glide inflection the pitch angular velocity has very small magnitude and its rising rate increases with increasing wave amplitude till glide inflection the mean pitch angular velocity first decreases due to glide inflection and then steadily increases towards zero value after undergoing small fluctuations during downward glide fig 47 show the fluctuation frequency of pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity for all selected wave amplitudes during upward and downward glides it can be noticed in fig 47 that the pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity fluctuation frequencies increases till glide inflection depth during glide inflection the rising rate of pitch wave moment and corresponding pitch angular velocity frequencies increases with decreasing pitch angle for all wave amplitudes the pitch wave moment frequencies continue to increase during start of the downward glide and decreases after attaining maximum values the slope of the pitch angular velocity fluctuation frequencies varies from decreasing to increasing with increasing wave amplitude during the start of the downward glide the pitch angular velocities frequencies decreases and subsequently increases for wave amplitudes 0 2 m and 0 25 m and then the pitch angular velocities frequencies decrease for all wave amplitudes with increasing depth it can be noticed that the smaller the wave amplitude the smaller is the fluctuation frequency magnitude and more unsteady are the variation of pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity frequencies along the glide path fig 48 shows the time lag of pitch angular velocities response from the excitation pitch wave moment during upward and downward glides for selected wave amplitudes it can be noticed that the difference between lag times is small till glide inflection for all wave amplitudes and increases due to the higher frequency of pitch angular velocity than pitch wave moment during glide inflection the slope of the lag time varies from increasing to decreasing during the start of downward glide the lag time continues to decrease for wave amplitude of 0 35 m as the fluctuation frequency of pitch angular velocity is higher than pitch wave moment and their difference increases during the start of the downward glide however the lag time for other wave amplitudes first rises then decreases till depth of 6 m and finally increases for wave amplitudes the higher the wave amplitude the smaller is the rise in lag time during the start of downward glide the lag time increases with decreasing wave amplitude during downward glide fig 49 shows the mean and maximum pitch angles of ug from depth of 10 m during upward to a depth of 10 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 49 that the amplitude and mean values of ug pitch angle increases during upward glide till glide inflection then changes direction and attain maximum absolute in downward glide and then their absolutes values increase during downward glide the larger the wave amplitude the larger are mean and maximum pitch angles and the higher is their rate of rise with depth during upward glide however the mean and maximum pitch angles for different wave amplitudes fluctuate about each other during downward glide the larger the wave amplitude the higher are the fluctuations in pitch angle during downward glide in this section the influence of wave amplitudes was analyzed on the glide path and dynamics characteristics of ug the glider was simulated in during upward glide glide inflection and downward glide for four selected wave amplitudes it was observed that the higher the wave amplitude the higher are the amplitudes and mean values of wave forces moments and ug response the higher the wave amplitude the higher is the deviation of ug from without wave glide path for combined upward and downward glides the horizontal covered distance increases while the time to complete combined glide and the minimum attained depth decreases as the wave amplitudes increases the mean wave forces moment increases glide speeds and encounter frequencies of ug the higher wave amplitude the higher is the encounter fluctuation frequency of ug 5 4 the influence of ug speed the ug is simulated in waves and without waves for four steady state glide speeds v d of 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 m s to examine the effects of waves forces on ug dynamics for different ug speeds in order to achieve the design glide speed the sliding mass and it vertical displacement r p y is kept constant while its longitudinal displacement r p x is varied for each steady state glide speed ballast mass is changed to provide the net buoyancy for each steady state design glide speed the details for net buoyancy adjustment and sliding mass position for each design glide speed are detailed in table 5 the angular frequency ω and amplitudes ɑ of selected wave are 1 04 rad s and 0 25 m respectively the glider is simulated for two glides with maximum and minimum depths of 25 and 2 5 m respectively the length of glide inflection is selected as 12 s the trajectory of the glide path for four glide speeds is shown in fig 50 it can be noticed that the horizontal distance covered during combined upward and downward glides in wave case is more than without wave case and its value increases with increasing glide speed for both wave and without wave cases table 6 shows the horizontal distance covered time required to complete glide and minimum attained depth for wave and without wave case due to the steeper glide path the ug attains the desired glide inflection depth for less horizontal distance covered during upward glide in wave case compared to without wave case it can also be noticed that the horizontal distance covered is almost same for all glide speeds during upward glide in both wave and without wave cases however due to additional distance covered during glide inflection the ug covers more horizontal distance during downward glide than upward glide for both wave and without wave due to mean wave forces and moments the ug covers more horizontal distance in wave case compared to without wave case and its value increases with increasing glide speed it can be noticed in table 6 that the time required to complete upward and downward glides is smaller in wave case compared to without wave case and its value decreases with increasing glide speeds due to additional time taken during glide inflection the time required to complete upward glide is smaller than downward glide it can also be noticed that the higher velocities during glide inflection results in greater distance covered due to inertia and the minimum attained depth in wave case than without wave case and the minimum attained depth decreases with increasing glide speed in both wave and without wave case fig 51 shows the mean and maximum surge wave forces and vertical velocities from depth of 10 m during the upward glide to a depth of 10 m downward glide fig 51 shows that the surge wave force maximum amplitude first increases till glide inflection then decreases and consequently increases during glide inflection and finally decrease with increasing depth for all wave amplitudes the mean surge wave force continues to increase till minimum depth and then decreases with increasing depth it can be noticed that the smaller the glide speed the higher is the maximum amplitude and mean values of surge wave force till glide inflection the surge wave force maximum amplitude for selected glide speeds fluctuates about each other during glide inflection and downward glide however it is observed that smaller the glide speed along the glide path the higher are the pitch angle and surge wave force maximum amplitude variation with depth during glide inflection and downward glide the difference between mean surge wave forces for selected glide speeds is very small during downward glide the maximum amplitudes of horizontal velocity first increase then decreases and subsequently increases during glide inflection and then decreases with increasing depth the higher glide speed the higher is magnitude and rate of variation of the horizontal velocity maximum amplitude with depth along the glide path the mean horizontal velocity increases till minimum depth the slope of mean horizontal velocity varies increasing to decreasing from the start of glide inflection till minimum depth as the ug change direction at minimum depth the mean horizontal velocity first increases and then decreases with increasing depth during downward glide the higher the glide speed the higher is the mean horizontal velocity along the glide path fig 52 shows the surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies along the upward and downward glide paths respectively it can be noticed the ug the surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies first increase till minimum depth then decreases and subsequently increases during glide inflection and then decreases with increasing depth during downward glide as the glide speed increase the surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies increases while rate variation with depth decreases during upward glide till glide inflection and during downward glide after the effect of glide inflection decrease it can also be noticed that the decline in fluctuation frequencies of horizontal velocity is less than surge wave force during glide inflection fig 53 shows the time lag of horizontal velocity response from the surge wave excitation force during upward and downward glides the lag time first decreases with decreasing depth then increases due to the larger decline in frequency of surge wave force compared to horizontal velocity during glide inflection subsequently decreases due to large increase in frequency of surge wave force compared to horizontal velocity and then steadily increases with increasing depth during downward glide it can be noticed that the smaller the glide speed the higher is the lag time during upward glide till glide inflection and during downward glide after the effects of glide inflection dies out fig 54 compared the mean and maximum values of heave wave force and vertical velocity during the upward and downward glides it can be noticed in fig 54 that the amplitude of heave wave force increases till minimum depth and then decreases during downward glide the mean heave wave force first increase with decreasing depth then decrease during glide inflection and attain maximum absolute value in downward direction and then its absolute value decreases with increasing depth for all glide speeds the glide speed has very small effect on the magnitude and rate of variation of maximum heave wave force the mean heave wave force increases with decreasing glide speed till glide inflection during upward glide and till the effects of glide inflection decrease during downward glide the rate of variation of mean heave wave force with depth increases with decreasing glide speed during glide inflection the maximum amplitude of vertical velocity first increases with decreasing depth and after attaining maximum value during glide inflection decreases with increasing depth the vertical velocity maximum amplitude rising rate during upward glide increases with decreasing glide speed and its declining rate decreases with decreasing glide speed during downward glide the slope of mean vertical velocity varies from increasing to decreasing with increasing glide speed during upward glide till glide inflection the mean vertical velocity first decreases and changes direction for all glide speeds during glide inflection then increase after attaining minimum value during downward glide and then become almost constant at depth of 6 m as the pitch angle variation due to glide inflection dies out the magnitudes of maximum and mean vertical velocities increase during upward glide and decrease during downward glide with increasing glide speed fig 55 shows the heave wave force and vertical velocity fluctuation frequencies along the glide path during upward and downward glides the heave wave force frequencies increase with decreasing depth and after attaining maximum value during glide inflection decreases with increasing depth the vertical velocity frequency increases till minimum depth for all glide speeds the slope of the vertical velocity first decreases during the start of downward glide then varies from decreasing to increasing with increasing glide speed and then decreases for all glide speeds it can be noticed that the higher the glide speed the higher is fluctuation frequency of heave wave force and vertical velocity along the glide path it can be noticed that the heave wave force and vertical velocity have almost same frequencies till glide inflection however the higher rising rate of vertical velocity frequency than heave wave force result in higher vertical velocity frequency at minimum depth the declining vertical velocity frequency during the start of downward glide results in almost same fluctuation frequencies of heave wave force and vertical velocity during downward glide fig 56 shows the time lag of vertical velocity response from the excitation heave wave force during an upward and downward glides it can be noticed in fig 56 that the lag time first decreases with decreasing depth during upward glide and after attaining minimum value during glide inflection increases with increasing depth during downward glide the lag time increases with decreasing glide speed along the glide path till glide inflection during upward glide the slope of lag time varies from decreasing to increasing as the glide speed increases during glide inflection the rate of decline of lag time increases with decreasing glide speed till minimum depth after small fluctuations during the start of downward glide the slope of the lag time first decreases with increasing glide speed till depth of 4 5 m and then increases for all glide speeds it can also be noticed that lag time during downward glide is smaller than upward glide due to higher fluctuation frequency of vertical velocity than heave wave force during glide inflection fig 57 compares the mean and maximum pitch wave moment during the upward glide from depth of 10 m till minimum depth and downward glide from minimum depth till depth of 10 m it can be noticed in fig 57 that the maximum amplitudes of pitch wave moment increases with decreasing depth and after attaining maximum value during glide inflection decreases with increasing depth the mean pitch wave moment first increases with decreasing depth then decreases till minimum depth and consequently increases during glide inflection and then decreases with increasing depth the variation behavior of maximum and mean values of pitch wave moment along the glide path is almost same for all glide speeds the maximum amplitudes of pitch wave moment have almost same values for all glide speeds along glide paths however the mean pitch wave moment increases with decreasing glide speeds the rate of variation of mean pitch wave moment with depth increases with decreasing glide speed the maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity first increases till glide inflection then decreases and consequently increases during glide inflection and then decreases with increasing depth the mean pitch angular velocity have almost constant magnitude till glide inflection then decreases and consequently increase during glide inflection and then steadily approaches zero as the pitch angle variation due to glide inflection dies out it can be noticed in fig 57 that the magnitude of maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity decreases and magnitude of mean pitch angular velocity increases with increasing glide speed the rates of variation of maximum and mean pitch angular velocities with depth are almost same for all glide speeds till glide inflection the magnitude of maximum and mean pitch angular velocities fluctuate about each other during glide inflection and downward glide however the smaller the glides speed the higher the rate of variation of mean and maximum pitch angular velocities with depth fig 58 shows the pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity fluctuation frequencies along the glide path during upward and downward glides the pitch wave moment frequencies increase with decreasing depth and after attaining maximum value during glide inflection decreases with increasing depth the pitch angular velocity frequency increases till minimum depth for all glide speeds the slope of the pitch angular velocity first decreases during the start of downward glide then varies from decreasing to increasing with increasing glide speed and then decreases for all glide speeds it can be noticed that the higher the glide speed the higher is fluctuation frequency and smaller is the rate of variation with depth of pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity along the glide path it can be noticed that the pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity have almost same frequencies till glide inflection however the higher rising rate of pitch angular velocity frequency than pitch wave moment result in large pitch angular velocity frequency at minimum depth fig 59 shows the time lag of pitch angular velocity response from the pitch wave moment during an upward and downward glides it can be noticed in fig 59 that the lag time first decreases with decreasing depth during upward glide and after attaining minimum value at minimum depth first increases then steadily decreases till depth of about 5 m and then increases with increasing depth during downward glide the glide speed has no effect on variation law and affects magnitude and rate of variation with depth the lag time increases with decreasing glide speed along the glide path till glide inflection during upward glide the slope of lag time varies from decreasing to increasing as the glide speed increases during glide inflection the declining and subsequent rising rate of lag time with depth increases with decreasing glide speed the rate of lag time variation with first increases during decline and then decreases during rise with increasing glide speed along downward glide path fig 60 shows the mean and maximum pitch angles of ug from depth of 10 m during the upward glide till depth of 10 m during the downward glide fig 60 shows that the amplitude and mean values of ug pitch angle increases as the glide speed of ug decreases during upward glide it can also be noticed in fig 60 that the amplitude and mean values of ug pitch angle increases with decreasing glide speed during upward glide till glide inflection depth the maximum and mean values of pitch angle fluctuate about each other during glide inflection and downward glide the smaller the glide speed the higher are the variation of mean and maximum pitch angle with depth during glide inflection and downward glide in this section the influence of glide speed was analyzed on the glide path and dynamics characteristics of ug the glider was simulated during upward glide glide inflection and downward glide for four selected glide speed it was observed that the higher the selected glide speed the higher the hydrodynamic wave force as compared to the wave forces and the smaller is the deviation of ug from designed glide path it is also observed the encounter fluctuation frequency of ug increases while the lag time decreases with increasing glide speed the amplitudes of horizontal and vertical velocities increase while the amplitude of pitch angular velocity decreases with increasing glide speed however due to the higher fluctuation of pitch angle during downward glide the amplitude of ug velocities fluctuate about each other for selected glide speeds during downward glide 5 5 the influence of irregular wave in this paper the frequency range of irregular wave is 0 5 rad s and it is divided into frequency interval δ ω 0 005 rad s for total interval n 1000 the ug is simulated in sea state 2 and 3 with their significant wave heights of 0 5 m and 1 25 m respectively the glide speed v d is selected as 0 5 m s and glide inflection time of 12 s is selected the ug is simulated from depth of 25 m 3 m depth and back to 25 m fig 61 shows glide path for sea state 2 and 3 and in without wave case it can be noticed that maximum deviation from without wave glide path occurs near sea surface during glide inflection the deviation from without wave glide path is higher for sea state compare to sea state 2 due to mean wave forces the distance covered x for wave case is greater that without wave case figs 62 64 show the variation of surge and heave wave forces and pitch wave moment with time along the glide path the magnitudes of wave forces and moments increases with decreasing depth and become maximum during glide inflection it can be observed that wave forces and moments are greater in sea state 3 compared to sea state 2 due to mean surge and heave wave forces the ug is deviated from steady state glide path figs 65 67 show the variation of horizontal velocity v x vertical velocity v y and pitch angular velocity ω z with time along the glide path it can be noticed in fig 65 that due to mean horizontal wave forces the horizontal velocity v x have greater magnitude than steady state velocity of 0 5 m s in both sea state 2 and 3 however the horizontal velocity v x attain much higher magnitude in sea state 3 compared to sea state 2 due to greater wave forces fig 68 show the variation of pitch angular velocity θ with time it can be noticed that due to higher fluctuating pitch wave moment in sea state 3 the ug pitch angle undergo higher amplitude fluctuations about steady state value as compared to sea state 2

the area of the ocean accounts for more than two third of the total surface area of the earth oceans are rich in valuable natural resources such as natural gas petroleum resources and other mineral biological and medical resources however exploration of oceans resources is still far less than that of land because of vast expense of ocean and human limitations in terms of time and development recently the exploration of marine resources and oceanographic surveys gained substantial attention due to gradual depletion of land resources and strategic importance of ocean warfare many countries are heavily investing in developing marine exploration and research different types of sea exploration platforms have been developed based on specific requirement operational range and endurance energy efficiency payload capacity and navigation time at present the main research work on the ocean is the long term environmental monitoring of the oceans including the monitoring of environmental data strategic resources biological species population numbers etc and seawater samples water quality depth ph temperature etc ma et al 2018 manned underwater vehicles have humans on board which increase the risk as well as operational cost so underwater unmanned systems are getting very popular sahoo et al 2019 in efforts to develop energy efficient and long endurance winged autonomous underwater vehicles auv the underwater glider ug is developed that locomote by modulating their buoyancy and attitude instead of using propellers or jet and thus consume a small amount of energy while adjusting its center of gravity and buoyancy these buoyancy driven underwater platforms are ideally suited to oceanographic sensing and sampling missions military patrol and reconnaissance operations and marine exploration and monitoring applications stommel 1989 was the first to develop the idea of ug the first generation of ug developed till 2001 are known as legacy gliders which includes slocum webb et al 2001 seaglider eriksen 2001 and spray sherman et al 2001 a typical ug have pressure bearing hull wings ballast pumps and tanks internal moving masses electronic components and batteries the advantage of this layout is that the cylindrical shell has a larger pressure bearing capacity while the internal space is large and the design and control method are relatively simple zhang 1998 however the legacy gliders have a low lift drag ratio l d and limited gliding efficiency because the hull barely generates any lift force wang et al 2015 after a thorough study of hydrodynamics shape of ug ug similar in shape to air glider were developed compared with the legacy gliders the bwb ug has substantial reduction in the wetted area reducing the skin friction drag the smooth blended wing center body intersection reduce the interference drag and the lift to drag ratio is very high the relative better attributes of bwb ug such as streamlined body low noise long distance easy recycling and high energy efficiency are attracting researchers and investors to explore potential research areas of interest all around the world waves are physical phenomenon in which water particles oscillate in an orbital motion thus transmitting energy along the interface between two fluids of different density the orbital motion of water particles decrease with depth and nearly become negligible at a depth equal to half of wavelength λ 2 known as wave base the longer the wavelength the deeper the wave base v et al 2019 hence wavelength determines the depth of influence of underwater wave effects the underwater effects of wave forces cause unstable dynamic behavior and problems in guidance and control dantas et al 2012 yoon et al 2016 this results in limiting the scope of practical applications of underwater vehicles uv battista et al 2016 moonesun 2017 as ugs are slow speed buoyancy driven uv the analysis of wave effects on ug are of significant importance to predict the dynamics and navigation of ug many efforts can be cited from literature to calculate the wave forces and analyze its effects on underwater vehicles uv fang et al 2006 developed hydrodynamic model including the characteristics of maneuvering and sea keeping to simulate the ascending and descending behavior of the underwater vehicle near the sea surface the wave forces were calculated for nps auv ii using strip theory based on source distribution method considering several wave headings and frequencies the operation of the vehicle in waves is compared with and without pd controller du et al 2011 developed a motion model to simulate the effects of ocean waves and currents on low velocity uuv near sea surface the dynamic motion model is developed using momentum theorem and moment of momentum theorem and wave forces and moments are calculated using integration of pressure filed potential over uuv surface malik et al 2013 used panel method to calculate wave force on auv using 2nd order stokes wave theory and head seas conditions analytical formulation of the wave forces and moments as function of wave amplitude and frequencies and auv depth and pitch and side slip angles are developed using matlab curve fitting tool yoon et al 2018 calculated wave forces and moments for remus using panel method and sparse numerical results of wave forces and wave moments are interpolated numerically to use in continuous cases for wave frequency wave direction and operating depths the motion dynamic equations with numerical interpolation results are used to analyze the effects of dynamic control inputs using stern stabilizers rudders and thruster on the dynamic characteristics of uuv in waves tian et al 2019 analyzed the hydrodynamic performance of auv near sea surface in coupled wave current flow using a two phase computational fluid dynamics cfd method the influence of wave heights reynolds numbers and submerged depths on auv is quantitatively analyzed and the results are validated using experimental data it can be noticed from literature review that most of the research work is done on auvs auvs normally operate at fixed depths with very small pitch angles higher speeds and considering some mechanical driving force like propeller however the ug operate along a saw tooth path with constantly changing depth at very slow speeds have higher pitch angle and the driving force is net buoyancy another important difference between ug and other auvs is glide inflection near sea surface in which ug pitch angle and net buoyancy reverses direction to change ug direction it is therefore important to analyze the influence of wave force on ug three dimensional panel methods based on potential flows are most common numerical tool to analyze the behavior of floating and submerged platforms with reasonable accuracy the surface of the body is divided into small flat panel over which the source strength is assumed to be constant by calculating the source strength the velocities and pressure at centroid of each panel can be easily determined malik et al 2013 as bwb ug is a complex 3d shape therefore numerical method are required to estimate accurate wave force results in this paper ansys hydrodynamic diffraction hd and hydrodynamic time response htr modules based on panel method is used to calculate wave forces and moment on ug long wavelength airy waves with small wave height and steepness are considered in deep water a series of simulations is performed in ansys hd and htr modules for a variety ug depths and pitch angles and wave amplitudes and frequencies the wave force and moment result obtained from simulations are fitted using matlab curve fitting tool to derive their analytical formulations the wave force and moment analytical formulations are coupled with ug motion dynamic equations to analyze the effects of waves on ug dynamic stability and navigation 2 motion model 2 1 problem description and coordinates

with mass m the position r p of sliding mass actuators m m can be changed with respect to body frame o xyz to change center of gravity cg position a variable ballast mass actuator m b fixed at center of buoyancy cb is used to change net buoyancy by modulating inside water mass the total vehicle mass is m v m h m m m b where m h is the uniformly distributed hull mass the position r c g of the mass weighted centroid of the vehicle in body frame o xyz is given by 1 r c g m h r h m m r p m h m b m m as hydrodynamic forces on a ug depend on the velocity and orientation of the ug with respect to fluid a wind frame w xyz is defined to track ug orientation with respect to ug relative velocity through water as shown in fig 3 the wind frame w xyz is defined with its origin at cb and it

components increases with decreasing depth the superposition of f w x c o s θ and f w y s i n θ having small lagging phase difference during upward glide results in increasing the amplitude of surge wave force f w x b during upward glide it is observed that the surge wave force f w x b and its comprising components lags pitch angle the lagging phase difference φsurge is small and its value decreases from t 32 15s and h 10 m to t 67 02s and h 3 3 m with increasing pitch angle the surge wave force amplitude a f w x given by 68 increases heave wave force amplitude a f w y given by 69 decreases c o s θ decreases and s i n θ increases the overlapping of pitch angle and surge wave force f w x b respective maximum and minimum amplitudes results in higher maximum amplitudes of surge wave force f w x b than absolute value of minimum amplitudes resulting in positive mean surge wave force during upward glide due to the higher rising rate of pitch angle maximum amplitude than minimum amplitude and decreasing phase difference φsurge during upward glide the maximum amplitude of surge wave force rises at higher rate than minimum amplitude resulting in an increasing mean surge wave force f w x b the increasing mean surge wave force f w x b increases mean horizontal and consequently increases ug encounter frequency as the pitch angle decreases towards zero from t 68 11s and h 3 m till t 81 45s and h 0 9 m during glide inflection surge wave force amplitude a f w x decreases heave wave force amplitude a f w y increases c o s θ increase and s i n θ decreases resulting in decreasing f w x c o s θ f w y s i n θ and consequently surge wave force f w x b amplitudes the relative smaller decrease of surge wave force f w x b maximum amplitudes than minimum amplitudes results in increasing surge wave force means value from t 67 02s to t 81 45s however it is observed that the decreasing surge wave force amplitudes and increasing lagging phase difference φsurge result in decreasing the rising rate of mean surge wave force fig 25 shows the variation of initial phase angle during glide inflection it can be noticed in fig 25 that the phase angle of surge wave force δ f w x decrease while phase angle of heave wave force δ f w y increase with decreasing pitch angel resulting in decreasing fluctuating frequency of s i n ω t x v w δ f w x and surge wave force f w x and increasing fluctuation frequency of s i n ω t x v w δ f w y and heave wave force f w y it can be noticed in fig 24 that although f w y s i n θ have larger frequency than f w x c o s θ as pitch angle changes direction between t 77 84s and t 85 26s their superposition results in decreasing the fluctuation frequency of surge wave force f w x b due to the larger amplitude of f w x c o s θ as compared to f w y s i n θ however fluctuation frequency of pitch angle increases during glide inflection till minimum depth resulting in increasing phase difference φsurge and consequently a very small value of 180 φsurge between surge wave force f w x b maximum amplitudes and pitch angle minimum amplitudes during downward glide during start of downward glide the initial phase variation and ug acceleration due downward buoyant and mean surge wave forces result in increasing the fluctuating frequencies of s i n ω t x v w δ f w x and s i n ω t x v w δ f w y and consequently increasing the fluctuation frequencies of f w x c o s θ f w y s i n θ and surge wave force f w x b the increasing absolute value of mean pitch angle from zero to a maximum value of 13 85 at time t 94 1s and h 3 6 m result in increasing f w x cos θ f wy sin θ and consequently surge wave force f wxb amplitudes after attaining maximum absolute value the pitch angle absolute values corresponding to maximum and minimum amplitudes start decreasing with increasing depth during downward glide as the negative pitch angle decreases the surge wave force amplitude a f w x given by 68 increases while heave wave force amplitude a f w y given by 69 c o s θ and s i n θ decreases during downward glide due to the small value of φsurge 180 the minimum amplitude of pitch angle overlaps with maximum amplitude of surge wave force f w x b and its components while the maximum amplitude of pitch angle overlaps with minimum amplitude of surge wave force f w x b and its components which results in higher maximum amplitudes of f w x c o s θ f w y s i n θ and surge wave force f w x b as compared to minimum amplitudes and consequently yields positive mean value along downward glide path as the absolute value of mean pitch angle decreases with increasing depth during downward glide the amplitudes and mean values of surge wave force decreases resulting in decreasing mean horizontal velocity and fluctuation frequency of ug 5 1 2 heave wave force in order to analyze the variation of heave wave force with pitch angle along the glide path the heave wave force f w y b calculated in body frame o xyz along with its comprising components i e f w x s i n θ and f w y c o s θ as given by 98 and pitch angle are shown in fig 26 98 f w y b f w x s i n θ f w y c o s θ it can be noticed in fig 26 that the smaller amplitude of surge wave force f w x compared to heave wave f w y and smaller value of s i n θ due to small pitch angle 9 to 17 result in a very small amplitude of f w x s i n θ compared to the amplitude f w y c o s θ and their superposition result in decreasing amplitude of the heave wave forces f w y b due to their almost anti phase nature along the glide path however due to smaller amplitude of f w x s i n θ compared to f w y c o s θ the amplitude and fluctuation frequency of heave wave force f w y b is almost same as f w y c o s θ it is observed that the value of φheave 180 decreases till glide inflection depth and then increases till minimum depth where φheave is the lagging phase difference of heave wave force from pitch angle due to the small value of φheave 180 the amplitude of pitch angle below mean value overlap with positive amplitude of heave wave force f w y b and the amplitude of pitch angle above mean value overlap with the negative amplitude of heave wave force f w y b for most of fluctuating response time as the pitch angle decreases the heave wave force f w y amplitude given by 69 and c o s θ increase due to the overlapping of heave wave force f w y b maximum amplitudes with pitch angle minimum amplitude the maximum amplitude of heave wave force f w y b attains higher value than absolute value of minimum amplitude resulting in a positive mean heave wave force along the upward glide path due to the higher rising rate of maximum amplitude of pitch angle resulting in an increasing mean pitch angle along the upward glide path and decreasing value of φheave 180 the difference between maximum and minimum amplitudes of heave wave force increases resulting in increasing mean heave wave force the decreasing the pitch angle toward zero during the start of glide inflection result in decreasing s i n θ and f w x given by 68 and increasing c o s θ and f w y given by 69 which result in heave wave force f w y b almost having same amplitude and fluctuating frequency as f w y c o s θ due to very small amplitude of very small amplitude of f w x s i n θ the amplitudes of heave wave force f w y b increases with decreasing depth and pitch angle toward zero however it is observed that the increasing value of φheave 180 till minimum depth result in larger increase in minimum amplitude compared to maximum amplitude and consequently decreasing the mean heave wave force as the mean pitch angle changes directions at t 80 5s and h 0 9 m the amplitudes of heave wave force f w y b decrease as the depth and absolute values of pitch angle increases during downward glide however the negative pitch angle results in higher heave wave force minimum amplitude than maximum amplitude resulting in negative mean heave wave force the absolute value of downward mean heave wave force increases in downward direction till the mean pitch angle increase to maximum absolute value of 13 85 as the ug reaches h 3 6 m at t 94 1s the increasing heave wave force initial phase angle δ f w y as given by 84 with decreasing pitch angle results in increasing the fluctuation frequency of heave wave force f w y b from 1 154 rad s at t 69 38s and h 2 66 m during upward glide to 1 17 rad s at t 90 97s and h 2 6 m during downward glide after attaining maximum values the ug pitch angle absolute values corresponding to maximum and minimum amplitudes and mean start decreasing with increasing depth during downward glide the higher fluctuation frequency of heave wave force during glide inflection results in smaller value of φheave 180 during downward glide the overlapping of heave wave force f w y b minimum amplitude with minimum absolute value of pitch angle results in higher minimum heave wave force amplitude than maximum amplitude and consequently resulting in negative mean heave wave force during downward glide with increasing depth and the pitch angle amplitudes and mean absolute values the amplitudes of heave wave force f w y b decreases while the difference between minimum and maximum heave wave force f w y b amplitudes decrease resulting in decreasing mean heave wave force during downward glide 5 1 3 pitch wave moment fig 27 shows the pitch wave moment m w z and pitch angle fluctuating amplitudes and mean values along the glide path it can be noticed that the pitch wave moment m w z and pitch angle are anti phase with small value of 180 φpitch between pitch wave moment m w z maximum amplitude and pitch angle minimum amplitude where φpitch is phase difference between pitch wave moment and pitch angle as pitch angle decreases the pith wave moment m w z amplitude given by 70 increases due to smaller 180 φpitch the pitch wave moment m w z maximum amplitude overlap with pitch angle minimum amplitude and pitch wave moment m w z minimum amplitude overlap with pitch angle maximum amplitude which result in higher maximum pitch wave moment m w z amplitude than minimum amplitude and consequently results in a positive mean pitch wave moment along the upward glide path due to increasing pitch angle values corresponding to maximum and minimum amplitudes and decreasing depth till glide inflection the maximum and minimum pitch wave moment amplitudes and their difference increases resulting in increasing mean pitch wave moment during the glide inflection although the actuators adjustment due to glide inflections completes from 68 11 s to 80 11 due to inertia of ug the mean pitch angle decreases to zero at t 80 5s and then starts increasing in downward direction till t 94 1s it is observed that amplitudes of pitch wave moment m w z increases till minimum depth due to decreasing depth and pitch angle however due to increasing value of 180 φpitch till minimum depth the increase in pitch wave moment minimum amplitude is greater than increase in maximum amplitudes resulting in decreasing mean pitch wave moment the increase in pitch wave moment m w z amplitude with decreasing pitch angle from zero to a minimum value of 13 85 till t 94 1s as given by 70 reduces the rate of decline of pitch wave moment amplitudes with increasing depth during downward glide the overlapping of pitch wave moment m w z maximum amplitude with pitch angle minimum amplitude results in greater the pitch wave moment m w z maximum amplitude than minimum amplitude and consequently positive mean pitch wave moment during downward glide the increasing phase angle as given by 85 with decreasing pitch angle results in increasing fluctuating frequency of pitch wave moment δ m w z during glide inflection the increasing depth during downward glide results in decreasing pitch wave moment m w z amplitudes and consequently the difference between maximum and minimum amplitudes resulting in decreasing mean pitch wave moment 5 2 the influence of wave frequency in order to analyze the effects of wave frequency ω on the dynamic behavior and navigation of ug the ug is simulated in waves and without waves for four wave frequencies ω of 0 57 1 04 1 51 and 1 99 radians per seconds the design glide speed v d of ug is 0 5 m s and the wave amplitude ɑ is selected as 0 2 m the glider is simulated for two glides with maximum depth of 30 m when the ug reaches a depth of 2 m during upward glide the glide inflection starts to change the sliding mass position r p x from 14 8 mm to 14 8 mm and net buoyancy from 18 15 n to 18 15 n in 12 s changing pitch angle and vertical velocity y from positive to negative values fig 28 shows the trajectory of the glide path for four wave frequencies and without wave case it can be noticed that deviation of ug from without wave glide increases with increasing wave frequency and decreasing depth it can be noticed that the total horizontal covered distance for combined upward and downward glides is greater in wave case than without wave case and its value increases with increasing wave frequency table 4 shows the horizontal covered distance x time required to complete each glide and minimum attained depth of ug for the four selected wave frequencies and without wave case the horizontal distance covered during upward glide till the glide inflection depth of 2 m is nearly same for all wave frequencies and without wave case the glide inflection is considered as start of downward glide that results in more horizontal distance during downward glide than upward glide due to additional distance covered during glide inflection during downward glide the horizontal distance covered in wave case is greater than without wave case and its value increases with increasing wave frequency it can also be noticed in table 4 that the ug takes less time in wave case to complete glide than without wave case and its value increases with increasing wave frequency the ug takes more time during downward glide due to the additional time taken during glide inflection fig 28 shows that the minimum depth attained by the ug in wave case is smaller than without wave case and its value decreases with increasing wave frequency fig 29 compares the fluctuating surge wave force f w x b and the horizontal velocities v x responses of ug for the selected four wave frequencies from a depth of 7 m during upward glide to the depth 7 m during downward glide fig 30 compare maximum amplitude and mean values of surge wave forces f w x b and the horizontal velocities v x for selected four wave frequencies from depth of 10 m during the upward till depth of 10 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 29 that the higher that wave frequency the higher surge wave force f w x b and corresponding horizontal velocities v x fluctuating amplitudes mean values and fluctuating frequencies fig 30 shows that the depth of wave base decreases and the rate of rise of surge wave force maximum amplitudes and mean values increase with increasing wave frequency as a result although the ug starts experiencing surge wave force at smaller depth for higher wave frequencies compared to the lower wave frequencies the higher rising rate results in attaining higher maximum amplitude and mean surge wave forces with increasing wave frequency it can be noticed that the rising rate of horizontal velocity demonstrates same behavior as the excitation surge wave force till glide inflection with decreasing pitch angle during glide inflection the maximum and mean surge wave forces first increase then decreases till pitch angel become zero at minimum depth then increase again as the pitch increases in downward direction and consequently decrease as the rate of pitch angle variation decreases and depth of ug increases the mean surge wave force first decreases and then increases as the ug changes direction the wave frequency has almost no effect on the variation behavior of mean and maximum surge wave forces during glide inflection and mainly effect the rate of variation and magnitudes of mean and maximum surge wave forces the higher the wave frequency the higher the rate of variation and maximum values attained by mean and maximum surge wave forces during glide inflection during glide inflection the combined effect of the increasing mean surge wave force with increasing wave frequency and decreasing net buoyancy results in decreasing values of mean horizontal velocity for smaller wave frequencies of 0 57 and 1 04 rad s and increasing values for higher wave frequencies of 1 51 and 1 99 rad s till minimum depth however due to increasing amplitudes and mean values of surge wave force and net downward buoyant force the ug horizontal velocity amplitudes and mean increase for all selected wave frequencies the rate of variation and magnitudes of amplitude and mean horizontal velocity increases with increasing wave frequency during glide inflection the mean and maximum surge wave forces and the corresponding horizontal velocities decrease with increasing depth and the rates of decline increases with increasing wave frequency during downward glide fig 31 compares the surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuating frequencies during upward and downward glides for all wave frequencies due to the forward speed the surge wave force and horizontal velocity have higher excitation frequencies than selected wave frequencies and its value increases with increasing wave frequency the surge wave force and horizontal velocity frequencies first increase then decrease and subsequently increase due to mean horizontal velocity and pitch angle variation during glide inflection and finally decreases with decreasing mean horizontal velocity during downward glide it is observed that the relative decline of fluctuation frequencies during glide inflection increase with increasing wave frequency however due to initial phase variation with changing pitch angle the decline in surge wave force fluctuation frequency is larger than horizontal velocity for all wave frequencies fig 32 shows the time lag of fluctuating horizontal velocity from the excitation surge wave force during upward glide and downward glides respectively it can be noticed that the higher the selected wave frequency the smaller is the time lag during upward and downward glides the lag time first decreases due to increasing surge wave force amplitude with decreasing depth then rise and subsequently decline near minimum depth and then slowly increases with decreasing depth during downward glide the variation behavior of lag time is almost same for all wave frequencies however the higher the wave frequency the smaller is the rise of lag time rise during glide inflection fig 33 shows the excitation heave wave force and vertical velocity response of ug along the glide path from a depth of 7 m during upward glide to the depth 7 m during downward glide fig 34 compares maximum amplitude and mean values of heave wave force f w y b and vertical velocity v y for selected wave frequencies from depth of 10 m during the upward glide till depth of 10 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 33 that the heave wave forces f w y b and vertical velocity v y amplitudes and fluctuating frequencies increases with increasing wave frequency and decreasing depth the difference in magnitudes of ug mean and steady state vertical velocities are very small as compared to ug mean and steady state horizontal velocities for all selected wave frequencies it is observed that although the mean surge and heave wave forces magnitudes are comparable the comparatively bigger value of ug vertical additional mass factor 30 4 than horizontal additional mass factor 0 265 results in smaller increase in vertical velocity of the ug compared to horizontal velocity and consequently resulting in smaller difference in magnitudes of ug mean and steady state vertical velocities it can be noticed in fig 34 that the depth of wave base decreases while the rate of rise of mean and maximum heave wave forces increases with increasing wave frequency the rate of rise of vertical velocity maximum amplitudes with depth demonstrates the same behavior as the heave wave force for all wave frequencies till glide inflection depth during upward glide during glide inflection the heave wave force amplitude increases till minimum depth and then decreases as the pitch angle decreases in the start of downward glide the mean heave wave force first increases then decreases and attain minimum value in downward direction and then increases as the pitch angle variation due to glide inflection decreases and depth of ug increase the increasing wave frequency have almost no effect on the variation behavior of heave wave force mean and maximum amplitude during glide inflection and mainly affect its magnitude and rate of variation during glide inflection the mean vertical velocity first decreases to zero and changes direction then increases after attaining minimum value the maximum absolute values attained by mean vertical velocity increases with increasing wave frequency during glide inflection the magnitude of vertical velocity maximum amplitude increases with increasing wave frequency during glide inflection the heave wave force and horizontal velocity maximum amplitudes decreases with increasing depth during downward glide the mean heave wave force and vertical velocity remains negative and their values increases with increasing depth during downward glide as the heave wave force mean values and amplitudes become nearly zero for all wave frequencies at depth below wave base the amplitudes of vertical velocity decreases to zero while its mean values attain steady state vertical velocity values fig 35 shows the heave wave force and vertical velocity fluctuation frequencies along the glide path during upward and downward glides due to mean horizontal velocity of ug the heave wave force and corresponding vertical velocities have higher fluctuation frequencies than selected wave frequencies it can be noticed that the fluctuation frequency increases due to increasing mean horizontal velocity with decreasing depth and decreases after attaining maximum value during downward glide the heave wave force and vertical velocity fluctuation frequencies increases with increasing wave frequency and the higher the selected wave frequency the higher is the rate of variation of fluctuation frequencies with depth above wave base fig 36 shows the time lag of vertical velocity response from the excitation heave wave force during an upward and downward glides respectively it can be noticed that the time lag decreases with increasing wave frequency the time lag decreases till minimum depth for all wave frequencies the increasing heave wave force amplitude and excitation frequency and decreasing pitch moment due to net buoyant force and inertia of ug the rate of rise of vertical velocity fluctuating frequency increases and consequently the rate of decline of time lag increases during glide inflection the higher the wave frequency the smaller is decline in time lag as the rate of pitch angle variation due to glide inflection decreases and depth of ug increase the lag time increases during downward glide for all wave frequencies fig 37 compares the maximum amplitude and mean value of pitch wave moments and corresponding pitch angular velocities from a depth of 10 m during upward glide till depth of 10 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 34 that the maximum amplitude of pitch wave moment increase till minimum depth while the mean pitch wave moment increases with decreasing depth till glide inflection and then decreases till minimum depth the rate of variation of maximum amplitude and mean value of pitch wave moment increases while depth of wave base decreases as the wave frequency increase the higher the wave frequency the larger is the attained value of maximum amplitude of pitch wave moment at minimum depth the slope of mean pitch wave moment varies from decreasing to increasing with increasing wave frequency during the start of glide inflection and finally the mean pitch wave moment decreases for all wave frequencies the rate of rise of pitch angular velocity maximum amplitudes with depth demonstrates the same behavior as the maximum amplitude of pitch wave moment till glide inflection depth with increasing wave frequency the mean pitch angular velocity varies from negative to positive values and the slope of mean pitch angular velocity increases from negative to positive with increasing wave frequency along upward glide path the rising rate of maximum pitch angular velocity decreases during glide inflection and the decrease in rising rate increases with decreasing wave frequency the mean pitch angular velocity decreases as the ug rotate in clockwise direction and attains maximum absolute value at minimum depth the higher the wave frequency the smaller is the rate of decline of mean pitch angular velocity as the depth of ug start increasing during downward glide the pitch wave moment amplitude decrease while the slope of mean pitch wave moment varies from decreasing to increasing with increasing wave frequency and finally the mean pitch wave moment decreases for all wave frequencies as the pitch angle decreases to its minimum equilibrium value due to glide inflection during downward glide the mean pitch angular velocity increases the rate of rise of mean pitch angular velocity with depth increases as the wave frequency decreases the mean pitch angular velocities fluctuate with very small amplitude about zero value for all wave frequencies and steadily approach to zero as the mean pitch angle variation due to attitude adjustment dies out the slope of maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity varies from increasing to decreasing as the wave frequency increases and finally maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity decreases with increasing depth for all wave frequencies fig 38 shows the ug fluctuating pitch angular response due to excitation pitch wave moment along the glide path from a depth of 7 m during upward glide to the depth 7 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 37 that the amplitudes of pitch angle increase with decreasing depth it can also be noticed that the ug pitch angle have higher absolute mean value than steady state pitch angle absolute values during upward and downward glide and its value increases with decreasing depth for all wave frequencies it is noticed that the pitch angle and pitch angular velocities are at phase angle of 90 with each other fig 39 shows the mean and maximum values of pitch angle during upward and downward glides the maximum amplitude and mean values of pitch angle first increase with decreasing depth then changes direction during glide inflection and attain maximum absolute value in downward direction and then increase with small fluctuations and finally become equal to with wave pitch angle values at depths below wave base it can be noticed that the rate of variation of pitch angle mean and maximum values with depth increases as the wave frequency increases in this section the influence of wave frequencies was analyzed on the glide path and dynamics characteristics of ug the ug was simulated during upward glide glide inflection and downward glide for four selected wave frequencies it was observed from results of motion simulation that the surge and heave wave forces and pitch wave moment have fluctuating amplitudes with mean values the rate of rise of wave forces moment amplitudes and mean values and ug velocities increases with decreasing depth while the depth of wave base decreases with increasing wave frequency the increasing rise rate resulted in higher attained values of wave forces moment and corresponding ug velocities at minimum depth for higher wave frequencies compared with smaller wave frequencies the glide path was significantly affected by wave forces moment during glide inflection due to the mean wave force and moment it was observed that the higher the wave frequency the larger is the deviation of ug from without wave glide path it was also observed that horizontal distance covered and the glide time for combined upward and downward glides increases while the minimum attained depth during glide inflection decreases with increasing wave frequency the excitation frequency of wave forces moment and ug response increases with increasing wave frequency it was noticed that the ug response lag the excitation wave force moment and the lag time decreases with increasing wave frequency 5 3 the influence of wave amplitude in order to analyze the effects of wave amplitude on the glide path and dynamic characteristics of ug the ug is simulated in waves for four wave amplitudes of 0 2 0 25 0 3 and 0 35 m the design glide speed v d of ug along the glide path is 0 75 m s and the wave frequency ω of 1 04 rad s is selected in all simulations the glider is simulated for two glides with maximum and minimum depths of 15 and 3 m respectively when the ug reaches to a depth of 3 m the glide inflection takes place the length of glide inflection is selected as 12 s the trajectory of the glide path for four wave amplitudes is shown in fig 40 it can be noticed that deviation from without wave glide path increases with increasing wave amplitude and maximum deviation occurs at minimum depth near sea surface it can be noticed in fig 40 that the combined horizontal covered distance during upward and downward glides is greater in wave case than without wave case and its value increases as wave amplitude increases table 5 shows the covered horizontal distance and time required to complete each glide and the minimum attained depth for the four selected wave amplitudes and without wave case it can be noticed in table 5 that the horizontal distance covered during upward glide till glide inflection depth is smaller in wave case than without wave case and its value decreases as the slope of glide path increases with increasing wave amplitude and the ug attains glide inflection depth for smaller horizontal distance covered due to the additional distance covered during glide inflection the horizontal distance covered during downward glide is greater than upward glide and its value increases with increasing wave amplitude table 5 shows that the ug takes less time in wave case to complete glide than without wave case for all selected wave amplitudes and the glide time decreases as the wave amplitudes increases due to additional time taken during glide inflection the ug takes more time during downward glide than upward glide the minimum depth attained by the ug in wave case is smaller than without wave case for all selected wave amplitudes fig 41 shows the ug fluctuating surge wave forces and horizontal velocities of ug along the glide path from a depth of 7 m during upward glide to the depth 7 m during downward glide for the selected four wave amplitudes fig 42 shows the mean and maximum surge wave forces and horizontal velocities of ug during upward glide and downward glides it can be noticed in fig 41 that the mean horizontal velocity of ug is higher than design steady state glide speed of 0 75 m s for all selected wave amplitudes it can also be noticed that the surge wave force have almost similar fluctuating response near minimum depth for wave amplitudes of 0 2 m and 0 3 m similarly the wave amplitudes of 0 25 m and 0 35 m have almost similar fluctuating response near minimum depth it can be noticed in fig 42 that the surge wave force and corresponding horizontal velocity maximum amplitude first increases till glide inflection then decreases and subsequently increases due to glide inflection and then decrease as the depth of ug increases during downward glide the mean surge wave force continues to increase for all selected wave amplitude and then decreases after attaining maximum value during glide inflection the mean horizontal velocity demonstrate almost same behavior as maximum amplitude of horizontal velocity along the glide path due to the similar fluctuating responses of wave amplitudes of 0 2 m and 0 3 m their variation behavior is almost same similarly the variation behavior for wave amplitudes of 0 25 m and 0 35 m is almost same along the glide path the wave amplitude also affects the magnitudes and rate of variation of maximum amplitude and mean values of surge wave force and horizontal velocity the higher the wave amplitude the higher the magnitudes and slower the rate of variation of maximum amplitude and mean values of surge wave force and horizontal velocity with depth fig 43 shows the surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies for the four selected wave amplitudes during upward and downward glides it can be seen that the surge wave forces and horizontal velocities have higher excitation frequencies than selected wave frequency of 1 04 rad s for all wave amplitudes and their values first increase with increasing mean horizontal velocity during upward glide then decrease and subsequently increase due to glide inflection and then decrease with increasing depth during downward glide due to the increasing mean horizontal velocity with increasing wave amplitude the higher the wave amplitude the higher surge wave forces and horizontal velocities fluctuation frequencies during upward and downward glides during glide inflection the decline of horizontal velocity fluctuation frequency is less than surge wave force fluctuation frequency due to similar fluctuating behavior of surge wave forces for wave amplitudes of 0 2 m and 0 3 m and wave amplitudes of 0 25 m and 0 35 m respectively their corresponding horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies demonstrate similar behavior fig 44 shows the time lag of horizontal velocity response from the surge wave excitation force during an upward and downward glides it can be noticed that the lag time first decreases till glide inflection then increase and subsequently decrease during glide inflection and then steadily increases with decreasing depth after small fluctuation the lag time is almost same for all wave amplitudes during start of upward glide due to the similar wave frequencies and increases with decreasing wave amplitude till glide inflection during upward glide and during downward glide when the effects of pitch angle variation due to glide inflection decreases during glide inflection the synchronized decline of surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies as shown in fig 43 result in smaller rise and larger subsequent decline of lag time for wave amplitude of 0 25 m as compare to other wave amplitudes the more synchronized the variation of fluctuating frequencies and the smaller the difference between fluctuating frequencies the smaller is the lag time fig 45 shows the fluctuating pitch wave moment on ug along the glide path from a depth of 7 m during upward glide to the depth 7 m during downward glide fig 46 shows the mean and maximum pitch wave moment from depth of 10 m during the upward glide till depth of 10 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 45 that the pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocities fluctuating amplitude and excitation frequencies increases as the selected wave amplitude increases and depth of ug decreases it can also be noticed that mean pitch angular velocity is almost equal to without wave pitch angular velocity value of zero during upward glide till glide inflection and during downward glide after the effects of glide inflection dies out fig 46 shows that the maximum amplitudes and mean values of pitch wave moments increase during upward glide and after attaining maximum values during glide inflection decreases as the depth of ug increases during downward glide for all wave amplitudes the values corresponding to maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity along first increases then decreases and subsequently increases during glide inflection and then decreases as the depth of ug increases the variation law of maximum amplitudes and mean values of pitch wave moments and maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity along the glide path is almost same for all wave amplitudes however their maximum amplitude increases with increasing wave amplitude the maximum amplitudes and mean values of pitch wave moment and maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocities corresponding to a particular depth almost linearly increases as the selected wave amplitude increases during upward glide till glide inflection and during downward glide after the effect of glide inflection dies out however their rate of variation of increases with decreasing wave amplitude during glide inflection the pitch angular velocity has very small magnitude and its rising rate increases with increasing wave amplitude till glide inflection the mean pitch angular velocity first decreases due to glide inflection and then steadily increases towards zero value after undergoing small fluctuations during downward glide fig 47 show the fluctuation frequency of pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity for all selected wave amplitudes during upward and downward glides it can be noticed in fig 47 that the pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity fluctuation frequencies increases till glide inflection depth during glide inflection the rising rate of pitch wave moment and corresponding pitch angular velocity frequencies increases with decreasing pitch angle for all wave amplitudes the pitch wave moment frequencies continue to increase during start of the downward glide and decreases after attaining maximum values the slope of the pitch angular velocity fluctuation frequencies varies from decreasing to increasing with increasing wave amplitude during the start of the downward glide the pitch angular velocities frequencies decreases and subsequently increases for wave amplitudes 0 2 m and 0 25 m and then the pitch angular velocities frequencies decrease for all wave amplitudes with increasing depth it can be noticed that the smaller the wave amplitude the smaller is the fluctuation frequency magnitude and more unsteady are the variation of pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity frequencies along the glide path fig 48 shows the time lag of pitch angular velocities response from the excitation pitch wave moment during upward and downward glides for selected wave amplitudes it can be noticed that the difference between lag times is small till glide inflection for all wave amplitudes and increases due to the higher frequency of pitch angular velocity than pitch wave moment during glide inflection the slope of the lag time varies from increasing to decreasing during the start of downward glide the lag time continues to decrease for wave amplitude of 0 35 m as the fluctuation frequency of pitch angular velocity is higher than pitch wave moment and their difference increases during the start of the downward glide however the lag time for other wave amplitudes first rises then decreases till depth of 6 m and finally increases for wave amplitudes the higher the wave amplitude the smaller is the rise in lag time during the start of downward glide the lag time increases with decreasing wave amplitude during downward glide fig 49 shows the mean and maximum pitch angles of ug from depth of 10 m during upward to a depth of 10 m during downward glide it can be noticed in fig 49 that the amplitude and mean values of ug pitch angle increases during upward glide till glide inflection then changes direction and attain maximum absolute in downward glide and then their absolutes values increase during downward glide the larger the wave amplitude the larger are mean and maximum pitch angles and the higher is their rate of rise with depth during upward glide however the mean and maximum pitch angles for different wave amplitudes fluctuate about each other during downward glide the larger the wave amplitude the higher are the fluctuations in pitch angle during downward glide in this section the influence of wave amplitudes was analyzed on the glide path and dynamics characteristics of ug the glider was simulated in during upward glide glide inflection and downward glide for four selected wave amplitudes it was observed that the higher the wave amplitude the higher are the amplitudes and mean values of wave forces moments and ug response the higher the wave amplitude the higher is the deviation of ug from without wave glide path for combined upward and downward glides the horizontal covered distance increases while the time to complete combined glide and the minimum attained depth decreases as the wave amplitudes increases the mean wave forces moment increases glide speeds and encounter frequencies of ug the higher wave amplitude the higher is the encounter fluctuation frequency of ug 5 4 the influence of ug speed the ug is simulated in waves and without waves for four steady state glide speeds v d of 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 m s to examine the effects of waves forces on ug dynamics for different ug speeds in order to achieve the design glide speed the sliding mass and it vertical displacement r p y is kept constant while its longitudinal displacement r p x is varied for each steady state glide speed ballast mass is changed to provide the net buoyancy for each steady state design glide speed the details for net buoyancy adjustment and sliding mass position for each design glide speed are detailed in table 5 the angular frequency ω and amplitudes ɑ of selected wave are 1 04 rad s and 0 25 m respectively the glider is simulated for two glides with maximum and minimum depths of 25 and 2 5 m respectively the length of glide inflection is selected as 12 s the trajectory of the glide path for four glide speeds is shown in fig 50 it can be noticed that the horizontal distance covered during combined upward and downward glides in wave case is more than without wave case and its value increases with increasing glide speed for both wave and without wave cases table 6 shows the horizontal distance covered time required to complete glide and minimum attained depth for wave and without wave case due to the steeper glide path the ug attains the desired glide inflection depth for less horizontal distance covered during upward glide in wave case compared to without wave case it can also be noticed that the horizontal distance covered is almost same for all glide speeds during upward glide in both wave and without wave cases however due to additional distance covered during glide inflection the ug covers more horizontal distance during downward glide than upward glide for both wave and without wave due to mean wave forces and moments the ug covers more horizontal distance in wave case compared to without wave case and its value increases with increasing glide speed it can be noticed in table 6 that the time required to complete upward and downward glides is smaller in wave case compared to without wave case and its value decreases with increasing glide speeds due to additional time taken during glide inflection the time required to complete upward glide is smaller than downward glide it can also be noticed that the higher velocities during glide inflection results in greater distance covered due to inertia and the minimum attained depth in wave case than without wave case and the minimum attained depth decreases with increasing glide speed in both wave and without wave case fig 51 shows the mean and maximum surge wave forces and vertical velocities from depth of 10 m during the upward glide to a depth of 10 m downward glide fig 51 shows that the surge wave force maximum amplitude first increases till glide inflection then decreases and consequently increases during glide inflection and finally decrease with increasing depth for all wave amplitudes the mean surge wave force continues to increase till minimum depth and then decreases with increasing depth it can be noticed that the smaller the glide speed the higher is the maximum amplitude and mean values of surge wave force till glide inflection the surge wave force maximum amplitude for selected glide speeds fluctuates about each other during glide inflection and downward glide however it is observed that smaller the glide speed along the glide path the higher are the pitch angle and surge wave force maximum amplitude variation with depth during glide inflection and downward glide the difference between mean surge wave forces for selected glide speeds is very small during downward glide the maximum amplitudes of horizontal velocity first increase then decreases and subsequently increases during glide inflection and then decreases with increasing depth the higher glide speed the higher is magnitude and rate of variation of the horizontal velocity maximum amplitude with depth along the glide path the mean horizontal velocity increases till minimum depth the slope of mean horizontal velocity varies increasing to decreasing from the start of glide inflection till minimum depth as the ug change direction at minimum depth the mean horizontal velocity first increases and then decreases with increasing depth during downward glide the higher the glide speed the higher is the mean horizontal velocity along the glide path fig 52 shows the surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies along the upward and downward glide paths respectively it can be noticed the ug the surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies first increase till minimum depth then decreases and subsequently increases during glide inflection and then decreases with increasing depth during downward glide as the glide speed increase the surge wave force and horizontal velocity fluctuation frequencies increases while rate variation with depth decreases during upward glide till glide inflection and during downward glide after the effect of glide inflection decrease it can also be noticed that the decline in fluctuation frequencies of horizontal velocity is less than surge wave force during glide inflection fig 53 shows the time lag of horizontal velocity response from the surge wave excitation force during upward and downward glides the lag time first decreases with decreasing depth then increases due to the larger decline in frequency of surge wave force compared to horizontal velocity during glide inflection subsequently decreases due to large increase in frequency of surge wave force compared to horizontal velocity and then steadily increases with increasing depth during downward glide it can be noticed that the smaller the glide speed the higher is the lag time during upward glide till glide inflection and during downward glide after the effects of glide inflection dies out fig 54 compared the mean and maximum values of heave wave force and vertical velocity during the upward and downward glides it can be noticed in fig 54 that the amplitude of heave wave force increases till minimum depth and then decreases during downward glide the mean heave wave force first increase with decreasing depth then decrease during glide inflection and attain maximum absolute value in downward direction and then its absolute value decreases with increasing depth for all glide speeds the glide speed has very small effect on the magnitude and rate of variation of maximum heave wave force the mean heave wave force increases with decreasing glide speed till glide inflection during upward glide and till the effects of glide inflection decrease during downward glide the rate of variation of mean heave wave force with depth increases with decreasing glide speed during glide inflection the maximum amplitude of vertical velocity first increases with decreasing depth and after attaining maximum value during glide inflection decreases with increasing depth the vertical velocity maximum amplitude rising rate during upward glide increases with decreasing glide speed and its declining rate decreases with decreasing glide speed during downward glide the slope of mean vertical velocity varies from increasing to decreasing with increasing glide speed during upward glide till glide inflection the mean vertical velocity first decreases and changes direction for all glide speeds during glide inflection then increase after attaining minimum value during downward glide and then become almost constant at depth of 6 m as the pitch angle variation due to glide inflection dies out the magnitudes of maximum and mean vertical velocities increase during upward glide and decrease during downward glide with increasing glide speed fig 55 shows the heave wave force and vertical velocity fluctuation frequencies along the glide path during upward and downward glides the heave wave force frequencies increase with decreasing depth and after attaining maximum value during glide inflection decreases with increasing depth the vertical velocity frequency increases till minimum depth for all glide speeds the slope of the vertical velocity first decreases during the start of downward glide then varies from decreasing to increasing with increasing glide speed and then decreases for all glide speeds it can be noticed that the higher the glide speed the higher is fluctuation frequency of heave wave force and vertical velocity along the glide path it can be noticed that the heave wave force and vertical velocity have almost same frequencies till glide inflection however the higher rising rate of vertical velocity frequency than heave wave force result in higher vertical velocity frequency at minimum depth the declining vertical velocity frequency during the start of downward glide results in almost same fluctuation frequencies of heave wave force and vertical velocity during downward glide fig 56 shows the time lag of vertical velocity response from the excitation heave wave force during an upward and downward glides it can be noticed in fig 56 that the lag time first decreases with decreasing depth during upward glide and after attaining minimum value during glide inflection increases with increasing depth during downward glide the lag time increases with decreasing glide speed along the glide path till glide inflection during upward glide the slope of lag time varies from decreasing to increasing as the glide speed increases during glide inflection the rate of decline of lag time increases with decreasing glide speed till minimum depth after small fluctuations during the start of downward glide the slope of the lag time first decreases with increasing glide speed till depth of 4 5 m and then increases for all glide speeds it can also be noticed that lag time during downward glide is smaller than upward glide due to higher fluctuation frequency of vertical velocity than heave wave force during glide inflection fig 57 compares the mean and maximum pitch wave moment during the upward glide from depth of 10 m till minimum depth and downward glide from minimum depth till depth of 10 m it can be noticed in fig 57 that the maximum amplitudes of pitch wave moment increases with decreasing depth and after attaining maximum value during glide inflection decreases with increasing depth the mean pitch wave moment first increases with decreasing depth then decreases till minimum depth and consequently increases during glide inflection and then decreases with increasing depth the variation behavior of maximum and mean values of pitch wave moment along the glide path is almost same for all glide speeds the maximum amplitudes of pitch wave moment have almost same values for all glide speeds along glide paths however the mean pitch wave moment increases with decreasing glide speeds the rate of variation of mean pitch wave moment with depth increases with decreasing glide speed the maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity first increases till glide inflection then decreases and consequently increases during glide inflection and then decreases with increasing depth the mean pitch angular velocity have almost constant magnitude till glide inflection then decreases and consequently increase during glide inflection and then steadily approaches zero as the pitch angle variation due to glide inflection dies out it can be noticed in fig 57 that the magnitude of maximum amplitude of pitch angular velocity decreases and magnitude of mean pitch angular velocity increases with increasing glide speed the rates of variation of maximum and mean pitch angular velocities with depth are almost same for all glide speeds till glide inflection the magnitude of maximum and mean pitch angular velocities fluctuate about each other during glide inflection and downward glide however the smaller the glides speed the higher the rate of variation of mean and maximum pitch angular velocities with depth fig 58 shows the pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity fluctuation frequencies along the glide path during upward and downward glides the pitch wave moment frequencies increase with decreasing depth and after attaining maximum value during glide inflection decreases with increasing depth the pitch angular velocity frequency increases till minimum depth for all glide speeds the slope of the pitch angular velocity first decreases during the start of downward glide then varies from decreasing to increasing with increasing glide speed and then decreases for all glide speeds it can be noticed that the higher the glide speed the higher is fluctuation frequency and smaller is the rate of variation with depth of pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity along the glide path it can be noticed that the pitch wave moment and pitch angular velocity have almost same frequencies till glide inflection however the higher rising rate of pitch angular velocity frequency than pitch wave moment result in large pitch angular velocity frequency at minimum depth fig 59 shows the time lag of pitch angular velocity response from the pitch wave moment during an upward and downward glides it can be noticed in fig 59 that the lag time first decreases with decreasing depth during upward glide and after attaining minimum value at minimum depth first increases then steadily decreases till depth of about 5 m and then increases with increasing depth during downward glide the glide speed has no effect on variation law and affects magnitude and rate of variation with depth the lag time increases with decreasing glide speed along the glide path till glide inflection during upward glide the slope of lag time varies from decreasing to increasing as the glide speed increases during glide inflection the declining and subsequent rising rate of lag time with depth increases with decreasing glide speed the rate of lag time variation with first increases during decline and then decreases during rise with increasing glide speed along downward glide path fig 60 shows the mean and maximum pitch angles of ug from depth of 10 m during the upward glide till depth of 10 m during the downward glide fig 60 shows that the amplitude and mean values of ug pitch angle increases as the glide speed of ug decreases during upward glide it can also be noticed in fig 60 that the amplitude and mean values of ug pitch angle increases with decreasing glide speed during upward glide till glide inflection depth the maximum and mean values of pitch angle fluctuate about each other during glide inflection and downward glide the smaller the glide speed the higher are the variation of mean and maximum pitch angle with depth during glide inflection and downward glide in this section the influence of glide speed was analyzed on the glide path and dynamics characteristics of ug the glider was simulated during upward glide glide inflection and downward glide for four selected glide speed it was observed that the higher the selected glide speed the higher the hydrodynamic wave force as compared to the wave forces and the smaller is the deviation of ug from designed glide path it is also observed the encounter fluctuation frequency of ug increases while the lag time decreases with increasing glide speed the amplitudes of horizontal and vertical velocities increase while the amplitude of pitch angular velocity decreases with increasing glide speed however due to the higher fluctuation of pitch angle during downward glide the amplitude of ug velocities fluctuate about each other for selected glide speeds during downward glide 5 5 the influence of irregular wave in this paper the frequency range of irregular wave is 0 5 rad s and it is divided into frequency interval δ ω 0 005 rad s for total interval n 1000 the ug is simulated in sea state 2 and 3 with their significant wave heights of 0 5 m and 1 25 m respectively the glide speed v d is selected as 0 5 m s and glide inflection time of 12 s is selected the ug is simulated from depth of 25 m 3 m depth and back to 25 m fig 61 shows glide path for sea state 2 and 3 and in without wave case it can be noticed that maximum deviation from without wave glide path occurs near sea surface during glide inflection the deviation from without wave glide path is higher for sea state compare to sea state 2 due to mean wave forces the distance covered x for wave case is greater that without wave case figs 62 64 show the variation of surge and heave wave forces and pitch wave moment with time along the glide path the magnitudes of wave forces and moments increases with decreasing depth and become maximum during glide inflection it can be observed that wave forces and moments are greater in sea state 3 compared to sea state 2 due to mean surge and heave wave forces the ug is deviated from steady state glide path figs 65 67 show the variation of horizontal velocity v x vertical velocity v y and pitch angular velocity ω z with time along the glide path it can be noticed in fig 65 that due to mean horizontal wave forces the horizontal velocity v x have greater magnitude than steady state velocity of 0 5 m s in both sea state 2 and 3 however the horizontal velocity v x attain much higher magnitude in sea state 3 compared to sea state 2 due to greater wave forces fig 68 show the variation of pitch angular velocity θ with time it can be noticed that due to higher fluctuating pitch wave moment in sea state 3 the ug pitch angle undergo higher amplitude fluctuations about steady state value as compared to sea state 2 6 conclusion in this paper the process of ocean dynamics is ignored and the influence of head on waves on the dynamic characteristics and navigation of ug are analyzed 1 the wave forces are calculated for different uwg depths pitch angles wave amplitudes and frequencies using panel method analytical formulations are derived for regular and irregular wave forces and moment based on obtained results

20491,in the present study swan wave model is nested with wavewatch 3 to reproduce waves off the central west coast of india using era 5 winds the sensitivity of swan wave model was tested with different wave growth and bottom friction schemes to identify the most suitable scheme for this region the model parameters have been validated with one year buoy measurements among all the four wave growth schemes komen janssen westhuysen and st6 and three friction schemes jonswap collin and madsen considered swan with komen or st6 and jonswap setup performed better in predicting the waves including the high waves during the southwest monsoon model performance has also been tested with high resolution wrf winds and the statistical results showed comparably the same performance as era5 winds the model very well demonstrated the existence of single peaked spectra during the southwest monsoon and double multi peaked spectra due to strong local winds and the swells arriving from the southern ocean during fair moderate weather season hence komen or st6 wave growth with jonswap bottom friction is recommended for the prediction of waves off the central west coast of india using era5 winds keywords swan model wavewatch 3 model era5 data wave growth bottom friction wrf winds 1 introduction the major sources of wave information are from in situ measurements model hindcasts and reanalysis voluntary observing ships vos and remote sensing hithin et al 2015 visual observations of wave parameters from ships vos data have been available along the shipping routes since 1784 however by nature these observations are subjective and there are large unsampled areas due to missing ship routes gulev and grigorieva 2004 satellite altimetry and its recent improvement in resolution as well as data quality are worthwhile but globally the repeat cycle of satellite altimetry for a location varies from 10 days for the topex poseidon satellite mission to 35 days for ers satellites and hence there is a chance of missing extreme events in situ observations are location specific and generally sparse in the coastal regions of the indian ocean unlike the atlantic ocean or the pacific ocean long term time series data of in situ observations are mostly unavailable and hence it is rather difficult to estimate wave climate or extreme sea state accurately without long term time series data also the requirement for such high quality wave data is increasing constantly for the design of offshore structures as well as studying the coastal processes hence we need to depend on numerical modelling based on a spectral concept which is a powerful tool to calculate wave properties accurately for operational use and engineering studies subject to the accuracy of input winds wave propagation within the coastal areas is strongly influenced by coastal morphology its islands bars shoals and channels some of the widely used numerical wave models are wave modelling wam wamdi 1988 wavewatch 3 ww3 the wavewatch iii development group 2019 tolman 2003 and simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 the state of art third generation wave models ww3 and swan represent better the transition between wind seas and swells compared to the former wave models these models use full wave spectra based on the integration of wave action balance equation wam and ww3 are more suitable for global and regional modelling chawla 2007 remya et al 2012 samiksha et al 2012 2015 2012 sandhya et al 2014 strauss et al 2007 umesh et al 2017 umesh and behera 2020 umesh and swain 2018 swan has been extensively validated and widely used across the globe in simulating coastal wave characteristics due to demand in the coastal areas amrutha et al 2016 bhowmick et al 2011 booij et al 1999 brown 2010 kumar et al 2009 mazaheri et al 2013 moeini et al 2012 nikishova et al 2017 parvathy et al 2017 ris et al 1999 samiksha et al 2019 sandhya et al 2014 siadatmousavi et al 2012 swain et al 2019 umesh and swain 2018 wang et al 2004 swan is a sophisticated model with various parameterizations to treat the physical processes with gradual bathymetric variations in the coastal regions more importantly the accuracy of the model output in the nearshore regions is governed by input forcing parameterizations of various source terms and the effect of numeric used several studies tried to propose parameterizations for dissipation source terms donelan and pierson jr 1987 feng and yeli 1992 hasselmann 1974 longuet higgins 1969 polnikov 1994 wamdi 1988 yuan et al 1986 researchers have also evaluated the suitability of different parameterized wave breaking and dissipation formulas for coastal spectral wave transformations zheng et al 2008 another important process is related to bottom friction bottom friction dissipation and nonlinear triad 3 wave interactions are the potentially important processes a study by luo and monbaliu 1994 suggested that the bottom friction and triad interactions are sensitive to local environments in terms of water depth bottom characteristics and wave properties along the west coast of india significant wave heights swh up to 6 m have been reported during the southwest monsoon period kumar et al 2006 in the rest of the period swh will be normally less than 1 5 m kumar and anand 2004 kumar et al 2003 reported that along the indian coast about 60 of the wave spectra are multi peaked and they are single peaked when swh 2 m it was also observed that wave energy spectra generally have more than one peak depending on the generation source and double peaked spectra are mainly swell dominated vethamony et al 2009 found that the co existence of wind seas and pre existing swells create diurnal variations on the resultant waves along the west coast of india during pre monsoon and northeast monsoon glejin et al 2013 reported that swells are present throughout the year off ratnagiri central west coast and swells are dominant during pre monsoon and weak during southwest monsoon due to prevailing strong winds amrutha et al 2016 analysed changes in nearshore waves during the active sea land breeze period off vengurla central west coast and found that peak wave period in a single day varied up to 8s it was also found that reduction in the wave height of wind sea was 20 and that of the swell 10 when waves travelled from 15 m to 5 m water depth the mean wave spectrum showed the predominant swell peak at 0 074 hz both at 15 and 5 m water depths but the wind sea peak shifted from 0 187 to 0 174 hz when waves travelled from 15 m to 5 m water depth dora et al 2018 showed that during the summer monsoon southwest monsoon coastal breeze is absent as monsoon winds dominate and pointed out the importance of having year long time series data for local weather predictions wave characteristics in the nearshore region off vengurla at 15 m water depth revealed that the highest swh was 5 05 m with an annual average swh of 0 93 m and the monthly average peak wave period ranged from 9 4 to 13s amrutha et al 2016 wave characteristics in the shallow waters of the central west coast of india are explored mostly using measurements which are time and space bounded several coastal development projects are proposed in the central west coast of india and that may demand wave climate information for which long term time series data are required therefore the present study is taken up aiming at simulating waves off the central west coast of india using a shallow water nested numerical model swan nested with ww3 with forcing from era5 winds we have used wave data collected off vengurla during 2018 for validation of the model results further assuming that the nested model provides very reliable results sensitivity analyses for wave growth and dissipation bottom friction have been carried out using the parameterization schemes available in the model with the aim of extending the model for the entire west coast of india the accuracy of model wave parameters has been discussed using the results of statistical and spectral analyses 2 area of study the location selected for the study is vengurla a port city in the coastal region of sindhudurg on the central west coast of india fig 1 it is situated at an average elevation of 11 m above msl and is bounded by the arabian sea on the west and the western ghats on the east vengurla is also surrounded by a semicircular range of hills the beaches are characterized by fine grain size sediments with distinctly different magnetic signatures in terms of their concentration

during june to september and 0 5 1 5 m and 5 6s during october to may respectively sathasivam et al 2015 inter annual variations in annual average values of swh from 2014 to 2018 is up to 8 while no significant variations in annually averaged values of mean wave period and peak wave period were observed george et al 2020 fig 1 shows the model domain chosen for the study as well as the location of

estimates of wave parameters in coastal areas lakes and estuaries from given wind bottom and current conditions booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 swan is computationally less efficient in deep water however swan can be used on any scale relevant for wind generated surface gravity waves it solves the action balance equation rather than the energy balance equation hasselmann et al 1973 5 n t c x n

parameterization schemes for the central west coast of india vengurla coast each parameterization option has been estimated independently by verifying the model simulated wave parameters viz swh significant wave height mwp mean wave period and mwd mean wave direction with the buoy observations off vengurla wave modelled spectra were also compared with the measured spectra 4 results and discussion firstly the accuracy of the reanalysis wind data was tested by validating era5 and wrf winds with measurements as measured wind data was not available for vengurla aws wind measurements off goa for the period jan feb 2018 have been used the comparison of winds u and v velocity components is shown in fig 2 and the statistics in table 1 the accuracy of reanalysis winds was found to be within the acceptable limit and therefore the reanalysis winds were used confidently in the wave model the statistics show much improved accuracy with era5 than the era interim datasets used in previous studies moreover era5 winds match very well with the wrf winds and in turn with measured winds the performance of swan nested in ww3 was tested by validating the model parameters statistical analysis and spectral distribution with one year measured waves off vengurla the regional wave model downscaling was carried out using swan by considering two approaches i a regional swan model without boundary conditions and ii a nested swan model with the boundary conditions from ww3 the results show that the regional model without boundary input underestimates the swh whereas the nested model gives reasonable agreement with the measured swh fig 3 a this implies that boundary conditions from a global model are required for accurately simulating waves in shallow regions these results are compatible with the earlier studies aboobacker et al 2011 sabique et al 2012 samiksha et al 2012 proving that nesting of any coastal model with a global model is a convenient option for better simulation of wave parameters in the coastal areas especially in the indian ocean context to accommodate the swells coming from the southern ocean atlantic ocean we have plotted 1d wave spectra fig 3b from the adjacent grids ww3 and swan grids at a few time instances to show the role of boundary conditions especially the swells coming from the outer domain into the local domain the shift of the spectrum including the peak towards low frequency and spread of energy over a wide frequency range is evident when the boundary conditions are applied to the smaller domain nevertheless the comparative study signiﬁes that the nested model performs reasonably well to reproduce the wave conditions off vengurla coast not only during fair weather season but also for high waves during southwest monsoon a study by atan et al 2017 revealed that swan performance is most sensitive to the type and parameterization of wave generation formulation and bottom friction since more than one formulation is available in swan for each source term in the present study tests were performed by selecting different formulations that provide the best agreement with the observations assuming that the nested model provides very reliable results performing sensitivity analyses for wave growth and dissipation bottom friction using the parameterization schemes available in the model so that the model can be extended for the entire west coast of india following sub sections present the detailed analyses of model results obtained for various combinations of wave growth physics and bottom friction 4 1 coastal wave modelling with different wave growth formulations and bottom friction the model sensitivity was evaluated with respect to input and dissipation parameterization for four different combinations of wave growth and bottom friction terms amrutha et al 2016 used nested swan wave model to hindcast waves off karwar 150 km south of the present study area and found that wave growth and bottom friction i e komen with jonswap is the best suitable parameterization for that region as this is the default setup suggested by the swan team we also initially setup the model using komen wave growth physics and jonswap bottom friction by keeping the coefficient cfjon 0 038 for the whole year subsequently by keeping the same bottom friction a sensitivity analysis was carried out for various wave growth terms viz janssen westhuysen and st6 fig 4 the simulated wave parameters viz swh mwp and mwd were compared with the measured data of 1 year period covering all the seasons and the accuracy was determined using statistical parameters table 2 for case 1 model simulations using komen wave growth and jonswap bottom friction showed good performance for swh bias 0 03 m rmse 0 18 m si 0 18 and cc 0 97 case 2 simulations using the janssen jonswap combination showed a good match with the measured data for the entire period including high waves during swm however case 3 simulations with westhuysen formulation showed drastic underestimation compared to all other simulations this may be due to the westhuysen scheme van der westhuysen et al 2007 which uses a saturation based expression to calculate the whitecapping dissipation combined with wind input of yan 1987 that essentially computes whitecapping dissipation locally in wavenumber space alves and banner 2003 babanin and van der westhuysen 2008 van der westhuysen et al 2007 it depends on quantities that are local in the frequency spectrum opposed to ones that are distributed over the spectrum as in the expression of komen et al 1984 however the final whitecapping expression proposed by alves and banner 2003 features additional dependencies on the spectral mean wavenumber and steepness which is problematic in situations of the mixed sea and swell often encountered in the nearshore case 4 with st6 wave growth and jonswap bottom friction reproduced waves matching well with the measured data bias 0 09 m rmse 0 20 m si 0 20 and cc 0 97 edwards et al 2018 performed a cost benefit analysis of swan with the source term package of st6 by concluded that the st6 source term is better than other source term packages and they recommended the use of the st6 source term in complex sea state conditions where wind seas and swells co exist in the present study we find that amongst the 4 categories komen case 1 and st6 case 4 formulations performed better than other combinations with less bias though we could not ascertain any specific reason for the schemes producing different responses possible reasons could be that i wind input is balanced with white capping dissipation in westhuysen in combination with non linear wave interaction and dissipation due to bottom friction and ii energy dissipation described by the breaking wave physics is not adequately modelled and it represents the wave conditions just before breaking or continuing features after breaking which in turn is associated with the previous breaking due to dissipation umesh and behera 2020 besides model validation of significant wave height we have also validated the mean wave period and mean wave direction the mwp table 2 and fig 4b calculated with default setup case 1 provided better results with bias 0 11 s and rmse 0 92 s compared to other cases including st6 however swan simulated with st6 physics gave the best results for mwd low rmse and low bias of course with marginal differences compared to other cases followed by komen jonswap table 2 and fig 4c model results show that 86 of the time waves were approaching from the southwest agreeing very close to the measured value 86 of the time from that sector and the difference is very marginal a study by umesh and behera 2020 showed that possible deviation in direction could be due to the representation of swells wind seas interaction in the source physics we also compared the model output with the wave parameters extracted from the era5 database off vengurla for the year 2018 the statistical results show good accuracy viz swh bias 0 09 m and rmse 0 14 m cc 0 99 mwp bias 2 08s and rmse 2 18s cc 0 89 and mwd bias 0 15 and rmse 17 11 though results showed good accuracy with model output the resolution of era5 data is 0 25 0 25 which makes it difficult to use in the nearshore region and demands for model output in fine resolution scale to check the accuracy of the model for a longer period we simulated the wave characteristics for additional year 2019 and compared the output with the era5 data the statistical results are swh bias 0 08 m and rmse 0 14 m cc 0 99 mwp bias 2 09s and rmse 2 19s cc 0 89 and mwd bias 0 79 and rmse 17 11 the comparison showed that statistical parameters for both years are nearly similar in another sensitivity analysis komen physics was used with different bottom friction terms viz jonswap collin and madsen and the results are presented in table 3 on comparing the statistical results of swh mwp and mwd table 3 it is very evident that komen collin and komen madsen simulations underestimate the wave parameters for high waves during sw monsoon but perform better during the rest of the year it may be noted that the mean wave direction in the study region varies between 180 and 360 in all seasons in fig 5 c we could observe two clusters of wave direction 180 270 and 270 360 a recent study by george et al 2020 discussed about the wave direction off vengurla with respect to seasons from february to may pre monsoon wave direction is from the northwest during monsoon june sept waves are predominantly from the west southwest due to the dominance of swells in the post monsoon season october january waves mostly approach from the southwest this seasonal distribution of waves indicates that the study region has 3 wave regimes i swells from the southwest ii wind seas from the northwest and iii westerly waves during monsoon on comparing the model results of swh we find that komen wave growth physics with jonswap friction performs better less bias and rmse than other combinations similarly model simulation with komen jonswap formulation provides better results for mwp and mwd 4 2 sensitivity analysis for high waves subsequent to the above results a few more sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate the performance of the swan model especially for high wave conditions 2 m such as during sw monsoon season say june the sea state of the arabian sea depends on the prevailing winds in the three different seasons namely southwest monsoon june september northeast monsoon october january and pre monsoon february may among these seasons high waves are observed during the southwest monsoon season glejin et al 2013 kumar et al 2006 considering the computational time and previous results simulations have been restricted to one month only but taking into account different combinations of wave growth and bottom friction terms as komen wave growth has been already tested for different bottom friction parameterizations section 4 1 we have carried out simulations with the remaining wave growth schemes janssen westhuysen and st6 and different bottom friction terms fig 6 shows the comparison of the model with the measurements during the sw monsoon season when there were larger waves table 4 presents the statistical estimates for the various physics tested during the high wave conditions sw monsoon season the results table 4 show that the model performance for swh is good with janssen jonswap scheme low values of rmse and si and good cc compared to janssen collin simulation on the contrary janssen madsen scheme in simulation provided more biased results for swh with high rmse and si values of course with good cc similar to komen madsen results i e underestimation of wave parameters during the monsoon season for high waves fig 6 in fig 6b we observe that model run with janseen wave growth scheme and bottom friction collin could not able to capture short period waves however janseen with madsen and jowswap bottom frictions could capture the short period waves based on the results of these setups subsequent simulations have been carried out considering only two bottom friction schemes viz jonswap and collin westhuysen wave growth simulation with jonswap and collin friction also underestimated wave height during monsoon season increased bias rmse and si compared to other simulation results fig 7 st6 with jonswap showed good performance for monsoon waves compared to other simulations with low bias 0 02 m rmse 0 22 m and si 0 11 st6 collin statistics resembled those of janssen collin simulations for swh although janssen madsen simulated the mean wave period accurately compared to other simulations it underpredicted swh and mwd most of the time we also changed the default values of coefficients of jonswap friction 0 038 0 02 and 0 01 for the month of june keeping komen wave growth constant from the three values considered for bottom friction it was observed that the accuracy of the model results swh improved bias reduced from 0 14 m to 0 01 m and rmse from 0 25 m to 0 19 m when the friction coefficient values were reduced but in the case of mwp and mwd the simulation results revealed that the default value of jonswap friction 0 038 gives better results compared to other friction values comparing all the combinations given in table 4 we find that janssen jonswap and st6 jonswap provide accurate results than all other simulations based on the results of all the sensitivity analyses tables 3 and 4 it can be concluded that komen jonswap and st6 jonswap reproduced the wave characteristics in the central west coast of india off vengurla to a better extent using era5 winds 4 3 simulation of waves using wrf winds the sensitivity of swan model output to winds in the coastal region was verified with wrf winds as well in addition to era5 winds based on the above results with era 5 winds sections 4 1 and 4 2 we setup the model with wrf winds using two best suited combinations komen wave growth jonswap bottom friction and st6 wave growth jonswap bottom friction formulations the results are presented in fig 8 the statistical analysis results for swh mwp and mwd are listed in table 5 the comparison of statistical results obtained for the era and wrf generated wave parameters shows that both the winds reproduced wave characteristics with more or less the same accuracy for the above combination of model schemes the model results for swh and mwp are almost similar with a marginal difference in mwd reduction in bias value for wrf this analysis further proves the reliability of the latest era5 wind datasets for wave modelling in coastal regions 4 4 spectral analysis the wave spectrum describes how the wave energy is distributed over a range of frequencies and it is used to identify different wave systems present at the measurement location cuchiara et al 2009 guedes soares 1991 phillips 1985 a spectrum with two peaks is expected to occur whenever the sea state contains two wave systems with different average periods often this will be a combination of a swell component with wind seas the west coast of india is known for the co existence of wind seas and swells especially during the southwest monsoon season in the present study model 1d normalised wave spectra are compared with those from the buoy wave spectra fig 9 these spectra represent typical wave conditions off vengurla for all the months of 2018 it is evident from the wave spectra that wave ﬁeld along the coast of vengurla comprises both wind seas and swells there are bi modal and multi modal fig 9 peaks associated with distant swells reaching the coastal waters off vengurla the model wave spectra closely resemble the buoy wave spectra even during high wave conditions of sw monsoon season and in general follow the energy level trend fig 10 shows the evolution of wave spectra off vengurla for the year 2018 from the measured and modelled datasets it is observed that when the spectrum is single peaked the model reproduces the waves very accurately and the spectrum matches very well with the measured spectrum model performance is within acceptable limits even for multipeaked spectra especially in the high frequency region of the spectrum the model very well demonstrated the existence of a single peaked spectrum during sw monsoon and double multi peaked spectra during moderate weather due to strong local winds and the swells arriving from the southern ocean fig 11 represents the monthly compass plots to show the wave energy represented by swh in different directional sectors both for model and measured data it clearly shows the directional match though there is a slight deviation in swh magnitude fig 12 represents the 2d directional spectrum from measured and modelled data at a specific time interval two spectral peaks are clearly observed in both the datasets however model spectra could not reproduce the wind sea energy to a greater extent 5 conclusions in this study the swan wave model nested with ww3 has been used to simulate wave parameters off vengurla coast located along the central west coast of india the global ww3 model provided time varying two dimensional energy spectra at the boundaries of the swan model swan was tested for different wave growth and bottom friction terms to select the formulation that is most suitable for the study region based on different simulations it was found that komen and st6 wave growth schemes with jonswap bottom friction has a good level of accuracy with the measured data wave growth with janssen too predicts the wave parameters accurately but not to the extent of the above formulations the westhuysen wave growth significantly underpredicts high waves for both the frictions jonswap and collin similarly model results of all wave growth formulations with different bottom friction schemes show that madsen friction underpredicts for high waves during monsoon whereas jonswap and collin frictions show good model performance for high waves too the sensitivity of the swan wave model to high resolution wrf winds was also analysed statistical results show that the model performed reasonably well with both the winds wrf and era5 spectral analysis signifies that model spectra follow the buoy spectra very closely based on all the results it can be concluded that for the central west coast of india komen and st6 wave growth physics with jonswap bottom friction suit very well to accurately reproduce the wave characteristics using era5 winds author s contribution s v samiksha conceptualization methodology writing original draft model simulation interpretation of the results lincy jancy

20491,in the present study swan wave model is nested with wavewatch 3 to reproduce waves off the central west coast of india using era 5 winds the sensitivity of swan wave model was tested with different wave growth and bottom friction schemes to identify the most suitable scheme for this region the model parameters have been validated with one year buoy measurements among all the four wave growth schemes komen janssen westhuysen and st6 and three friction schemes jonswap collin and madsen considered swan with komen or st6 and jonswap setup performed better in predicting the waves including the high waves during the southwest monsoon model performance has also been tested with high resolution wrf winds and the statistical results showed comparably the same performance as era5 winds the model very well demonstrated the existence of single peaked spectra during the southwest monsoon and double multi peaked spectra due to strong local winds and the swells arriving from the southern ocean during fair moderate weather season hence komen or st6 wave growth with jonswap bottom friction is recommended for the prediction of waves off the central west coast of india using era5 winds keywords swan model wavewatch 3 model era5 data wave growth bottom friction wrf winds 1 introduction the major sources of wave information are from in situ measurements model hindcasts and reanalysis voluntary observing ships vos and remote sensing hithin et al 2015 visual observations of wave parameters from ships vos data have been available along the shipping routes since 1784 however by nature these observations are subjective and there are large unsampled areas due to missing ship routes gulev and grigorieva 2004 satellite altimetry and its recent improvement in resolution as well as data quality are worthwhile but globally the repeat cycle of satellite altimetry for a location varies from 10 days for the topex poseidon satellite mission to 35 days for ers satellites and hence there is a chance of missing extreme events in situ observations are location specific and generally sparse in the coastal regions of the indian ocean unlike the atlantic ocean or the pacific ocean long term time series data of in situ observations are mostly unavailable and hence it is rather difficult to estimate wave climate or extreme sea state accurately without long term time series data also the requirement for such high quality wave data is increasing constantly for the design of offshore structures as well as studying the coastal processes hence we need to depend on numerical modelling based on a spectral concept which is a powerful tool to calculate wave properties accurately for operational use and engineering studies subject to the accuracy of input winds wave propagation within the coastal areas is strongly influenced by coastal morphology its islands bars shoals and channels some of the widely used numerical wave models are wave modelling wam wamdi 1988 wavewatch 3 ww3 the wavewatch iii development group 2019 tolman 2003 and simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 the state of art third generation wave models ww3 and swan represent better the transition between wind seas and swells compared to the former wave models these models use full wave spectra based on the integration of wave action balance equation wam and ww3 are more suitable for global and regional modelling chawla 2007 remya et al 2012 samiksha et al 2012 2015 2012 sandhya et al 2014 strauss et al 2007 umesh et al 2017 umesh and behera 2020 umesh and swain 2018 swan has been extensively validated and widely used across the globe in simulating coastal wave characteristics due to demand in the coastal areas amrutha et al 2016 bhowmick et al 2011 booij et al 1999 brown 2010 kumar et al 2009 mazaheri et al 2013 moeini et al 2012 nikishova et al 2017 parvathy et al 2017 ris et al 1999 samiksha et al 2019 sandhya et al 2014 siadatmousavi et al 2012 swain et al 2019 umesh and swain 2018 wang et al 2004 swan is a sophisticated model with various parameterizations to treat the physical processes with gradual bathymetric variations in the coastal regions more importantly the accuracy of the model output in the nearshore regions is governed by input forcing parameterizations of various source terms and the effect of numeric used several studies tried to propose parameterizations for dissipation source terms donelan and pierson jr 1987 feng and yeli 1992 hasselmann 1974 longuet higgins 1969 polnikov 1994 wamdi 1988 yuan et al 1986 researchers have also evaluated the suitability of different parameterized wave breaking and dissipation formulas for coastal spectral wave transformations zheng et al 2008 another important process is related to bottom friction bottom friction dissipation and nonlinear triad 3 wave interactions are the potentially important processes a study by luo and monbaliu 1994 suggested that the bottom friction and triad interactions are sensitive to local environments in terms of water depth bottom characteristics and wave properties along the west coast of india significant wave heights swh up to 6 m have been reported during the southwest monsoon period kumar et al 2006 in the rest of the period swh will be normally less than 1 5 m kumar and anand 2004 kumar et al 2003 reported that along the indian coast about 60 of the wave spectra are multi peaked and they are single peaked when swh 2 m it was also observed that wave energy spectra generally have more than one peak depending on the generation source and double peaked spectra are mainly swell dominated vethamony et al 2009 found that the co existence of wind seas and pre existing swells create diurnal variations on the resultant waves along the west coast of india during pre monsoon and northeast monsoon glejin et al 2013 reported that swells are present throughout the year off ratnagiri central west coast and swells are dominant during pre monsoon and weak during southwest monsoon due to prevailing strong winds amrutha et al 2016 analysed changes in nearshore waves during the active sea land breeze period off vengurla central west coast and found that peak wave period in a single day varied up to 8s it was also found that reduction in the wave height of wind sea was 20 and that of the swell 10 when waves travelled from 15 m to 5 m water depth the mean wave spectrum showed the predominant swell peak at 0 074 hz both at 15 and 5 m water depths but the wind sea peak shifted from 0 187 to 0 174 hz when waves travelled from 15 m to 5 m water depth dora et al 2018 showed that during the summer monsoon southwest monsoon coastal breeze is absent as monsoon winds dominate and pointed out the importance of having year long time series data for local weather predictions wave characteristics in the nearshore region off vengurla at 15 m water depth revealed that the highest swh was 5 05 m with an annual average swh of 0 93 m and the monthly average peak wave period ranged from 9 4 to 13s amrutha et al 2016 wave characteristics in the shallow waters of the central west coast of india are explored mostly using measurements which are time and space bounded several coastal development projects are proposed in the central west coast of india and that may demand wave climate information for which long term time series data are required therefore the present study is taken up aiming at simulating waves off the central west coast of india using a shallow water nested numerical model swan nested with ww3 with forcing from era5 winds we have used wave data collected off vengurla during 2018 for validation of the model results further assuming that the nested model provides very reliable results sensitivity analyses for wave growth and dissipation bottom friction have been carried out using the parameterization schemes available in the model with the aim of extending the model for the entire west coast of india the accuracy of model wave parameters has been discussed using the results of statistical and spectral analyses 2 area of study the location selected for the study is vengurla a port city in the coastal region of sindhudurg on the central west coast of india fig 1 it is situated at an average elevation of 11 m above msl and is bounded by the arabian sea on the west and the western ghats on the east vengurla is also surrounded by a semicircular range of hills the beaches are characterized by fine grain size sediments with distinctly different magnetic signatures in terms of their concentration and magnetic grain sizes gawali et al 2010 the coastal region of vengurla is characterized by three different seasons pre monsoon february may southwest monsoon swm june september and northeast monsoon nem october january swm winds are stronger than nem and pre monsoon winds vengurla experiences a tropical climate and the annual precipitation is 3155 3 mm gawali et al 2010 the tides are predominantly semi diurnal and mixed it is exposed to open ocean waves from northwest to south amrutha et al 2016 it is reported that wave height and wave period vary between 1 5 and 3 0 m and 5 8s during june to september and 0 5 1 5 m and 5 6s during october to may respectively sathasivam et al 2015 inter annual variations in annual average values of swh from 2014 to 2018 is up to 8 while no significant variations in annually averaged values of mean wave period and peak wave period were observed george et al 2020 fig 1 shows the model domain chosen for the study as well as the location of

smaller domain only era5 winds were given as input to wavewatch iii and both era5 and wrf winds to the swan model 3 2 wave data the wave data measured using a datawell directional waverider buoy deployed at 15 m water depth in a shallow water location off vengurla from january to december 2018 have been used for model validation the data were recorded continuously at 1 28 hz and the data for every 30min were processed as one record data were sampled at a frequency of 1 28 hz and fast fourier transform of 8 series each consisting of 256 data points were added to give spectra with 16 degrees of freedom the high frequency cut off was set at 0 6 hz and the resolution was 0 005 hz the swh and mwp were obtained from the spectral analysis based on circular moments the mwd corresponding to the spectral peak frequency fp was estimated kuik et al 1988 3 3 statistical indicators the accuracy of both the measured datasets and the model results was tested by subjecting these data to

estimates of wave parameters in coastal areas lakes and estuaries from given wind bottom and current conditions booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 swan is computationally less efficient in deep water however swan can be used on any scale relevant for wind generated surface gravity waves it solves the action balance equation rather than the energy balance equation hasselmann et al 1973 5 n t c x n

wind energy to the waves is described with a resonance mechanism phillips 1957 and a feed back mechanism miles 1957 wave growth due to the wind is expressed as 7 s i n σ θ a b e σ θ in which a and b depend on wave frequency and direction and wind speed and direction the expression for the term a is from cavaleri and rizzoli 1981 two optional expressions for the coefficient b are used one from snyder et al 1981 and the second from janssen 1991 the dissipation terms of the wave energy include white capping s d s w bottom friction s d s b and depth induced breaking s d s b r as this study involves sensitivity analyses using bottom friction we have discussed parameters related to the bottom friction equation the bottom friction dissipation can be expressed as 8 s d s b σ θ c b o t t o m

finite difference schemes two dimensional rectangular grid which are simple robust and economical for application in oceanic waters swan computations can be made on a regular curvilinear grid or a triangular mesh in a cartesian or spherical coordinate system swan has the option to make computations that are nested in coarse swan wam or wavewatch 3 ww3 in such runs swan interpolates the spatial boundary of the swan wam or ww3 grid to the model domain finer grid of swan that needs to coincide with the grid lines of wam ww3 or output nest grid boundaries of swan 3 4 1 model setup wave model set ups can vary depending on the physical characteristics of the study area including geographical conditions wave formations bathymetry gradients and global and local wind effects atan et al 2017 the studies by breivik et al 2009 and anselmi molina et al 2012 report the application of wam swan and ww3 swan nested models warner et al 2008 for accurate prediction of nearshore waves the parameterization of shallow water wave physics also influences the model results in the present study a nesting approach using two separate gridded model domains has been used to simulate wave conditions off vengurla central west coast of india the larger model domain of the indian ocean 60 s to 30 n 15 e to 130 e fig 1 had a coarse resolution 0 5 0 5 to reproduce the propagation of swells from the southern ocean to the open ocean of indian ocean a regional nested high resolution smaller domain off vengurla coast 72 e to 75 e and 14 n to 17 n fig 1 with 0 01 0 01 1 11 km 1 11 km has been used to reproduce the transformed offshore waves and locally generated waves in a limited fetch both the domains used gebco general bathymetric chart of the oceans bathymetry database available from http www ngdc noaa gov mgg gebco a 30 arc second global model of the earth s surface the 2d spectral boundary conditions generated using ww3 larger domain were given as initial boundary conditions for swan smaller domain wave frequencies were discretized from 0 025 to 0 58 hz over 63 bins on a logarithmic scale the physics of swan model simulation includes depth induced wave breaking hasselmann et al 1973 bottom friction wind wave growth white capping quadruplet and triad interactions vegetation and fluid mud set ups were deactivated as there are no vegetation fields or fluid mud beds present in the study area swan was tested with wave growth janssen komen westhyusen st6 and bottom friction jonswap collin madsen with the objective of selecting the best available parameterization schemes for the central west coast of india vengurla coast each parameterization option has been estimated independently by verifying the model simulated wave parameters viz swh significant wave height mwp mean wave period and mwd mean wave direction with the buoy observations off vengurla wave modelled spectra were also compared with the measured spectra 4 results and discussion firstly the accuracy of the reanalysis wind data was tested by validating era5 and wrf winds with measurements as measured wind data was not available for vengurla aws wind measurements off goa for the period jan feb 2018 have been used the comparison of winds u and v velocity components is shown in fig 2 and the statistics in table 1 the accuracy of reanalysis winds was found to be within the acceptable limit and therefore the reanalysis winds were used confidently in the wave model the statistics show much improved accuracy with era5 than the era interim datasets used in previous studies moreover era5 winds match very well with the wrf winds and in turn with measured winds the performance of swan nested in ww3 was tested by validating the model parameters statistical analysis and spectral distribution with one year measured waves off vengurla the regional wave model downscaling was carried out using swan by considering two approaches i a regional swan model without boundary conditions and ii a nested swan model with the boundary conditions from ww3 the results show that the regional model without boundary input underestimates the swh whereas the nested model gives reasonable agreement with the measured swh fig 3 a this implies that boundary conditions from a global model are required for accurately simulating waves in shallow regions these results are compatible with the earlier studies aboobacker et al 2011 sabique et al 2012 samiksha et al 2012 proving that nesting of any coastal model with a global model is a convenient option for better simulation of wave parameters in the coastal areas especially in the indian ocean context to accommodate the swells coming from the southern ocean atlantic ocean we have plotted 1d wave spectra fig 3b from the adjacent grids ww3 and swan grids at a few time instances to show the role of boundary conditions especially the swells coming from the outer domain into the local domain the shift of the spectrum including the peak towards low frequency and spread of energy over a wide frequency range is evident when the boundary conditions are applied to the smaller domain nevertheless the comparative study signiﬁes that the nested model performs reasonably well to reproduce the wave conditions off vengurla coast not only during fair weather season but also for high waves during southwest monsoon a study by atan et al 2017 revealed that swan performance is most sensitive to the type and parameterization of wave generation formulation and bottom friction since more than one formulation is available in swan for each source term in the present study tests were performed by selecting different formulations that provide the best agreement with the observations assuming that the nested model provides very reliable results performing sensitivity analyses for wave growth and dissipation bottom friction using the parameterization schemes available in the model so that the model can be extended for the entire west coast of india following sub sections present the detailed analyses of model results obtained for various combinations of wave growth physics and bottom friction 4 1 coastal wave modelling with different wave growth formulations and bottom friction the model sensitivity was evaluated with respect to input and dissipation parameterization for four different combinations of wave growth and bottom friction terms amrutha et al 2016 used nested swan wave model to hindcast waves off karwar 150 km south of the present study area and found that wave growth and bottom friction i e komen with jonswap is the best suitable parameterization for that region as this is the default setup suggested by the swan team we also initially setup the model using komen wave growth physics and jonswap bottom friction by keeping the coefficient cfjon 0 038 for the whole year subsequently by keeping the same bottom friction a sensitivity analysis was carried out for various wave growth terms viz janssen westhuysen and st6 fig 4 the simulated wave parameters viz swh mwp and mwd were compared with the measured data of 1 year period covering all the seasons and the accuracy was determined using statistical parameters table 2 for case 1 model simulations using komen wave growth and jonswap bottom friction showed good performance for swh bias 0 03 m rmse 0 18 m si 0 18 and cc 0 97 case 2 simulations using the janssen jonswap combination showed a good match with the measured data for the entire period including high waves during swm however case 3 simulations with westhuysen formulation showed drastic underestimation compared to all other simulations this may be due to the westhuysen scheme van der westhuysen et al 2007 which uses a saturation based expression to calculate the whitecapping dissipation combined with wind input of yan 1987 that essentially computes whitecapping dissipation locally in wavenumber space alves and banner 2003 babanin and van der westhuysen 2008 van der westhuysen et al 2007 it depends on quantities that are local in the frequency spectrum opposed to ones that are distributed over the spectrum as in the expression of komen et al 1984 however the final whitecapping expression proposed by alves and banner 2003 features additional dependencies on the spectral mean wavenumber and steepness which is problematic in situations of the mixed sea and swell often encountered in the nearshore case 4 with st6 wave growth and jonswap bottom friction reproduced waves matching well with the measured data bias 0 09 m rmse 0 20 m si 0 20 and cc 0 97 edwards et al 2018 performed a cost benefit analysis of swan with the source term package of st6 by concluded that the st6 source term is better than other source term packages and they recommended the use of the st6 source term in complex sea state conditions where wind seas and swells co exist in the present study we find that amongst the 4 categories komen case 1 and st6 case 4 formulations performed better than other combinations with less bias though we could not ascertain any specific reason for the schemes producing different responses possible reasons could be that i wind input is balanced with white capping dissipation in westhuysen in combination with non linear wave interaction and dissipation due to bottom friction and ii energy dissipation described by the breaking wave physics is not adequately modelled and it represents the wave conditions just before breaking or continuing features after breaking which in turn is associated with the previous breaking due to dissipation umesh and behera 2020 besides model validation of significant wave height we have also validated the mean wave period and mean wave direction the mwp table 2 and fig 4b calculated with default setup case 1 provided better results with bias 0 11 s and rmse 0 92 s compared to other cases including st6 however swan simulated with st6 physics gave the best results for mwd low rmse and low bias of course with marginal differences compared to other cases followed by komen jonswap table 2 and fig 4c model results show that 86 of the time waves were approaching from the southwest agreeing very close to the measured value 86 of the time from that sector and the difference is very marginal a study by umesh and behera 2020 showed that possible deviation in direction could be due to the representation of swells wind seas interaction in the source physics we also compared the model output with the wave parameters extracted from the era5 database off vengurla for the year 2018 the statistical results show good accuracy viz swh bias 0 09 m and rmse 0 14 m cc 0 99 mwp bias 2 08s and rmse 2 18s cc 0 89 and mwd bias 0 15 and rmse 17 11 though results showed good accuracy with model output the resolution of era5 data is 0 25 0 25 which makes it difficult to use in the nearshore region and demands for model output in fine resolution scale to check the accuracy of the model for a longer period we simulated the wave characteristics for additional year 2019 and compared the output with the era5 data the statistical results are swh bias 0 08 m and rmse 0 14 m cc 0 99 mwp bias 2 09s and rmse 2 19s cc 0 89 and mwd bias 0 79 and rmse 17 11 the comparison showed that statistical parameters for both years are nearly similar in another sensitivity analysis komen physics was used with different bottom friction terms viz jonswap collin and madsen and the results are presented in table 3 on comparing the statistical results of swh mwp and mwd table 3 it is very evident that komen collin and komen madsen simulations underestimate the wave parameters for high waves during sw monsoon but perform better during the rest of the year it may be noted that the mean wave direction in the study region varies between 180 and 360 in all seasons in fig 5 c we could observe two clusters of wave direction 180 270 and 270 360 a recent study by george et al 2020 discussed about the wave direction off vengurla with respect to seasons from february to may pre monsoon wave direction is from the northwest during monsoon june sept waves are predominantly from the west southwest due to the dominance of swells in the post monsoon season october january waves mostly approach from the southwest this seasonal distribution of waves indicates that the study region has 3 wave regimes i swells from the southwest ii wind seas from the northwest and iii westerly waves during monsoon on comparing the model results of swh we find that komen wave growth physics with jonswap friction performs better less bias and rmse than other combinations similarly model simulation with komen jonswap formulation provides better results for mwp and mwd 4 2 sensitivity analysis for high waves subsequent to the above results a few more sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate the performance of the swan model especially for high wave conditions 2 m such as during sw monsoon season say june the sea state of the arabian sea depends on the prevailing winds in the three different seasons namely southwest monsoon june september northeast monsoon october january and pre monsoon february may among these seasons high waves are observed during the southwest monsoon season glejin et al 2013 kumar et al 2006 considering the computational time and previous results simulations have been restricted to one month only but taking into account different combinations of wave growth and bottom friction terms as komen wave growth has been already tested for different bottom friction parameterizations section 4 1 we have carried out simulations with the remaining wave growth schemes janssen westhuysen and st6 and different bottom friction terms fig 6 shows the comparison of the model with the measurements during the sw monsoon season when there were larger waves table 4 presents the statistical estimates for the various physics tested during the high wave conditions sw monsoon season the results table 4 show that the model performance for swh is good with janssen jonswap scheme low values of rmse and si and good cc compared to janssen collin simulation on the contrary janssen madsen scheme in simulation provided more biased results for swh with high rmse and si values of course with good cc similar to komen madsen results i e underestimation of wave parameters during the monsoon season for high waves fig 6 in fig 6b we observe that model run with janseen wave growth scheme and bottom friction collin could not able to capture short period waves however janseen with madsen and jowswap bottom frictions could capture the short period waves based on the results of these setups subsequent simulations have been carried out considering only two bottom friction schemes viz jonswap and collin westhuysen wave growth simulation with jonswap and collin friction also underestimated wave height during monsoon season increased bias rmse and si compared to other simulation results fig 7 st6 with jonswap showed good performance for monsoon waves compared to other simulations with low bias 0 02 m rmse 0 22 m and si 0 11 st6 collin statistics resembled those of janssen collin simulations for swh although janssen madsen simulated the mean wave period accurately compared to other simulations it underpredicted swh and mwd most of the time we also changed the default values of coefficients of jonswap friction 0 038 0 02 and 0 01 for the month of june keeping komen wave growth constant from the three values considered for bottom friction it was observed that the accuracy of the model results swh improved bias reduced from 0 14 m to 0 01 m and rmse from 0 25 m to 0 19 m when the friction coefficient values were reduced but in the case of mwp and mwd the simulation results revealed that the default value of jonswap friction 0 038 gives better results compared to other friction values comparing all the combinations given in table 4 we find that janssen jonswap and st6 jonswap provide accurate results than all other simulations based on the results of all the sensitivity analyses tables 3 and 4 it can be concluded that komen jonswap and st6 jonswap reproduced the wave characteristics in the central west coast of india off vengurla to a better extent using era5 winds 4 3 simulation of waves using wrf winds the sensitivity of swan model output to winds in the coastal region was verified with wrf winds as well in addition to era5 winds based on the above results with era 5 winds sections 4 1 and 4 2 we setup the model with wrf winds using two best suited combinations komen wave growth jonswap bottom friction and st6 wave growth jonswap bottom friction formulations the results are presented in fig 8 the statistical analysis results for swh mwp and mwd are listed in table 5 the comparison of statistical results obtained for the era and wrf generated wave parameters shows that both the winds reproduced wave characteristics with more or less the same accuracy for the above combination of model schemes the model results for swh and mwp are almost similar with a marginal difference in mwd reduction in bias value for wrf this analysis further proves the reliability of the latest era5 wind datasets for wave modelling in coastal regions 4 4 spectral analysis the wave spectrum describes how the wave energy is distributed over a range of frequencies and it is used to identify different wave systems present at the measurement location cuchiara et al 2009 guedes soares 1991 phillips 1985 a spectrum with two peaks is expected to occur whenever the sea state contains two wave systems with different average periods often this will be a combination of a swell component with wind seas the west coast of india is known for the co existence of wind seas and swells especially during the southwest monsoon season in the present study model 1d normalised wave spectra are compared with those from the buoy wave spectra fig 9 these spectra represent typical wave conditions off vengurla for all the months of 2018 it is evident from the wave spectra that wave ﬁeld along the coast of vengurla comprises both wind seas and swells there are bi modal and multi modal fig 9 peaks associated with distant swells reaching the coastal waters off vengurla the model wave spectra closely resemble the buoy wave spectra even during high wave conditions of sw monsoon season and in general follow the energy level trend fig 10 shows the evolution of wave spectra off vengurla for the year 2018 from the measured and modelled datasets it is observed that when the spectrum is single peaked the model reproduces the waves very accurately and the spectrum matches very well with the measured spectrum model performance is within acceptable limits even for multipeaked spectra especially in the high frequency region of the spectrum the model very well demonstrated the existence of a single peaked spectrum during sw monsoon and double multi peaked spectra during moderate weather due to strong local winds and the swells arriving from the southern ocean fig 11 represents the monthly compass plots to show the wave energy represented by swh in different directional sectors both for model and measured data it clearly shows the directional match though there is a slight deviation in swh magnitude fig 12 represents the 2d directional spectrum from measured and modelled data at a specific time interval two spectral peaks are clearly observed in both the datasets however model spectra could not reproduce the wind sea energy to a greater extent 5 conclusions in this study the swan wave model nested with ww3 has been used to simulate wave parameters off vengurla coast located along the central west coast of india the global ww3 model provided time varying two dimensional energy spectra at the boundaries of the swan model swan was tested for different wave growth and bottom friction terms to select the formulation that is most suitable for the study region based on different simulations it was found that komen and st6 wave growth schemes with jonswap bottom friction has a good level of accuracy with the measured data wave growth with janssen too predicts the wave parameters accurately but not to the extent of the above formulations the westhuysen wave growth significantly underpredicts high waves for both the frictions jonswap and collin similarly model results of all wave growth formulations with different bottom friction schemes show that madsen friction underpredicts for high waves during monsoon whereas jonswap and collin frictions show good model performance for high waves too the sensitivity of the swan wave model to high resolution wrf winds was also analysed statistical results show that the model performed reasonably well with both the winds wrf and era5 spectral analysis signifies that model spectra follow the buoy spectra very closely based on all the results it can be concluded that for the central west coast of india komen and st6 wave growth physics with jonswap bottom friction suit very well to accurately

20492,pile breakwaters are widely used for coastal protection to ensure the safety and hence serviceability of pile breakwaters under disastrous waves like tsunamis an accurate estimation of wave actions exerted on them is necessary this work investigates the hydrodynamic properties of solitary waves resemble tsunami waves interacting with a single row pile breakwater using openfoam large eddy simulation les is utilized to deal with the turbulent flow and the free surface is reproduced by a scheme named thinc qq tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing with quadratic surface representation and gaussian quadrature this numerical model is validated against published experimental data using the verified model flow patterns near the piles are interpreted a parametric study is then conducted on the influences of incident wave height blockage ratio and pile diameter to the hydrodynamic parameters of pile breakwater which include wave run up wave force and jet velocity finally semi empirical formulas are established for quick and reliable evaluation of these parameters the research work can provide guideline for practical design of pile breakwater keywords solitary wave pile breakwater flow pattern hydrodynamic parameters openfoam 1 introduction breakwaters are important infrastructures protecting the coastal area from disastrous waves in waters with large depth and soft seabed traditional gravity breakwaters suffer from construction difficulties and pile breakwater is widely adopted some projects have been under construction in zhoushan islands east china shown in fig 1 under the impact of tsunami like waves it can effectively reduce the run up and wave force on the sheltered objects huang and yuan 2010 yao et al 2020 to prevent structural failure accurate estimations to the hydrodynamic responses of pile breakwater under extreme waves are required in engineering practice however pile breakwater performs more complex hydrodynamic behaviors than ordinary pile groups which involves wave run up nonlinear impacts breaking free surface and violent jet flow these features are difficult to reproduce numerically or measure experimentally therefore knowledge on the wave interactions with pile breakwater is still insufficient wave transmission and reflection at pile breakwater characterized by transmission coefficient k t and reflection coefficient k r have been studied extensively effects of pile configurations and wave conditions were extensively examined through physical experiments and numerous semi empirical formulas have been established hayashi and kano 1966 truitt and herbich 1987 herbich and douglas 1988 huang 2007a huang and yuan 2010 analytical solutions of k t and k r were also derived from potential theory empirical coefficients were introduced to account for the nonlinear dissipation of wave energy and satisfactory agreement can be reached with experimental data huang 2007b koraim 2011 zhu 2011 these works gave applicable predictions to k t and k r but detailed flow field information is lacked and further investigations are still expected in terms of structural design wave force and run up are the most concerned parameters which give design references to the strength of foundations and air gap of superstructures respectively huang and chen 2020 experimentally observed that when exposed to regular or irregular waves the wave pressure is amplified at the corners and junctions of pile breakwater and superstructures are mainly affected by the lift load of run up waves through simulations and experiments mojtahedi et al 2020 pointed out that waves forces can be reduced through optimum designs to the cross section and installation angle of piles and circular piles are subjected to the minimum wave force under the same blocking area in addition to conventional wave conditions survivability of pile breakwater under disastrous waves like tsunamis and storm surges must be evaluated and ensured solitary waves have resemblances to tsunamis rossetto et al 2011 luo et al 2019 ren et al 2019 and hence are widely adopted as artificial substitutes to tsunami waves jiang et al 2015 numerically investigated the impacts of solitary wave to a single row pile breakwater both wave force and run up were found to be greatly magnified in comparison with a single pile and morison equation was proved to be an acceptable fit to the time history of wave force yao et al 2018 subsequently considered the condition of a double row pile breakwater maximum wave force and run up on both rows were found to increase with the increase of incident wave height and blockage ratio of piles and an empirical formula was proposed to predict the wave force of piles in each row jiang et al 2019 simulated the impacts of solitary wave breaking on sloping beach and the maximum slamming force to the piles was empirically formulated as a function of incident wave height blockage ratio and slope angle of seabed frantzis et al 2020 reproduced jiang et al 2015 s work and found that pile diameter has little effect to the maximum height of run up these works provide some design reference but a direct prediction to the maximum wave run up is still lacked moreover most investigations were conducted within a limited range of incident wave height and blockage ratio of piles and special phenomena e g ringing and secondary load cycle may come up under extreme scenarios in fact all the hydrodynamic characteristics of pile breakwater are closely related to the local flow field some studies to the flow pattern near pile structures have been conducted under steep regular waves two typical patterns of wave scattering type 1 and type 2 around a single pile were observed to successively come up in every wave period swan and sheikh 2015 sun et al 2016 mohseni et al 2018 type 1 is induced by the run up and falling back of wave crest while type 2 is associated with flow around the pile for ordinary pile groups or arrays near trapping and upwelling of waves were observed between adjacent piles kamath et al 2015 yoon et al 2016 cao and wan 2017 however flow patterns near the pile breakwater have some particularities the piles are very closely spaced with a large blockage ratio such as 90 or more meanwhile it covers a large width thus wave diffraction is restrained therefore violent jets are generated in the slots of adjacent piles due to flow contraction hayashi et al 1968 derived the depth averaged jet velocity in the slots from the bernoulli equation and continuity equation moreover a nearly linear relationship was experimentally found between maximum scour depth and maximum jet velocity frantzis et al 2020 noticed the air trapping in the leeward regions of piles which promotes the dissipation of wave energy a completely different pattern of vorticity field from a single pile is also observed the above studies have shed some insight into the flow pattern in the vicinity pile breakwaters but further understanding to the flow mechanism is still expected moreover quantitative prediction to the jet velocity under extreme waves like tsunamis is necessary which helps evaluating the depth of local scour this paper aims to interpret the evolution of wave field and jet flow near a single row pile breakwater and to work out semi empirical formulas for hydrodynamic parameters of engineering interest i e wave run up wave force and jet velocity the tsunami wave as one of the most destructive waves is considered the highly verified and recognized cfd computational fluid dynamics code openfoam is adopted for accurate prediction of the complex wave structure interaction process the novelty of this study lies in a new interpretation to the flow patterns and quick predictions to the hydrodynamic parameters of pile breakwater the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 numerical model is introduced and validated against available experimental data in section 3 evolution of free surface and jet flow are interpreted afterwards parametric analysis is conducted to the effects of incident wave height blockage ratio and pile diameter special phenomena under nonlinear wave actions are analyzed and semi empirical formulas are established finally main conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 model

experiment of jiang et al 2015 in which a solitary wave is generated by a piston type wavemaker and goes through a single row pile breakwater simulations are also conducted using openfoam by jiang et al 2015 fig 3 shows the sketch of the experiment diameter of piles d is 0 05 m distance between centers of adjacent piles s is 0 08 m incident wave height h i is 0 07 m water depth h is 0 20 m wave gauges g1 g4 and advs acoustic doppler velocimeter v1 v2 are arranged along the flume and dynamic pressure sensors p1 p4 are set on the pile surface exact locations of these probes are marked in fig 3 grid sensitivity in the vicinity of piles is tested to ensure that simulation results are grid independent body fitted grids are utilized to discretize the computational domain o type grid is adopted in the vicinity of piles as shown in fig 4 three sets of mesh with different grid numbers on the circumference of piles are constructed 40 grids for mesh 1 64 grids for mesh 2 and 96 grids for mesh 3 mesh information not including the boundary layer is listed in table 1 for all the meshes thickness of grids on wall boundaries is strictly checked to ensure that y dimensionless distance to the wall is limited under 1 simulations were conducted on the hpc center of zhejiang university zhoushan campus which runs under redhat enterprise linux 7 4 x64 operating system and is equipped with 2 processors intel xeon gold 6132 14 core 2 6 ghz on each compute node all the cases were run using mpi parallel computing on 26 cores and computational time for mesh 1 coarse mesh 2 medium and mesh 3 refined is approximately 8h 21h and 96h respectively fig 5 compares the time histories of dimensionless dynamic pressure at p1 p4 which is the most sensitive parameter to grid resolution results by mesh 1 mesh 3 are compared with the experimental and numerical data of jiang et al 2015 since results at symmetrical probes p2 and p3 are almost identical only curves at p2 are plotted here at the front point of pile p1 shown in fig 5a all the numerical results show great agreement with experimental data and even the coarsest mesh mesh 1 can accurately predict the maximum dynamic pressure at the side point p2 shown in fig 5b the increasing rate of experimental curve shows a tendency of slowdown and then speedup again before reaching its crest which looks like a platform mesh 2 and mesh 3 clearly identify this tendency on the contrast mesh 1 greatly underestimates the maximum dynamic pressure while the simulation of jiang et al 2015 shows much greater deviation from experimental data and the platform is not obvious at the rear of pile p4 shown in fig 5c a significant secondary crest is experimentally observed before the major crest this secondary crest is numerically reproduced by mesh 1 mesh 3 but missed in jiang et al 2015 s result it can be found that both mesh 2 and mesh 3 give satisfactory predictions to the dynamic pressure on pile surface since mesh 3 only shows insignificant advantage over mesh 2 for the balance of computational efficiency and accuracy a resolution of 64 grids on pile circumference mesh 2 is finally adopted results of wave surface and velocity components by mesh 2 are also compared with jiang et al 2015 fig 6 is time histories of dimensionless water elevation at wave gauges g1 g4 both numerical results agree quite well with experimental data as the leading wave goes through afterwards some minor deviations can be found in both simulations at the leeward side of piles g3 and g4 but curves of present model are more in line with experimental data fig 7 shows the time histories of dimensionless velocity components at probes v1 and v2 it can be found that for probe v1 on the waveward side both numerical models give satisfactory predictions to the horizontal and vertical velocity for probe v2 on the leeward side numerical results still show good accuracy during the actions of leading wave but some notable differences arise afterwards especially for vertical velocity it should be noticed that for solitary waves generated through different methods by a piston type wavemaker in jiang et al 2015 s experiment or by a velocity boundary of dirichlet type in present model intensity of trailing waves can vary greatly therefore deviations of numerical results at g3 g4 and v2 may be partly explained by the differences of trailing waves nevertheless since this study mainly focuses on the actions of leading wave present results are considered acceptable errors of the finally adopted mesh 2 in maximum values at all the probes are listed in table 2 it can be found that errors at most probes are below 5 even for probe p4 where violent breaking of free surface takes place error of the maximum dynamic pressure is below 10 therefore present numerical model can be proved reliable in reproducing the flow field and predicting the hydrodynamic characteristics in the vicinity of pile breakwater 2 4 simulation conditions a single row pile breakwater under construction in zhoushan islands east china is chosen as the prototype of this study the breakwater is consisted of closely spaced steel pipes with a diameter of 1 m and the local water depth is about 4 m simulation is conducted under a scale of 9 100 so that the time scale and velocity scale both equal to 0 3 under froude law can be converted conveniently between the model and the prototype the effective length of solitary wave can be evaluated as the part containing 95 of the total mass which covers 2 12 h h h 1 2 at each side of the wave crest dean and dalrymple 1991 the maximum effective wave length in the present study is 3 41 m with h 0 36 m and h i h 0 2 therefore total length of the numerical wave flume is chosen as 16 m and the pile breakwater is located 10 m downstream the inlet boundary of flume this distance is at least 3 times the effective length of incident waves for all the conditions any hydrodynamic parameter of pile breakwater φ φ can stand for wave run up ru jet velocity u x or horizontal wave force f x in this paper can be expressed as a function of following physical quantities 13 φ f ρ g μ h i h s d u m where ρ is water density g is gravitational acceleration μ is dynamic viscosity h i is incident wave height h is water depth s is the distance between centers of adjacent piles d is pile diameter and u m is the maximum horizontal velocity of water particles by using ρ g and h as fundamental quantities and substituting u m g h h i h for solitary wave into eq 13 dimensionless expressions can be derived by dimensional analysis as 14 r u h f 1 h i h s d d h 15 f x ρ g h 3 f 2 h i h s d d h 16 u x g h f 3 h i h s d d h according to eqs 14 16 dimensionless parameters h i h s d and d h are major factors to the hydrodynamic parameters of pile breakwater under solitary waves in following discussions of this paper wave run up is normalized as ru h and jet velocity is normalized as u x g h 1 2 considering the physical meaning wave force is normalized as f x ρ g a b h 1 where a b d h i h is the theoretical blocking area of each pile systematic investigations are made into the effects of h i h s d and d h all the simulation conditions are listed in table 3 and conditions with different d h under identical h i h and s d are distinguished by suffix a b or c before the run of each case incident wave height is calibrated in an empty numerical flume with the same grid size as mesh 2 a numerical wave gauge is arranged at the position of pile breakwater 10 m downstream the inlet boundary and input parameters at the inlet boundary are adjusted until the demanded wave height h i is obtained 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow pattern to clarify the nature of solitary wave interactions with pile breakwater evolution of free surface and velocity field is analyzed in this section a general flow pattern is observed in different cases and a typical case with s d 1 2963 h i h 0 4 and d h 0 33 case 7b in table 3 is taken as an example fig 8 shows a sequence of free surfaces together with contours of dimensionless horizontal velocity during the passage of incident wave it can be found that with the approach of wave crest water in front of the piles begins to bank up t h g 1 2 23 5 in fig 8a on arrival of the wave crest t h g 1 2 24 7 in fig 8b it rises to the maximum height and then plunges downward through the slots into the leeward free surface afterwards t h g 1 2 26 5 in fig 8c the run up water on the front surface of piles begins to fall back and wave reflection takes place on the waveward side meanwhile a hump is observed behind the rear of each pile finally t h g 1 2 27 7 in fig 8d a backflow is formed on the leeward side accompanied with fierce wave breaking according to abovementioned process evolution of free surface can be divided into four stages i e rising maximum run up plunging and backflow these stages correspond to fig 8a d respectively accompanied with the wave motion two types of jet flow are identified on both vertical and horizontal planes fig 9 shows the development of plunging jets on the vertical section of z 0 5s in the center of slots case 7b in rising stage t h g 1 2 23 5 in fig 9a water in the slots gets accelerated due to flow contraction and the flow direction turns upwards after reaching the maximum height t h g 1 2 24 7 in fig 9b the falling water pierces into the leeward free surface as a plunging jet two rollers swirling structures a major one above and a minor one beneath the plunging jet are generated by the large velocity gradient on jet boundaries t h g 1 2 26 5 in fig 9c to some extent flow pattern in this stage resembles the flow over a weir which has been observed by si et al 2018 finally in backflow stage t h g 1 2 27 7 in fig 9d the major roller develops into a backflow and leads to the breaking of free surface downstream the piles while the minor roller gradually damps when the backflow goes through the piles against the wave direction water banks up again at the rear of piles therefore flow will reciprocates through the slots until the wave energy gets completely dissipated fig 10 shows the development of free jets on the horizontal section of y 2 5d which is not directly disturbed by the plunging jets in rising stage t h g 1 2 23 5 in fig 10a as the wave crest approaches free jets are generated in the slots and separation of boundary layer begins to take place on the piles forming a pair of vertices on both sides of jet then with the arrival of wave crest t h g 1 2 24 7 in fig 10b the intensity of free jets reaches the maximum level and the vortices are driven downstream by the velocity gradient on jet boundaries after the passage of wave crest t h g 1 2 26 5 in fig 10c free jets keep moving by inertia and bring the vortices downstream finally the jets are completely dissipated and the vortices decay subsequently this process is completely different from the alternate shedding vortices downstream a single pile 3 2 hydrodynamic parameters exposed to tsunami like waves the structural safety of pile breakwater is threatened by multiple factors the piles bear great impacts during the wave actions and the water running up along the piles may cause damage to superstructures additionally high speed jets are generated in the slots leading to severe local scour and hence weakening the capacity of foundations therefore predictions to these hydrodynamic parameters are crucial for the structural design this section interprets the changing tendencies of wave run up wave force and jet velocity a parametric study is then carried out on the effects of dimensionless wave height h i h relative center spacing s d and relative pile diameter d h finally semi empirical formulas are established for quick predictions to the maximum value of these parameters 3 2 1 wave run up wave run up on the piles is discussed in this subsection fig 11 presents the time histories of water elevations in the typical condition case 7b numerical wave gauges wg1 wg5 are arranged clockwise on the circumference of pile and wg6 is in the center of the slot it can be found from the curves that run up mainly takes place on the waveward pile surface wg1 and wg2 and the maximum run up height appears at the front stagnation point wg1 two successive crests are observed at probes on the leeward pile surface wg4 and wg5 the first one comes up with the passage of the wave crest while the second is induced by the lateral compression of plunging jets in the slots which has been illustrated previously in fig 9c moreover due to the near trapping of scattering wave an upwelling takes place in the slots wg3 and wg6 as the wave crest goes through therefore the peak value at wg6 exceeds that of wg3 and the wave surface shows a sharp ridge shown in fig 9b after the passage of wave crest all the curves show continuous fluctuations indicating the breaking of free surface similar patterns with case 7b are also found in the other cases more detailed flow characteristics e g air entrapment and vorticity field can be found in the paper by frantzis et al 2020 dimensionless run up height ru h in all the conditions are listed in table 4 fig 12 shows the effects of dimensionless wave height h i h and center spacing s d it can be found in fig 12a that ru h increases with the increase of h i h and the increment shows a rising trend due to the increasing nonlinearity of incident wave meanwhile as shown in fig 12b ru h increases with the decrease of s d this tendency indicates that with smaller center spacing of adjacent piles more wave energy gets concentrated and then transforms into potential energy moreover d h is found to have little effect to ru h since the scale of pile is negligible comparing with the length of solitary wave which is theoretically infinite in practical objects pile breakwater is usually combined with superstructures such as wharves or platforms to help evaluating the air gap between the run up water and the deck of superstructures a formula for maximum run up of solitary wave is derived on the basis of run up on a single pile according to niedzwecki and duggal 1992 based on the hypothesis that kinetic energy of water particle on the wave crest will completely transform into potential energy maximum wave run up on a single pile can be calculated as 17 r u a c u m 2 2 g where a is wave amplitude u m is the maximum velocity on the wave crest and c is an empirical coefficient by substituting a h i and u m g h h i h into eq 17 run up of solitary wave on a single pile can be written as 18 r u h i 0 5 c h i 2 h here for pile breakwater the concentration effect of closely spaced piles to wave energy is expressed by a power function of s d therefore as a correction to eq 18 a semi empirical formula for the maximum dimensionless run up on pile breakwater is proposed as 19 r u h h i h a 1 h i h 2 1 b 1 s d c 1 when s d tends to eq 19 reduces to the form of eq 18 indicating the rationality of its form values of constant parameters a 1 b 1 c 1 are fitted from simulation results in table 3 as a 1 1 253 b 1 0 608 c 1 4 717 a fairly good correlation is achieved between results in table 3 and obtained by eq 19 with r 2 0 998 as shown in fig 13 particularly a notable phenomenon is observed that under some extreme scenarios the height of upwelling in the slots may even exceed the maximum run up fig 14 compares the time histories of water elevations at wg1 and wg6 in an extreme case with s d 1 2963 h i h 0 5 and d h 0 33 case 8b in table 2 with peak value at wg6 found slightly larger than wg1 fig 15 shows the transient free surface at the instant of maximum run up t h g 1 2 24 1 in case 8b and water elevation in the slots goes apparently higher than that on the waveward pile surface this phenomenon only occurs when s d 1 2963 or 1 1111 and h i h 0 5 in cases of this paper and may be induced by the combined effects of wave nonlinearity and focused wave energy in contracting slots splashing and air entrapping are observed during the upwelling process making it difficult to locate the position of maximum upwelling therefore prediction to the maximum upwelling is not given in present work more attention should be paid to this phenomenon in future study with a wider range of h i h and s d taken into consideration 3 2 2 horizontal wave force characteristics of horizontal wave force on each pile are analyzed in this subsection since wave force is usually in line with wave elevations time histories of dimensionless horizontal wave force in solid lines together with water elevation at wg1 in dash lines are shown in fig 16 conditions of different incident wave heights and blockage ratios of piles are discussed with d h 0 33 it is obvious that under small incident wave height h i h 0 2 in fig 16a c e on the left column curve of horizontal force goes almost synchronously with that of wave elevation and both curves change smoothly in contrast under large incident wave height h i h 0 5 in fig 16b d f on the right column a remarkable lagging behind is observed on curve of wave elevation and a secondary crest appears on both curves after the passage of wave crest marked by dash circles the secondary crests under large incident wave height can be explained by the run up and fall back of water along the piles fig 17 shows the free surface together with contour of dimensionless vertical velocity in a typical case with h i h 0 5 s d 1 2963 and d h 0 33 case 8b in table 2 it can be found that at the instant of maximum horizontal force t h g 1 2 23 2 in fig 17a positive vertical velocity remains on free surface in front of the piles thus water keeps going upwards by inertia and the maximum run up comes up a bit later afterwards during the declining of wave force water falls from the maximum height along the piles and then slams on the waveward free surface at a high speed t h g 1 2 25 5 in fig 17b additional pressure is applied to the front surface of piles causing a transient rally of horizontal wave force i e the secondary crest on the curve moreover a transient stagnation of water elevation is also induced by the reaction of free surface to the falling water which corresponds to the secondary crest of water elevation at wg1 to conclude this phenomenon is resulted by the lagging behind of the run up and fall back of water on the front surface of piles it resembles the ringing and secondary load cycle on a single pile which has been analyzed by rainey 2007 and li et al 2014 responses of piles to the secondary crest of wave force remains to be further investigated considering these nonlinear phenomena it is difficult to mathematically express the whole impacting process therefore the emphasis here is laid to the maximum value of horizontal wave force f m a x which is one of the most concerned quantities in structural design an explicit formula is proposed here for a fast prediction to f m a x on the reference of morison equation morison et al 1950 in general it is composed of the sum of drag force and inertia force but according to dean and dalrymple 1991 wave force under large kc number theoretically infinite for solitary waves is dominated by the drag component and the inertia component is negligible jiang et al 2015 and yao et al 2018 utilized the drag component to fit wave force and obtained acceptable results 20 f x c d h η 1 2 ρ d u 2 d y in their work wave elevation η and corresponding horizontal velocity u are obtained from simulation results this method gives a more realistic expression to the incident wave but these parameters are implicit and may lead to some inconvenience in applications therefore a further simplification to eq 20 is made here for an explicit expression to the maximum horizontal force 21 f max 1 2 c d ρ a b u m 2 in eq 21 blocking area of each pile is evaluated as a b d h i h analytical velocity on the crest u m g h h i h drag coefficient c d is fitted from simulation results c d calculated by the measured f m a x in all the conditions are listed in table 5 fig 18 shows the effects of dimensionless wave height h i h and center spacing s d it can be found that drag coefficient c d increases with the decrease of both h i h and s d roughly following a relationship of power function with both parameters d h is found to have negligible effect to c d since data points with identical h i h and s d almost coincide with each other according to the changing tendencies of c d with h i h and s d an empirical formula is written as 22 c d 1 2 a 2 h i h b 2 s d c 2 when s d tends to c d reduces to the constant 1 2 which is the widely adopted experimental value of drag coefficient for a single pile schlichting and kestin 1961 values of constant parameters a 2 b 2 c 2 are fitted from simulation results in table 5 as a 2 1 919 b 2 1 266 c 2 4 009 fig 19 compares the fitted calculated from eq 22 and simulated in table 5 results of c d a satisfactory correlation is achieved with r 2 0 9964 by this way given parameters of the structure and the incident wave f m a x can be directly predicted as 23 f max 1 2 1 919 h i h 1 266 s d 4 009 1 2 ρ d h i h h i h g h 2 3 2 3 jet velocity experimental observations to the shape of scour holes at the base of pile breakwater indicate that xu et al 2019 the maximum depth appears in the slots under the shear of jets hayashi et al 1968 also found that maximum scour depth follows a nearly linear relationship with the maximum jet velocity in slots of pile breakwater therefore maximum jet velocity is one of the major factors to the local scour of pile breakwater this subsection quantitatively investigates the jet velocity in the slots during the actions of solitary wave and a formula is proposed to predict the maximum of depth averaged jet velocity local scour is not directly investigated here but present results may be referential for future studies on the maximum scour depth of pile breakwater under solitary waves fig 20 shows the time histories of horizontal velocity u x in the slots in case 7b with s d 1 2963 h i h 0 4 and d h 0 33 five velocity probes are arranged on the centerline of the slot at vertical positions y h 1 6 1 3 1 2 2 3 5 6 it can be found that curves of u x in the slot keep increasing before the arrival of wave crest and the maximum value of each curve almost coincides the curves then decline and fluctuate under the actions of the plunging jet and backflow since the backflow goes through the probe at y h 1 6 a significant negative value of u x is observed on this curve it can be found from figs 9b and 20 that distribution of maximum u x in the slots is almost uniform similar conclusion was also drawn experimentally by huang and yuan 2010 therefore mean jet velocity along the depth u x can be calculated by the average of peak values at probes in the slots simulation results of dimensionless u x in all the conditions are listed in table 6 and effects of dimensionless incident wave height h i h and center space of adjacent piles s d are revealed in fig 21 as shown in fig 21a u x g h 1 2 increases with the increase of h i h and the increment shows a declining trend that is because an increasing proportion of wave energy is dissipated near the free surface instead of transmitted through the slots and fig 21b shows that u x g h 1 2 increases with the decrease of s d since the flow contraction in the slots gets strengthened besides because of the similarity of jet profile albertson et al 1950 effect of d h to u x g h 1 2 is found to be insignificant under the same h i h and s d according to the changing tendencies in fig 21 u x g h 1 2 is assumed to follow a relationship of power function with h i h and s d an empirical formula for u x g h 1 2 is written as eq 17 to reflect the combined effects of wave nonlinearity and flow contraction 24 u x g h h i h 1 a 3 h i h b 3 s d c 3 when s d tends to eq 15 reduces to the analytical velocity on the crest of solitary wave hence the form of eq 21 is reasonable according to the simulation data in table 5 values of constant parameters a 3 b 3 c 3 are fitted as a 3 1 062 b 3 0 770 c 3 2 459 a quite good correlation is reached between simulation results in table 4 and predictions of eq 22 with r 2 0 9945 as shown in fig 22 eq 22 may give a base for the follow up researches to the local scour of pile breakwater and experimental studies will be made in the future to obtain the functional relationships between maximum scour depth and u x 4 conclusions in this paper hydrodynamic behaviors of a single row pile breakwater under solitary waves is numerically studied using openfoam flow patterns are interpreted and hydrodynamic parameters of engineering interest i e wave run up ru wave force f m a x and mean jet velocity in slots u x are investigated quantitatively parametric analysis are carried out on effects of h i h s d and d h to above parameters and main findings are listed as follows 1 two types of jet flow are identified in the vicinity of the piles the first is the plunging jets diving into the free surface on the leeward side of piles which lead to backflow and wave breaking the second is free jets generated by the flow contraction in the slots maximum velocity of free jets u x is found to increase with the increase of h i h and the decrease of s d while the influence of d h is negligible formula for u x is fitted from simulation results it may be referential for the depth of local scour 2 maximum wave run up appears at the front point of piles it is found to increase with the increase of h i h and the decrease of s d but almost independent of d h a semi empirical formula for maximum run up is established based on that of a single pile which helps evaluating the air gap of superstructures specially in scenarios of large wave height and small spacing of piles the height of upwelling in the slots may exceed the maximum run up 3 a quick prediction to the maximum horizontal wave force is proposed by a simplification to morison equation drag coefficient of each pile c d is found to increase with the decrease of both h i h and s d while d h has little influence particularly under large wave height a secondary crest on time history of horizontal wave force appears when the run up water falls back along the piles it slams on the free surface in front of piles and causes additional positive

20492,pile breakwaters are widely used for coastal protection to ensure the safety and hence serviceability of pile breakwaters under disastrous waves like tsunamis an accurate estimation of wave actions exerted on them is necessary this work investigates the hydrodynamic properties of solitary waves resemble tsunami waves interacting with a single row pile breakwater using openfoam large eddy simulation les is utilized to deal with the turbulent flow and the free surface is reproduced by a scheme named thinc qq tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing with quadratic surface representation and gaussian quadrature this numerical model is validated against published experimental data using the verified model flow patterns near the piles are interpreted a parametric study is then conducted on the influences of incident wave height blockage ratio and pile diameter to the hydrodynamic parameters of pile breakwater which include wave run up wave force and jet velocity finally semi empirical formulas are established for quick and reliable evaluation of these parameters the research work can provide guideline for practical design of pile breakwater keywords solitary wave pile breakwater flow pattern hydrodynamic parameters openfoam 1 introduction breakwaters are important infrastructures protecting the coastal area from disastrous waves in waters with large depth and soft seabed traditional gravity breakwaters suffer from construction difficulties and pile breakwater is widely adopted some projects have been under construction in zhoushan islands east china shown in fig 1 under the impact of tsunami like waves it can effectively reduce the run up and wave force on the sheltered objects huang and yuan 2010 yao et al 2020 to prevent structural failure accurate estimations to the hydrodynamic responses of pile breakwater under extreme waves are required in engineering practice however pile breakwater performs more complex hydrodynamic behaviors than ordinary pile groups which involves wave run up nonlinear impacts breaking free surface and violent jet flow these features are difficult to reproduce numerically or measure experimentally therefore knowledge on the wave interactions with pile breakwater is still insufficient wave transmission and reflection at pile breakwater characterized by transmission coefficient k t and reflection coefficient k r have been studied extensively effects of pile configurations and wave conditions were extensively examined through physical experiments and numerous semi empirical formulas have been established hayashi and kano 1966 truitt and herbich 1987 herbich and douglas 1988 huang 2007a huang and yuan 2010 analytical solutions of k t and k r were also derived from potential theory empirical coefficients were introduced to account for the nonlinear dissipation of wave energy and satisfactory agreement can be reached with experimental data huang 2007b koraim 2011 zhu 2011 these works gave applicable predictions to k t and k r but detailed flow field information is lacked and further investigations are still expected in terms of structural design wave force and run up are the most concerned parameters which give design references to the strength of foundations and air gap of superstructures respectively huang and chen 2020 experimentally observed that when exposed to regular or irregular waves the wave pressure is amplified at the corners and junctions of pile breakwater and superstructures are mainly affected by the lift load of run up waves through simulations and experiments mojtahedi et al 2020 pointed out that waves forces can be reduced through optimum designs to the cross section and installation angle of piles and circular piles are subjected to the minimum wave force under the same blocking area in addition to conventional wave conditions survivability of pile breakwater under disastrous waves like tsunamis and storm surges must be evaluated and ensured solitary waves have resemblances to tsunamis rossetto et al 2011 luo et al 2019 ren et al 2019 and hence are widely adopted as artificial substitutes to tsunami waves jiang et al 2015 numerically investigated the impacts of solitary wave to a single row pile breakwater both wave force and run up were found to be greatly magnified in comparison with a single pile and morison equation was proved to be an acceptable fit to the time history of wave force yao et al 2018 subsequently considered the condition of a double row pile breakwater maximum wave force and run up on both rows were found to increase with the increase of incident wave height and blockage ratio of piles and an empirical formula was proposed to predict the wave force of piles in each row jiang et al 2019 simulated the impacts of solitary wave breaking on sloping beach and the maximum slamming force to the piles was empirically formulated as a function of incident wave height blockage ratio and slope angle of seabed frantzis et al 2020 reproduced jiang et al 2015 s work and found that pile diameter has little effect to the maximum height of run up these works provide some design reference but a direct prediction to the maximum wave run up is still lacked moreover most investigations were conducted within a limited range of incident wave height and blockage ratio of piles and special phenomena e g ringing and secondary load cycle may come up under extreme scenarios in fact all the hydrodynamic characteristics of pile breakwater are closely related to the local flow field some studies to the flow pattern near pile structures have been conducted under steep regular waves two typical patterns of wave scattering type 1 and type 2 around a single pile were observed to successively come up in every wave period swan and sheikh 2015 sun et al 2016 mohseni et al 2018 type 1 is induced by the run up and falling back of wave crest while type 2 is associated with flow around the pile for ordinary pile groups or arrays near trapping and upwelling of waves were observed between adjacent piles kamath et al 2015 yoon et al 2016 cao and wan 2017 however flow patterns near the pile breakwater have some particularities the piles are very closely spaced with a large blockage ratio such as 90 or more meanwhile it covers a large width thus wave diffraction is restrained therefore violent jets are generated in the slots of adjacent piles due to flow contraction hayashi et al 1968 derived the depth averaged jet velocity in the slots from the bernoulli equation and continuity equation moreover a nearly linear relationship was experimentally found between maximum scour depth and maximum jet velocity frantzis et al 2020 noticed the air trapping in the leeward regions of piles which promotes the dissipation of wave energy a completely different pattern of vorticity field from a single pile is also observed the above studies have shed some insight into the flow pattern in the vicinity pile breakwaters but further understanding to the flow mechanism is still expected moreover quantitative prediction to the jet velocity under extreme waves like tsunamis is necessary which helps evaluating the depth of local scour this paper aims to interpret the evolution of wave field and jet flow near a single row pile breakwater and to work out semi empirical formulas for hydrodynamic parameters of engineering interest i e wave run up wave force and jet velocity the tsunami wave as one of the most destructive waves is considered the highly verified and recognized cfd computational fluid dynamics code openfoam is adopted for accurate prediction of the complex wave structure interaction process the novelty of this study lies in a new interpretation to the flow patterns and quick predictions to the hydrodynamic parameters of pile breakwater the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 numerical model is introduced and validated against available experimental data in section 3 evolution of free surface and jet flow are interpreted afterwards parametric analysis is conducted to the effects of incident wave height blockage ratio and pile diameter special phenomena under nonlinear wave actions are analyzed and semi empirical formulas are established finally main conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 model

experiment of jiang et al 2015 in which a solitary wave is generated by a piston type wavemaker and goes through a single row pile breakwater simulations are also conducted using openfoam by jiang et al 2015 fig 3 shows the sketch of the experiment diameter of piles d is 0 05 m distance between centers of adjacent piles s is 0 08 m incident wave height h i is 0 07 m water depth h is 0 20 m wave gauges g1 g4 and advs acoustic doppler velocimeter v1 v2 are arranged along the flume and dynamic pressure sensors p1 p4 are set on the pile surface exact locations of these probes are marked in fig 3 grid sensitivity in the vicinity of piles is tested to ensure that simulation results are grid independent body fitted grids are utilized to discretize the computational domain o type grid is adopted in the vicinity of piles as shown in fig 4 three sets of mesh with different grid numbers on the circumference of piles are constructed 40 grids for mesh 1 64 grids for mesh 2 and 96 grids for mesh 3 mesh information not including the boundary layer is listed in table 1 for all the meshes thickness of grids on wall boundaries is strictly checked to ensure that y dimensionless distance to the wall is limited under 1 simulations were conducted on the hpc center of zhejiang university zhoushan campus which runs under redhat enterprise linux 7 4 x64 operating system and is equipped with 2 processors intel xeon gold 6132 14 core 2 6 ghz on each compute node all the cases were run using mpi parallel computing on 26 cores and computational time for mesh 1 coarse mesh 2 medium and mesh 3 refined is approximately 8h 21h and 96h respectively fig 5 compares the time histories of dimensionless dynamic pressure at p1 p4 which is the most sensitive parameter to grid resolution results by mesh 1 mesh 3 are compared with the experimental and numerical data of jiang et al 2015 since results at symmetrical probes p2 and p3 are almost identical only curves at p2 are plotted here at the front point of pile p1 shown in fig 5a all the numerical results show great agreement with experimental data and even the coarsest mesh mesh 1 can accurately predict the maximum dynamic pressure at the side point p2 shown in fig 5b the increasing rate of experimental curve shows a tendency of slowdown and then speedup again before reaching its crest which looks like a platform mesh 2 and mesh 3 clearly identify this tendency on the contrast mesh 1 greatly underestimates the maximum dynamic pressure while the simulation of jiang et al 2015 shows much greater deviation from experimental data and the platform is not obvious at the rear of pile p4 shown in fig 5c a significant secondary crest is experimentally observed before the major crest this secondary crest is numerically reproduced by mesh 1 mesh 3 but missed in jiang et al 2015 s result it can be found that both mesh 2 and mesh 3 give satisfactory predictions to the dynamic pressure on pile surface since mesh 3 only shows insignificant advantage over mesh 2 for the balance of computational efficiency and accuracy a resolution of 64 grids on pile circumference mesh 2 is finally adopted results of wave surface and velocity components by mesh 2 are also compared with jiang et al 2015 fig 6 is time histories of dimensionless water elevation at wave gauges g1 g4 both numerical results agree quite well with experimental data as the leading wave goes through afterwards some minor deviations can be found in both simulations at the leeward side of piles g3 and g4 but curves of present model are more in line with experimental data fig 7 shows the time histories of dimensionless velocity components at probes v1 and v2 it can be found that for probe v1 on the waveward side both numerical models give satisfactory predictions to the horizontal and vertical velocity for probe v2 on the leeward side numerical results still show good accuracy during the actions of leading wave but some notable differences arise afterwards especially for vertical velocity it should be noticed that for solitary waves generated through different methods by a piston type wavemaker in jiang et al 2015 s experiment or by a velocity boundary of dirichlet type in present model intensity of trailing waves can vary greatly therefore deviations of numerical results at g3 g4 and v2 may be partly explained by the differences of trailing waves nevertheless since this study mainly focuses on the actions of leading wave present results are considered acceptable errors of the finally adopted mesh 2 in maximum values at all the probes are listed in table 2 it can be found that errors at most probes are below 5 even for probe p4 where violent breaking of free surface takes place error of the maximum dynamic pressure is below 10 therefore present numerical model can be proved reliable in reproducing the flow field and predicting the hydrodynamic characteristics in the vicinity of pile breakwater 2 4 simulation conditions a single row pile breakwater under construction in zhoushan islands east china is chosen as the prototype of this study the breakwater is consisted of closely spaced steel pipes with a diameter of 1 m and the local water depth is about 4 m simulation is conducted under a scale of 9 100 so that the time scale and velocity scale both equal to 0 3 under froude law can be converted conveniently between the model and the prototype the effective length of solitary wave can be evaluated as the part containing 95 of the total mass which covers 2 12 h h h 1 2 at each side of the wave crest dean and dalrymple 1991 the maximum effective wave length in the present study is 3 41 m with h 0 36 m and h i h 0 2 therefore total length of the numerical wave flume is chosen as 16 m and the pile breakwater is located 10 m downstream the inlet boundary of flume this distance is at least 3 times the effective length of incident waves for all the conditions any hydrodynamic parameter of pile breakwater φ φ can stand for wave run up ru jet velocity u x or horizontal wave force f x in this paper can be expressed as a function of following physical quantities 13 φ f ρ g μ h i h s d u m where ρ is water density g is gravitational acceleration μ is dynamic viscosity h i is incident wave height h is water depth s is the distance between centers of adjacent piles d is pile diameter and u m is the maximum horizontal velocity of water particles by using ρ g and h as fundamental quantities and substituting u m g h h i h for solitary wave into eq 13 dimensionless expressions can be derived by dimensional analysis as 14 r u h f 1 h i h s d d h 15 f x ρ g h 3 f 2 h i h s d d h 16 u x g h f 3 h i h s d d h according to eqs 14 16 dimensionless parameters h i h s d and d h are major factors to the hydrodynamic parameters of pile breakwater under solitary waves in following discussions of this paper wave run up is normalized as ru h and jet velocity is normalized as u x g h 1 2 considering the physical meaning wave force is normalized as f x ρ g a b h 1 where a b d h i h is the theoretical blocking area of each pile systematic investigations are made into the effects of h i h s d and d h all the simulation conditions are listed in table 3 and conditions with different d h under identical h i h and s d are distinguished by suffix a b or c before the run of each case incident wave height is calibrated in an empty numerical flume with the same grid size as mesh 2 a numerical wave gauge is arranged at the position of pile breakwater 10 m downstream the inlet boundary and input parameters at the inlet boundary are adjusted until the demanded wave height h i is obtained 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow pattern to clarify the nature of solitary wave interactions with pile breakwater evolution of free surface and velocity field is analyzed in this section a general flow pattern is observed in different cases and a typical case with s d 1 2963 h i h 0 4 and d h 0 33 case 7b in table 3 is taken as an example fig 8 shows a sequence of free surfaces together with contours of dimensionless horizontal velocity during the passage of incident wave it can be found that with the approach of wave crest water in front of the piles begins to bank up t h g 1 2 23 5 in fig 8a on arrival of the wave crest t h g 1 2 24 7 in fig 8b it rises to the maximum height and then plunges downward through the slots into the leeward free surface afterwards t h g 1 2 26 5 in fig 8c the run up water on the front surface of piles begins to fall back and wave reflection takes place on the waveward side meanwhile a hump is observed behind the rear of each pile finally t h g 1 2 27 7 in fig 8d a backflow is formed on the leeward side accompanied with fierce wave breaking according to abovementioned process evolution of free surface can be divided into four stages i e rising maximum run up plunging and backflow these stages correspond to fig 8a d respectively accompanied with the wave motion two types of jet flow are identified on both vertical and horizontal planes fig 9 shows the development of plunging jets on the vertical section of z 0 5s in the center of slots case 7b in rising stage t h g 1 2 23 5 in fig 9a water in the slots gets accelerated due to flow contraction and the flow direction turns upwards after reaching the maximum height t h g 1 2 24 7 in fig 9b the falling water pierces into the leeward free surface as a plunging jet two rollers swirling structures a major one above and a minor one beneath the plunging jet are generated by the large velocity gradient on jet boundaries t h g 1 2 26 5 in fig 9c to some extent flow pattern in this stage resembles the flow over a weir which has been observed by si et al 2018 finally in backflow stage t h g 1 2 27 7 in fig 9d the major roller develops into a backflow and leads to the breaking of free surface downstream the piles while the minor roller gradually damps when the backflow goes through the piles against the wave direction water banks up again at the rear of piles therefore flow will reciprocates through the slots until the wave energy gets completely dissipated fig 10 shows the development of free jets on the horizontal section of y 2 5d which is not directly disturbed by the plunging jets in rising stage t h g 1 2 23 5 in fig 10a as the wave crest approaches free jets are generated in the slots and separation of boundary layer begins to take place on the piles forming a pair of vertices on both sides of jet then with the arrival of wave crest t h g 1 2 24 7 in fig 10b the intensity of free jets reaches the maximum level and the vortices are driven downstream by the velocity gradient on jet boundaries after the passage of wave crest t h g 1 2 26 5 in fig 10c free jets keep moving by inertia and bring the vortices downstream finally the jets are completely dissipated and the vortices decay subsequently this process is completely different from the alternate shedding vortices downstream a single pile 3 2 hydrodynamic parameters exposed to tsunami like waves the structural safety of pile breakwater is threatened by multiple factors the piles bear great impacts during the wave actions and the water running up along the piles may cause damage to superstructures additionally high speed jets are generated in the slots leading to severe local scour and hence weakening the capacity of foundations therefore predictions to these hydrodynamic parameters are crucial for the structural design this section interprets the changing tendencies of wave run up wave force and jet velocity a parametric study is then carried out on the effects of dimensionless wave height h i h relative center spacing s d and relative pile diameter d h finally semi empirical formulas are established for quick predictions to the maximum value of these parameters 3 2 1 wave run up wave run up on the piles is discussed in this subsection fig 11 presents the time histories of water elevations in the typical condition case 7b numerical wave gauges wg1 wg5 are arranged clockwise on the circumference of pile and wg6 is in the center of the slot it can be found from the curves that run up mainly takes place on the waveward pile surface wg1 and wg2 and the maximum run up height appears at the front stagnation point wg1 two successive crests are observed at probes on the leeward pile surface wg4 and wg5 the first one comes up with the passage of the wave crest while the second is induced by the lateral compression of plunging jets in the slots which has been illustrated previously in fig 9c moreover due to the near trapping of scattering wave an upwelling takes place in the slots wg3 and wg6 as the wave crest goes through therefore the peak value at wg6 exceeds that of wg3 and the wave surface shows a sharp ridge shown in fig 9b after the passage of wave crest all the curves show continuous fluctuations indicating the breaking of free surface similar patterns with case 7b are also found in the other cases more detailed flow characteristics e g air entrapment and vorticity field can be found in the paper by frantzis et al 2020 dimensionless run up height ru h in all the conditions are listed in table 4 fig 12 shows the effects of dimensionless wave height h i h and center spacing s d it can be found in fig 12a that ru h increases with the increase of h i h and the increment shows a rising trend due to the increasing nonlinearity of incident wave meanwhile as shown in fig 12b ru h increases with the decrease of s d this tendency indicates that with smaller center spacing of adjacent piles more wave energy gets concentrated and then transforms into potential energy moreover d h is found to have little effect to ru h since the scale of pile is negligible comparing with the length of solitary wave which is theoretically infinite in practical objects pile breakwater is usually combined with superstructures such as wharves or platforms to help evaluating the air gap between the run up water and the deck of superstructures a formula for maximum run up of solitary wave is derived on the basis of run up on a single pile according to niedzwecki and duggal 1992 based on the hypothesis that kinetic energy of water particle on the wave crest will completely transform into potential energy maximum wave run up on a single pile can be calculated as 17 r u a c u m 2 2 g where a is wave amplitude u m is the maximum velocity on the wave crest and c is an empirical coefficient by substituting a h i and u m g h h i h into eq 17 run up of solitary wave on a single pile can be written as 18 r u h i 0 5 c h i 2 h here for pile breakwater the concentration effect of closely spaced piles to wave energy is expressed by a power function of s d therefore as a correction to eq 18 a semi empirical formula for the maximum dimensionless run up on pile breakwater is proposed as 19 r u h h i h a 1 h i h 2 1 b 1 s d c 1 when s d tends to eq 19 reduces to the form of eq 18 indicating the rationality of its form values of constant parameters a 1 b 1 c 1 are fitted from simulation results in table 3 as a 1 1 253 b 1 0 608 c 1 4 717 a fairly good correlation is achieved between results in table 3 and obtained by eq 19 with r 2 0 998 as shown in fig 13 particularly a notable phenomenon is observed that under some extreme scenarios the height of upwelling in the slots may even exceed the maximum run up fig 14 compares the time histories of water elevations at wg1 and wg6 in an extreme case with s d 1 2963 h i h 0 5 and d h 0 33 case 8b in table 2 with peak value at wg6 found slightly larger than wg1 fig 15 shows the transient free surface at the instant of maximum run up t h g 1 2 24 1 in case 8b and water elevation in the slots goes apparently higher than that on the waveward pile surface this phenomenon only occurs when s d 1 2963 or 1 1111 and h i h 0 5 in cases of this paper and may be induced by the combined effects of wave nonlinearity and focused wave energy in contracting slots splashing and air entrapping are observed during the upwelling process making it difficult to locate the position of maximum upwelling therefore prediction to the maximum upwelling is not given in present work more attention should be paid to this phenomenon in future study with a wider range of h i h and s d taken into consideration 3 2 2 horizontal wave force characteristics of horizontal wave force on each pile are analyzed in this subsection since wave force is usually in line with wave elevations time histories of dimensionless horizontal wave force in solid lines together with water elevation at wg1 in dash lines are shown in fig 16 conditions of different incident wave heights and blockage ratios of piles are discussed with d h 0 33 it is obvious that under small incident wave height h i h 0 2 in fig 16a c e on the left column curve of horizontal force goes almost synchronously with that of wave elevation and both curves change smoothly in contrast under large incident wave height h i h 0 5 in fig 16b d f on the right column a remarkable lagging behind is observed on curve of wave elevation and a secondary crest appears on both curves after the passage of wave crest marked by dash circles the secondary crests under large incident wave height can be explained by the run up and fall back of water along the piles fig 17 shows the free surface together with contour of dimensionless vertical velocity in a typical case with h i h 0 5 s d 1 2963 and d h 0 33 case 8b in table 2 it can be found that at the instant of maximum horizontal force t h g 1 2 23 2 in fig 17a positive vertical velocity remains on free surface in front of the piles thus water keeps going upwards by inertia and the maximum run up comes up a bit later afterwards during the declining of wave force water falls from the maximum height along the piles and then slams on the waveward free surface at a high speed t h g 1 2 25 5 in fig 17b additional pressure is applied to the front surface of piles causing a transient rally of horizontal wave force i e the secondary crest on the curve moreover a transient stagnation of water elevation is also induced by the reaction of free surface to the falling water which corresponds to the secondary crest of water elevation at wg1 to conclude this phenomenon is resulted by the lagging behind of the run up and fall back of water on the front surface of piles it resembles the ringing and secondary load cycle on a single pile which has been analyzed by rainey 2007 and li et al 2014 responses of piles to the secondary crest of wave force remains to be further investigated considering these nonlinear phenomena it is difficult to mathematically express the whole impacting process therefore the emphasis here is laid to the maximum value of horizontal wave force f m a x which is one of the most concerned quantities in structural design an explicit formula is proposed here for a fast prediction to f m a x on the reference of morison equation morison et al 1950 in general it is composed of the sum of drag force and inertia force but according to dean and dalrymple 1991 wave force under large kc number theoretically infinite for solitary waves is dominated by the drag component and the inertia component is negligible jiang et al 2015 and yao et al 2018 utilized the drag component to fit wave force and obtained acceptable results 20 f x c d h η 1 2 ρ d u 2 d y in their work wave elevation η and corresponding horizontal velocity u are obtained from simulation results this method gives a more realistic expression to the incident wave but these parameters are implicit and may lead to some inconvenience in applications therefore a further simplification to eq 20 is made here for an explicit expression to the maximum horizontal force 21 f max 1 2 c d ρ a b u m 2 in eq 21 blocking area of each pile is evaluated as a b d h i h analytical velocity on the crest u m g h h i h drag coefficient c d is fitted from simulation results c d calculated by the measured f m a x in all the conditions are listed in table 5 fig 18 shows the effects of dimensionless wave height h i h and center spacing s d it can be found that drag coefficient c d increases with the decrease of both h i h and s d roughly following a relationship of power function with both parameters d h is found to have negligible effect to c d since data points with identical h i h and s d almost coincide with each other according to the changing tendencies of c d with h i h and s d an empirical formula is written as 22 c d 1 2 a 2 h i h b 2 s d c 2 when s d tends to c d reduces to the constant 1 2 which is the widely adopted experimental value of drag coefficient for a single pile schlichting and kestin 1961 values of constant parameters a 2 b 2 c 2 are fitted from simulation results in table 5 as a 2 1 919 b 2 1 266 c 2 4 009 fig 19 compares the fitted calculated from eq 22 and simulated in table 5 results of c d a satisfactory correlation is achieved with r 2 0 9964 by this way given parameters of the structure and the incident wave f m a x can be directly predicted as 23 f max 1 2 1 919 h i h 1 266 s d 4 009 1 2 ρ d h i h h i h g h 2 3 2 3 jet velocity experimental observations to the shape of scour holes at the base of pile breakwater indicate that xu et al 2019 the maximum depth appears in the slots under the shear of jets hayashi et al 1968 also found that maximum scour depth follows a nearly linear relationship with the maximum jet velocity in slots of pile breakwater therefore maximum jet velocity is one of the major factors to the local scour of pile breakwater this subsection quantitatively investigates the jet velocity in the slots during the actions of solitary wave and a formula is proposed to predict the maximum of depth averaged jet velocity local scour is not directly investigated here but present results may be referential for future studies on the maximum scour depth of pile breakwater under solitary waves fig 20 shows the time histories of horizontal velocity u x in the slots in case 7b with s d 1 2963 h i h 0 4 and d h 0 33 five velocity probes are arranged on the centerline of the slot at vertical positions y h 1 6 1 3 1 2 2 3 5 6 it can be found that curves of u x in the slot keep increasing before the arrival of wave crest and the maximum value of each curve almost coincides the curves then decline and fluctuate under the actions of the plunging jet and backflow since the backflow goes through the probe at y h 1 6 a significant negative value of u x is observed on this curve it can be found from figs 9b and 20 that distribution of maximum u x in the slots is almost uniform similar conclusion was also drawn experimentally by huang and yuan 2010 therefore mean jet velocity along the depth u x can be calculated by the average of peak values at probes in the slots simulation results of dimensionless u x in all the conditions are listed in table 6 and effects of dimensionless incident wave height h i h and center space of adjacent piles s d are revealed in fig 21 as shown in fig 21a u x g h 1 2 increases with the increase of h i h and the increment shows a declining trend that is because an increasing proportion of wave energy is dissipated near the free surface instead of transmitted through the slots and fig 21b shows that u x g h 1 2 increases with the decrease of s d since the flow contraction in the slots gets strengthened besides because of the similarity of jet profile albertson et al 1950 effect of d h to u x g h 1 2 is found to be insignificant under the same h i h and s d according to the changing tendencies in fig 21 u x g h 1 2 is assumed to follow a relationship of power function with h i h and s d an empirical formula for u x g h 1 2 is written as eq 17 to reflect the combined effects of wave nonlinearity and flow contraction 24 u x g h h i h 1 a 3 h i h b 3 s d c 3 when s d tends to eq 15 reduces to the analytical velocity on the crest of solitary wave hence the form of eq 21 is reasonable according to the simulation data in table 5 values of constant parameters a 3 b 3 c 3 are fitted as a 3 1 062 b 3 0 770 c 3 2 459 a quite good correlation is reached between simulation results in table 4 and predictions of eq 22 with r 2 0 9945 as shown in fig 22 eq 22 may give a base for the follow up researches to the local scour of pile breakwater and experimental studies will be made in the future to obtain the functional relationships between maximum scour depth and u x 4 conclusions in this paper hydrodynamic behaviors of a single row pile breakwater under solitary waves is numerically studied using openfoam flow patterns are interpreted and hydrodynamic parameters of engineering interest i e wave run up ru wave force f m a x and mean jet velocity in slots u x are investigated quantitatively parametric analysis are carried out on effects of h i h s d and d h to above parameters and main findings are listed as follows 1 two types of jet flow are identified in the vicinity of the piles the first is the plunging jets diving into the free surface on the leeward side of piles which lead to backflow and wave breaking the second is free jets generated by the flow contraction in the slots maximum velocity of free jets u x is found to increase with the increase of h i h and the decrease of s d while the influence of d h is negligible formula for u x is fitted from simulation results it may be referential for the depth of local scour 2 maximum wave run up appears at the front point of piles it is found to increase with the increase of h i h and the decrease of s d but almost independent of d h a semi empirical formula for maximum run up is established based on that of a single pile which helps evaluating the air gap of superstructures specially in scenarios of large wave height and small spacing of piles the height of upwelling in the slots may exceed the maximum run up 3 a quick prediction to the maximum horizontal wave force is proposed by a simplification to morison equation drag coefficient of each pile c d is found to increase with the decrease of both h i h and s d while d h has little influence particularly under large wave height a secondary crest on time history of horizontal wave force appears when the run up water falls back along the piles it slams on the free surface in front of piles and causes additional positive

20493,this paper describes numerical simulations of the series and parallel water entry of supersonic projectiles with different head shapes entry velocities interval times and interval distances we focus on the cavity geometry and the drag force characteristics of the projectiles for projectiles entering the water in series no cavity is formed by the second projectile this second projectile impacts and penetrates the water jet and moves inside the cavity formed by the first projectile moreover the impact drag force coefficient of the second projectile is significantly smaller than that of a single projectile entering the water with the same entry conditions the cavitation drag force coefficient of the second projectile fluctuates in the case of projectiles entering the water in parallel the impact drag force coefficient is slightly smaller than that of single projectile water entry after the projectiles impact the water the drag force coefficient declines sharply increases again to form a small peak and then reduces to an approximately constant value that is slightly larger than that of a single projectile entering the water additionally although the outside boundary of the parallel water entry cavity shows a similar shape to that of single projectile water entry the blockage effect causes the inside boundary to form an approximately straight line keywords series parallel water entry cavity geometry drag force characteristics 1 introduction supercavitaion is a special case of cavitation in which an object is completely enveloped in a cavity generated by injecting noncondensable gas into liquid ventilated supercavitation or reducing the pressure to the saturation vapor pressure natural supercavitation it is often employed to reduce skin friction drag for high speed underwater vehicles nesteruk 2012 jiang et al 2019 because of the promising applications of drag force reduction to underwater vehicles ventilated and natural supercavitation flows under low subsonic conditions in water have been extensively investigated for over half a century logvinovich 1973 nesteruk 2012 truscott et al 2014 shao et al 2018 wu et al 2019 huang et al 2019 however there is still a significant lack of fundamental understanding of the detailed physical processes involved in compressible natural supercavitation flow under high subsonic transonic and supersonic conditions in the water in particular the supercavitation flow characteristics of high subsonic transonic and supersonic projectiles entering a water body in series or in parallel require further investigation li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 there have been few reports of high speed compressible supercavitating projectile experiments partly due to their high cost but also for reasons of military secrecy slender body underwater projectile experiments were performed at the institute of fluid mechanics of the national academy of sciences of ukraine to investigate compressible natural supercavitation flow at large slenderness ratios λ 70 200 with underwater speeds ranging from 500 to 1550 m s savchenko 2001 2008 vlasenko 2003 the projectiles were made of steel and titanium with cavitator diameters of 1 2 3 mm and a maximum diameter of 10 17 mm and the experimental images were captured by a high speed camera at 25000 fps to illustrate the compressible natural supercavity geometry with an emphasis on the shock wave characteristics close to the cavitator savchenko 2008 high speed imaging experiments of water entry by high subsonic 975 m s and supersonic 1540 m s projectiles hrubes 2000 kirschner 2001 truscott et al 2014 were conducted by the naval undersea warfare center nuwc at newport rhode island these experiments revealed that projectiles with flat noses tapered tips and high slenderness ratios could pierce the surface at shallow angles and continue to descend through the water column without ricochet truscott et al 2014 experiments with spherical shaped and slender shaped projectiles launching into the water at speeds ranging from 1500 to 2000 m s were conducted at the shock wave research center tohoku university to investigate compressible natural supercavitation flow and drag force characteristics the results indicate that the initial shock wave generated by the projectile impact propagates at approximately the speed of sound and the drag force is smaller than with a single phase flow yamashita et al 2004 although limited experimental results have been published various numerical simulations have investigated compressible natural supercavitation flow and drag force characteristics al ev 1983 wang et al 2017 li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 nonlinear numerical prediction methods for axisymmetric objects entering the water and moving in water with high subsonic transonic and supersonic speeds both with and without viscosity have been used to examine the behavior of compressible supercavitation flow al ev 1983 zigangareeva and kiselev 1998 kunz et al 2001 to investigate both the incompressible and compressible effects of supercavitation in subsonic transonic and supersonic flows the supercavity geometry and drag force calculation methods for slender and disc cavitators can be combined through slender body theory and matched asymptotic expansion serebryakov 2006 serebryakov et al 2009 the results show that cavity length and radius increase sharply and then decrease sharply in transonic flows and the cavitation drag force coefficient mainly depends on the cavitation number and mach number of the disc cavitator i e c x 0 82 c 1 σ m a 1 c x 0 82 c σ m a 1 c 2 7 15 m a 2 1 3 1 m a 2 1 2 1 based on slender body theory first and second order solutions for the supercavity geometry of a slender conical cavitator were obtained by considering the compressibility of the water vasin 2001 the results indicate that there is not much difference between the second order solution and the first order solution for subsonic flow with both producing oval cavities namely the supercavity geometry depends on the cavitation number mach number and slenderness ratio for supersonic flow the first order approximate solution is consistent with that of subsonic flow and the second order approximate solution gives a concave cavity that is inconsistent with the theory vasin 2001 for underwater normal shock waves considering the mass momentum energy equation and tait equation in the water the calculation results predicted that the critical angle of the supersonic flow around a wedge or cone is less than that in the air vasin 2001 nesteruk 2003 investigated the underwater supersonic supercavitation flow based on slender body theory and derived a second order approximate solution the calculation results indicate that the compressibility at subsonic and supersonic speeds has little effect on the shape of the cavity the impact of compressibility is mainly reflected in the cavitation drag force more recently the supercavity geometry including the length maximum radius and aspect ratio was calculated based on slender body theory under subsonic transonic and supersonic speeds for 0 276 m a 2 2 with the corresponding cavitation number range of 10 3 10 5 the supercavity shapes were in good agreement with the experimental results for both m a 1 and m a 1 wang et al 2017 in terms of numerical simulations of viscous flow a multiphase preconditioned time marching algorithm called uncle m has been developed to simulate unsteady ventilated supercavitation flow natural supercavitation flow and compressible natural supercavitation flow without considering the energy equation kunz et al 2001 venkateswaran et al 2002 the oti hull hydrocode which solves the shock and explosion model for a continuous medium and two phase flow method were used to simulate compressible supercavitation flow at speeds ranging from 700 to 1800 m s schaffar and pfeifer 2001 the density and pressure distribution outside the supercavity are of the same magnitude with both methods schaffar and pfeifer 2001 moreover the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations using a cell centered finite volume method and the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model together with the liquid state equations were applied to simulate the compressibility effects of a projectile moving in water with high subsonic transonic and supersonic speeds li et al 2018 a similar urans approach with the k ε turbulence model was applied to simulate the compressibility effects of a supersonic projectile upon water entry chen et al 2019 due to the cavitation flow compressibility caused by the mixture phase at ultra low sound speeds there is a wealth of literature covering multiphase cavitation flow in compressible media including the euler euler framework for relatively stable supercavitating flows and the continuum method for unsteady sheet cloud cavitating flows wang et al 2020 note that a lagrangian eulerian method has been developed to simulate cavitating flows in recent years with the cavitation nuclei dynamics considered to simulate the details of the flow physics shams et al 2011 maeda and colonius 2018 for the case of inviscid isothermal flow a compressible correction method has been used to solve the positive pressure uniform cavitation flow model allowing the cavitation characteristics of the naca66 hydrofoil to be simulated van der heul and wesseling 2000 a robust cfd methodology for predicting three dimensional flows with extensive cavitation was established based on the multiphase flow equations with mass transfer due to cavitation derived from a simplified rayleigh plesset model zwart et al 2004 numerical methods including energy conservation with the non steady state compressible euler equation the ideal gas equation of state for the vapor phase and the tait equation for the liquid phase have been used to simulate the shock wave characteristics of naca0015 hydrofoil cavitation flow 2d and 3d nozzles and the cavitation characteristics of 3d curved hydrofoils schnerr et al 2006 a predictor corrector approach considering the compressibility of cavitating flows was used to capture the pressure wave achieving good agreement with experimental data gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 and an efficient large eddy simulation method for compressible multiphase flow based on the implicit subgrid scale model using a four cell stencil has effectively simulated the bubble collapse bubble cloud collapse and cavitating turbulent mixing layer egerer et al 2016 additionally a compressible cavitation solver based on openfoam with a compressible thermodynamic equilibrium mixture model was developed to simulate the rayleigh collapse of a single bubble and a cluster of bubbles showing the importance of the liquid compressibility on the cavitation dynamics ghahramani et al 2019 similarly 3d numerical simulation methods have been developed to calculate the transient sheet cloud cavitating flows around a clark y hydrofoil at an attack angle of α 8 an inlet velocity of u 10 m s and a cavitation number of σ 0 8 based on openfoam using both the native incompressible cavitation solver interphasechangefoam and a compressible cavitation solver compared with the incompressible condition the compressible medium allows better predictions of the unsteady cavitation evolution and cavity shedding frequency wang et al 2020 although research on compressible natural supercavitation in water has increased over the past few years the compressibility effects of various flow conditions i e different projectile shapes entry velocities and series parallel water entry on the cavitation dynamics in high subsonic transonic and supersonic flows are still not well understood therefore the present study systematically examines the fundamental flow and drag force characteristics produced by different projectile shapes and entry velocities in the case of series and parallel water entry these characteristics significantly affect supercavitating projectile applications such as the projectile profile and launch conditions the current work is structured as follows section 2 provides details of the research methods and validation in section 3 the numerical simulation results and corresponding explanations of supercavitation flows and drag force characteristics are reported section 3 1 presents simulation results for single projectile water entry with different head shapes and entry velocities section 3 2 gives the simulation results for two projectiles entering the water in series with different head shapes entry velocities and entry interval times and section 3 3 provides the simulation results for two projectiles entering the water in parallel with different head shapes entry velocities and entry interval distances finally the conclusions to this study are provided in section 4 2 research methods and validation 2 1 governing equations in the present work a compressible homogeneous multiphase transport equation is used and the numerical method consists of the continuity equation momentum

considering the compressibility effects specifically the following tait equation of state for water without temperature correction is employed p p 0 k 0 ρ l ρ 0 n 1 where p 0 and ρ 0 are reference values at a reference temperature of t 0 293 15 k k 0 and n are weak functions of temperature and pressure and they are generally assumed to have constant values of 3 10 8 pa and 7 15 respectively if the pressure value on the shock front exceeds 3 10 3 mpa k 0 and n are generally assumed to have constant values of 416 mpa and 6 29 respectively the air phase and vapor phase are modeled as ideal gases i e p ρ a r a t and p ρ v r v t are the equations of the state for air and vapor respectively correspondingly the effective speed of sound c m for the mixture phase is a function of the void

6dof model in fluent are used to update the dynamic grid and calculate the motion behavior of rigid bodies in the fluid domain space respectively 2 2 numerical conditions and validation numerical simulations were conducted to validate the numerical approach against previous experimental results an experimental image is shown in fig 1 a hrubes 2000 where the projectile velocity is 1540 m s and the launch depth is 4 m the geometry used in this simulation as illustrated in fig 1b was the same as that of the experimental projectile used by hrubes 2000 specifically the length of the projectile is 157 4 mm the head cavitator diameter is 1 42 mm the base diameter is 13 12 mm and the ratio of length to base diameter is 12 in the numerical calculation domain the domain inlet is 20l upstream of the cavitator center and the outlet is 260l downstream of the projectile base center the same configuration as used by li et al 2018 the total number of grid cells is 286 380 and the mesh size of the first layer on the projectile surface is 0 1 mm the fluid mesh which is shown in detail in fig 1c is adequate to simulate compressible supercavitation flow more simulation details can be found in li et al 2018 the pressure and water density results shown in fig 1d and e indicate that there is a general agreement between the simulated and experimental flow characteristics to investigate the flow and drag force characteristics of supersonic projectiles entering the water in series and in parallel a group of projectiles with the same total length and base diameter but different head geometries were used in this investigation i e cylindrical projectile 90 cone projectile and hemispherical head projectile as shown in fig 2 a note that in the case of series water entry there is another projectile with the same head shape and entry velocity a certain interval behind the first projectile as illustrated in fig 2b in the case of parallel water entry two projectiles with the same head shape and entry velocity enter the water a certain distance apart as illustrated in fig 2c the calculation domain inlet is 42d upstream of the water surface and the outlet is 280d downstream of the water surface a no slip boundary condition is imposed on the projectile surface and no slip wall conditions are imposed on the side boundaries the numerical simulations adopt a two dimensional axisymmetric model and use 1 2 of the computational domain schematic diagrams of the overall calculation domain and the boundary are shown in fig 3 a in the calculation domain the y axis is the axis of symmetry and the coordinate origin is the tip of the projectile s head 2d away from the water surface for the different model calculations reported in subsequent sections the height of the head tip of the projectile from the free surface at the initial moment is always 2d the total number of grid cells is 298 550 300 125 and 305 814 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively the mesh details around the different projectiles are illustrated in fig 3b 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the projectile shape and entry velocity to investigate the drag force and cavitation flow characteristics of the projectiles upon supersonic water entry the drag force coefficient projectile trajectory maximum density of the water and cavity geometry were simulated for a single projectile entering the water under different head shapes and entry velocities the results are presented in figs 4 8 specifically as shown in fig 4 the drag force coefficient c d f 1 2 ρ u s where f is the total drag force ρ is the density of the water u is the entry velocity and s is the reference characteristic area based on the base diameter indicates the impact and cavitation drag force variation characteristics for different projectile head shapes with the same entry velocity of 0 41 ma and for different entry velocities i e 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma with the same head shape i e cylinder as presented in fig 4a the impact drag force coefficients i e the peak values of the drag force coefficient curve are 7 06 1 35 and 0 99 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively the corresponding cavitation drag force coefficients i e steady drag force coefficients are 0 80 0 58 and 0 35 previous experimental and numerical values of the impact drag force coefficient are 5 0 1 3 and 1 1 and those for the cavitation drag force coefficient are 0 9 0 5 and 0 3 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under a low entry velocity may 1975 cointe and armand 1987 ghadimi et al 2012 namely the numerical simulation drag force coefficient results are similar to those in the literature because the compressibility does not significantly affect the flow field at an entry velocity of 0 41 ma li et al 2018 moreover as shown in fig 4b the impact drag force coefficient declines from 7 06 to 4 57 as the entry velocity increases from m a 0 41 to m a 1 03 and the cavitation drag force coefficient remains constant at 0 80 note that the appearance time of the peak drag force coefficient gradually decreases because the increase in entry velocity makes the cylinder hit the water surface faster as shown in fig 4b the projectile trajectory behaviors i e the velocity and y direction movement distance for different head shapes and different entry velocities are presented in fig 5 the behavior of the projectiles in this scenario is dominated by the drag force bodily et al 2014 more specifically as shown in fig 5a the decrease in velocity and corresponding penetration depth of the cylinder which has a relatively large drag force are larger and smaller respectively than those of the cone and hemisphere projectiles which have relatively small drag forces as the entry velocity of the cylinder projectile increases from 0 41 ma to 1 03 ma the rate of decrease in velocity gradually increases and the velocity reaches a consistent value after 3 0 ms as shown in fig 5b fig 5b also indicates that the penetration depth of the cylinder increases sharply with the entry velocity these characteristics of the cylinder under different entry velocities can be attributed to the drag force characteristics presented in fig 4b although the drag force coefficient drops slightly with increasing entry velocity the total drag force increases sharply resulting in the rate of decrease in velocity gradually increasing at higher entry velocities to investigate the compressibility effects of the different head shapes and entry velocities of the single projectile upon water entry the maximum density variation characteristics of the water are summarized in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a the peak dimensionless water density ρ ρ 0 values are 1 27 1 09 and 1 23 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under the same entry velocity of 0 41 ma the peak ρ ρ 0 values for the cylindrical projectile under entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma are 1 27 1 40 1 45 and 1 52 respectively as shown in fig 6b moreover after the projectile impacts the water surface the maximum water density gradually reduces corresponding to the compressibility effects of the water see fig 6 as the projectile velocity declines see fig 5 we attribute the maximum water density variation characteristics under different head shapes and entry velocities to the maximum pressure distribution i e the pressure distribution close to stagnation points characteristics for different head shapes and entry velocities may 1975 li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 in other words projectiles with a higher impact force such as the cylinder fig 4a and the 1 03 ma entry velocity fig 4b produce the peak maximum density as shown in fig 6a and b moreover projectiles with a relatively high current velocity such as the hemisphere fig 5a and the 1 03 ma entry velocity fig 5b correspond to a steady maximum density as shown in fig 6a and b figs 7 and 8 show the water entry cavity geometry at some typical instances for different head shapes and entry velocities for all the simulations the cavity boundaries are defined as the iso surface of a water volume fraction of 50 as presented in figs 7 and 8 the cavity geometries have similar characteristics as found in previous studies may 1975 lee et al 1997 chen et al 2019 i e open cavity see figs 7a and 8a cavity surface closure see fig 7b c 8b and c and cavity independent development see figs 7d and 8d moreover the cavity diameter caused by projectiles with larger drag force i e the cylinder or high entry velocity 1 03 ma is always obviously larger than that caused by projectiles with smaller drag force i e cone and hemisphere shapes or relatively low entry velocity 0 41 ma as shown in figs 7 and 8 namely a high drag force corresponds to high momentum transfer from the projectile to the cavity which dominates the cavity development may 1975 lee et al 1997 the cavity length variation which refers to the penetration depth of the projectile under different head shapes and entry velocities can be attributed to the drag force characteristics as explained above in other words a small drag force and high entry velocity correspond to a large cavity length or projectile penetration depth as shown in figs 7 and 8 3 2 series water entry to investigate the flow and drag force characteristics of projectiles entering the water in series the cavity geometry trajectory and maximum water density under different projectile head shapes entry velocities and interval times are shown in figs 9 12 as presented in fig 9 the drag force coefficient characteristics of the second projectile are systematically compared for the different projectile head shapes with the same entry velocity 0 41 ma and an interval time of 4 ms fig 9a different entry velocities with the same head shape cylinder and an interval time of 4 ms fig 9b and different interval times with the same head shape cylinder and an entry velocity of 0 41 ma fig 9c generally the maximum drag force coefficient of the second projectile is significantly smaller than that of the first projectile note that the drag force coefficient characteristics of the first projectile under series water entry are the same as for single projectile water entry this is because the second projectile has almost no effect on the first projectile under series water entry specifically the impact drag force coefficients of the second projectile are 1 51 0 81 and 0 68 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under an entry velocity of 0 41 ma and interval time of 4 ms as shown in fig 9a the corresponding values for the first projectile are 7 06 1 35 and 0 99 the impact drag force coefficients of the second projectile are 1 51 1 13 1 12 and 0 88 those of the first projectile are 7 06 5 29 5 06 and 4 57 for entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma respectively under the same head shape and interval time as shown in fig 9b the impact drag force coefficients of the second projectile are 1 44 1 62 1 51 and 1 51 for interval times of 1 ms 2 ms 3 ms and 4 ms respectively under the same entry velocity and head shape as shown in fig 9c after the projectile impacts the water the drag force coefficient shows some fluctuations as indicated in fig 9 this is different from the drag force coefficient of the first projectile which sharply declines to the cavitation drag force as shown in fig 4 we attribute these drag force coefficient characteristics of the second projectile under series water entry to the flow conditions being significantly different from that of single projectile water entry more specifically for the series water entry the second projectile impacts the water jet formed by the surface closure created by the first projectile entering the water as shown in fig 10 this is different from the case of a projectile impacting the water surface and the impact water jet significantly reduces the impact force as suggested by nathan et al 2019 additionally the fluctuations in the drag force coefficient can be mainly attributed to the shape and energy of the water jet which are different under different projectile head shapes projectile entry velocities and interval times fig 10 presents the cavity geometry under series water entry with different entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma with the same head shape cylinder and interval time 4 ms although the cavity geometry of the first projectile is the same as for single projectile water entry see fig 8 no cavity is formed by the second projectile entering the water the second projectile impacts the water jet penetrates the water jet and moves inside the cavity formed by the first projectile as the second projectile impacts the water jet different drag force coefficient fluctuations occur see fig 9b due to the different water jet shapes and energies see fig 10 note that the cavity geometry characteristics of the second projectile under different head shapes and interval times are similar to those of the different entry velocities not shown here for brevity namely the cavity geometry of the first projectile is the same as that of in the case of single projectile water entry the second projectile only impacts the water jet resulting in different drag force coefficient fluctuations and then penetrates the water jet before moving inside the cavity formed by the first projectile the behavior of the second projectile in terms of the velocity and movement distance under different head shapes entry velocities and interval times is presented in fig 11 again this behavior is dominated by the drag force bodily et al 2014 generally as shown in fig 11 the velocity remains approximately constant then decreases to another approximately constant value this behavior corresponds to the projectile moving in the air with a relatively low drag force moving in the water jet with a relatively high drag force and then moving inside the cavity with a relatively low drag force as shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively furthermore as shown in fig 11a the relatively small velocity decrease of the hemisphere projectile corresponds to the relatively small drag force see fig 9a and the relatively large penetration depth moreover for the different entry velocities fig 11b and different interval times fig 11c there are similar velocity decrease and penetration depth trends as in fig 11a this can be attributed to the drag force characteristics shown in fig 9b and c to investigate the compressibility effect of projectiles entering the water in series the maximum density variation characteristics of the water for different projectile head shapes entry velocities and interval times are summarized in fig 12 the peak dimensionless water density ρ ρ 0 values are 1 16 1 10 and 1 11 for the second cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under an entry velocity of 0 41 ma and an interval time of 4 ms as shown in fig 12a the peak ρ ρ 0 values are 1 16 1 26 1 33 and 1 37 for the second cylindrical projectile with entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma respectively under the same interval time of 4 ms as shown in fig 12b the peak ρ ρ 0 values are 1 10 1 10 1 12 and 1 16 for the second cylindrical projectile with an entry velocity of 0 41 ma and interval times of 1 ms 2 ms 3 ms and 4 ms respectively as shown in fig 12c after the peak value the water density caused by the second projectile fluctuates due to the drag force and decreases to a constant corresponding to the second projectile moving inside the cavity fig 10 we attribute the maximum water density variation characteristics of the second projectile or the compressibility effect under different head shapes entry velocities and interval times to the maximum pressure distribution caused by the second projectile impacting the water jet may 1975 li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 3 3 parallel water entry to investigate the flow and drag force characteristics of projectiles entering the water in parallel the drag force characteristics trajectory maximum water density and cavity geometry were simulated for different projectile head shapes entry velocities and interval distances the results are shown in figs 13 17 fig 13 compares the projectile drag force coefficient characteristics for the different projectile head shapes with the same entry velocity 1 03 ma and an interval distance of 6 d fig 13a different entry velocities with the same head shape cylinder and an interval distance of 6 d fig 13b and different interval distances with the same head shape cylinder and an entry velocity of 0 69 ma fig 13c generally the maximum drag force coefficient of the projectiles in the case of parallel water entry is slightly smaller than that under single projectile water entry namely the impact drag force coefficients of the projectiles in parallel water entry are 3 91 1 57 and 1 50 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under the same entry velocity of 1 03 ma and the same interval distance of 6 d as shown in fig 13a the impact drag force coefficients in the case of parallel water entry are 6 06 4 69 4 52 and 3 91 for entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma respectively under the same head shape and interval distance as shown in fig 13b this compares with 7 06 5 29 5 06 and 4 57 for single projectile water entry the impact drag force coefficients are 4 67 4 69 4 64 and 4 64 for interval distances of 2 d 6 d 10 d and 14 d respectively under the same entry velocity and head shape as shown in fig 13c after projectile impact the drag force coefficient sharply declines increases again to form a small peak and then decreases to an approximately constant value that is slightly larger than that for single projectile water entry as indicated in fig 13 we attribute these drag force coefficient characteristics to the flow conditions being slightly different from those for single projectile water entry more specifically in the case of parallel water entry two projectiles enter the water together and the pressure distribution is different from the case of single projectile water entry as shown in fig 14a namely there is a pressure disturbance that contributes to the second drag force coefficient peak additionally the time and value of the second peak are strongly affected by the interval distance i e as the interval distance increases the time of appearance decays and the peak value gradually decreases as shown in figs 13c and 14a note that in the case of parallel water entry the general variation trend of the projectiles under different head shapes and entry velocities is the same as for single projectile water entry this is not discussed here for brevity the velocity and movement distance under different head shapes entry velocities and interval distances in the case of parallel water entry are presented in fig 15 again the behavior is dominated by the drag force bodily et al 2014 generally as shown in fig 15 the velocity remains approximately constant and then decreases corresponding to the projectile moving in the air with a relatively low drag force and entering the water with a relatively high drag force as shown in fig 13 more specifically as shown in fig 15a the relatively small velocity decrease of the hemisphere shaped projectile corresponds to the relatively small drag force see fig 13 and relatively large penetration depth similarly for different entry velocities with the same head shape and interval distance as shown in fig 15b and different interval distances with the same head shape and entry velocity as shown in fig 15c there are similar decreases in velocity and penetration depth as in fig 15a this can be attributed to the drag force characteristics shown in fig 13b and c this is not discussed here for brevity to investigate the compressibility effects of parallel water entry under different head shapes entry velocities and interval distances the maximum density variation characteristics of the water are summarized in fig 16 the peak ρ ρ 0 values are 1 50 1 33 and 1 39 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under the same entry velocity 1 03 ma and interval distance 6 d as shown in fig 16a the peak ρ ρ 0 values are 1 26 1 38 1 44 and 1 50 for the cylindrical projectile with entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma respectively under the same interval distance of 6 d as shown in fig 16b the peak ρ ρ 0 value is 1 38 for all interval distances with the cylindrical projectile at an entry velocity of 0 69 ma as shown in fig 16c after the peak value there is a second peak maximum water density similar to the drag force this is caused by the pressure disturbance of parallel water entry fig 14a and a high density zone fig 14b corresponding to the high pressure zone fig 14a furthermore we attribute the maximum water density variation characteristics of the parallel water entry or compressibility effect under different head shapes entry velocities and interval distances to the maximum pressure distribution may 1975 li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 fig 17 shows the water entry cavity geometry at a typical instance t 0 2 ms for different head shapes entry velocities and interval distances as presented in fig 17 the cavity geometry has similar characteristics as in previous studies may 1975 lee et al 1997 chen et al 2019 i e open cavity cavity surface closure and cavity independent development although the outside boundary of the cavity in the case of parallel water entry has a similar shape as for single projectile water entry the inside boundary of the cavity exhibits significantly different shapes approximating a straight line as shown in fig 17a and b moreover as the interval distance increases as shown in fig 17c the inside boundary of the parallel water entry cavity gradually changes from an approximately straight line to an elliptical arc similar to that observed for single projectile water entry we attribute the inside boundary variation characteristics of the parallel water entry cavity to the blockage effect shao et al 2017 namely as the interval distance decreases the blockage increases and contributes to the cavity diameter decreasing and the cavity boundary shape changing from an elliptical arc to a straight line shao et al 2017 specifically the equivalent blockage ratios are 20 7 7 4 8 and 3 4 at interval distances of 2 d 6 d 10 d and 14 d respectively therefore as the interval distance increases to 10 d the blockage ratio decreases to 4 8 and the wall effect can be ignored as shown in fig 17c additionally because the transfer of projectile momentum to the cavity dominates the cavity development may 1975 lee et al 1997 the cavity diameter caused by a projectile with a large drag force i e the cylinder is always obviously greater than that caused by a projectile with a small drag force i e cone and hemisphere as shown in fig 17a the cavity length behavior which refers to the penetration depth of the projectile under different head shapes and entry velocities can be attributed to the drag force characteristics as explained above namely a small drag force and high entry velocity correspond to a large cavity length or projectile penetration depth as shown in fig 17a and b 4 conclusions in this study supersonic projectiles entering the water in series and in parallel with different head shapes entry velocities interval times and interval distances were numerically investigated the numerical formulation used the unsteady compressible rans equations together with the s s t k ω turbulence model tait equation of state for water without temperature correction equations of state for air and vapor and the zwart cavitation model the numerical simulation results given by the supersonic projectile model were compared with experimental results measured by hrubes 2000 to validate the numerical approach the numerical simulation drag force coefficient results for single projectile water entry with different head shapes were found to be similar to those in previous studies as the compressibility does not significantly affect the flow field at an entry velocity of m a 0 41 moreover as the entry velocity increases the impact drag force coefficient decline and the cavitation drag force coefficient remains constant correspondingly the velocity and y direction movement for different head shapes and different entry velocities were found to be dominated by the drag force in terms of compressibility projectiles with a high impact force produce the peak maximum density and projectiles with a relatively high current velocity produce a large steady maximum density additionally the cavity diameter produced by a projectile with a large drag force i e cylinder is always obviously greater than that caused by a projectile with a small drag force i e cone and hemisphere furthermore for projectiles entering the water in series the maximum drag force coefficient of the second projectile is significantly smaller than that of the first projectile after the projectile impact the drag force coefficient fluctuates unlike that of the first projectile which decreases sharply to the cavitation drag force although the cavity geometry of the first projectile is the same as that for single projectile water entry there is no cavity formed by the second projectile as it only impacts the water jet penetrates the water jet and moves inside the cavity formed by the first projectile the maximum water density variations of the second projectile or the compressibility effect under different head shapes entry velocities and interval times can be attributed to the maximum pressure distribution caused by the second projectile impacting the water jet finally for projectiles entering the water in parallel the maximum drag force coefficient is slightly smaller than that for single projectile water entry after impact the drag force coefficient decreases sharply increases again to form a small peak and then reduces to an approximately constant value that is slightly greater than that in the single projectile case these drag force coefficient characteristics can be attributed to the pressure disturbance caused by parallel water entry although the outside boundary of the parallel water entry cavity shows a similar shape to that for single projectile water entry the inside boundary exhibits significantly different shapes that approximate a straight line as the interval distance increases the inside boundary of the parallel water entry cavity gradually changes from an approximately straight line to an elliptical arc the inside boundary variation characteristics of the parallel water entry cavity can be attributed to the blockage effect namely as the interval distance decreases the blockage increases contributing to a decrease in cavity diameter and changing the cavity boundary shape from an elliptical arc to a straight line credit authorship

20493,this paper describes numerical simulations of the series and parallel water entry of supersonic projectiles with different head shapes entry velocities interval times and interval distances we focus on the cavity geometry and the drag force characteristics of the projectiles for projectiles entering the water in series no cavity is formed by the second projectile this second projectile impacts and penetrates the water jet and moves inside the cavity formed by the first projectile moreover the impact drag force coefficient of the second projectile is significantly smaller than that of a single projectile entering the water with the same entry conditions the cavitation drag force coefficient of the second projectile fluctuates in the case of projectiles entering the water in parallel the impact drag force coefficient is slightly smaller than that of single projectile water entry after the projectiles impact the water the drag force coefficient declines sharply increases again to form a small peak and then reduces to an approximately constant value that is slightly larger than that of a single projectile entering the water additionally although the outside boundary of the parallel water entry cavity shows a similar shape to that of single projectile water entry the blockage effect causes the inside boundary to form an approximately straight line keywords series parallel water entry cavity geometry drag force characteristics 1 introduction supercavitaion is a special case of cavitation in which an object is completely enveloped in a cavity generated by injecting noncondensable gas into liquid ventilated supercavitation or reducing the pressure to the saturation vapor pressure natural supercavitation it is often employed to reduce skin friction drag for high speed underwater vehicles nesteruk 2012 jiang et al 2019 because of the promising applications of drag force reduction to underwater vehicles ventilated and natural supercavitation flows under low subsonic conditions in water have been extensively investigated for over half a century logvinovich 1973 nesteruk 2012 truscott et al 2014 shao et al 2018 wu et al 2019 huang et al 2019 however there is still a significant lack of fundamental understanding of the detailed physical processes involved in compressible natural supercavitation flow under high subsonic transonic and supersonic conditions in the water in particular the supercavitation flow characteristics of high subsonic transonic and supersonic projectiles entering a water body in series or in parallel require further investigation li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 there have been few reports of high speed compressible supercavitating projectile experiments partly due to their high cost but also for reasons of military secrecy slender body underwater projectile experiments were performed at the institute of fluid mechanics of the national academy of sciences of ukraine to investigate compressible natural supercavitation flow at large slenderness ratios λ 70 200 with underwater speeds ranging from 500 to 1550 m s savchenko 2001 2008 vlasenko 2003 the projectiles were made of steel and titanium with cavitator diameters of 1 2 3 mm and a maximum diameter of 10 17 mm and the experimental images were captured by a high speed camera at 25000 fps to illustrate the compressible natural supercavity geometry with an emphasis on the shock wave characteristics close to the cavitator savchenko 2008 high speed imaging experiments of water entry by high subsonic 975 m s and supersonic 1540 m s projectiles hrubes 2000 kirschner 2001 truscott et al 2014 were conducted by the naval undersea warfare center nuwc at newport rhode island these experiments revealed that projectiles with flat noses tapered tips and high slenderness ratios could pierce the surface at shallow angles and continue to descend through the water column without ricochet truscott et al 2014 experiments with spherical shaped and slender shaped projectiles launching into the water at speeds ranging from 1500 to 2000 m s were conducted at the shock wave research center tohoku university to investigate compressible natural supercavitation flow and drag force characteristics the results indicate that the initial shock wave generated by the projectile impact propagates at approximately the speed of sound and the drag force is smaller than with a single phase flow yamashita et al 2004 although limited experimental results have been published various numerical simulations have investigated compressible natural supercavitation flow and drag force characteristics al ev 1983 wang et al 2017 li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 nonlinear numerical prediction methods for axisymmetric objects entering the water and moving in water with high subsonic transonic and supersonic speeds both with and without viscosity have been used to examine the behavior of compressible supercavitation flow al ev 1983 zigangareeva and kiselev 1998 kunz et al 2001 to investigate both the incompressible and compressible effects of supercavitation in subsonic transonic and supersonic flows the supercavity geometry and drag force calculation methods for slender and disc cavitators can be combined through slender body theory and matched asymptotic expansion serebryakov 2006 serebryakov et al 2009 the results show that cavity length and radius increase sharply and then decrease sharply in transonic flows and the cavitation drag force coefficient mainly depends on the cavitation number and mach number of the disc cavitator i e c x 0 82 c 1 σ m a 1 c x 0 82 c σ m a 1 c 2 7 15 m a 2 1 3 1 m a 2 1 2 1 based on slender body theory first and second order solutions for the supercavity geometry of a slender conical cavitator were obtained by considering the compressibility of the water vasin 2001 the results indicate that there is not much difference between the second order solution and the first order solution for subsonic flow with both producing oval cavities namely the supercavity geometry depends on the cavitation number mach number and slenderness ratio for supersonic flow the first order approximate solution is consistent with that of subsonic flow and the second order approximate solution gives a concave cavity that is inconsistent with the theory vasin 2001 for underwater normal shock waves considering the mass momentum energy equation and tait equation in the water the calculation results predicted that the critical angle of the supersonic flow around a wedge or cone is less than that in the air vasin 2001 nesteruk 2003 investigated the underwater supersonic supercavitation flow based on slender body theory and derived a second order approximate solution the calculation results indicate that the compressibility at subsonic and supersonic speeds has little effect on the shape of the cavity the impact of compressibility is mainly reflected in the cavitation drag force more recently the supercavity geometry including the length maximum radius and aspect ratio was calculated based on slender body theory under subsonic transonic and supersonic speeds for 0 276 m a 2 2 with the corresponding cavitation number range of 10 3 10 5 the supercavity shapes were in good agreement with the experimental results for both m a 1 and m a 1 wang et al 2017 in terms of numerical simulations of viscous flow a multiphase preconditioned time marching algorithm called uncle m has been developed to simulate unsteady ventilated supercavitation flow natural supercavitation flow and compressible natural supercavitation flow without considering the energy equation kunz et al 2001 venkateswaran et al 2002 the oti hull hydrocode which solves the shock and explosion model for a continuous medium and two phase flow method were used to simulate compressible supercavitation flow at speeds ranging from 700 to 1800 m s schaffar and pfeifer 2001 the density and pressure distribution outside the supercavity are of the same magnitude with both methods schaffar and pfeifer 2001 moreover the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations using a cell centered finite volume method and the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model together with the liquid state equations were applied to simulate the compressibility effects of a projectile moving in water with high subsonic transonic and supersonic speeds li et al 2018 a similar urans approach with the k ε turbulence model was applied to simulate the compressibility effects of a supersonic projectile upon water entry chen et al 2019 due to the cavitation flow compressibility caused by the mixture phase at ultra low sound speeds there is a wealth of literature covering multiphase cavitation flow in compressible media including the euler euler framework for relatively stable supercavitating flows and the continuum method for unsteady sheet cloud cavitating flows wang et al 2020 note that a lagrangian eulerian method has been developed to simulate cavitating flows in recent years with the cavitation nuclei dynamics considered to simulate the details of the flow physics shams et al 2011 maeda and colonius 2018 for the case of inviscid isothermal flow a compressible correction method has been used to solve the positive pressure uniform cavitation flow model allowing the cavitation characteristics of the naca66 hydrofoil to be simulated van der heul and wesseling 2000 a robust cfd methodology for predicting three dimensional flows with extensive cavitation was established based on the multiphase flow equations with mass transfer due to cavitation derived from a simplified rayleigh plesset model zwart et al 2004 numerical methods including energy conservation with the non steady state compressible euler equation the ideal gas equation of state for the vapor phase and the tait equation for the liquid phase have been used to simulate the shock wave characteristics of naca0015 hydrofoil cavitation flow 2d and 3d nozzles and the cavitation characteristics of 3d curved hydrofoils schnerr et al 2006 a predictor corrector approach considering the compressibility of cavitating flows was used to capture the pressure wave achieving good agreement with experimental data gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 and an efficient large eddy simulation method for compressible multiphase flow based on the implicit subgrid scale model using a four cell stencil has effectively simulated the bubble collapse bubble cloud collapse and cavitating turbulent mixing layer egerer et al 2016 additionally a compressible cavitation solver based on openfoam with a compressible thermodynamic equilibrium mixture model was developed to simulate the rayleigh collapse of a single bubble and a cluster of bubbles showing the importance of the liquid compressibility on the cavitation dynamics ghahramani et al 2019 similarly 3d numerical simulation methods have been developed to calculate the transient sheet cloud cavitating flows around a clark y hydrofoil at an attack angle of α 8 an inlet velocity of u 10 m s and a cavitation number of σ 0 8 based on openfoam using both the native incompressible cavitation solver interphasechangefoam and a compressible cavitation solver compared with the incompressible condition the compressible medium allows better predictions of the unsteady cavitation evolution and cavity shedding frequency wang et al 2020 although research on compressible natural supercavitation in water has increased over the past few years the compressibility effects of various flow conditions i e different projectile shapes entry velocities and series parallel water entry on the cavitation dynamics in high subsonic transonic and supersonic flows are still not well understood therefore the present study systematically examines the fundamental flow and drag force characteristics produced by different projectile shapes and entry velocities in the case of series and parallel water entry these characteristics significantly affect supercavitating projectile applications such as the projectile profile and launch conditions the current work is structured as follows section 2 provides details of the research methods and validation in section 3 the numerical simulation results and corresponding explanations of supercavitation flows and drag force characteristics are reported section 3 1 presents simulation results for single projectile water entry with different head shapes and entry velocities section 3 2 gives the simulation results for two projectiles entering the water in series with different head shapes entry velocities and entry interval times and section 3 3 provides the simulation results for two projectiles entering the water in parallel with different head shapes entry velocities and entry interval distances finally the conclusions to this study are provided in section 4 2 research methods and validation 2 1 governing equations in the present work a compressible homogeneous multiphase transport equation is used and the numerical method consists of the continuity equation momentum

considering the compressibility effects specifically the following tait equation of state for water without temperature correction is employed p p 0 k 0 ρ l ρ 0 n 1 where p 0 and ρ 0 are reference values at a reference temperature of t 0 293 15 k k 0 and n are weak functions of temperature and pressure and they are generally assumed to have constant values of 3 10 8 pa and 7 15 respectively if the pressure value on the shock front exceeds 3 10 3 mpa k 0 and n are generally assumed to have constant values of 416 mpa and 6 29 respectively the air phase and vapor phase are modeled as ideal gases i e p ρ a r a t and p ρ v r v t are the equations of the state for air and vapor respectively correspondingly the effective speed of sound c m for the mixture phase is a function of the void

6dof model in fluent are used to update the dynamic grid and calculate the motion behavior of rigid bodies in the fluid domain space respectively 2 2 numerical conditions and validation numerical simulations were conducted to validate the numerical approach against previous experimental results an experimental image is shown in fig 1 a hrubes 2000 where the projectile velocity is 1540 m s and the launch depth is 4 m the geometry used in this simulation as illustrated in fig 1b was the same as that of the experimental projectile used by hrubes 2000 specifically the length of the projectile is 157 4 mm the head cavitator diameter is 1 42 mm the base diameter is 13 12 mm and the ratio of length to base diameter is 12 in the numerical calculation domain the domain inlet is 20l upstream of the cavitator center and the outlet is 260l downstream of the projectile base center the same configuration as used by li et al 2018 the total number of grid cells is 286 380 and the mesh size of the first layer on the projectile surface is 0 1 mm the fluid mesh which is shown in detail in fig 1c is adequate to simulate compressible supercavitation flow more simulation details can be found in li et al 2018 the pressure and water density results shown in fig 1d and e indicate that there is a general agreement between the simulated and experimental flow characteristics to investigate the flow and drag force characteristics of supersonic projectiles entering the water in series and in parallel a group of projectiles with the same total length and base diameter but different head geometries were used in this investigation i e cylindrical projectile 90 cone projectile and hemispherical head projectile as shown in fig 2 a note that in the case of series water entry there is another projectile with the same head shape and entry velocity a certain interval behind the first projectile as illustrated in fig 2b in the case of parallel water entry two projectiles with the same head shape and entry velocity enter the water a certain distance apart as illustrated in fig 2c the calculation domain inlet is 42d upstream of the water surface and the outlet is 280d downstream of the water surface a no slip boundary condition is imposed on the projectile surface and no slip wall conditions are imposed on the side boundaries the numerical simulations adopt a two dimensional axisymmetric model and use 1 2 of the computational domain schematic diagrams of the overall calculation domain and the boundary are shown in fig 3 a in the calculation domain the y axis is the axis of symmetry and the coordinate origin is the tip of the projectile s head 2d away from the water surface for the different model calculations reported in subsequent sections the height of the head tip of the projectile from the free surface at the initial moment is always 2d the total number of grid cells is 298 550 300 125 and 305 814 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively the mesh details around the different projectiles are illustrated in fig 3b 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the projectile shape and entry velocity to investigate the drag force and cavitation flow characteristics of the projectiles upon supersonic water entry the drag force coefficient projectile trajectory maximum density of the water and cavity geometry were simulated for a single projectile entering the water under different head shapes and entry velocities the results are presented in figs 4 8 specifically as shown in fig 4 the drag force coefficient c d f 1 2 ρ u s where f is the total drag force ρ is the density of the water u is the entry velocity and s is the reference characteristic area based on the base diameter indicates the impact and cavitation drag force variation characteristics for different projectile head shapes with the same entry velocity of 0 41 ma and for different entry velocities i e 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma with the same head shape i e cylinder as presented in fig 4a the impact drag force coefficients i e the peak values of the drag force coefficient curve are 7 06 1 35 and 0 99 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively the corresponding cavitation drag force coefficients i e steady drag force coefficients are 0 80 0 58 and 0 35 previous experimental and numerical values of the impact drag force coefficient are 5 0 1 3 and 1 1 and those for the cavitation drag force coefficient are 0 9 0 5 and 0 3 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under a low entry velocity may 1975 cointe and armand 1987 ghadimi et al 2012 namely the numerical simulation drag force coefficient results are similar to those in the literature because the compressibility does not significantly affect the flow field at an entry velocity of 0 41 ma li et al 2018 moreover as shown in fig 4b the impact drag force coefficient declines from 7 06 to 4 57 as the entry velocity increases from m a 0 41 to m a 1 03 and the cavitation drag force coefficient remains constant at 0 80 note that the appearance time of the peak drag force coefficient gradually decreases because the increase in entry velocity makes the cylinder hit the water surface faster as shown in fig 4b the projectile trajectory behaviors i e the velocity and y direction movement distance for different head shapes and different entry velocities are presented in fig 5 the behavior of the projectiles in this scenario is dominated by the drag force bodily et al 2014 more specifically as shown in fig 5a the decrease in velocity and corresponding penetration depth of the cylinder which has a relatively large drag force are larger and smaller respectively than those of the cone and hemisphere projectiles which have relatively small drag forces as the entry velocity of the cylinder projectile increases from 0 41 ma to 1 03 ma the rate of decrease in velocity gradually increases and the velocity reaches a consistent value after 3 0 ms as shown in fig 5b fig 5b also indicates that the penetration depth of the cylinder increases sharply with the entry velocity these characteristics of the cylinder under different entry velocities can be attributed to the drag force characteristics presented in fig 4b although the drag force coefficient drops slightly with increasing entry velocity the total drag force increases sharply resulting in the rate of decrease in velocity gradually increasing at higher entry velocities to investigate the compressibility effects of the different head shapes and entry velocities of the single projectile upon water entry the maximum density variation characteristics of the water are summarized in fig 6 as shown in fig 6a the peak dimensionless water density ρ ρ 0 values are 1 27 1 09 and 1 23 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under the same entry velocity of 0 41 ma the peak ρ ρ 0 values for the cylindrical projectile under entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma are 1 27 1 40 1 45 and 1 52 respectively as shown in fig 6b moreover after the projectile impacts the water surface the maximum water density gradually reduces corresponding to the compressibility effects of the water see fig 6 as the projectile velocity declines see fig 5 we attribute the maximum water density variation characteristics under different head shapes and entry velocities to the maximum pressure distribution i e the pressure distribution close to stagnation points characteristics for different head shapes and entry velocities may 1975 li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 in other words projectiles with a higher impact force such as the cylinder fig 4a and the 1 03 ma entry velocity fig 4b produce the peak maximum density as shown in fig 6a and b moreover projectiles with a relatively high current velocity such as the hemisphere fig 5a and the 1 03 ma entry velocity fig 5b correspond to a steady maximum density as shown in fig 6a and b figs 7 and 8 show the water entry cavity geometry at some typical instances for different head shapes and entry velocities for all the simulations the cavity boundaries are defined as the iso surface of a water volume fraction of 50 as presented in figs 7 and 8 the cavity geometries have similar characteristics as found in previous studies may 1975 lee et al 1997 chen et al 2019 i e open cavity see figs 7a and 8a cavity surface closure see fig 7b c 8b and c and cavity independent development see figs 7d and 8d moreover the cavity diameter caused by projectiles with larger drag force i e the cylinder or high entry velocity 1 03 ma is always obviously larger than that caused by projectiles with smaller drag force i e cone and hemisphere shapes or relatively low entry velocity 0 41 ma as shown in figs 7 and 8 namely a high drag force corresponds to high momentum transfer from the projectile to the cavity which dominates the cavity development may 1975 lee et al 1997 the cavity length variation which refers to the penetration depth of the projectile under different head shapes and entry velocities can be attributed to the drag force characteristics as explained above in other words a small drag force and high entry velocity correspond to a large cavity length or projectile penetration depth as shown in figs 7 and 8 3 2 series water entry to investigate the flow and drag force characteristics of projectiles entering the water in series the cavity geometry trajectory and maximum water density under different projectile head shapes entry velocities and interval times are shown in figs 9 12 as presented in fig 9 the drag force coefficient characteristics of the second projectile are systematically compared for the different projectile head shapes with the same entry velocity 0 41 ma and an interval time of 4 ms fig 9a different entry velocities with the same head shape cylinder and an interval time of 4 ms fig 9b and different interval times with the same head shape cylinder and an entry velocity of 0 41 ma fig 9c generally the maximum drag force coefficient of the second projectile is significantly smaller than that of the first projectile note that the drag force coefficient characteristics of the first projectile under series water entry are the same as for single projectile water entry this is because the second projectile has almost no effect on the first projectile under series water entry specifically the impact drag force coefficients of the second projectile are 1 51 0 81 and 0 68 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under an entry velocity of 0 41 ma and interval time of 4 ms as shown in fig 9a the corresponding values for the first projectile are 7 06 1 35 and 0 99 the impact drag force coefficients of the second projectile are 1 51 1 13 1 12 and 0 88 those of the first projectile are 7 06 5 29 5 06 and 4 57 for entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma respectively under the same head shape and interval time as shown in fig 9b the impact drag force coefficients of the second projectile are 1 44 1 62 1 51 and 1 51 for interval times of 1 ms 2 ms 3 ms and 4 ms respectively under the same entry velocity and head shape as shown in fig 9c after the projectile impacts the water the drag force coefficient shows some fluctuations as indicated in fig 9 this is different from the drag force coefficient of the first projectile which sharply declines to the cavitation drag force as shown in fig 4 we attribute these drag force coefficient characteristics of the second projectile under series water entry to the flow conditions being significantly different from that of single projectile water entry more specifically for the series water entry the second projectile impacts the water jet formed by the surface closure created by the first projectile entering the water as shown in fig 10 this is different from the case of a projectile impacting the water surface and the impact water jet significantly reduces the impact force as suggested by nathan et al 2019 additionally the fluctuations in the drag force coefficient can be mainly attributed to the shape and energy of the water jet which are different under different projectile head shapes projectile entry velocities and interval times fig 10 presents the cavity geometry under series water entry with different entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma with the same head shape cylinder and interval time 4 ms although the cavity geometry of the first projectile is the same as for single projectile water entry see fig 8 no cavity is formed by the second projectile entering the water the second projectile impacts the water jet penetrates the water jet and moves inside the cavity formed by the first projectile as the second projectile impacts the water jet different drag force coefficient fluctuations occur see fig 9b due to the different water jet shapes and energies see fig 10 note that the cavity geometry characteristics of the second projectile under different head shapes and interval times are similar to those of the different entry velocities not shown here for brevity namely the cavity geometry of the first projectile is the same as that of in the case of single projectile water entry the second projectile only impacts the water jet resulting in different drag force coefficient fluctuations and then penetrates the water jet before moving inside the cavity formed by the first projectile the behavior of the second projectile in terms of the velocity and movement distance under different head shapes entry velocities and interval times is presented in fig 11 again this behavior is dominated by the drag force bodily et al 2014 generally as shown in fig 11 the velocity remains approximately constant then decreases to another approximately constant value this behavior corresponds to the projectile moving in the air with a relatively low drag force moving in the water jet with a relatively high drag force and then moving inside the cavity with a relatively low drag force as shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively furthermore as shown in fig 11a the relatively small velocity decrease of the hemisphere projectile corresponds to the relatively small drag force see fig 9a and the relatively large penetration depth moreover for the different entry velocities fig 11b and different interval times fig 11c there are similar velocity decrease and penetration depth trends as in fig 11a this can be attributed to the drag force characteristics shown in fig 9b and c to investigate the compressibility effect of projectiles entering the water in series the maximum density variation characteristics of the water for different projectile head shapes entry velocities and interval times are summarized in fig 12 the peak dimensionless water density ρ ρ 0 values are 1 16 1 10 and 1 11 for the second cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under an entry velocity of 0 41 ma and an interval time of 4 ms as shown in fig 12a the peak ρ ρ 0 values are 1 16 1 26 1 33 and 1 37 for the second cylindrical projectile with entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma respectively under the same interval time of 4 ms as shown in fig 12b the peak ρ ρ 0 values are 1 10 1 10 1 12 and 1 16 for the second cylindrical projectile with an entry velocity of 0 41 ma and interval times of 1 ms 2 ms 3 ms and 4 ms respectively as shown in fig 12c after the peak value the water density caused by the second projectile fluctuates due to the drag force and decreases to a constant corresponding to the second projectile moving inside the cavity fig 10 we attribute the maximum water density variation characteristics of the second projectile or the compressibility effect under different head shapes entry velocities and interval times to the maximum pressure distribution caused by the second projectile impacting the water jet may 1975 li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 3 3 parallel water entry to investigate the flow and drag force characteristics of projectiles entering the water in parallel the drag force characteristics trajectory maximum water density and cavity geometry were simulated for different projectile head shapes entry velocities and interval distances the results are shown in figs 13 17 fig 13 compares the projectile drag force coefficient characteristics for the different projectile head shapes with the same entry velocity 1 03 ma and an interval distance of 6 d fig 13a different entry velocities with the same head shape cylinder and an interval distance of 6 d fig 13b and different interval distances with the same head shape cylinder and an entry velocity of 0 69 ma fig 13c generally the maximum drag force coefficient of the projectiles in the case of parallel water entry is slightly smaller than that under single projectile water entry namely the impact drag force coefficients of the projectiles in parallel water entry are 3 91 1 57 and 1 50 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under the same entry velocity of 1 03 ma and the same interval distance of 6 d as shown in fig 13a the impact drag force coefficients in the case of parallel water entry are 6 06 4 69 4 52 and 3 91 for entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma respectively under the same head shape and interval distance as shown in fig 13b this compares with 7 06 5 29 5 06 and 4 57 for single projectile water entry the impact drag force coefficients are 4 67 4 69 4 64 and 4 64 for interval distances of 2 d 6 d 10 d and 14 d respectively under the same entry velocity and head shape as shown in fig 13c after projectile impact the drag force coefficient sharply declines increases again to form a small peak and then decreases to an approximately constant value that is slightly larger than that for single projectile water entry as indicated in fig 13 we attribute these drag force coefficient characteristics to the flow conditions being slightly different from those for single projectile water entry more specifically in the case of parallel water entry two projectiles enter the water together and the pressure distribution is different from the case of single projectile water entry as shown in fig 14a namely there is a pressure disturbance that contributes to the second drag force coefficient peak additionally the time and value of the second peak are strongly affected by the interval distance i e as the interval distance increases the time of appearance decays and the peak value gradually decreases as shown in figs 13c and 14a note that in the case of parallel water entry the general variation trend of the projectiles under different head shapes and entry velocities is the same as for single projectile water entry this is not discussed here for brevity the velocity and movement distance under different head shapes entry velocities and interval distances in the case of parallel water entry are presented in fig 15 again the behavior is dominated by the drag force bodily et al 2014 generally as shown in fig 15 the velocity remains approximately constant and then decreases corresponding to the projectile moving in the air with a relatively low drag force and entering the water with a relatively high drag force as shown in fig 13 more specifically as shown in fig 15a the relatively small velocity decrease of the hemisphere shaped projectile corresponds to the relatively small drag force see fig 13 and relatively large penetration depth similarly for different entry velocities with the same head shape and interval distance as shown in fig 15b and different interval distances with the same head shape and entry velocity as shown in fig 15c there are similar decreases in velocity and penetration depth as in fig 15a this can be attributed to the drag force characteristics shown in fig 13b and c this is not discussed here for brevity to investigate the compressibility effects of parallel water entry under different head shapes entry velocities and interval distances the maximum density variation characteristics of the water are summarized in fig 16 the peak ρ ρ 0 values are 1 50 1 33 and 1 39 for the cylindrical 90 cone head and hemisphere head projectiles respectively under the same entry velocity 1 03 ma and interval distance 6 d as shown in fig 16a the peak ρ ρ 0 values are 1 26 1 38 1 44 and 1 50 for the cylindrical projectile with entry velocities of 0 41 ma 0 69 ma 0 83 ma and 1 03 ma respectively under the same interval distance of 6 d as shown in fig 16b the peak ρ ρ 0 value is 1 38 for all interval distances with the cylindrical projectile at an entry velocity of 0 69 ma as shown in fig 16c after the peak value there is a second peak maximum water density similar to the drag force this is caused by the pressure disturbance of parallel water entry fig 14a and a high density zone fig 14b corresponding to the high pressure zone fig 14a furthermore we attribute the maximum water density variation characteristics of the parallel water entry or compressibility effect under different head shapes entry velocities and interval distances to the maximum pressure distribution may 1975 li et al 2018 chen et al 2019 fig 17 shows the water entry cavity geometry at a typical instance t 0 2 ms for different head shapes entry velocities and interval distances as presented in fig 17 the cavity geometry has similar characteristics as in previous studies may 1975 lee et al 1997 chen et al 2019 i e open cavity cavity surface closure and cavity independent development although the outside boundary of the cavity in the case of parallel water entry has a similar shape as for single projectile water entry the inside boundary of the cavity exhibits significantly different shapes approximating a straight line as shown in fig 17a and b moreover as the interval distance increases as shown in fig 17c the inside boundary of the parallel water entry cavity gradually changes from an approximately straight line to an elliptical arc similar to that observed for single projectile water entry we attribute the inside boundary variation characteristics of the parallel water entry cavity to the blockage effect shao et al 2017 namely as the interval distance decreases the blockage increases and contributes to the cavity diameter decreasing and the cavity boundary shape changing from an elliptical arc to a straight line shao et al 2017 specifically the equivalent blockage ratios are 20 7 7 4 8 and 3 4 at interval distances of 2 d 6 d 10 d and 14 d respectively therefore as the interval distance increases to 10 d the blockage ratio decreases to 4 8 and the wall effect can be ignored as shown in fig 17c additionally because the transfer of projectile momentum to the cavity dominates the cavity development may 1975 lee et al 1997 the cavity diameter caused by a projectile with a large drag force i e the cylinder is always obviously greater than that caused by a projectile with a small drag force i e cone and hemisphere as shown in fig 17a the cavity length behavior which refers to the penetration depth of the projectile under different head shapes and entry velocities can be attributed to the drag force characteristics as explained above namely a small drag force and high entry velocity correspond to a large cavity length or projectile penetration depth as shown in fig 17a and b 4 conclusions in this study supersonic projectiles entering the water in series and in parallel with different head shapes entry velocities interval times and interval distances were numerically investigated the numerical formulation used the unsteady compressible rans equations together with the s s t k ω turbulence model tait equation of state for water without temperature correction equations of state for air and vapor and the zwart cavitation model the numerical simulation results given by the supersonic projectile model were compared with experimental results measured by hrubes 2000 to validate the numerical approach the numerical simulation drag force coefficient results for single projectile water entry with different head shapes were found to be similar to those in previous studies as the compressibility does not significantly affect the flow field at an entry velocity of m a 0 41 moreover as the entry velocity increases the impact drag force coefficient decline and the cavitation drag force coefficient remains constant correspondingly the velocity and y direction movement for different head shapes and different entry velocities were found to be dominated by the drag force in terms of compressibility projectiles with a high impact force produce the peak maximum density and projectiles with a relatively high current velocity produce a large steady maximum density additionally the cavity diameter produced by a projectile with a large drag force i e cylinder is always obviously greater than that caused by a projectile with a small drag force i e cone and hemisphere furthermore for projectiles entering the water in series the maximum drag force coefficient of the second projectile is significantly smaller than that of the first projectile after the projectile impact the drag force coefficient fluctuates unlike that of the first projectile which decreases sharply to the cavitation drag force although the cavity geometry of the first projectile is the same as that for single projectile water entry there is no cavity formed by the second projectile as it only impacts the water jet penetrates the water jet and moves inside the cavity formed by the first projectile the maximum water density variations of the second projectile or the compressibility effect under different head shapes entry velocities and interval times can be attributed to the maximum pressure distribution caused by the second projectile impacting the water jet finally for projectiles entering the water in parallel the maximum drag force coefficient is slightly smaller than that for single projectile water entry after impact the drag force coefficient decreases sharply increases again to form a small peak and then reduces to an approximately constant value that is slightly greater than that in the single projectile case these drag force coefficient characteristics can be attributed to the pressure disturbance caused by parallel water entry although the outside boundary of the parallel water entry cavity shows a similar shape to that for single projectile water entry the inside boundary exhibits significantly different shapes that approximate a straight line as the interval distance increases the inside boundary of the parallel water entry cavity gradually changes from an approximately straight line to an elliptical arc the inside boundary variation characteristics of the parallel water entry cavity can be attributed to the blockage effect namely as the interval distance decreases the blockage increases contributing to a decrease in cavity diameter and changing the cavity boundary shape from an elliptical arc to a straight line credit authorship

20494,a novel idea to reduce the resistance of a transom stern hull in displacement and semi planing modes is investigated by placing a spoon shaped device in the recirculating zone behind the transom the momentum of the forward moving water will be absorbed and a pushing force generated on the device numerical and experimental techniques are applied on a transom stern hull to optimize the shape and position of the device and to explore in detail the physics behind the gain for the towed hull at a froude number of 0 4 the maximum measured resistance reduction is 11 while the computed maximum reduction is 17 in self propulsion with one propeller the measured power reduction is 15 the power cannot be computed with the applied propeller model which is an axial body force distribution in the propeller disk but the reduction in thrust using the device is 11 more significant gains are possible at smaller froude numbers while the effect is reduced at higher froude numbers larger gains are achieved by splitting the thrust on two propellers keywords transom flow transom clearance recirculation zone resistance reduction high speed 1 introduction for boats and ships running at speeds in the semi planing and planing speed ranges transom sterns are the only viable option cruiser type sterns cannot be used since the hull lines would then be strongly curved on the aft body creating a large suction force increasing both resistance and trim by the stern the optimum transom size increases as the boat design speed increases larsson and raven 2010 a model of a planing transom stern hull operating at two different speeds is shown in fig 1 in the lower speed range the transom is wet but there is a critical speed for transom stern hulls where the water surface leaves the transom tangent to the bottom and after that the transom becomes dry before this critical speed the water is dragged along with the hull in a massively separated zone behind the transom this is an unwanted flow feature and is considered a source of loss increasing the hull resistance eslamdoost et al 2015 merciar and savitsky 1973 were among the first to propose a drag prediction algorithm for speeds in the pre planing regime where the transom was still wet the transom clearance phenomenon was studied by oving 1986 who provided an empirical formula for the critical transom clearance froude number as a linear function of the hull breadth to transom draft ratio maki et al 2006 conducted experiments with a series of geosim models of a destroyer they provided a correlation between the static transom draft froude number and the free surface elevation behind the transom they also developed a regression formula for estimation of the transom clearance as a function of the beam to draft ratio transom draft froude number and reynolds number a minor effect of free sinkage and trim on the critical froude number was observed in comparison to a fixed model they highlighted the importance of the wavefield on the transom clearance which occurred earlier when the wave trough was located in the vicinity of the transom based on measurements carried out on a series of simplified hull models with rectangular cross sections doctors et al 2007 provided a model for the transom hydrostatic drag to improve the traditional thin ship formulation for resistance prediction the transom flow measured for different cases showed that the water level drop at the transom was not linearly correlated with the ship speed but had a wavy trend in contrast with an earlier study carried out by doctors 2006 they detected a minor influence of the transom draft reynolds number on the transom clearance these contradictory conclusions were related to the different measurement techniques used to detect the wave elevation at the transom for his doctoral thesis maki 2006 carried out a numerical and experimental analysis of the transom stern flow a comprehensive literature review on transom flow research can be found in the thesis different flow regimes with varying characteristics of the free surface behind the hull and the causes of the free surface instability are presented transom ventilation was also investigated the viscous and potential flow of a two dimensional transom stern at increasing transom immersion was studied by starke et al 2007 who employed a free surface fitting reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method through comparison of potential flow and rans results they demonstrated that the critical froude number decreases when viscous effects were neglected they also concluded that the transom clearance occurred earlier at full scale compared to model scale resulting in a more significant transom resistance coefficient at full scale the same method and solver were employed by van der ploeg and starke 2013 to investigate the transom flow regimes for different three dimensional 3d transom geometries in model scale and full scale they concluded that the scale effects influence the free surface pattern mainly behind the transom moreover they concluded that the wavelength is longer at full scale and waves are less steep in this region wyatt et al 2008 carried out full scale experimental measurements and numerical predictions of the wave pattern behind a semi plaining transom sterned vessel the mean height and spectra of the breaking stern waves were measured in situ by a light detection and ranging lidar sensor over a range of ship speeds both below and above the transom clearance froude number two different viscous flow solvers were employed and both displayed an over suppression of the transom waves in the late wake after the initial onset of breaking it was speculated that this resulted from an un modelled turbulent process due to unsteady interaction of the propulsors and appendages which may set up large organized turbulent structures that affect the dissipation of surface waves a detached eddy turbulence model was used by bhushan et al 2012 to investigate the vortical structures and associated instabilities of transom flow of the same full scale vessel as tested by wyatt et al 2008 the transom wave elevation instability was attributed to the karman like transom vortex shedding as both show the same dominant frequency the authors showed that the transom vortex shedding influenced the dynamic sinkage and trim as well they concluded that the instabilities in the flow did not show significant variation with scale propeller or motions employing a rans solver eslamdoost et al 2015 investigated the physics of transom clearance of a planing hull they reported an abrupt increase of the hull resistance at the critical froude number where the transom is just fully ventilated the peak in the resistance curve was caused by a sudden local increase in transom submergence related to the existence of a minimum in pressure coefficient and a maximum in streamline curvature at the transom edge haase et al 2016 investigated a catamaran hull at both model and full scale using an unsteady rans approach and validated them against the model test they reported the existence of a squashed horseshoe structure of the flow inside the stagnant area behind the transom which showed an unsteady behaviour at higher transom froude numbers the transom drag was identified as a significant component of the total resistance up to 70 at full scale indicating the importance of accurate prediction of the transom flow being interested in air entrainment physics hendrickson et al 2019 carried out an implicit large eddy simulation of the turbulent transom flow beyond the critical transom clearance froude number the authors concluded that the convergent corner wave region formed immediately after the wake is ballistic and thus only governed by the speed and geometry of the ship employing a lagrangian cavity identification technique they showed that the most potent air entrainment occurs at the position of wave breaking as presented above several studies have been carried out to understand the transom stern flow physics from different perspectives in the study described in this paper we investigated a new technique to reduce ships fuel consumption around transom clearance speed the basic idea was to use the recirculating water energy and the breaking rooster tail wave behind the hull at speeds below the critical one where the water clears the transom a device was placed inside the recirculating water region to stop the water from moving forward in the direction of hull movement the goal was to reduce the energy loss in the recirculating water region the device absorbs the momentum of the forward flowing water and pushes the hull forward the overall result is a reduced total resistance this idea has been patented in sweden eslamdoost et al 2020 and has an international patent pending the patent authorities know of no similar technique fig 2 shows a configuration used in the computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations and experiments inserting the transom pushing device tpd in the dead water region splits the bare hull recirculating zone into two separate regions fig 3 the shape and the horizontal and vertical positions of the device influence the flow and thus the forward pushing force the objective of the work was to understand the physics of the tpd better and to optimize the position both in towing and self propulsion mode the investigation was carried out using both cfd and experiments referred to as experimental fluid dynamics efd in the following text first the example hull and the tpd are introduced after that the efd technique is described followed by a description of the cfd technique then the computed and measured results are presented and finally some conclusions are drawn 2 test case the hull used in this study was a planing hull designed by sspa referred to as the sspa hull in the following text a body plan is presented in fig 4 and the longitudinal positions of the hull sections are shown in fig 5 the aft and fore perpendiculars are indicated by the numbers 0 and 20 respectively draft measurements were carried out at these sections the towing point of the hull was 95 mm below the deck level and was located at section 6 shown in fig 5 in table 1 the particulars of the hull are given the 3d printed propeller geometry is shown in fig 6 it has five blades with an outer diameter of 100 mm this propeller is not designed to operate at low speeds and thus its efficiency in the measurement speed range is lower than its best efficiency it should also be mentioned that the ittc guidelines for ship model testing state that the propeller diameter should be larger than 150 mm ittc 28 resistance committee 2017 however in the towing tank test carried out in this study the selection of the propeller diameter used in the towing tank tests was constrained by the available hull size thus the criterion recommended in the ittc guidelines for propeller diameter in the model test was not fulfilled moreover the 3d printed propeller was made of plastic that possibly deforms under high loading conditions the blade deformation may result in performance degradation these specifications can result in increased uncertainty of propeller performance measurement to reduce the uncertainties incorporated with the propeller power measurement only the relative change of propeller power with and without the tpd has been analysed in the paper the location of the propeller and the tpd relative to the hull are shown in fig 7 systematic variations of the tpd are reported in sections 5 3 and 5 4 in cfd the propeller is represented as a body force disk shown in the figure note that this disk is vertical this is to enable a better alignment with the grid to reduce numerical errors however even if the disk is upright the body forces are directed along the imagined shaft inclined 10 relative to the bottom note that no shaft was included in the computations there was a physical shaft in the experiments and the propeller was naturally at right angles to the shaft the centre of both propellers was the same and the position is shown in the figure a detail of the tpd mount is shown in fig 8 the tpd 1 is attached to a vertical bar 2 along which it can slide to different vertical positions the bar is attached to a balance 3 which in turn is connected to a horizontal u beam 4 this beam can slide longitudinally to position the tpd at different distances from the transom the balance measures horizontal and vertical forces 3 experimental technique 3 1 test facility the tests were performed in sspa s towing tank which is 260 m long the breadth and depth of the towing tank are 10 m and 5 m respectively the towing tank is spanned by a gantry carriage from which the ship model is towed all tests were performed in calm water 3 2 test arrangement the model was ballasted to the design loading condition the draught was verified at the forward perpendicular fp midships ms and aft perpendicular ap on both sides of the model during testing the model was fixed axially to the carriage with a rod and an electrical transducer that measured the towing force exerted on the model as the rod was adjusted to be parallel to the baseline the force was measured in the horizontal direction at all tests the model was kept on course by two guiding devices one at each perpendicular these devices also prevented the model from swaying and yawing while leaving it free to heave roll and pitch when moving the tpd longitudinally the centre of gravity moved backward this was compensated by moving a ballast weight in the longitudinal direction the following signals were measured and registered by a computer on the carriage model speed towing force vertical motion at fp vertical motion at ap vertical force on the tpd horizontal force on the tpd propeller shaft torque propeller rpm 4 numerical method 4 1 numerical details the numerical simulations were carried out with the code star ccm 15 02 a finite volume method in combination with control volumes dominated by trimmed hex mesh was used in this code to solve the unsteady mass and momentum conservation equations in integral form an implicit unsteady time stepping method was used this method has a wide stability range courant number larger than 1 and allows sizeable local time steps the volume of fluid vof method was used to obtain the volume fraction of the liquid which added one more equation to the system of equations convective terms in this equation were discretized using the hric scheme the free surface interface was expected to be sharp since this equation resolves the free surface within typically one cell the k ω sst turbulence model was used to compute the turbulence effects on the mean flow the boundary layers were resolved down to the wall and no wall functions were used this system of equations was solved using a segregated iterative solution method based on the simple algorithm the simulations were carried out employing a dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model to capture the dynamic sinkage and trim before starting the two degrees of freedom free sinkage and trim modelling the simulations were carried out with the fixed sinkage and trim until the pressure and viscous forces exerted on the hull were stabilized then the hull was released to sink and trim and the dfbi solver started to update the equilibrium position of the hull iteratively in the case of the bare hull a towing force was applied to the hull at the position where the hull was towed in the towing tank the location of the tow force is shown in fig 5 to the extent possible the tow force was kept parallel to the keel line during the resistance tests in the computations the magnitude of the tow force at each iteration is set equal to the hull s resistance computed from the previous iteration the propeller was modelled employing a uniform distribution of an axial body force inside a circular disk that encloses the propeller then the propeller thrust was included in the dfbi model as an external force acting on the hull inclined 10 4 2 grid only half of the geometry was used because the flow was considered symmetrical trimmed hexahedral grids and prism layers along walls were used to create the grids trimmed grids allow anisotropic local refinement around the hull and the free surface four levels of refinement inside arbitrarily defined volumes were used for the free surface and around the hull to capture the free surface the computational domain size and the overall grid distribution in the domain are shown in fig 9 as this study aimed to investigate the transom flow the highest refinement level was used in this region as shown in fig 10 the prism layer grid used to resolve the boundary layer is seen below the hull in the symmetry plane since no wall functions were used y was set to be around 1 with an expansion ratio of 1 1 in the wall normal direction 4 3 verification a systematic grid refinement study was carried out for froude number 0 4 with the tpd at x t p d z t p d 100 l p p 5 2 to obtain a suitable cell size and the corresponding discretization uncertainty the coordinate system is shown in fig 7 the study s froude number was just below the critical froude number where the water clears the transom eslamdoost et al 2015 eight grids with systematically varied grid parameters were used the number of cells in the coarsest grid was 0 944 10 6 and in the finest was 14 9 10 6 the convergence of the solution for the total resistance r t non dimensionalized by the displacement weight of the hull is shown in fig 11 since the grid is unstructured the step size r i on the horizontal axis is obtained as the third root of the total number of cells for the finest grid divided by the total number of cells for grid i the finest grid is represented by r 1 in this figure a formal verification based on the least squares root method by eça and hoekstra was also carried out eça and hoekstra 2014 this showed that a good compromise between numerical accuracy and computational effort was obtained with the second finest grid which was selected for further computations the number of cells for this grid was 5 8 10 6 and the numerical uncertainty 4 04 it should be noted that the verification method is for steady flows while some unsteadiness was detected in the computations described here particularly at froude numbers below the critical one a dependence on the time step may thus be expected 4 4 validation validation was done for the bare hull bh without the tpd fig 12 shows the predicted and measured resistance against the froude number as well as the magnitude of the comparison error in percent at the most interesting froude number 0 4 the comparison error is around 4 while the maximum error 8 occurs in the froude number range 0 35 0 60 for the lowest froude number the comparison error is relatively large around 14 note that the comparison error includes both computational and measurement errors unfortunately no estimate of the experimental error was available so a formal validation cannot be made however we can note that the comparison error for froude number 0 4 is about the same as the numerical uncertainty while it is more significant for the other froude numbers aft draft and fore draft results are shown in fig 13 the correspondence between cfd and efd is reasonably good except at the highest froude number a systematic variation of the position of the tpd was carried out to obtain its optimum position fig 14 shows the variation of the time averaged measured and computed horizontal force acting on the tpd both on the bare hull and the self propelled hull at fn 0 4 the non dimensional force acting on the tpd in the interval studied varies within 15 of the non dimensionalized total resistance at this speed the horizontal force acting on the tpd points forward when the tpd is positioned close to the transom and decreases as the tpd is positioned further from the transom the force even changes direction when the tpd is positioned sufficiently far from the transom the trends of the measured and computed force variations agree well with each other however the agreement level is much better when the tpd is located close to the transom x t p d l p p 100 6 we should keep in mind that the tpd is placed in the core of a turbulent flow region which may show large instabilities thus considering the complicated flow physics the agreement between the measured and computed horizontal tpd force is deemed satisfactory it should be noted that a large pushing force does not necessarily mean a large resistance reduction the tpd interacts with the transom flow and thus alters the transom resistance therefore to evaluate the performance of the tpd we should consider the total resistance of the hull including the tpd and not only the force acting on the tpd the physics of the tpd resistance reduction mechanism is discussed in 5 2 5 results 5 1 design of the tpd the tpd utilizes the energy in the recirculating water behind the transom in the lower speed ranges when the transom is still wet in the initial design phase two different flat plate geometries were placed in the recirculating water region fig 15 the plates were placed at the same longitudinal distance from the transom and an optimization study was carried out to obtain the largest resistance reduction as a function of vertical distance from the transom edge these preliminary studies showed a resistance reduction of 2 8 for the rectangular plate and 4 6 for the triangular plate at froude number 0 4 the pressure distribution on both sides of the plates is shown in fig 16 and fig 17 the high pressure on the front side of the rectangular plate shows that the corners penetrate the free stream flow which reduces the plate s efficiency thus as a modification to the initial design a triangular tpd was generated by trimming the lower corners of the rectangular plate the reduced pressure on the same face of the triangular tpd shows that trimming the lower corners of the rectangular plate produces a favourable result and the triangular tpd does not penetrate the free stream flow any longer as mentioned this modification improved the performance of the tpd by about 2 in comparison to the rectangular tpd however the flat triangular tpd is not streamlined and its sharp edges may increase the system resistance in cases where it penetrates the free stream flow to minimize the risk of increased resistance a curved surface that allows the free stream flow to pass smoothly is better than a flat plate moreover the tpd can cover a larger recirculating water area if its form is adapted to the structure of the recirculating region which itself is a function of the transom shape as well as the operating speed of the hull fig 18 shows the streamlines behind the transom in half of the recirculating region there are also several cross sections shown in this figure the dark blue area shows the flow moving backward and the red colour highlights the region where the flow moves in the forward direction the tpd function is to take advantage of the energy in this flow region and reduce the resistance the cross sections marked with red can be used to design an improved tpd form adapted to this region the projected area of the new design in fig 19 is taken from one of the cross sections and its edges are curved backward to avoid a sudden increase in resistance in cases where it moves out of the recirculating water zone the new design of the tpd is shown in fig 20 the new design offered a resistance reduction of 5 7 in the preliminary design stages which was 1 2 better than the triangular tpd note that this improvement was obtained in the early design phase of the project and through a systematic variation of tpd position we managed to improve the performance considerably the systematic variation of the tpd position is presented in section 5 3 5 2 physical understanding the basic idea behind the tpd is to take advantage of the momentum in the forward direction found in the recirculating zone behind the transom a device with significant resistance in this forward flowing water would create a pushing force when attached to the hull however preliminary calculations indicated that there might be other important unexpected effects in this section we describe how cfd was used to investigate the physics of the tpd 5 2 1 global versus local effect the first question is whether the tpd effect is related to the local flow behind the transom or to the global flow this was investigated by changing the hull attitude sinkage and trim to determine whether the tpd acts as a trim plane or alternatively reduces the resistance by reducing the size of the too large transom to investigate the effect of local and global flow changes three cases were compared for the optimum position shown in fig 29 of the tpd at x t p d l p p 100 5 and z t p d l p p 100 1 1 at fn 0 4 without the propeller in addition to the bare hull without the tpd bh and with the tpd bhpd a case was run with the same sinkage and trim as bhpd but without the tpd bh bhpd the effect of changes in sinkage and trim could then be evaluated the non dimensionalized fore and aft drafts of bh σ l p p 100 were 0 18 and 0 74 respectively the non dimensionalized fore and aft draft of bhpd and thus bh bhpd were 0 11 and 0 68 respectively these drafts resulted in a trim angle of 0 5 for bh and 0 4 for bhpd and thus bh bhpd the results are shown in table 2 where the resistance contributions are split into three components the hull excluding the transom hull the transom and the tpd the last row of table 2 shows that the total resistance changes very little due to the sinkage and trim change from 34 8 n to 34 0 n the effect of adding the tpd for the same trim is an order of magnitude larger a change from 34 0 n to 28 3 n the resistance reduction due to the changed sinkage and trim mainly comes from the hull 42 6 n changed to 41 5 n in contrast the transom contribution change is minor 7 8 n to 7 5 n adding the tpd increases the transom contribution considerably more from 7 5 to 8 9 while the most significant resistance reduction by far is due to the force from the tpd 4 6 n this investigation thus confirms the original idea that it is the force on the tpd that causes the resistance reduction when the tpd is in its optimum position one effect which was not foreseen in the original tpd idea was the increase of water level on the transom which increases its pushing force as we have seen in table 2 there is indeed such an effect at least for this condition in fig 21 the relative importance of the tpd and the increase in transom pushing force is shown for varying longitudinal positions of the tpd but with the vertical position fixed to the optimum at z t p d l p p 100 1 1 there is also a curve for the change in hull resistance excluding transom the tpd is the most significant contributor to the pushing force at all longitudinal positions the transom change contribution is much smaller but positive for large distances the transom effect approaches the tpd effect the hull effect is small and positive at small distances but negative when the tpd is distant from the transom the rise in water level at the transom when the tpd is in the optimum position is shown in fig 22 for this case the increase in the wetted area on the transom is 9 6 it may be of interest to also look at the water levels on the two sides of the tpd these are shown for the reference case in fig 23 the water level is much higher on the rear surface as expected this indicates the different pressures on the front and rear surfaces of the tpd that give the pushing force the pressures are presented in fig 24 in fig 25 the pressure forces on the two sides are displayed as a function of the tpd position the positive contributions to the pushing forces from the rear concave surface are much larger than the negative contributions from the front convex surface this is particularly so for the optimum longitudinal position and at positions closer to the transom at positions further from the transom the positive force is reduced and the negative one is increased absolute value which means that the total tpd force is decreased considerably note that all this is for the optimum vertical position z t p d l p p 100 1 1 if the vertical position of the tpd is varied the findings change fig 26 shows the contributions from the tpd the transom and the hull excluding the transom when the axial position was fixed to the optimum x t p d l p p 100 5 while the vertical position was varied apparently the relative contributions change drastically for non optimum vertical positions but interestingly the sum of the contributions i e the total effect is relatively constant if the tpd is pushed down into the free stream water moving backward its pushing force will naturally be reduced when it approaches the level of the transom edge the tpd will create a drag force however the high pressure in front of the tpd in this position will raise the water level on the transom thereby increasing its pushing effect also the tpd will act as a trim plane and create a bow down trim which reduces the hull drag due to the too large transom when the tpd is lifted above the optimum position the pushing force is naturally reduced it does not take full advantage of the recirculating flow in this position however even in this case there is a rise in the water level on the transom which increases its pushing effect and partly compensates for the loss in tpd force 5 2 2 tpd effect on the wave pattern the basic idea is that the tpd will take advantage of the forward moving water in the recirculating zone the question is whether it also changes the transmitted wave height fig 27 shows the wave pattern for the optimum position at fn 0 4 a reduction in wave height caused by the tpd is seen at least close to the hull fig 28 shows the wave height in the symmetry plane behind the hull again a reduction in wave height is seen close to the hull but the effect seems to decay with distance from the hull 5 3 systematic variations with and without a propeller in the figures above the optimum position of the tpd has been used as a reference and the effect of variations has been discussed referring to this section here the entire matrix of variations will be presented to obtain the optimum position of the tpd computations with a systematic variation in position were carried out with and without the tpd for the towed hull and the self propelled one the gain is visualized in fig 29 the maximum gain 16 75 is at the reference position x t p d z t p d 100 l p p 5 1 1 as seen in this figure the gain is relatively constant with x t p d variation around the optimum height but moving further away from the optimum height the gain drops considerably the corresponding gain for the self propelled case is presented in fig 30 it would have been more interesting to give the reduction in delivered power but that cannot be computed using the current approach with a body force disk representing the propeller the optimum occurs at the same axial position but at a smaller vertical distance from the transom edge x t p d z t p d 100 l p p 5 0 8 the magnitudes of the gains are smaller the maximum gain in the self propelled case is 11 9 from fig 30 it also appears that the best efficiency region for the tpd is more confined relative to the results from the towed hull this is attributed to the smaller recirculating region behind the transom in self propulsion compared to the towed hull the propeller accelerates the flow on the afterbody thus the flow has higher momentum which makes it less prone to break behind the transom the result will be a more confined recirculating region which has less energy for the tpd to harness a comparison between computed and measured resistance reductions for the bare hull is shown in fig 31 the maximum gain estimated using cfd is about 17 while the measured gain from the tests indicates approximately 11 resistance reduction the cfd and efd optimum positions are observed to be different in this figure we compare changes in forces which are about one order of magnitude smaller than the total resistance this may result in a significant comparison error direct comparison of the hull resistance fig 12 or the horizontal tpd forces fig 14 results in a much better agreement level especially when the magnitude of the force is large in the self propelled hull simulations an axial body force model has been used for modelling the propeller since the propulsive efficiency of the propeller is not known we cannot compute the delivered power instead we present the computed effective power resistance hull speed and the measured delivered power torque rotation rate below note that these quantities are not directly comparable fig 32 shows the gains achieved by placing the tpd at different distances from the transom the reference effective power is computed from the resistance of the simulated self propelled hull and the reference delivered power is obtained from the self propulsion measurement at fn 0 4 both without the tpd interestingly we can see that the gain in the measured delivered power in self propulsion fig 32 is more significant than the measured resistance reduction of the towed case fig 31 this may sound to be in contrast with an earlier conclusion in this section that due to a smaller recirculating water region in self propulsion the gains in resistance reduction will be smaller compared to the towed case however we should not forget the effect of the propulsive factors presumably the main contribution to the change in delivered power will come from the resistance change we should also keep in mind that the transom stern hulls are mainly designed to operate at speeds beyond the transom clearance froude number therefore the propeller of a transom stern vessel which operates at speeds below the transom clearance froude number operates in an off design condition where its efficiency is far from the best efficiency point a reduction of the ship resistance by the tpd results in an unloading of the propeller and thus a better efficiency is achieved therefore the tpd benefit is achieved not only by the reduced resistance but also by the improved propeller efficiency this is most likely the reason for the more significant measured total gain in self propulsion 15 2 compared to that of the towed case 11 the optimum position of the tpd at fn 0 4 was used to study the effect of the tpd on power reduction at other speeds as well fig 33 shows the gain in self propulsion versus froude number at different speeds somewhat surprisingly the gain increases when the froude number is reduced the most significant gain in power obtained from efd is about 25 at fn 0 2 in the range fn 0 3 to 0 5 the gains are between 13 and 18 which is much more than anticipated in the same range the effective power gains computed from cfd simulations vary between 10 and 14 so in both cases the reductions are considerable the performance of the tpd at froude numbers above the transom clearance froude number is surprising fig 34 displays the computed free surface profile at the symmetry plane with and without the tpd at froude number 0 5 the transom is fully ventilated at this froude number however both the cfd and efd data show that the tpd has reduced the power by about 14 inserting the tpd into the transom region at this froude number alters the transom flow differently as seen in fig 34 the interaction of the tpd and the transom waves results in an increase of transom clearance froude number the transom is not fully ventilated any longer and consequently the transom drag is reduced the tpd contributes to the resistance reduction through a pushing force as well moreover in contrast to the conclusion made in section 5 2 1 for the optimum tpd position at froude number 0 4 the tpd does alter the hull attitude slightly at this froude number as seen in fig 34 in the presence of the tpd the hull trim angle is somewhat reduced reduced aft draft which in turn reduces the hull resistance therefore at this froude number the tpd reduces the total resistance by altering both the local and the global flow 5 4 two propellers in this section the performance of the tpd is reported for a two propeller arrangement at froude number 0 4 and compared with the one propeller case presented above as stated in the computational method description section a body force model has been employed to model the propeller effect the dark blue areas in fig 35 show the regions where the body force has been deployed to accelerate the flow in the case of one propeller the propeller centre is placed on the hull symmetry plane diameter 100 mm in this section two propellers of smaller diameters diameter 70 mm are placed 150 mm away from the hull symmetry plane fig 35 table 3 shows the results obtained from cfd self propulsion simulations in the presence of one propeller and two propellers with and without the tpd the optimum tpd position obtained from self propulsion systematic optimization is used for all these simulations if we compare only the self propelled hulls without the tpd we notice that the hull resistance propeller thrust has increased by about 1 5 n when two propellers are used since the sinkage and trim angles for these hulls are almost the same only the local flow changes contribute to the increased hull resistance the leading cause is the decreased wetted area of the transom with two propellers compared to the self propulsion simulation with one propeller as a result the transom drag for the hull with two propellers increases about 1 3 n i e almost the entire drag difference between the cases based on the numerical study of the tpd position optimization in self propulsion we know that the tpd reduces the self propelled hull resistance thrust by 11 9 the resistance reduction increases to 14 4 when two propellers are used the sinkage and trim of these hulls are the same and again the local flow changes must be responsible for the lower resistance of the hull with two propellers in fact the pushing force of the tpd is slightly smaller for the hull with two propellers 0 6 n in comparison to 1 2 n however due to the interaction between the tpd and the transom the wetted surface area of the transom becomes the same for both hulls remember that the transom wetted surface area without the tpd was smaller for the hull with two propellers in the presence of the tpd the hulls have precisely the same wetted surface area and thus transom pushing force consequently the gain is more significant for two propellers 6 conclusions a transom pushing device tpd has been developed to reduce the resistance of transom stern planing hulls which operate at off design conditions where the transom is not ventilated and a recirculating water region exists behind the transom a spoon shaped tpd is considerably more efficient than a flat one rectangular and triangular plates were investigated but both were inferior to the newly developed spoon shape the tpd resistance reduction is mainly achieved through modification of pressure distribution in the aft region the waves behind the hull are also reduced by the tpd but this effect diminishes in the far wake for the optimum position of the tpd its main effect is as expected a pushing force generated by the device when it is located in the recirculating flow there is also a positive effect of a water level rise at the transom but that is much smaller in the low speed range the impact on sinkage and trim is minor however the tpd can act as a trim plate at speeds just above the transom clearance froude number for other positions of the tpd particularly in the vertical direction its role changes for a too low placement closer to the transom edge the pushing force is reduced considerably and may become negative however this effect is compensated to some degree by increasing the water level on the transom and a smaller trim of the hull systematic variations in position for the towed case showed a maximum resistance reduction in cfd by 17 while the measured maximum gain in efd was 11 this is for the most interesting froude number fn 0 4 for the self propelled case the maximum resistance thrust reduction was 11 in cfd while the reduction in power for efd was 15 again at fn 0 4 the propeller jet stream sweeps the transom wave further downstream making it less prone to break and fill in the transom hollow as a result the recirculating region behind the transom becomes smaller than that of the towed hull and consequently the gain in resistance is reduced however the total gain in self propulsion is not achieved solely by the resistance reduction the propeller of a planing hull at speeds below the transom clearance froude number operates in an off design condition the resistance reduction due to the tpd results in an unloading of the propeller and a better operating condition therefore the total gain in the delivered power is achieved through the resistance reduction as well as a more favourable operating condition for the propeller although the tpd position was optimized for fn 0 4 it is still effective both below and above this number cfd results also reveal that the tpd can be more effective when the thrust is distributed to two propellers rather than one

20494,a novel idea to reduce the resistance of a transom stern hull in displacement and semi planing modes is investigated by placing a spoon shaped device in the recirculating zone behind the transom the momentum of the forward moving water will be absorbed and a pushing force generated on the device numerical and experimental techniques are applied on a transom stern hull to optimize the shape and position of the device and to explore in detail the physics behind the gain for the towed hull at a froude number of 0 4 the maximum measured resistance reduction is 11 while the computed maximum reduction is 17 in self propulsion with one propeller the measured power reduction is 15 the power cannot be computed with the applied propeller model which is an axial body force distribution in the propeller disk but the reduction in thrust using the device is 11 more significant gains are possible at smaller froude numbers while the effect is reduced at higher froude numbers larger gains are achieved by splitting the thrust on two propellers keywords transom flow transom clearance recirculation zone resistance reduction high speed 1 introduction for boats and ships running at speeds in the semi planing and planing speed ranges transom sterns are the only viable option cruiser type sterns cannot be used since the hull lines would then be strongly curved on the aft body creating a large suction force increasing both resistance and trim by the stern the optimum transom size increases as the boat design speed increases larsson and raven 2010 a model of a planing transom stern hull operating at two different speeds is shown in fig 1 in the lower speed range the transom is wet but there is a critical speed for transom stern hulls where the water surface leaves the transom tangent to the bottom and after that the transom becomes dry before this critical speed the water is dragged along with the hull in a massively separated zone behind the transom this is an unwanted flow feature and is considered a source of loss increasing the hull resistance eslamdoost et al 2015 merciar and savitsky 1973 were among the first to propose a drag prediction algorithm for speeds in the pre planing regime where the transom was still wet the transom clearance phenomenon was studied by oving 1986 who provided an empirical formula for the critical transom clearance froude number as a linear function of the hull breadth to transom draft ratio maki et al 2006 conducted experiments with a series of geosim models of a destroyer they provided a correlation between the static transom draft froude number and the free surface elevation behind the transom they also developed a regression formula for estimation of the transom clearance as a function of the beam to draft ratio transom draft froude number and reynolds number a minor effect of free sinkage and trim on the critical froude number was observed in comparison to a fixed model they highlighted the importance of the wavefield on the transom clearance which occurred earlier when the wave trough was located in the vicinity of the transom based on measurements carried out on a series of simplified hull models with rectangular cross sections doctors et al 2007 provided a model for the transom hydrostatic drag to improve the traditional thin ship formulation for resistance prediction the transom flow measured for different cases showed that the water level drop at the transom was not linearly correlated with the ship speed but had a wavy trend in contrast with an earlier study carried out by doctors 2006 they detected a minor influence of the transom draft reynolds number on the transom clearance these contradictory conclusions were related to the different measurement techniques used to detect the wave elevation at the transom for his doctoral thesis maki 2006 carried out a numerical and experimental analysis of the transom stern flow a comprehensive literature review on transom flow research can be found in the thesis different flow regimes with varying characteristics of the free surface behind the hull and the causes of the free surface instability are presented transom ventilation was also investigated the viscous and potential flow of a two dimensional transom stern at increasing transom immersion was studied by starke et al 2007 who employed a free surface fitting reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method through comparison of potential flow and rans results they demonstrated that the critical froude number decreases when viscous effects were neglected they also concluded that the transom clearance occurred earlier at full scale compared to model scale resulting in a more significant transom resistance coefficient at full scale the same method and solver were employed by van der ploeg and starke 2013 to investigate the transom flow regimes for different three dimensional 3d transom geometries in model scale and full scale they concluded that the scale effects influence the free surface pattern mainly behind the transom moreover they concluded that the wavelength is longer at full scale and waves are less steep in this region wyatt et al 2008 carried out full scale experimental measurements and numerical predictions of the wave pattern behind a semi plaining transom sterned vessel the mean height and spectra of the breaking stern waves were measured in situ by a light detection and ranging lidar sensor over a range of ship speeds both below and above the transom clearance froude number two different viscous flow solvers were employed and both displayed an over suppression of the transom waves in the late wake after the initial onset of breaking it was speculated that this resulted from an un modelled turbulent process due to unsteady interaction of the propulsors and appendages which may set up large organized turbulent structures that affect the dissipation of surface waves a detached eddy turbulence model was used by bhushan et al 2012 to investigate the vortical structures and associated instabilities of transom flow of the same full scale vessel as tested by wyatt et al 2008 the transom wave elevation instability was attributed to the karman like transom vortex shedding as both show the same dominant frequency the authors showed that the transom vortex shedding influenced the dynamic sinkage and trim as well they concluded that the instabilities in the flow did not show significant variation with scale propeller or motions employing a rans solver eslamdoost et al 2015 investigated the physics of transom clearance of a planing hull they reported an abrupt increase of the hull resistance at the critical froude number where the transom is just fully ventilated the peak in the resistance curve was caused by a sudden local increase in transom submergence related to the existence of a minimum in pressure coefficient and a maximum in streamline curvature at the transom edge haase et al 2016 investigated a catamaran hull at both model and full scale using an unsteady rans approach and validated them against the model test they reported the existence of a squashed horseshoe structure of the flow inside the stagnant area behind the transom which showed an unsteady behaviour at higher transom froude numbers the transom drag was identified as a significant component of the total resistance up to 70 at full scale indicating the importance of accurate prediction of the transom flow being interested in air entrainment physics hendrickson et al 2019 carried out an implicit large eddy simulation of the turbulent transom flow beyond the critical transom clearance froude number the authors concluded that the convergent corner wave region formed immediately after the wake is ballistic and thus only governed by the speed and geometry of the ship employing a lagrangian cavity identification technique they showed that the most potent air entrainment occurs at the position of wave breaking as presented above several studies have been carried out to understand the transom stern flow physics from different perspectives in the study described in this paper we investigated a new technique to reduce ships fuel consumption around transom clearance speed the basic idea was to use the recirculating water energy and the breaking rooster tail wave behind the hull at speeds below the critical one where the water clears the transom a device was placed inside the recirculating water region to stop the water from moving forward in the direction of hull movement the goal was to reduce the energy loss in the recirculating water region the device absorbs the momentum of the forward flowing water and pushes the hull forward the overall result is a reduced total resistance this idea has been patented in sweden eslamdoost et al 2020 and has an international patent pending the patent authorities know of no similar technique fig 2 shows a configuration used in the computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations and experiments inserting the transom pushing device tpd in the dead water region splits the bare hull recirculating zone into two separate regions fig 3 the shape and the horizontal and vertical positions of the device influence the flow and thus the forward pushing force the objective of the work was to understand the physics of the tpd better and to optimize the position both in towing and self propulsion mode the investigation was carried out using both cfd and experiments referred to as experimental fluid dynamics efd in the following text first the example hull and the tpd are introduced after that the efd technique is described followed by a description of the cfd technique then the computed and measured results are presented and finally some conclusions are drawn 2 test case the hull used in this study was a planing hull designed by sspa referred to as the sspa hull in the following text a body plan is presented in fig 4 and the longitudinal positions of the hull sections are shown in fig 5 the aft and fore perpendiculars are indicated by the numbers 0 and 20 respectively draft measurements were carried out at these sections the towing point of the hull was 95 mm below the deck level and was located at section 6 shown in fig 5 in table 1 the particulars of the hull are given the 3d printed propeller geometry is shown in fig 6 it has five blades with an outer diameter of 100 mm this propeller is not designed to operate at low speeds and thus its efficiency in the measurement speed range is lower than its best efficiency it should also be mentioned that the ittc guidelines for ship model testing state that the propeller diameter should be larger than 150 mm ittc 28 resistance committee 2017 however in the towing tank test carried out in this study the selection of the propeller diameter used in the towing tank tests was constrained by the available hull size thus the criterion recommended in the ittc guidelines for propeller diameter in the model test was not fulfilled moreover the 3d printed propeller was made of plastic that possibly deforms under high loading conditions the blade deformation may result in performance degradation these specifications can result in increased uncertainty of propeller performance measurement to reduce the uncertainties incorporated with the propeller power measurement only the relative change of propeller power with and without the tpd has been analysed in the paper the location of the propeller and the tpd relative to the hull are shown in fig 7 systematic variations of the tpd are reported in sections 5 3 and 5 4 in cfd the propeller is represented as a body force disk shown in the figure note that this disk is vertical this is to enable a better alignment with the grid to reduce numerical errors however even if the disk is upright the body forces are directed along the imagined shaft inclined 10 relative to the bottom note that no shaft was included in the computations there was a physical shaft in the experiments and the propeller was naturally at right angles to the shaft the centre of both propellers was the same and the position is shown in the figure a detail of the tpd mount is shown in fig 8 the tpd 1 is attached to a vertical bar 2 along which it can slide to different vertical positions the bar is attached to a balance 3 which in turn is connected to a horizontal u beam 4 this beam can slide longitudinally to position the tpd at different distances from the transom the balance measures horizontal and vertical forces 3 experimental technique 3 1 test facility the tests were performed in sspa s towing tank which is 260 m long the breadth and depth of the towing tank are 10 m and 5 m respectively the towing tank is spanned by a gantry carriage from which the ship model is towed all tests were performed in calm water 3 2 test arrangement the model was ballasted to the design loading condition the draught was verified at the forward perpendicular fp midships ms and aft perpendicular ap on both sides of the model during testing the model was fixed axially to the carriage with a rod and an electrical transducer that measured the towing force exerted on the model as the rod was adjusted to be parallel to the baseline the force was measured in the horizontal direction at all tests the model was kept on course by two guiding devices one at each perpendicular these devices also prevented the model from swaying and yawing while leaving it free to heave roll and pitch when moving the tpd longitudinally the centre of gravity moved backward this was compensated by moving a ballast weight in the longitudinal direction the following signals were measured and registered by a computer on the carriage model speed towing force vertical motion at fp vertical motion at ap vertical force on the tpd horizontal force on the tpd propeller shaft torque propeller rpm 4 numerical method 4 1 numerical details the numerical simulations were carried out with the code star ccm 15 02 a finite volume method in combination with control volumes dominated by trimmed hex mesh was used in this code to solve the unsteady mass and momentum conservation equations in integral form an implicit unsteady time stepping method was used this method has a wide stability range courant number larger than 1 and allows sizeable local time steps the volume of fluid vof method was used to obtain the volume fraction of the liquid which added one more equation to the system of equations convective terms in this equation were discretized using the hric scheme the free surface interface was expected to be sharp since this equation resolves the free surface within typically one cell the k ω sst turbulence model was used to compute the turbulence effects on the mean flow the boundary layers were resolved down to the wall and no wall functions were used this system of equations was solved using a segregated iterative solution method based on the simple algorithm the simulations were carried out employing a dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model to capture the dynamic sinkage and trim before starting the two degrees of freedom free sinkage and trim modelling the simulations were carried out with the fixed sinkage and trim until the pressure and viscous forces exerted on the hull were stabilized then the hull was released to sink and trim and the dfbi solver started to update the equilibrium position of the hull iteratively in the case of the bare hull a towing force was applied to the hull at the position where the hull was towed in the towing tank the location of the tow force is shown in fig 5 to the extent possible the tow force was kept parallel to the keel line during the resistance tests in the computations the magnitude of the tow force at each iteration is set equal to the hull s resistance computed from the previous iteration the propeller was modelled employing a uniform distribution of an axial body force inside a circular disk that encloses the propeller then the propeller thrust was included in the dfbi model as an external force acting on the hull inclined 10 4 2 grid only half of the geometry was used because the flow was considered symmetrical trimmed hexahedral grids and prism layers along walls were used to create the grids trimmed grids allow anisotropic local refinement around the hull and the free surface four levels of refinement inside arbitrarily defined volumes were used for the free surface and around the hull to capture the free surface the computational domain size and the overall grid distribution in the domain are shown in fig 9 as this study aimed to investigate the transom flow the highest refinement level was used in this region as shown in fig 10 the prism layer grid used to resolve the boundary layer is seen below the hull in the symmetry plane since no wall functions were used y was set to be around 1 with an expansion ratio of 1 1 in the wall normal direction 4 3 verification a systematic grid refinement study was carried out for froude number 0 4 with the tpd at x t p d z t p d 100 l p p 5 2 to obtain a suitable cell size and the corresponding discretization uncertainty the coordinate system is shown in fig 7 the study s froude number was just below the critical froude number where the water clears the transom eslamdoost et al 2015 eight grids with systematically varied grid parameters were used the number of cells in the coarsest grid was 0 944 10 6 and in the finest was 14 9 10 6 the convergence of the solution for the total resistance r t non dimensionalized by the displacement weight of the hull is shown in fig 11 since the grid is unstructured the step size r i on the horizontal axis is obtained as the third root of the total number of cells for the finest grid divided by the total number of cells for grid i the finest grid is represented by r 1 in this figure a formal verification based on the least squares root method by eça and hoekstra was also carried out eça and hoekstra 2014 this showed that a good compromise between numerical accuracy and computational effort was obtained with the second finest grid which was selected for further computations the number of cells for this grid was 5 8 10 6 and the numerical uncertainty 4 04 it should be noted that the verification method is for steady flows while some unsteadiness was detected in the computations described here particularly at froude numbers below the critical one a dependence on the time step may thus be expected 4 4 validation validation was done for the bare hull bh without the tpd fig 12 shows the predicted and measured resistance against the froude number as well as the magnitude of the comparison error in percent at the most interesting froude number 0 4 the comparison error is around 4 while the maximum error 8 occurs in the froude number range 0 35 0 60 for the lowest froude number the comparison error is relatively large around 14 note that the comparison error includes both computational and measurement errors unfortunately no estimate of the experimental error was available so a formal validation cannot be made however we can note that the comparison error for froude number 0 4 is about the same as the numerical uncertainty while it is more significant for the other froude numbers aft draft and fore draft results are shown in fig 13 the correspondence between cfd and efd is reasonably good except at the highest froude number a systematic variation of the position of the tpd was carried out to obtain its optimum position fig 14 shows the variation of the time averaged measured and computed horizontal force acting on the tpd both on the bare hull and the self propelled hull at fn 0 4 the non dimensional force acting on the tpd in the interval studied varies within 15 of the non dimensionalized total resistance at this speed the horizontal force acting on the tpd points forward when the tpd is positioned close to the transom and decreases as the tpd is positioned further from the transom the force even changes direction when the tpd is positioned sufficiently far from the transom the trends of the measured and computed force variations agree well with each other however the agreement level is much better when the tpd is located close to the transom x t p d l p p 100 6 we should keep in mind that the tpd is placed in the core of a turbulent flow region which may show large instabilities thus considering the complicated flow physics the agreement between the measured and computed horizontal tpd force is deemed satisfactory it should be noted that a large pushing force does not necessarily mean a large resistance reduction the tpd interacts with the transom flow and thus alters the transom resistance therefore to evaluate the performance of the tpd we should consider the total resistance of the hull including the tpd and not only the force acting on the tpd the physics of the tpd resistance reduction mechanism is discussed in 5 2 5 results 5 1 design of the tpd the tpd utilizes the energy in the recirculating water behind the transom in the lower speed ranges when the transom is still wet in the initial design phase two different flat plate geometries were placed in the recirculating water region fig 15 the plates were placed at the same longitudinal distance from the transom and an optimization study was carried out to obtain the largest resistance reduction as a function of vertical distance from the transom edge these preliminary studies showed a resistance reduction of 2 8 for the rectangular plate and 4 6 for the triangular plate at froude number 0 4 the pressure distribution on both sides of the plates is shown in fig 16 and fig 17 the high pressure on the front side of the rectangular plate shows that the corners penetrate the free stream flow which reduces the plate s efficiency thus as a modification to the initial design a triangular tpd was generated by trimming the lower corners of the rectangular plate the reduced pressure on the same face of the triangular tpd shows that trimming the lower corners of the rectangular plate produces a favourable result and the triangular tpd does not penetrate the free stream flow any longer as mentioned this modification improved the performance of the tpd by about 2 in comparison to the rectangular tpd however the flat triangular tpd is not streamlined and its sharp edges may increase the system resistance in cases where it penetrates the free stream flow to minimize the risk of increased resistance a curved surface that allows the free stream flow to pass smoothly is better than a flat plate moreover the tpd can cover a larger recirculating water area if its form is adapted to the structure of the recirculating region which itself is a function of the transom shape as well as the operating speed of the hull fig 18 shows the streamlines behind the transom in half of the recirculating region there are also several cross sections shown in this figure the dark blue area shows the flow moving backward and the red colour highlights the region where the flow moves in the forward direction the tpd function is to take advantage of the energy in this flow region and reduce the resistance the cross sections marked with red can be used to design an improved tpd form adapted to this region the projected area of the new design in fig 19 is taken from one of the cross sections and its edges are curved backward to avoid a sudden increase in resistance in cases where it moves out of the recirculating water zone the new design of the tpd is shown in fig 20 the new design offered a resistance reduction of 5 7 in the preliminary design stages which was 1 2 better than the triangular tpd note that this improvement was obtained in the early design phase of the project and through a systematic variation of tpd position we managed to improve the performance considerably the systematic variation of the tpd position is presented in section 5 3 5 2 physical understanding the basic idea behind the tpd is to take advantage of the momentum in the forward direction found in the recirculating zone behind the transom a device with significant resistance in this forward flowing water would create a pushing force when attached to the hull however preliminary calculations indicated that there might be other important unexpected effects in this section we describe how cfd was used to investigate the physics of the tpd 5 2 1 global versus local effect the first question is whether the tpd effect is related to the local flow behind the transom or to the global flow this was investigated by changing the hull attitude sinkage and trim to determine whether the tpd acts as a trim plane or alternatively reduces the resistance by reducing the size of the too large transom to investigate the effect of local and global flow changes three cases were compared for the optimum position shown in fig 29 of the tpd at x t p d l p p 100 5 and z t p d l p p 100 1 1 at fn 0 4 without the propeller in addition to the bare hull without the tpd bh and with the tpd bhpd a case was run with the same sinkage and trim as bhpd but without the tpd bh bhpd the effect of changes in sinkage and trim could then be evaluated the non dimensionalized fore and aft drafts of bh σ l p p 100 were 0 18 and 0 74 respectively the non dimensionalized fore and aft draft of bhpd and thus bh bhpd were 0 11 and 0 68 respectively these drafts resulted in a trim angle of 0 5 for bh and 0 4 for bhpd and thus bh bhpd the results are shown in table 2 where the resistance contributions are split into three components the hull excluding the transom hull the transom and the tpd the last row of table 2 shows that the total resistance changes very little due to the sinkage and trim change from 34 8 n to 34 0 n the effect of adding the tpd for the same trim is an order of magnitude larger a change from 34 0 n to 28 3 n the resistance reduction due to the changed sinkage and trim mainly comes from the hull 42 6 n changed to 41 5 n in contrast the transom contribution change is minor 7 8 n to 7 5 n adding the tpd increases the transom contribution considerably more from 7 5 to 8 9 while the most significant resistance reduction by far is due to the force from the tpd 4 6 n this investigation thus confirms the original idea that it is the force on the tpd that causes the resistance reduction when the tpd is in its optimum position one effect which was not foreseen in the original tpd idea was the increase of water level on the transom which increases its pushing force as we have seen in table 2 there is indeed such an effect at least for this condition in fig 21 the relative importance of the tpd and the increase in transom pushing force is shown for varying longitudinal positions of the tpd but with the vertical position fixed to the optimum at z t p d l p p 100 1 1 there is also a curve for the change in hull resistance excluding transom the tpd is the most significant contributor to the pushing force at all longitudinal positions the transom change contribution is much smaller but positive for large distances the transom effect approaches the tpd effect the hull effect is small and positive at small distances but negative when the tpd is distant from the transom the rise in water level at the transom when the tpd is in the optimum position is shown in fig 22 for this case the increase in the wetted area on the transom is 9 6 it may be of interest to also look at the water levels on the two sides of the tpd these are shown for the reference case in fig 23 the water level is much higher on the rear surface as expected this indicates the different pressures on the front and rear surfaces of the tpd that give the pushing force the pressures are presented in fig 24 in fig 25 the pressure forces on the two sides are displayed as a function of the tpd position the positive contributions to the pushing forces from the rear concave surface are much larger than the negative contributions from the front convex surface this is particularly so for the optimum longitudinal position and at positions closer to the transom at positions further from the transom the positive force is reduced and the negative one is increased absolute value which means that the total tpd force is decreased considerably note that all this is for the optimum vertical position z t p d l p p 100 1 1 if the vertical position of the tpd is varied the findings change fig 26 shows the contributions from the tpd the transom and the hull excluding the transom when the axial position was fixed to the optimum x t p d l p p 100 5 while the vertical position was varied apparently the relative contributions change drastically for non optimum vertical positions but interestingly the sum of the contributions i e the total effect is relatively constant if the tpd is pushed down into the free stream water moving backward its pushing force will naturally be reduced when it approaches the level of the transom edge the tpd will create a drag force however the high pressure in front of the tpd in this position will raise the water level on the transom thereby increasing its pushing effect also the tpd will act as a trim plane and create a bow down trim which reduces the hull drag due to the too large transom when the tpd is lifted above the optimum position the pushing force is naturally reduced it does not take full advantage of the recirculating flow in this position however even in this case there is a rise in the water level on the transom which increases its pushing effect and partly compensates for the loss in tpd force 5 2 2 tpd effect on the wave pattern the basic idea is that the tpd will take advantage of the forward moving water in the recirculating zone the question is whether it also changes the transmitted wave height fig 27 shows the wave pattern for the optimum position at fn 0 4 a reduction in wave height caused by the tpd is seen at least close to the hull fig 28 shows the wave height in the symmetry plane behind the hull again a reduction in wave height is seen close to the hull but the effect seems to decay with distance from the hull 5 3 systematic variations with and without a propeller in the figures above the optimum position of the tpd has been used as a reference and the effect of variations has been discussed referring to this section here the entire matrix of variations will be presented to obtain the optimum position of the tpd computations with a systematic variation in position were carried out with and without the tpd for the towed hull and the self propelled one the gain is visualized in fig 29 the maximum gain 16 75 is at the reference position x t p d z t p d 100 l p p 5 1 1 as seen in this figure the gain is relatively constant with x t p d variation around the optimum height but moving further away from the optimum height the gain drops considerably the corresponding gain for the self propelled case is presented in fig 30 it would have been more interesting to give the reduction in delivered power but that cannot be computed using the current approach with a body force disk representing the propeller the optimum occurs at the same axial position but at a smaller vertical distance from the transom edge x t p d z t p d 100 l p p 5 0 8 the magnitudes of the gains are smaller the maximum gain in the self propelled case is 11 9 from fig 30 it also appears that the best efficiency region for the tpd is more confined relative to the results from the towed hull this is attributed to the smaller recirculating region behind the transom in self propulsion compared to the towed hull the propeller accelerates the flow on the afterbody thus the flow has higher momentum which makes it less prone to break behind the transom the result will be a more confined recirculating region which has less energy for the tpd to harness a comparison between computed and measured resistance reductions for the bare hull is shown in fig 31 the maximum gain estimated using cfd is about 17 while the measured gain from the tests indicates approximately 11 resistance reduction the cfd and efd optimum positions are observed to be different in this figure we compare changes in forces which are about one order of magnitude smaller than the total resistance this may result in a significant comparison error direct comparison of the hull resistance fig 12 or the horizontal tpd forces fig 14 results in a much better agreement level especially when the magnitude of the force is large in the self propelled hull simulations an axial body force model has been used for modelling the propeller since the propulsive efficiency of the propeller is not known we cannot compute the delivered power instead we present the computed effective power resistance hull speed and the measured delivered power torque rotation rate below note that these quantities are not directly comparable fig 32 shows the gains achieved by placing the tpd at different distances from the transom the reference effective power is computed from the resistance of the simulated self propelled hull and the reference delivered power is obtained from the self propulsion measurement at fn 0 4 both without the tpd interestingly we can see that the gain in the measured delivered power in self propulsion fig 32 is more significant than the measured resistance reduction of the towed case fig 31 this may sound to be in contrast with an earlier conclusion in this section that due to a smaller recirculating water region in self propulsion the gains in resistance reduction will be smaller compared to the towed case however we should not forget the effect of the propulsive factors presumably the main contribution to the change in delivered power will come from the resistance change we should also keep in mind that the transom stern hulls are mainly designed to operate at speeds beyond the transom clearance froude number therefore the propeller of a transom stern vessel which operates at speeds below the transom clearance froude number operates in an off design condition where its efficiency is far from the best efficiency point a reduction of the ship resistance by the tpd results in an unloading of the propeller and thus a better efficiency is achieved therefore the tpd benefit is achieved not only by the reduced resistance but also by the improved propeller efficiency this is most likely the reason for the more significant measured total gain in self propulsion 15 2 compared to that of the towed case 11 the optimum position of the tpd at fn 0 4 was used to study the effect of the tpd on power reduction at other speeds as well fig 33 shows the gain in self propulsion versus froude number at different speeds somewhat surprisingly the gain increases when the froude number is reduced the most significant gain in power obtained from efd is about 25 at fn 0 2 in the range fn 0 3 to 0 5 the gains are between 13 and 18 which is much more than anticipated in the same range the effective power gains computed from cfd simulations vary between 10 and 14 so in both cases the reductions are considerable the performance of the tpd at froude numbers above the transom clearance froude number is surprising fig 34 displays the computed free surface profile at the symmetry plane with and without the tpd at froude number 0 5 the transom is fully ventilated at this froude number however both the cfd and efd data show that the tpd has reduced the power by about 14 inserting the tpd into the transom region at this froude number alters the transom flow differently as seen in fig 34 the interaction of the tpd and the transom waves results in an increase of transom clearance froude number the transom is not fully ventilated any longer and consequently the transom drag is reduced the tpd contributes to the resistance reduction through a pushing force as well moreover in contrast to the conclusion made in section 5 2 1 for the optimum tpd position at froude number 0 4 the tpd does alter the hull attitude slightly at this froude number as seen in fig 34 in the presence of the tpd the hull trim angle is somewhat reduced reduced aft draft which in turn reduces the hull resistance therefore at this froude number the tpd reduces the total resistance by altering both the local and the global flow 5 4 two propellers in this section the performance of the tpd is reported for a two propeller arrangement at froude number 0 4 and compared with the one propeller case presented above as stated in the computational method description section a body force model has been employed to model the propeller effect the dark blue areas in fig 35 show the regions where the body force has been deployed to accelerate the flow in the case of one propeller the propeller centre is placed on the hull symmetry plane diameter 100 mm in this section two propellers of smaller diameters diameter 70 mm are placed 150 mm away from the hull symmetry plane fig 35 table 3 shows the results obtained from cfd self propulsion simulations in the presence of one propeller and two propellers with and without the tpd the optimum tpd position obtained from self propulsion systematic optimization is used for all these simulations if we compare only the self propelled hulls without the tpd we notice that the hull resistance propeller thrust has increased by about 1 5 n when two propellers are used since the sinkage and trim angles for these hulls are almost the same only the local flow changes contribute to the increased hull resistance the leading cause is the decreased wetted area of the transom with two propellers compared to the self propulsion simulation with one propeller as a result the transom drag for the hull with two propellers increases about 1 3 n i e almost the entire drag difference between the cases based on the numerical study of the tpd position optimization in self propulsion we know that the tpd reduces the self propelled hull resistance thrust by 11 9 the resistance reduction increases to 14 4 when two propellers are used the sinkage and trim of these hulls are the same and again the local flow changes must be responsible for the lower resistance of the hull with two propellers in fact the pushing force of the tpd is slightly smaller for the hull with two propellers 0 6 n in comparison to 1 2 n however due to the interaction between the tpd and the transom the wetted surface area of the transom becomes the same for both hulls remember that the transom wetted surface area without the tpd was smaller for the hull with two propellers in the presence of the tpd the hulls have precisely the same wetted surface area and thus transom pushing force consequently the gain is more significant for two propellers 6 conclusions a transom pushing device tpd has been developed to reduce the resistance of transom stern planing hulls which operate at off design conditions where the transom is not ventilated and a recirculating water region exists behind the transom a spoon shaped tpd is considerably more efficient than a flat one rectangular and triangular plates were investigated but both were inferior to the newly developed spoon shape the tpd resistance reduction is mainly achieved through modification of pressure distribution in the aft region the waves behind the hull are also reduced by the tpd but this effect diminishes in the far wake for the optimum position of the tpd its main effect is as expected a pushing force generated by the device when it is located in the recirculating flow there is also a positive effect of a water level rise at the transom but that is much smaller in the low speed range the impact on sinkage and trim is minor however the tpd can act as a trim plate at speeds just above the transom clearance froude number for other positions of the tpd particularly in the vertical direction its role changes for a too low placement closer to the transom edge the pushing force is reduced considerably and may become negative however this effect is compensated to some degree by increasing the water level on the transom and a smaller trim of the hull systematic variations in position for the towed case showed a maximum resistance reduction in cfd by 17 while the measured maximum gain in efd was 11 this is for the most interesting froude number fn 0 4 for the self propelled case the maximum resistance thrust reduction was 11 in cfd while the reduction in power for efd was 15 again at fn 0 4 the propeller jet stream sweeps the transom wave further downstream making it less prone to break and fill in the transom hollow as a result the recirculating region behind the transom becomes smaller than that of the towed hull and consequently the gain in resistance is reduced however the total gain in self propulsion is not achieved solely by the resistance reduction the propeller of a planing hull at speeds below the transom clearance froude number operates in an off design condition the resistance reduction due to the tpd results in an unloading of the propeller and a better operating condition therefore the total gain in the delivered power is achieved through the resistance reduction as well as a more favourable operating condition for the propeller although the tpd position was optimized for fn 0 4 it is still effective both below and above this number cfd results also reveal that the tpd can be more effective when the thrust is distributed to two propellers rather than one
