alternative biofouling cleaning system designed for operation by crews on board ships that are en route of cruising to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first proposed antifouling practice for ships instead of thoroughly removing biofouling from a ship hull the aim of this new method is to interrupt the development of biofouling the duration between dry dock or in harbor underwater cleaning can be extended and the operational and maintenance costs are expected to be significantly reduced to the best of our knowledge few studies have addressed the effects of cleaning on biofouling in different types of operations in this experiment we tested the effectiveness of the proposed method and various practical considerations such as the integration of pump with nozzle arm and the availability and operational requirements for applying the system on a ship this paper presents the results of our experiment for answering primary questions such as how effective with which various nozzle jets remove biofouling we also discuss the potential of this system as a vital approach to be integrated into a complete antifouling strategy 2 method and procedure the experimental study simulated the process of in water biofouling cleaning system sliding on a ship hull and hydroblasting the hull simultaneously we conducted experiments in both field and laboratory conditions in the field we established time series for the development of biofouling on ship hull surfaces in a coastal environment in the laboratory we primarily tested the effectiveness of the cleaning system with a number of combinations of design parameters 2 1 observation of biofouling development 2 1 1 specimen preparation the field investigation simulated the progress of biofouling on the surfaces of a ship hull submerged in water the specimens for biofouling experiment were pvcsheets 400 200 3 mm 1 coated with one layer of commercial marine primer followed by one layer of oleoresin based inorganic marine paint sp 255 marine paint the marine primers include formulations based on specific materials e g vinyl chlorinated rubber epoxy and epoxy coal tar we prepared two sets of specimens all of which were weighed on an electronic scale precision aptp456b 3 kg 0 01 g before field incubation all specimens were prepared in triplicate to our knowledge the performance of any paint coating is directly dependent upon the correct and thorough preparation of the surface prior to coating we prepared each biofouling specimen by pickling it in a solution of hydrochloric acid with an inhibitor according to the c3 5 designation of astm g 1 90 astm 2003 the specimens were rinsed with deionized water and were then air dried and weighed before testing we prepared the specimens to ensure a surface profile allowing satisfactory adhesion of the coating to be applied the most expensive and technologically advanced coating system will fail if the surface preparation is incomplete 2 1 2 field incubation we arranged a series of specimens vertically on a steel rack set which was contained in a chamber we then sank the entire experimental system in water 1 8 m in depth near the shore at keelung port taiwan 121 46 31 e 25 09 06 n fig 1 shows the experimental system in coastal water the chamber was a rectangular plastic tank constructed from heavy gauge chemical and water resistant opaque orange cross linked polyethylene the bottom of the tank was removed to make it ready to sink to the seabed we used a measuring system with a miniaturized sensor for in situ water quality monitoring simbeye and yang 2014 the sensor system featured low energy consumption and automatic measurement and logging the data presented in this paper were taken during the entire testing period data were collected on temperature salinity concentration of chlorophyll a chl a nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 the physical environmental parameters including salinity and temperature were recorded 0 5 m below the surface by using a sya 2 2 salinometer and thermometer levels of nitrates in the form of soluble reactive phosphorus were determined using the molybdenum blue method immediately after sampling parsons et al 1984 the detection limits of no3 and po4 were 0 02 and 0 03 mmol l1 respectively the mean chl a concentration was then determined fluorometrically turner designs 10au fluorometer before and after acidification 2 1 3 determining biofouling growth we tested the biofouling growth 2 4 8 12 16 20 24 48 96 144 192 and 240 days after the specimens were set in the coastal

cleaning effectiveness ec we constructed an experimental system fig 2 to simulate the operation of the cleaning system proposed in this study the system mainly consisted of a specimen holder which was a 90 cm diameter frp ring and a hydraulic cleaning device submerged in a circular 120 cm diameter frp water tank the cleaning device was a series of interchangeable jet nozzles the water pressure was adjusted by controlling the pump s delivery valve we mounted flat jet nozzle tips fig 2 onto an 80 mm diameter stainless steel aisi 3030 pipe secured them in place with a retaining nut and sealed the system for high pressure operations the inner profile of each flat jet nozzle was designed to generate an even jet distribution for an effective cleaning action over the surface being treated the nozzle tips could easily be replaced and the jet could be conveniently oriented in any desired direction table 1 summarizes the specifications for the nozzles used in this study to protect against the risk of clogging we connected a filter set immediately before the delivery valve we determined the effectiveness of biofouling removal from specimens incubated in the coastal water for 2 4 8 12 16 20 24 48 96 144 192 and 240 days we retrieved the specimens from the experimental zone weighed them and loaded them onto the fouling cleaning system for hydroblasting we obtained the weight measurements for each retrieved specimen after the specimen had been hung vertically to drip dry for approximately 30 min we started pumps and adjusted the delivery valve and jet set for vacuum directional angle distance and water pressure next we rotated the specimen holder ring at an angular speed of approximately 5 per second to complete an entire cleaning circle for the specimen being cleaned table 2

specimen before cleaning g wc weight of specimen after cleaning g 2 3 propelling cleaning device on hull in this study the new cleaning system was designed with a series of jet nozzles fitted on a flexible arm that can adhere to a ship hull under the hydraulic suction force generated in its suction pads fig 3 the concept for propelling the suction device together with the nozzle arm is by fixing a fin of certain shape and dimension outward the suction device is used to maintain the nozzle arm adhering to ship hull when the ship starts to move forward water force against the fin will push the cleaning device along the hull sternward the suction force can be adjusted against the pushing force to allow the nozzle arm to slide on the surface of the hull as the ship moves forward the nozzle arm was propelled by water flow horizontally along the length of the specimen being cleaned we tested the suction force generated by water pressure in relation to the pushing forces acting on the nozzle arm a force gauge pce fm50 was used to measure the pushing forces 3 results 3 1 growth of biofouling fig 4 presents images and time series of growth g m2 and growth rate g m2 day of biomass on the ship hull specimens during the 195 days of the cleaning period the four images of the specimens were taken 89 95 129 158 days after the incubation system was immersed in the coastal water we observed obvious scattered plant coverage on the specimens on day 89 on day 95 and thereafter the surfaces of all the specimens were completely covered by organisms and the color of the paint was no longer visible after 129 days of incubation the colony of shells was obviously growing denser the results indicated that marine biofouling communities are complicated and virtually uncharacterized microorganisms begin to colonize a surface in a layer referred to as microfouling agrawl and kakac 1991 this layer of microorganisms includes fungi algae bacteria and diatoms formed within hours of immersion fischer et al 1984 keevil et al 1989 james and hayden 2000 the larvae of larger marine invertebrates referred to as macrofouling such as bryozoans mussels barnacles and polychaetes attach to the microfouling layer callow and callow 2000 guo et al 2012 we collected water quality data during biofouling incubation starting on day 52 april 10 2014 in the experimental zone during the incubation period water temperature varied between 11 c and 31 c following a typical spring to winter seasonal pattern the salinity remained largely consistent at approximately 32 psu throughout the incubation the measured ch a remained at approximately 1 μg l in general but there were two measurements up to approximately 1 6 μg l on days 74 and 116 the measured nitrates in the coastal water were between 10 and 35 μm during the earliest 116 days of incubation but increased sharply to 160 μm during the following 15 days similarly phosphate measurements remained below 1 5 μm for the earliest 116 days then increased sharply to nearly three times that figure within the next 15 days it is reasonable to believe that aside from water temperatures the variations of the water quality parameters were caused mainly by nonseasonal factors the tested body of water is located next to a wharf of approximately 10 nonlivable recreational boats such as kayaks and personal sails an aquaculture experimental station is also nearby that produces water discharges along the coastline 3 2 biofouling cleaning depending on the severity of biofouling and vessel type and size in water cleaning can be conducted using hydroblasters brushes or scrapers logan 2012 or by diver or remote operated cleaning vehicles floerl et al 2008 to counter the spread of invasive species caused by biofouling cleaning some regions and countries have established regulations requiring the proper collection and disposal of any material removed from ship hulls gossett 2012 imo 2011 still numerous dry docks may not be able to contain residue generated during cleaning hagan et al 2014 3 2 1 comparison of nozzles the operation of biofouling cleanup in this study consisted of directing a high pressure water jet at the surface of hull specimens retrieved from the field incubation system with hydroblasting the cleaning effect depends on the nature and condition of the hull surface and also on the characteristics of the water anzecc 1997 fig 5 compares the effectiveness of different nozzles for biofouling removal angles and types of nozzles have apparent effects on the effectiveness of biofouling removal fig 5 with a distance of 6 mm from nozzle tip to specimen surface the biofouling removal rates were 41 59 and 71 for 25 flat 65 flat and rotating jet respectively following the adjustment of pumping pressure from 12 to 30 kg cm2 the results also indicated that the biofouling removal rates were highly correlated with the water pressure used for hydroblasting this was true for all three types of nozzles used especially for the 65 flat jet r2 0 9801 and the rotating jet r2 0 9878 for the 25 flat jet nozzle the highest removal rate was approximately 40 when water pressure was increased to 30 kg cm2 for the 65 flat jet nozzle the removal rates ranged from 60 to 72 at a water pressure of 30 kg cm2 3 2 2 comparison of jet distance the results from this study indicate that for rotating nozzles the influence of the jet distances on the effectiveness of biofouling removal was not obvious as shown in fig 6 for the 65 flat nozzle when the jet distances were increased from 6 to 11 mm the highest removal rate remained at approximately 70 however comparing the correlations between water pressures and removal rates the correlation was more significant with a jet distance of 6 mm r2 0 988 than with a distance of 11 mm r2 0 616 distance from the water jet to the fouled surface also had an effect usually for removing surface plant fouling in dockyard practices pressures vary over a wide range and can be as high as 350 bars valle and burgui 2015 shell fouling layers may resist the water jets woods et al 2012 3 3 propelling cleaning device on hull fig 7 presents the relationship between vacuums in suction devicecreated by pumping under various pumping pressures the generated vacuums were almost proportional to the water pressure applied r2 0 908 fig 8 presents the relationship between pulling forces for moving cleaning devices along ship hulls under various pumping pressures the pushing forces used to propel the suction device were increased with higher water pressure 4 discussion 4 1 penalty of biofouling on ship the management of ship hull is an important component of the efficient operation of ships after a ship that has been serviced at a dry dock returns to the water for operation its smooth hull may gradually roughen following biofouling and corrosion which increase frictional drag and lead to increases in fuel consumption and other operational costs schultz et al 2011 the penalties of biofouling depend mainly on the seriousness of fouling and ship speed zebra mussels do not settle on a hull at water flow speeds greater than 2 m sec townsin 2003 assuming bunker fuel oil price to be us 250 per ton a serious biofouling would cost an additional us 2500 per day for a containership that uses 100 tons of fuel oil daily to maintain its standard cruise speed thus a fleet of 100 containerships would cost us 90 million annually to compensate for the fuel penalty caused by biofouling moreover biofouling also blocks seawater intake and adversely influences cooling system circulation the costs associated with hull fouling also include expenditures for hull coating renewal schultz et al 2011 therefore ship owners and operators have sufficient incentives to address biofouling using cost effective measures including the method presented in this paper furthermore biofouling concerns organizations and authorities responsible for health and environmental issues the additional fuel consumption also increases atmospheric pollutants e g nitrogen oxides nox sulfur oxides sox particulate matter and greenhouse gas emissions proportionately the ship s energy efficiency management plan and other energy efficiency regulations developed by the imo for minimizing the negative effects of hull fouling provide a globally consistent approach to the management of biofouling and the potential economic benefits associated with the implementation of these regulations imo 2013 can motivate stakeholders to take action regarding economic incentives the contractual arrangements in the transportation chain determine who benefits from operational cost savings the economic interests of ship owners or operators may not always support the investments required to improve operational efficiency however a company considering the most effective strategy tends to take a holistic view of its options 4 2 reducing bioinvasion through in water cleaning ballast water is a vector for bioinvasion therefore it is internationally regulated biofouling on ship hulls can be a comparable vector for bioinvasion posing threats to human health domestic ecosystems aquatic environments the tourism fishing and marine industries and coastal real estate values minchin and gollasch 2003 drake and lodge 2007 biofouling removed from a vessel may contain nonindigenous species and result in automatic identification system ais related problems davidson et al 2009 piola et al 2009 hewitt and campbell 2010 imo 2011 inglis et al 2010 found that of all biofouling species identified from more than 500 international vessels sampled at various new zealand ports 68 were nonindigenous species mcclary and nelligan 2001 inglis et al 2010 thus ensuring that hull biofouling treatment is undertaken in a manner that contains and eliminates all organisms removed from hull surfaces is desirable floerl et al 2008 roberts and tsamenyi 2008 takata et al 2006 woods et al 2012 suggested that routine in water hull cleaning between dry docks could significantly reduce ais problems however the control of marine nonindigenous species through vessel biofouling remains largely voluntary which inhibits the development of approaches to address the problem imo 2011 numerous currently available in water hull cleaning methods neither contain the organisms that are removed from hulls nor treat them prior to release into coastal water these methods could pose biosecurity threats valle and burgui 2015 hopefully over the next few years more nations and the imo will begin to recognize that reliance on voluntary biofouling control will not effectively limit bioinvasion and nations will start to legislate more stringent hull cleaning procedures and more advanced technologies hagan et al 2014 imo 2011 the method presented in this paper may meet the requirement to have a minimal effect on ais problems related to vessel biofouling because it minimizes opportunities for biofouling growth and proceeds in open oceans 4 3 alternatives for hull friction reduction the easiest means to practice minimizing hull friction for ships is reducing both sailing speed and submerged surface area a large amount of development has been dedicated to modifying surface fluid interaction either by changing how seawater behaves or by improving the surface texture of the wetted area 4 3 1 underwater cleaning and maintenance merchant cargo ships use hull cleaning on an as needed basis in general currently used methods of in water cleaning can be a vital part of biofouling management the process is to conduct a precleaning inspection to determine the need for cleaning and the tools to use however establishing a containment system for in water hull cleaning is rather difficult thus in water hull cleaning can introduce various types and degrees of environmental risk the process can also cause coating damage and corrosion of the ship hull the fact can be easily ignored when it is known that a coating will be applied during the next dry docking in 3 5 years kane 2010 however some ship operators are motivated to extend the period before dry docking because of costs and other operational factors the cleaning system proposed in this paper is an appropriate toolwhich can effectively remove the fouling without excessive wear of the af paint 4 3 2 antifouling strategy innovation the tendency of organisms to adhere to a hull and colonize its surface is a crucial practical challenge for ship operation most methods of ship hull maintenance focus on surface modifications to minimize either the bacterial attachment or the viability of the attachment the ship hull may not be effectively protected after a long time period has elapsed microorganisms e g bacteria and algae can grow to a point where they provide biofilm as a primary foundation that incubates growing macroorganisms e g seaweed barnacles and mollusks a hull area infested with macroorganisms tends to generate high concentrations of microorganisms on surrounding hull areas causing a feedback loop that amplifies minor biofouling into major biofouling if the biofilm is eliminated it becomes impossible for organisms to reproduce and subsequently develop although bacterial attachment to surfaces has long been extensively studied the influence of surface topography on bacteria material interactions has received little attention until recently hasan and chatterjee 2015 modification of the biomaterial surface topography is a promising strategy to prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation minchin et al 2006 recently publications have reported that microscale and nanoscale modification of material surfaces can offer novel antifouling surfaces the results presented by valle and burgui 2015 revealed that three dimensional micrometer structures have a profound influence on bacterial attachment instead of cleaning a hull after an outbreak of biofouling the strategy of our en route biofilm cleaning is focused on intermittently interrupting the continuous development of a biofouling system this can effectively prevent the growth of biofouling the results obtained in the current field and laboratory experiments demonstrate that water jets can remove biofilm from a ship hull to a certain degree more importantly this can effectively disrupt the development of biofouling systems and prolong the stage at which biofouling is present but does not substantially degrade ship performance 4 3 3 system availability the proposed cleaning system is designed for simplicity low weight low cost and convenient en route operation by onboard crews all components necessary for integrating the hydroblasting system proposed in this study are available in a wide range of compatible specifications and the system can be manufactured at relatively low cost for instance nozzles of standard types are commercially available with various flow rates 1 5 47 l per minute and spray angles they are most commonly applied for car washing and industrial cleaning a tapered thread allows for a firm connection and appropriate spray orientation the nozzles are fabricated from aisi 316l grade stainless steel to ensure capacity tolerances within 3 of the nominal value 5 conclusions and suggestions the initial motivation of this study was to remove masses of biofouling effectively however over the course of this study we found that it may be more beneficial to interrupt the continuity of the development of a biofouling system in addition to potential cost reduction for ship operator results from this study demonstrates that the application of the en route hydroblasting method may bring opportunity of overall environmental benefit prevention of biofouling using simple methods can be a hope for any stakeholder who is responsible for the costs benefits long term investment value total ownership cost and environmental impact of any ship or fleet the prevention of biofilm growth on ship hulls may be impossible but biofilms can be treated intermittently and their growth can be interrupted effectively the system and method provided in this paper is to be implemented prior to an excessive slime buildup that would expedite the development of a mature and complete biofouling system we determined the extent to which the proposed technology can be used to prevent the buildup of biofouling on international vessels to reduce the global transfer of nonindigenous species and to contribute to the future development of useful solutions although ignoring possible biofouling is widely recognized as being costly for ship operation costly hull cleanings are still delayed until a ships is in a dry dock or in port we suggest that future studies use this cleaning system periodically while monitoring the status of biofouling to determine the effectiveness of the interference the results can also be used to establish parameters e g cleaning cycle duration for a strategic plan

data were collected on temperature salinity concentration of chlorophyll a chl a nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 the physical environmental parameters including salinity and temperature were recorded 0 5 m below the surface by using a sya 2 2 salinometer and thermometer levels of nitrates in the form of soluble reactive phosphorus were determined using the molybdenum blue method immediately after sampling parsons et al 1984 the detection limits of no3 and po4 were 0 02 and 0 03 mmol l1 respectively the mean chl a concentration was then determined fluorometrically turner designs 10au

cleaning effectiveness ec we constructed an experimental system fig 2 to simulate the operation of the cleaning system proposed in this study the system mainly consisted of a specimen holder which was a 90 cm diameter frp ring and a hydraulic cleaning device submerged in a circular 120 cm diameter frp water tank the cleaning device was a series of interchangeable jet nozzles the water pressure was adjusted by controlling the pump s delivery valve we mounted flat jet nozzle tips fig 2 onto an 80 mm diameter stainless steel aisi 3030 pipe secured them in place with a retaining nut and sealed the system for high pressure operations the inner profile of each flat jet nozzle was designed to generate an even jet distribution for an effective cleaning action over the surface being treated the nozzle tips could easily be replaced and the jet could be conveniently oriented in any desired direction table 1 summarizes the specifications for the nozzles used in this study to protect against the risk of clogging we connected a filter set immediately before the delivery valve we determined the effectiveness of biofouling removal from specimens incubated in the coastal water for 2 4 8 12 16 20 24 48 96 144 192 and 240 days we retrieved the specimens from the experimental zone weighed them and loaded them onto the fouling cleaning system for hydroblasting we obtained the weight measurements for each retrieved specimen after the specimen had been hung vertically to drip dry for approximately 30 min we started pumps and adjusted the delivery valve and jet set for vacuum directional angle distance and water pressure next we rotated the specimen holder ring at an angular speed of approximately 5 per second to complete an entire cleaning circle for the specimen being cleaned table 2

specimen before cleaning g wc weight of specimen after cleaning g 2 3 propelling cleaning device on hull in this study the new cleaning system was designed with a series of jet nozzles fitted on a flexible arm that can adhere to a ship hull under the hydraulic suction force generated in its suction pads fig 3 the concept for propelling the suction device together with the nozzle arm is by fixing a fin of certain shape and dimension outward the suction device is used to maintain the nozzle arm adhering to ship hull when the ship starts to move forward water force against the fin will push the cleaning device along the hull sternward the suction force can be adjusted against the pushing force to allow the nozzle arm to slide on the surface of the hull as the ship moves forward the nozzle arm was propelled by water flow horizontally along the length of the specimen being cleaned we tested the suction force generated by water pressure in relation to the pushing forces acting on the nozzle arm a force gauge pce fm50 was used to measure the pushing forces 3 results 3 1 growth of biofouling fig 4 presents images and time series of growth g m2 and growth rate g m2 day of biomass on the ship hull specimens during the 195 days of the cleaning period the four images of the specimens were taken 89 95 129 158 days after the incubation system was immersed in the coastal water we observed obvious scattered plant coverage on the specimens on day 89 on day 95 and thereafter the surfaces of all the specimens were completely covered by organisms and the color of the paint was no longer visible after 129 days of incubation the colony of shells was obviously growing denser the results indicated that marine biofouling communities are complicated and virtually uncharacterized microorganisms begin to colonize a surface in a layer referred to as microfouling agrawl and kakac 1991 this layer of microorganisms includes fungi algae bacteria and diatoms formed within hours of immersion fischer et al 1984 keevil et al 1989 james and hayden 2000 the larvae of larger marine invertebrates referred to as macrofouling such as bryozoans mussels barnacles and polychaetes attach to the microfouling layer callow and callow 2000 guo et al 2012 we collected water quality data during biofouling incubation starting on day 52 april 10 2014 in the experimental zone during the incubation period water temperature varied between 11 c and 31 c following a typical spring to winter seasonal pattern the salinity remained largely consistent at approximately 32 psu throughout the incubation the measured ch a remained at approximately 1 μg l in general but there were two measurements up to approximately 1 6 μg l on days 74 and 116 the measured nitrates in the coastal water were between 10 and 35 μm during the earliest 116 days of incubation but increased sharply to 160 μm during the following 15 days similarly phosphate measurements remained below 1 5 μm for the earliest 116 days then increased sharply to nearly three times that figure within the next 15 days it is reasonable to believe that aside from water temperatures the variations of the water quality parameters were caused mainly by nonseasonal factors the tested body of water is located next to a wharf of approximately 10 nonlivable recreational boats such as kayaks and personal sails an aquaculture experimental station is also nearby that produces water discharges along the coastline 3 2 biofouling cleaning depending on the severity of biofouling and vessel type and size in water cleaning can be conducted using hydroblasters brushes or scrapers logan 2012 or by diver or remote operated cleaning vehicles floerl et al 2008 to counter the spread of invasive species caused by biofouling cleaning some regions and countries have established regulations requiring the proper collection and disposal of any material removed from ship hulls gossett 2012 imo 2011 still numerous dry docks may not be able to contain residue generated during cleaning hagan et al 2014 3 2 1 comparison of nozzles the operation of biofouling cleanup in this study consisted of directing a high pressure water jet at the surface of hull specimens retrieved from the field incubation system with hydroblasting the cleaning effect depends on the nature and condition of the hull surface and also on the characteristics of the water anzecc 1997 fig 5 compares the effectiveness of different nozzles for biofouling removal angles and types of nozzles have apparent effects on the effectiveness of biofouling removal fig 5 with a distance of 6 mm from nozzle tip to specimen surface the biofouling removal rates were 41 59 and 71 for 25 flat 65 flat and rotating jet respectively following the adjustment of pumping pressure from 12 to 30 kg cm2 the results also indicated that the biofouling removal rates were highly correlated with the water pressure used for hydroblasting this was true for all three types of nozzles used especially for the 65 flat jet r2 0 9801 and the rotating jet r2 0 9878 for the 25 flat jet nozzle the highest removal rate was approximately 40 when water pressure was increased to 30 kg cm2 for the 65 flat jet nozzle the removal rates ranged from 60 to 72 at a water pressure of 30 kg cm2 3 2 2 comparison of jet distance the results from this study indicate that for rotating nozzles the influence of the jet distances on the effectiveness of biofouling removal was not obvious as shown in fig 6 for the 65 flat nozzle when the jet distances were increased from 6 to 11 mm the highest removal rate remained at approximately 70 however comparing the correlations between water pressures and removal rates the correlation was more significant with a jet distance of 6 mm r2 0 988 than with a distance of 11 mm r2 0 616 distance from the water jet to the fouled surface also had an effect usually for removing surface plant fouling in dockyard practices pressures vary over a wide range and can be as high as 350 bars valle and burgui 2015 shell fouling layers may resist the water jets woods et al 2012 3 3 propelling cleaning device on hull fig 7 presents the relationship between vacuums in suction devicecreated by pumping under various pumping pressures the generated vacuums were almost proportional to the water pressure applied r2 0 908 fig 8 presents the relationship between pulling forces for moving cleaning devices along ship hulls under various pumping pressures the pushing forces used to propel the suction device were increased with higher water pressure 4 discussion 4 1 penalty of biofouling on ship the management of ship hull is an important component of the efficient operation of ships after a ship that has been serviced at a dry dock returns to the water for operation its smooth hull may gradually roughen following biofouling and corrosion which increase frictional drag and lead to increases in fuel consumption and other operational costs schultz et al 2011 the penalties of biofouling depend mainly on the seriousness of fouling and ship speed zebra mussels do not settle on a hull at water flow speeds greater than 2 m sec townsin 2003 assuming bunker fuel oil price to be us 250 per ton a serious biofouling would cost an additional us 2500 per day for a containership that uses 100 tons of fuel oil daily to maintain its standard cruise speed thus a fleet of 100 containerships would cost us 90 million annually to compensate for the fuel penalty caused by biofouling moreover biofouling also blocks seawater intake and adversely influences cooling system circulation the costs associated with hull fouling also include expenditures for hull coating renewal schultz et al 2011 therefore ship owners and operators have sufficient incentives to address biofouling using cost effective measures including the method presented in this paper furthermore biofouling concerns organizations and authorities responsible for health and environmental issues the additional fuel consumption also increases atmospheric pollutants e g nitrogen oxides nox sulfur oxides sox particulate matter and greenhouse gas emissions proportionately the ship s energy efficiency management plan and other energy efficiency regulations developed by the imo for minimizing the negative effects of hull fouling provide a globally consistent approach to the management of biofouling and the potential economic benefits associated with the implementation of these regulations imo 2013 can motivate stakeholders to take action regarding economic incentives the contractual arrangements in the transportation chain determine who benefits from operational cost savings the economic interests of ship owners or operators may not always support the investments required to improve operational efficiency however a company considering the most effective strategy tends to take a holistic view of its options 4 2 reducing bioinvasion through in water cleaning ballast water is a vector for bioinvasion therefore it is internationally regulated biofouling on ship hulls can be a comparable vector for bioinvasion posing threats to human health domestic ecosystems aquatic environments the tourism fishing and marine industries and coastal real estate values minchin and gollasch 2003 drake and lodge 2007 biofouling removed from a vessel may contain nonindigenous species and result in automatic identification system ais related problems davidson et al 2009 piola et al 2009 hewitt and campbell 2010 imo 2011 inglis et al 2010 found that of all biofouling species identified from more than 500 international vessels sampled at various new zealand ports 68 were nonindigenous species mcclary and nelligan 2001 inglis et al 2010 thus ensuring that hull biofouling treatment is undertaken in a manner that contains and eliminates all organisms removed from hull surfaces is desirable floerl et al 2008 roberts and tsamenyi 2008 takata et al 2006 woods et al 2012 suggested that routine in water hull cleaning between dry docks could significantly reduce ais problems however the control of marine nonindigenous species through vessel biofouling remains largely voluntary which inhibits the development of approaches to address the problem imo 2011 numerous currently available in water hull cleaning methods neither contain the organisms that are removed from hulls nor treat them prior to release into coastal water these methods could pose biosecurity threats valle and burgui 2015 hopefully over the next few years more nations and the imo will begin to recognize that reliance on voluntary biofouling control will not effectively limit bioinvasion and nations will start to legislate more stringent hull cleaning procedures and more advanced technologies hagan et al 2014 imo 2011 the method presented in this paper may meet the requirement to have a minimal effect on ais problems related to vessel biofouling because it minimizes opportunities for biofouling growth and proceeds in open oceans 4 3 alternatives for hull friction reduction the easiest means to practice minimizing hull friction for ships is reducing both sailing speed and submerged surface area a large amount of development has been dedicated to modifying surface fluid interaction either by changing how seawater behaves or by improving the surface texture of the wetted area 4 3 1 underwater cleaning and maintenance merchant cargo ships use hull cleaning on an as needed basis in general currently used methods of in water cleaning can be a vital part of biofouling management the process is to conduct a precleaning inspection to determine the need for cleaning and the tools to use however establishing a containment system for in water hull cleaning is rather difficult thus in water hull cleaning can introduce various types and degrees of environmental risk the process can also cause coating damage and corrosion of the ship hull the fact can be easily ignored when it is known that a coating will be applied during the next dry docking in 3 5 years kane 2010 however some ship operators are motivated to extend the period before dry docking because of costs and other operational factors the cleaning system proposed in this paper is an appropriate toolwhich can effectively remove the fouling without excessive wear of the af paint 4 3 2 antifouling strategy innovation the tendency of organisms to adhere to a hull and colonize its surface is a crucial practical challenge for ship operation most methods of ship hull maintenance focus on surface modifications to minimize either the bacterial attachment or the viability of the attachment the ship hull may not be effectively protected after a long time period has elapsed microorganisms e g bacteria and algae can grow to a point where they provide biofilm as a primary foundation that incubates growing macroorganisms e g seaweed barnacles and mollusks a hull area infested with macroorganisms tends to generate high concentrations of microorganisms on surrounding hull areas causing a feedback loop that amplifies minor biofouling into major biofouling if the biofilm is eliminated it becomes impossible for organisms to reproduce and subsequently develop although bacterial attachment to surfaces has long been extensively studied the influence of surface topography on bacteria material interactions has received little attention until recently hasan and chatterjee 2015 modification of the biomaterial surface topography is a promising strategy to prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation minchin et al 2006 recently publications have reported that microscale and nanoscale modification of material surfaces can offer novel antifouling surfaces the results presented by valle and burgui 2015 revealed that three dimensional micrometer structures have a profound influence on bacterial attachment instead of cleaning a hull after an outbreak of biofouling the strategy of our en route biofilm cleaning is focused on intermittently interrupting the continuous development of a biofouling system this can effectively prevent the growth of biofouling the results obtained in the current field and laboratory experiments demonstrate that water jets can remove biofilm from a ship hull to a certain degree more importantly this can effectively disrupt the development of biofouling systems and prolong the stage at which biofouling is present but does not substantially degrade ship performance 4 3 3 system availability the proposed cleaning system is designed for simplicity low weight low cost and convenient en route operation by onboard crews all components necessary for integrating the hydroblasting system proposed in this study are available in a wide range of compatible specifications and the system can be manufactured at relatively low cost for instance nozzles of standard types are commercially available with various flow rates 1 5 47 l per minute and spray angles they are most commonly applied for car washing and industrial cleaning a tapered thread allows for a firm connection and appropriate spray orientation the nozzles are fabricated from aisi 316l grade stainless steel to ensure capacity tolerances within 3 of the nominal value 5 conclusions and suggestions the initial motivation of this study was to remove masses of biofouling effectively however over the course of this study we found that it may be more beneficial to interrupt the continuity of the development of a biofouling system in addition to potential cost reduction for ship operator results from this study demonstrates that the application of the en route hydroblasting method may bring opportunity of overall environmental benefit prevention of biofouling using simple methods can be a hope for any stakeholder who is responsible for the costs benefits long term investment value total ownership cost and environmental impact of any ship or fleet the prevention of biofilm growth on ship hulls may be impossible but biofilms can be treated intermittently and their growth can be interrupted effectively the system and method provided in this paper is to be implemented prior to an excessive slime buildup that would expedite the development of a mature and complete biofouling system we determined the extent to which the proposed technology can be used to prevent the buildup of biofouling on international vessels to reduce the global transfer of nonindigenous species and to contribute to the future development of useful solutions although ignoring possible biofouling is widely recognized as being costly for ship operation costly hull cleanings are still delayed until a ships is in a dry dock or in port we suggest that future studies use this cleaning system periodically while monitoring the status of biofouling to determine the effectiveness of the interference the results can also be used to establish parameters e g cleaning cycle duration for a strategic plan

many countries pay more attention to exploitation of ocean energy such as wave energy tidal current energy ocean thermal and salinity gradient energy wave energy is an abundant and dense form of renewable energy wave energy converters with different geometry and configuration are currently developed by different technology companies babarit et al 2014 such as small bottom referenced heaving buoy floating oscillating water column bottom fixed heave buoy array bottom fixed oscillating flap and so on one of the most promising wave energy converters wecs is oscillating wave surge converter owsc which is an effective contender in the challenge to extract energy from waves whittaker and folley 2012 with simple structure the owsc is suitable for shallow and inter mediate water depth and has a much higher energy to surface area ratio babarit et al 2014 such as oyster renzi et al 2014 which consists of a large buoyant flap hinged near the seabed the flap oscillates back and forth under the action of the incident waves and the kinetic energy of the flap is converted into electrical energy by pumping high pressure water ashore to drive a hydro electric turbine this design is good but when it is mounted on the sea bottom several problems will appear such as difficulty in maintenance corrosion by sea water and oil leakage pollution do et al 2015 to avoid these problems some researchers hansen et al 2013 zurkinden et al 2014 designed the land hinged owsc whose hinged joints and hydraulic device can be placed above the water or on the coast although the land hinged owsc is convenient in maintenance and avoids corrosion by sea water it is still necessary to investigate its hydrodynamics characteristics which are directly related to wave power capturing efficiency therefore hydrodynamics characteristics of land hinged owsc will been investigated by numerical methods in this paper earlier grid based numerical methods were used to simulate waves and fluid solid interaction problems kim et al 2001 used a finite difference method to simulate 3 d non linear multi directional waves ning and teng 2007 used a three dimensional boundary element model to simulate a fully nonlinear irregular wave tank ning et al 2008 further studied nonlinear regular and focused waves in an infinite water depth the numerical simulations of linear water waves and the wave structure interaction are explored by finnegan and goggins 2012 because of the extreme deformation of the free surface like wave breaking splashing and fragmentation of the air water surface the floating motions with large amplitude are still considered as a challenging problem for grid based numerical methods smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph liu and liu 2010 monaghan 2005 is a meshless lagrangian method which uses a particle interpolation method to compute smooth field variables each particle has the independent physical information mass density pressure position velocity and internal energy and those quantities are derived by interpolation or constitutive relations without association with a grid sph method does not suffer from the mesh distortion problems thus it can easily simulate free surface flows especially for water wave splashing and fragmentation liu and liu 2010 based on different conditions sequentially sph method or its evolved methods have been widely applied to investigate the interactions between waves and floating bodies monaghan and kos 2000 were the first to simulate fluid solid interactions using the sph method shao and gotoh 2004 used incompressible sph method combined with a large eddy simulation model to simulate the coupled motion between waves and the floating curtain wall delorme et al 2009 and shao et al 2012 investigated liquid sloshing by sph method in comparison with experimental and reference results bouscasse et al 2013 simulated nonlinear interaction between waves and the complex geometric body using δ sph bing ren et al 2015 studied nonlinear interaction between waves and a rectangular box using the wcsph method pengnan sun et al 2015 applied wcsph to simulate violent fluid solid interaction therefore it is convinced that sph method can be used to study the hydrodynamics characteristics of land hinged owsc the paper is organized as follows in section 2 sph model is briefly outlined and the boundary treatment is described in section 3 6 standing waves regular waves the interaction between wave and rigid plate and bottom hinged owsc are simulated to validate numerical methods respectively in section 7 the interactions between waves and land hinged owsc are simulated and hydrodynamics characteristics of land hinged owsc are discussed finally some conclusions are given 2 methodology 2 1 sph scheme 2 1 1 integral approximation sph method starts from the concept of integral representation of a function f x liu and liu 2003 the value of f x at material position x can be reconstructed by convolution of known values f x with a smoothing kernel function in the surrounding domain ω the linear approximation of f x is defined by liu and liu 2010 2 1 f x ω f x w x x h d x where w x x h is the smoothing kernel function d x is the differential volume element h is the smoothing length defining the influence area of the kernel function w the support domain ω is a circular or a spheroidal domain in a two or three dimensional space respectively if f x of eq 2 1 is substituted by f x we can obtain 2 2 f x ω f x w x x h d x where f x denotes the gradient of function f x according to the principle of integration by parts eq 2 2 can be expressed as 2 3 f x s f x w x x h n d s ω f x w x x h d x where n is the unit vector normal to the surface s since the kernel function w is defined to have compact support the surface integral within the computational domain is usually zero therefore the gradient of function f x can be approximated by liu and liu 2010 2 4 f x ω f x w x x h d x where the antisymmetric property w x x h w x x h has been implicitly used the kernel function w should satisfy normalization or unity condition delta function property compact condition and symmetric condition four kinds of kernel functions are considered in this paper as shown in the followings the cubic spline function monaghan and lattanzio 1985 is 2 5 w α d 2 3 r 2 1 2 r 3 0 r 1 1 6 2 r 3 1 r

α d 3 r 5 6 2 r 5 15 1 r 5 0 r 1 3 r 5 6 2 r 5 1 r 2 3 r 5 2 r 3 0 r 3 the gaussian function gingold and monaghan 1977 is 2 8 w α d e r 2 r 3 0 r 3 where r x x h is dimensionless distance between the particles x and x α d is 15 7πh 2 96 1199πh 2 7 478πh 2 and 1 πh 2 for cubic spline quartic spline quintic spline and gaussian functions in two dimensional space respectively 2 1 2 particle approximation the integral form of eq 2 1 can be approximated by the convolution sum 2 9 f i j m j ρ j f j w i j where f i f x i and w ij w x i x j h subscripts i and j denote the particle index m and ρ are mass and density respectively the summation is over all particles within the compact support domain of particle i in order to improve the accuracy near boundaries the rhs of eq 2 9 is normalized by the sph summation of the smoothing function itself over the neighboring particles liu and liu 2010 2 10 f i j m j ρ j f j w i j j m j ρ j w i j the integral form of eq 2 4 can be approximated by the convolution sum 2 11 f i j m j ρ j f j i w i j where i w i j x i x j r i j w i j r i j r ij denotes distance between particles i and j the following identify is usually employed inside the gradient operator monaghan 2005 2 12 f f f 1 the same procedure of the particle approximation to obtain eq 2 11 is applied to each gradient term on the right hand side of eq 2 12 the following expression is obtained 2 13 f i j m j ρ j f j f i i w i j similarly if the operational symbol in eq 2 12 is substituted by eq 2 13 can be rewritten as 2 14 f i j m j ρ j f j f i i w i j based on a variational approach bonet and lok 1999 demonstrated that if the continuity equation is expressed using eq 2 13 the internal force due to the pressure field should be evaluated by eq 2 14 also colagrossi et al 2009 gave the proof that eqs 2 13 and 2 14 not only naturally satisfy the dynamic free surface boundary condition but also conserve momentum 2 2 governing equations the euler equations for mass and momentum conservation in a lagrangian frame of reference are described as follows 2 15 d ρ d t ρ u ρ d u d t p ρ g where t represents time ρ is the scalar density u is the velocity vector p denotes the pressure and g is the body force the pressure p is solved by using the weakly compressible equation which is expressed as morris et al 1997 2 16 p c 0 2 ρ ρ 0 where ρ 0 is the reference density and c 0 is the artificial sound speed considering computational cost c 0 is usually defined much lower than true sound speed in order to meet the incompressible properties the artificial sound speed c 0 is taken as following max u 2 c 0 2 g d c 0 2 0 01 monaghan 1994 where d represents the depth of water 2 3 discrete governing equations the artificial viscous term is discretized as molteni and colagrossi 2009 2 17 τ i α h c ρ 0 j m j ρ j u j u i r j r i r j r i 2 i w colagrossi et al 2011 pointed out that eq 2 17 can implicitly satisfy the dynamic free surface boundary condition in a weak sense the artificial viscous coefficient α is usually in the range 0 01 0 05 antuono et al 2011 in all simulations considered in this paper it has been set equal to 0 01 unless noted otherwise padova et al 2014 discussed the artificial viscosity coefficient α in sph modelling of regular waves confirmed the capability of sph to simulate regular breaking waves and demonstrated the important role of the artificial viscous coefficient furthermore the relationship between the artificial viscous coefficient α and the physical kinematic viscosity ν antuono et al 2011 is 2 18 ν α h c 0 2 d i m 2 where d im is the number of spatial dimension spurious pressure fluctuations may occur due to the reflection of acoustic waves one of the popular methods to overcome the problem is δ sph model antuono et al 2010 in which a proper diffusive term is added to the continuity equation in order to remove the spurious high frequency oscillations the density diffusive term reads as 2 19 ρ δ δ h c 0 j m j ρ j ψ i j i w i j 2 20 ψ i j 2 ρ i ρ j x i x j r i j 2 ρ i l ρ j l where the coefficient δ determines the intensity of the diffusion of density and is usually set to be 0 1 marrone et al 2011 ρ l represents the renormalized density gradient marrone et al 2011 and is expressed as 2 21 ρ i l j m j ρ j ρ i ρ j l i i w i j 2 22 l i j m j ρ j x i x j i w i j using eqs 2 13 and 2 14 to discretize the velocity divergence and pressure gradient respectively and introducing the density diffusive term and the artificial viscous term into eq 2 15 the discrete governing equations are expressed as colagrossi and landrini 2003 marrone et al 2011 2 23 d ρ i d t ρ i j m j ρ j u i u j i w i j ρ δ i ρ i d u i d t j m j ρ j p i p j i w i j ρ i g τ i 2 4 boundary conditions in this paper the boundary and virtual particles are created to represent solid walls for the sake of discussions the boundary and virtual particles located on and outside the solid walls respectively are both called as boundary particles to calculate the physical information of boundary particles the projecting points huang et al 2015 are created and associated to these boundary particles as shown in fig 1 the displacement between boundary particle x b and projecting point x p satisfies the following relation 2 24 x p x b n b ε δ where n b is normal vector of boundary particle and δ is the initial particle spacing ε is the factor which is set to guarantee that the distance between the projecting point and the boundary line is the half of initial particle spacing the fluid variables velocity pressure and density of the projecting point are evaluated through eq 2 10 herein it should be noted that j represents the fluid particles interacting with projecting points based on the projecting points the fluid variables of the boundary particles are calculated as followings for motionless walls the free slip condition is adopted the tangential velocity is maintained by u τ b u τ p where u τ b is the tangential velocity of the boundary particle and u τ p is the tangential velocity of the projecting point corresponding to the boundary particle in order to prevent fluid particle from going through the solid boundary the normal velocity of the boundary particle is equal and opposite to that of the projecting point the pressure of boundary particle p b is obtained by oger et al 2006 2 25 p b p p ρ 0 g n b ε δ where p p is the pressure of the projecting point corresponding to the boundary particle n b εδ is the displacement between boundary particle x b and projecting point x p then the density of boundary particle ρ b can be calculated by inverted weakly compressible equation 2 26 ρ b ρ 0 p b c 0 2 for the piston type wave maker the velocity of the boundary particle is derived by motion function of piston for the floating body the velocity of the boundary particle is derived by motion function of floating body the motion functions of the piston type wave maker and the floating body will be described in sections 2 6 and 2 7 respectively the pressure of moving boundary particle is computed by bouscasse et al 2013 2 27 p b p p ρ d u b d t n b g n b ε δ where d u b dt is the accelerate of the boundary particle 2 5 the boundary force model to prevent the penetration of fluid particles across the solid walls monaghan 1994 exerted a repulsive force on the fluid particles adjacent to the boundary the particular form of the force was chosen to be similar to the lennard jones force of molecular dynamics however acting on a fluid particle moving parallel to the boundary these lennard jones forces can feel a non uniform normal force and a nonzero tangential force and cause a large disturbance to the flow near a boundary an alternative form of the repulsive boundary force that may reduce the disturbance on the flow was proposed by han et al 2013 this model can be written as follows 2 28 f i j u max 2 min u i u j n j 1 w

2 3 standing waves 3 1 computational model in fig 2 the 2 d sketch of the standing waves tank is shown the length of tank is l the height of the tank wall is 1 2l and the depth of water is d d l here all walls in this case are fixed initially fluid particles with the particle spacing δ are evenly laid in the fluid domain of the tank and three layers boundary particles are evenly distributed in walls of the tank the initial velocity potential is defined by the potential theory antuono et al 2011 3 1 φ 0 x y h g 2 σ cosh k y d cosh k d cos k x h is the wave height σ is circular frequent d is the depth of water k 2π λ is the corresponding wave number here wave length λ l l is the tank length the initial velocity can be derived by φ 0 x y the right plot of fig 2 shows the initial velocity vector and pressure contour at time t 0 the free surface is horizontal and the initial density is given by 3 2 ρ 0 ρ r 1 g d c 2 3 2 results and discussions for the viscous fluid the total energy of fluid particles goes to zero and the standing wave is completely damped for long time evolution for finite values of smoothing length h and neglecting the boundary layer dissipation the analytical solution of the total kinetic energy over time is described as follows antuono et al 2011 3 3 e k i n λ g h 2 32 e β t 1 cos 2 σ t the damping coefficient β 4νk 2 depends on the wave number k and the kinematic viscosity ν which is described in eq 2 18 two different damping coefficients are considered β 0 3432 and β 0 1648 respectively the damping coefficient is adjusted by kinematic viscosity which varies according to the artificial viscous coefficient α and the initial particle spacing δ according to antuono et al 2011 sph cannot properly simulate gravity waves whose amplitude is less than mean particle distance and a good agreement is observed only when h δ 4 therefore the wave height h is 8δ and 48δ for β 0 3432 and 0 1648 respectively fig 3 shows time history of the total kinetic energy predicted by sph with different kernel functions described in section 2 the spatial resolutions are l 100 and l 250 which make about 11 000 and 65 000 particles respectively for β 0 3432 and 0 1648 respectively the results by gaussian and quintic spline functions are well agreement with analytical solutions whereas cubic and quartic spline functions don t produce similar results also it is found that the total kinetic energy predicted by quartic spline function is closer to the analytic solution than that predicted by cubic spline function it may be the reason that the kernel function with the large support domain can maintain more interacting particle pairs than that with the small support domain and thus the kernel function with the large support domain not only improves numerical accuracy but also tends to decrease the effect of disorder particles the simulations are performed on a desktop computer using an intel r core tm i7 4790k processor quad core 4 0 ghz under a windows 7 64 bit edition operating system the time consumed by different kernel functions with the resolution δ l 250 is given in table 1 as a result of more interacting particle pairs gaussian and quintic spline functions take more time than quartic and cubic spline functions however we believe that it is worth for sph to use gaussian or quintic spline function for simulations of waves since low precision kernel functions usually generate extra numerical dissipations since low precision kernel functions are difficult to produce satisfactory results results from cubic and quartic spline functions will not be presented in the followings fig 4 shows time history of the total kinetic energy by sph with different spatial resolutions for β 0 3432 the particle sizes δ are l 50 l 80 and l 100 respectively for β 0 1648 the particle sizes δ are l 90 l 150 and l 250 respectively herein the artificial viscosity coefficient α is altered to keep fixed damping coefficient β for different spatial resolutions with the increasing of spatial resolutions results of sph with gaussian or quintic spline function converge to the analytical solution furthermore as the damping coefficient β decreases the resolution has to also increase to produce satisfactory results these results show the good convergence properties of present sph scheme for simulations of free surface flows fig 5 shows time history of the total kinetic energy by sph with or not boundary force model herein the particle sizes are l 100 and l 250 for β 0 3432 and 0 1648 respectively results by sph with or not boundary force model are good agreement with the analytical solutions it indicates that the modified boundary force model presented in section 2 5 has few effects on numerical accuracy however if there is no the boundary force model the particle penetration may occur which will be presented in section 4 4 regular waves 4 1 computational model fig 6 shows the 2d numerical wave tank the depth of water is d and the tank length is l 40d the wave height h is 0 23d and wave length λ is 7 4d a piston type wavemaker located at the left boundary of the tank is used to produce regular waves the down and right boundaries of the tank are free slip solid walls as shown in fig 6 the time profiles of water surface elevation are collected at two different positions which are located at x d 1 and x d 18 respectively 4 2 results and discussions fig 7 shows the time profiles of water surface elevation η at x d 18 predicted by gaussian function and quintic spline function in comparison with the solutions of bem mel lugni 1999 the initial particle spacing δ d 50 is used in this case it is found from fig 7 that the results of gaussian function may be closer to the solutions of bem mel than those of quintic spline function fig 8 shows the particle distributions at the t 5 d g 1 2 predicted by the gaussian function and the quintic spline function respectively it can be seen that the gaussian function may help sph acquire more uniform particles than the quintic spline function the regular particle distribution usually leads the better accuracy and stability than the irregular particle distribution for long time simulations hence it means that gaussian function may possess higher accuracy and stability than quintic spline function for simulations of the wave propagation fig 9 shows the time profiles of water surface elevation η at x d 18 predicted by different spatial resolutions in comparison with the solutions of bem mel the gaussian function is adopted and particle resolutions are d 25 d 50 and d 100 the total number of particles is about 25 000 100 000 and 400 000 respectively the case with δ d 50 requires 110 000 iterations and takes about 19 h with the increase of the resolution the wave elevation by sph tends to the convergent solution of the bem mel signal again the results show the good convergence properties of present sph scheme fig 10 shows the particle snapshots at t 1 3 d g 1 2 from left plot corresponding to the case of no boundary force the penetration of fluid particles across the wall is observed however if the boundary force model is used no fluid particles penetrate across the wall boundary as shown in right plot of fig 10 therefore the boundary force model is important to prevent the penetration of fluid particles across the wall especially when the high relative speed between fluid particles and boundaries exists generally waves inside the computational domain may cause reflections at boundaries these reflections may lead to unphysical behavior of waves at the boundaries however the long enough tank may usually suppress or reduce the intensity of reflected waves fig 11 shows the time profiles of water surface elevation η with different tank lengths l 40d 30d and 25d which make about 106 000 80 000 and 66 000 particles respectively the time consumed by different tank lengths is given in table 2 it can be seen that from fig 11 the water surface elevation with l 25d deviates from the analytical or reference solutions after t 4 0 d g 1 2 which may be caused by the superposition of the reflection waves and incident waves with the increase of the tank lengths the wave elevation tends to the analytical or reference solutions therefore if the tank length is long enough and simulation time is short enough it may avoid the effect of the wave reflections on results however for a longer time simulation with surface piercing structures special treatment like inner source generation of waves ning et al 2015 should be considered to avoid wave reflections at the end of water tank 5 interaction between wave and rigid plate 5 1 computational model in this section the interaction between solitary wave and a plate is simulated to validate the computational wave force as shown in fig 12 the model is presented based on seiffert et al s experimental model seiffert et al 2014 in present case the length of wave tank is 4 0 m and its height is 0 12 m the solitary wave is generated by a piston type wavemaker the plate is fixed at the middle of wave tank and 1 2 m away from wavemaker the plate length and thickness are 0 305 m and 0 0127 m respectively the plate is submerged in the water entirely and the top of plate is leveled with still water surface the still water depth d is 0 114 m and wave amplitude h a is 0 3d the particle space δ 0 002 is implemented here and 120 000 particles are generated this case requires 85 000 iterations which take about 17 h 5 2 numerical results time series of the total vertical and horizontal forces on the plate are shown in fig 13 a and b respectively in comparison with the experimental results the measured forces have be divided by the plate width 0 149m because the numerical simulations are implemented in two dimensional space while the experiments are three dimensional it should be noted here that t 0 does not necessarily indicate the time when experiments start seiffert et al 2014 in order to comparing with the experimental results the computed vertical force should subtract the initial still water pressure the vertical and horizontal forces by sph reach their peak at 2 03s and 2 12s respectively which are well agreement with results by the experiment the maximum value of vertical force by sph is slightly larger than the experimental result fig 14 shows snapshots of pressure and particles acquired by sph simulations at t 1 5s the wave starts to impact on the plate and the forces on the plate start to increase gradually at t 2 22s it can be observed that the water waves on top of the plate begin to dash against those below the plate and the water near the right side of the plate sprays and splashes on the plate the spray and splash bring about the oscillation of the vertical force after 2 4s as shown in fig 13 a 6 bottom hinged oscillating wave surge converter 6 1 computational model fig 15 shows the bottom hinged owsc model which is the same with the case given by m brito et al 2016 the flap is mounted at the bottom of the tank 7 92 m from the wavemaker the flap model is a 0 54 m 0 12 m box with a hinge height of 0 16 m the mass of flap is 33 kg the mass center is 0 16 m above the axis of the half bottom tube and the inertia is 1 84 kg m2 the wave tank is 18 m long with the 2 5 m slope for absorbing waves the off shore still water depth d is 0 69 m the regular waves with wave period t 2s and wave height h 0 12 m are generated by a piston type wavemaker located at the left end of the tank the gaussian function is adopted and three particle resolutions δ 0 01 m 0 0075 m and 0 005 m are implemented the total number of particles is about 100 000 180 000 and 390 000 respectively the case with δ 0 01 m requires 110 000 iterations and takes about 9 h 6 2 numerical results in this paper the power take off pto system is simplified to the restoring torque k d ω described in eq 2 37 if there is no pto system the damping coefficient kd is 0 furthermore the effect of the pto system on the flap angle may be considered by introducing the damping coefficient kd 35 fig 16 shows the time series of the flap angle θ predicted by present sph model in comparison with the results from sphysics brito et al 2016 which is an open source parallel cfd solver based on sph crespo et al 2015 the negative rotating angles denote counter clockwise rotations and the positive ones denote clockwise rotations the time variation of the flap angle from present sph model is in reasonable agreement with data from sphysics confirming the applicability of the present numerical model also the flap rotation angles from three resolutions almost coincide which shows a good convergence what s more we can see that the damping coefficient kd has significant influence on the flap angle which will be emphasize again in simulations of land hinged owsc fig 17 shows pressure snapshots of sph simulations at various time at time t 5s the flap is swinging back while at time t 6s it is swinging forth it can be also observed that the angles of the flap at t 5s and t 7s are both in second quadrant since the wave period is t 2s which also confirms the correct behavior under the action of regular waves 7 land hinged oscillating wave surge converter 7 1 computational model and boundary conditions in this section the interaction between waves and land hinged owsc is simulated by sph method and some parameters which likely have an effect on wave energy capturing efficient are investigated fig 18 shows the land hinged owsc model the length of water tank is l 40 m with water depth d 0 8 m the piston type wavemaker is located on the left end of the tank a pivoted absorber is fixed and semi immersed and its center of rotation is located at point o x r z r following harmonic wave loadings the absorber swings up and down around the rotation center o the profile of absorber is described in fig 19 the mass and inertia of the absorber are 79 kg and 83 5 kg m2 respectively and the mass center x c is marked in fig 19 too the gaussian function is adopted and the initial particle spacing δ is 0 02 in all simulations 7 2 results and discussion 7 2 1 the effect of heights of rotation center herein the symbol d sin is used to denote the distance between rotation center o and still water surface to investigate effect of d sin on rotation angles three different depths d sin 0 1 m 0 15 m and 0 2 m are simulated respectively regular waves with wave height h 0 25 m and period t 2s are produced by the wave maker located at the left end of the tank the damping coefficient of pto is k d 2000 fig 20 shows the time history of rotation angle θ for different d sin three different depths d sin produce almost the same swing amplitude it means that the distance of rotation center o to still water surface has few effects on wave energy capturing efficiency 7 2 2 the effect of wave heights for studying the impact of wave heights on movements of absorber four wave heights with the same period t 2s are investigated the four wave heights are 0 1 m 0 15 m 0 2 m and 0 25 m respectively the rotation center is located at point 6 0 0 9 i e d sin 0 1 m in this part the pto is shut down which denotes that the damping coefficient is zero the time series of the rotation angle θ can be observed in fig 21 the negative rotating angles denote clockwise rotations for different wave heights with the same period the phases of absorber are in good agreement whereas amplitudes of absorber increasingly grow with the increase of wave heights it means that the wave energy capturing efficiency increasingly grows with the increase of wave heights which makes a logical behavior under the action of regular waves 7 2 3 the effect of pto damping coefficients to explore the effect caused by pto damping coefficients different damping coefficients k d are exerted on the absorber under different wave conditions the instantaneous power p can be calculated by p k d ω 2 where ω denotes angular velocity of absorber and the active power p u can be computed by p u 1 t 0 t p t d t the rotation center is located at point 6 0 0 9 i e d sin 0 1 m fig 22 shows instantaneous power of absorber with different pto damping coefficients it can be seen that the peak of instantaneous power with k d 2000 is larger than those with k d 100 and 5000 fig 23 shows the active power p u with pto damping coeffcients for different periods with increasing of pto damping coeffcients the active power p u increases at first and then reduces thus there exists the most optimal damping coeffient which can help the absorber capture more wave energy comparing three curves of the active power p u for different wave periods it can be found that the optimum pto damping coefficient varies with wave periods the optimum pto damping coefficients are about 2000 3000 and 4000 for t 2s 3s and 4s respectively also it can be observed that when the optimal pto damping coefficient is adopted the wave period t 2s has lager active power than t 3s and 4s therefore the active power of land hinged owsc strongly depends on both the pto damping coefficients and the wave periods 8 conclusions standing waves regular waves the interaction between wave and rigid plate and bottom hinged oscillating wave surge converter owsc are simulated to validate the accuracy of numerical methods the results of sph are compared with the analytical solutions or reference results and good agreements are achieved these results demonstrate that sph method presented in this paper can give acceptable results for the simulations of voilent waves finally the weakly compressible sph scheme with diffusive terms is applied to investigate the hydrodynamics characteristics of land hinged oscillating wave surge converter owsc the following preliminary conclusions are obtained the selection of kernel function is critical for accuracy of sph method gaussian kernel can be regarded as a proper kernel function for simulations of waves for simulations of voilent waves fulid particles panetrating across solid walls may happen the modified boundary force model presented in this paper not only prevents the penetration of fluid particles across the solid walls but also has few effects on numerical accuracy generally it is able to avoid the effect of the wave reflections on internal flows if the tank length is long enough the distance of rotation center to still water surface has few effects on wave energy capturing efficiency the amplitudes of absorber increasingly grow with the increase of wave heights which means that the wave energy capturing efficiency increasingly grows with the increase of wave heights the pto damping coefficients and the wave periods have important effect on active power and there is the optimal damping coeffient for a fixed wave period acknowledgements the authors would like to

many countries pay more attention to exploitation of ocean energy such as wave energy tidal current energy ocean thermal and salinity gradient energy wave energy is an abundant and dense form of renewable energy wave energy converters with different geometry and configuration are currently developed by different technology companies babarit et al 2014 such as small bottom referenced heaving buoy floating oscillating water column bottom fixed heave buoy array bottom fixed oscillating flap and so on one of the most promising wave energy converters wecs is oscillating wave surge converter owsc which is an effective contender in the challenge to extract energy from waves whittaker and folley 2012 with simple structure the owsc is suitable for shallow and inter mediate water depth and has a much higher energy to surface area ratio babarit et al 2014 such as oyster renzi et al 2014 which consists of a large buoyant flap hinged near the seabed the flap oscillates back and forth under the action of the incident waves and the kinetic energy of the flap is converted into electrical energy by pumping high pressure water ashore to drive a hydro electric turbine this design is good but when it is mounted on the sea bottom several problems will appear such as difficulty in maintenance corrosion by sea water and oil leakage pollution do et al 2015 to avoid these problems some researchers hansen et al 2013 zurkinden et al 2014 designed the land hinged owsc whose hinged joints and hydraulic device can be placed above the water or on the coast although the land hinged owsc is convenient in maintenance and avoids corrosion by sea water it is still necessary to investigate its hydrodynamics characteristics which are directly related to wave power capturing efficiency therefore hydrodynamics characteristics of land hinged owsc will been investigated by numerical methods in this paper earlier grid based numerical methods were used to simulate waves and fluid solid interaction problems kim et al 2001 used a finite difference method to simulate 3 d non linear multi directional waves ning and teng 2007 used a three dimensional boundary element model to simulate a fully nonlinear irregular wave tank ning et al 2008 further studied nonlinear regular and focused waves in an infinite water depth the numerical simulations of linear water waves and the wave structure interaction are explored by finnegan and goggins 2012 because of the extreme deformation of the free surface like wave breaking splashing and fragmentation of the air water surface the floating motions with large amplitude are still considered as a challenging problem for grid based numerical methods smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph liu and liu 2010 monaghan 2005 is a meshless lagrangian method which uses a particle interpolation method to compute smooth field variables each particle has the independent physical information mass density pressure position velocity and internal energy and those quantities are derived by interpolation or constitutive relations without association with a grid sph method does not suffer from the mesh distortion problems thus it can easily simulate free surface flows especially for water wave splashing and fragmentation liu and liu 2010 based on different conditions sequentially sph method or its evolved methods have been widely applied to investigate the interactions between waves and floating bodies monaghan and kos 2000 were the first to simulate fluid solid interactions using the sph method shao and gotoh 2004 used incompressible sph method combined with a large eddy simulation model to simulate the coupled motion between waves and the floating curtain wall delorme et al 2009 and shao et al 2012 investigated liquid sloshing by sph method in comparison with experimental and reference results bouscasse et al 2013 simulated nonlinear interaction between waves and the complex geometric body using δ sph bing ren et al 2015 studied nonlinear interaction between waves and a rectangular box using the wcsph method pengnan sun et al 2015 applied wcsph to simulate violent fluid solid interaction therefore it is convinced that sph method can be used to study the hydrodynamics characteristics of land hinged owsc the paper is organized as follows in section 2 sph model is briefly outlined and the boundary treatment is described in section 3 6 standing waves regular waves the interaction between wave and rigid plate and bottom hinged owsc are simulated to validate numerical methods respectively in section 7 the interactions between waves and land hinged owsc are simulated and hydrodynamics characteristics of land hinged owsc are discussed finally some conclusions are given 2 methodology 2 1 sph scheme 2 1 1 integral approximation sph method starts from the concept of integral representation of a function f x liu and liu 2003 the value of f x at material position x can be reconstructed by convolution of known values f x with a smoothing kernel function in the surrounding domain ω the linear approximation of f x is defined by liu and liu 2010 2 1 f x ω f x w x x h d x where w x x h is the smoothing kernel function d x is the differential volume element h is the smoothing length defining the influence area of the kernel function w the support domain ω is a circular or a spheroidal domain in a two or three dimensional space respectively if f x of eq 2 1 is substituted by f x we can obtain 2 2 f x ω f x w x x h d x where f x denotes the gradient of function f x according to the principle of integration by parts eq 2 2 can be expressed as 2 3 f x s f x w x x h n d s ω f x w x x h d x where n is the unit vector normal to the surface s since the kernel function w is defined to have compact support the surface integral within the computational domain is usually zero therefore the gradient of function f x can be approximated by liu and liu 2010 2 4 f x ω f x w x x h d x where the antisymmetric property w x x h w x x h has been implicitly used the kernel function w should satisfy normalization or unity condition delta function property compact condition and symmetric condition four kinds of kernel functions are considered in this paper as shown in the followings the cubic spline function monaghan and lattanzio 1985 is 2 5 w α d 2 3 r 2 1 2 r 3 0 r 1 1 6 2 r 3 1 r

α d 3 r 5 6 2 r 5 15 1 r 5 0 r 1 3 r 5 6 2 r 5 1 r 2 3 r 5 2 r 3 0 r 3 the gaussian function gingold and monaghan 1977 is 2 8 w α d e r 2 r 3 0 r 3 where r x x h is dimensionless distance between the particles x and x α d is 15 7πh 2 96 1199πh 2 7 478πh 2 and 1 πh 2 for cubic spline quartic spline quintic spline and gaussian functions in two dimensional space respectively 2 1 2 particle approximation the integral form of eq 2 1 can be approximated by the convolution sum 2 9 f i j m j ρ j f j w i j where f i f x i and w ij w x i x j h subscripts i and j denote the particle index m and ρ are mass and density respectively the summation is over all particles within the compact support domain of particle i in order to improve the accuracy near boundaries the rhs of eq 2 9 is normalized by the sph summation of the smoothing function itself over the neighboring particles liu and liu 2010 2 10 f i j m j ρ j f j w i j j m j ρ j w i j the integral form of eq 2 4 can be approximated by the convolution sum 2 11 f i j m j ρ j f j i w i j where i w i j x i x j r i j w i j r i j r ij denotes distance between particles i and j the following identify is usually employed inside the gradient operator monaghan 2005 2 12 f f f 1 the same procedure of the particle approximation to obtain eq 2 11 is applied to each gradient term on the right hand side of eq 2 12 the following expression is obtained 2 13 f i j m j ρ j f j f i i w i j similarly if the operational symbol in eq 2 12 is substituted by eq 2 13 can be rewritten as 2 14 f i j m j ρ j f j f i i w i j based on a variational approach bonet and lok 1999 demonstrated that if the continuity equation is expressed using eq 2 13 the internal force due to the pressure field should be evaluated by eq 2 14 also colagrossi et al 2009 gave the proof that eqs 2 13 and 2 14 not only naturally satisfy the dynamic free surface boundary condition but also conserve momentum 2 2 governing equations the euler equations for mass and momentum conservation in a lagrangian frame of reference are described as follows 2 15 d ρ d t ρ u ρ d u d t p ρ g where t represents time ρ is the scalar density u is the velocity vector p denotes the pressure and g is the body force the pressure p is solved by using the weakly compressible equation which is expressed as morris et al 1997 2 16 p c 0 2 ρ ρ 0 where ρ 0 is the reference density and c 0 is the artificial sound speed considering computational cost c 0 is usually defined much lower than true sound speed in order to meet the incompressible properties the artificial sound speed c 0 is taken as following max u 2 c 0 2 g d c 0 2 0 01 monaghan 1994 where d represents the depth of water 2 3 discrete governing equations the artificial viscous term is

boundary condition in a weak sense the artificial viscous coefficient α is usually in the range 0 01 0 05 antuono et al 2011 in all simulations considered in this paper it has been set equal to 0 01 unless noted otherwise padova et al 2014 discussed the artificial viscosity coefficient α in sph modelling of regular waves confirmed the capability of sph to simulate regular breaking waves and demonstrated the important role of the artificial viscous coefficient furthermore the relationship between the artificial viscous coefficient α and the physical kinematic viscosity ν antuono et al 2011 is 2 18 ν α h c 0 2 d i m 2 where d im is the number of spatial dimension spurious pressure fluctuations may occur due to the reflection of acoustic waves one of the popular methods to overcome the problem is δ sph model antuono et al 2010 in which a proper diffusive term is added to the continuity equation in order to remove the spurious high frequency oscillations the density diffusive

conditions in this paper the boundary and virtual particles are created to represent solid walls for the sake of discussions the boundary and virtual particles located on and outside the solid walls respectively are both called as boundary particles to calculate the physical information of boundary particles the projecting points huang et al 2015 are created and associated to these boundary particles as shown in fig 1 the displacement between boundary particle x b and projecting point x p satisfies the following relation 2 24 x p x b n b ε δ where n b is normal vector of boundary particle and δ is the initial particle spacing ε is the factor which is set to guarantee that the distance between the projecting point and the boundary line is the half of initial particle spacing the fluid variables velocity pressure and density of the projecting point are evaluated through eq 2 10 herein it should be noted that j represents the fluid particles interacting with projecting points based on the projecting points the fluid variables of the boundary particles are calculated as followings for motionless walls the free slip condition is adopted the tangential velocity is maintained by u τ b u τ p where u τ b is the tangential velocity of the boundary particle and u τ p is the tangential velocity of the projecting point corresponding to the boundary particle in order to prevent fluid particle from going through the solid boundary the normal velocity of the boundary particle is equal and opposite to that of the projecting point the pressure of boundary particle p b is obtained by oger et al 2006 2 25 p b p p ρ 0 g n b ε δ where p p is the pressure of the projecting point corresponding to the boundary particle n b εδ is the displacement between boundary particle x b and projecting point x p then the density of boundary particle ρ b can be calculated by inverted weakly compressible equation 2 26 ρ b ρ 0 p b c 0 2 for the piston type wave maker the velocity of the boundary particle is derived by motion function of piston for the floating body the velocity of the boundary particle is derived by motion function of floating body the motion functions of the piston type wave maker and the floating body will be described in sections 2 6 and 2 7 respectively the pressure of moving boundary particle is computed by bouscasse et al 2013 2 27 p b p p ρ d u b d t n b g n b ε δ where d u b dt is the accelerate of the boundary particle 2 5 the boundary force model to prevent the penetration of fluid particles across the solid walls monaghan 1994 exerted a repulsive force on the fluid particles adjacent to the boundary the particular form of the force was chosen to be similar to the lennard jones force of molecular dynamics however acting on a fluid particle moving parallel to the boundary these lennard jones forces can feel a non uniform normal force and a nonzero tangential force and cause a large disturbance to the flow near a boundary an alternative form of the repulsive boundary force that may reduce the disturbance on the flow was proposed by han et al 2013 this model can be written as follows 2 28 f i j u max 2 min u i u j n j 1 w i j h i j d i m n j r i j n j u i u j n j 0 0 u i u j n j 0 where r ij x i x j and h ij h i h j 2 d im is the number of spatial dimension f ij represents repulsive force of the boundary particle j acting on the fluid particle i n j is the normal vector of the boundary particle j u max denotes maximum velocity of all fluid particles to keep same dimension on two sides of eq 2 28 we make a little modification to eq 2 28 the modified equation is rewritten as follows 2 29 f i j c 0 u i u j n j w i j h i j d i m n j r i j n j u i u j n j 0 0 u i u j n j 0 where the threshold i e 1 is removed and the artificial sound speed c 0 is used to replace u max 2 2 6 wavemaker theory 2 6 1 regular wave theory the regular waves are produced by the piston type wave maker which is located at one end of the long water tank the horizontal displacement and velocity of the piston are given by omidvar et al 2015 respectively 2 30 x piston t s 2 sin σ t 2 31 u piston t s σ 2 cos σ t for piston type wavemaker

2 3 standing waves 3 1 computational model in fig 2 the 2 d sketch of the standing waves tank is shown the length of tank is l the height of the tank wall is 1 2l and the depth of water is d d l here all walls in this case are fixed initially fluid particles with the particle spacing δ are evenly laid in the fluid domain of the tank and three layers boundary particles are evenly distributed in walls of the tank the initial velocity potential is defined by the potential theory antuono et al 2011 3 1 φ 0 x y h g 2 σ cosh k y d cosh k d cos k x h is the wave height σ is circular frequent d is the depth of water k 2π λ is the corresponding wave number here wave length λ l l is the tank length the initial velocity can be derived by φ 0 x y the right plot of fig 2 shows the initial velocity vector and pressure contour at time t 0 the free surface is horizontal and the initial density is given by 3 2 ρ 0 ρ r 1 g d c 2 3 2 results and discussions for the viscous fluid the total energy of fluid particles goes to zero and the standing wave is completely damped for long time evolution for finite values of smoothing length h and neglecting the boundary layer dissipation the analytical solution of the total kinetic energy over time is described as follows antuono et al 2011 3 3 e k i n λ g h 2 32 e β t 1 cos 2 σ t the damping coefficient β 4νk 2 depends on the wave number k and the kinematic viscosity ν which is described in eq 2 18 two different damping coefficients are considered β 0 3432 and β 0 1648 respectively the damping coefficient is adjusted by kinematic viscosity which varies according to the artificial viscous coefficient α and the initial particle spacing δ according to antuono et al 2011 sph cannot properly simulate gravity waves whose amplitude is less than mean particle distance and a good agreement is observed only when h δ 4 therefore the wave height h is 8δ and 48δ for β 0 3432 and 0 1648 respectively fig 3 shows time history of the total kinetic energy predicted by sph with different kernel functions described in section 2 the spatial resolutions are l 100 and l 250 which make about 11 000 and 65 000 particles respectively for β 0 3432 and 0 1648 respectively the results by gaussian and quintic spline functions are well agreement with analytical solutions whereas cubic and quartic spline functions don t produce similar results also it is found that the total kinetic energy predicted by quartic spline function is closer to the analytic solution than that predicted by cubic spline function it may be the reason that the kernel function with the large support domain can maintain more interacting particle pairs than that with the small support domain and thus the kernel function with the large support domain not only improves numerical accuracy but also tends to decrease the effect of disorder particles the simulations are performed on a desktop computer using an intel r core tm i7 4790k processor quad core 4 0 ghz under a windows 7 64 bit edition operating system the time consumed by different kernel functions with the resolution δ l 250 is given in table 1 as a result of more interacting particle pairs gaussian and quintic spline functions take more time than quartic and cubic spline functions however we believe that it is worth for sph to use gaussian or quintic spline function for simulations of waves since low precision kernel functions usually generate extra numerical dissipations since low precision kernel functions are difficult to produce satisfactory results results from cubic and quartic spline functions will not be presented in the followings fig 4 shows time history of the total kinetic energy by sph with different spatial resolutions for β 0 3432 the particle sizes δ are l 50 l 80 and l 100 respectively for β 0 1648 the particle sizes δ are l 90 l 150 and l 250 respectively herein the artificial viscosity coefficient α is altered to keep fixed damping coefficient β for different spatial resolutions with the increasing of spatial resolutions results of sph with gaussian or quintic spline function converge to the analytical solution furthermore as the damping coefficient β decreases the resolution has to also increase to produce satisfactory results these results show the good convergence properties of present sph scheme for simulations of free surface flows fig 5 shows time history of the total kinetic energy by sph with or not boundary force model herein the particle sizes are l 100 and l 250 for β 0 3432 and 0 1648 respectively results by sph with or not boundary force model are good agreement with the analytical solutions it indicates that the modified boundary force model presented in section 2 5 has few effects on numerical accuracy however if there is no the boundary force model the particle penetration may occur which will be presented in section 4 4 regular waves 4 1 computational model fig 6 shows the 2d numerical wave tank the depth of water is d and the tank length is l 40d the wave height h is 0 23d and wave length λ is 7 4d a piston type wavemaker located at the left boundary of the tank is used to produce regular waves the down and right boundaries of the tank are free slip solid walls as shown in fig 6 the time profiles of water surface elevation are collected at two different positions which are located at x d 1 and x d 18 respectively 4 2 results and discussions fig 7 shows the time profiles of water surface elevation η at x d 18 predicted by gaussian function and quintic spline function in comparison with the solutions of bem mel lugni 1999 the initial particle spacing δ d 50 is used in this case it is found from fig 7 that the results of gaussian function may be closer to the solutions of bem mel than those of quintic spline function fig 8 shows the particle distributions at the t 5 d g 1 2 predicted by the gaussian function and the quintic spline function respectively it can be seen that the gaussian function may help sph acquire more uniform particles than the quintic spline function the regular particle distribution usually leads the better accuracy and stability than the irregular particle distribution for long time simulations hence it means that gaussian function may possess higher accuracy and stability than quintic spline function for simulations of the wave propagation fig 9 shows the time profiles of water surface elevation η at x d 18 predicted by different spatial resolutions in comparison with the solutions of bem mel the gaussian function is adopted and particle resolutions are d 25 d 50 and d 100 the total number of particles is about 25 000 100 000 and 400 000 respectively the case with δ d 50 requires 110 000 iterations and takes about 19 h with the increase of the resolution the wave elevation by sph tends to the convergent solution of the bem mel signal again the results show the good convergence properties of present sph scheme fig 10 shows the particle snapshots at t 1 3 d g 1 2 from left plot corresponding to the case of no boundary force the penetration of fluid particles across the wall is observed however if the boundary force model is used no fluid particles penetrate across the wall boundary as shown in right plot of fig 10 therefore the boundary force model is important to prevent the penetration of fluid particles across the wall especially when the high relative speed between fluid particles and boundaries exists generally waves inside the computational domain may cause reflections at boundaries these reflections may lead to unphysical behavior of waves at the boundaries however the long enough tank may usually suppress or reduce the intensity of reflected waves fig 11 shows the time profiles of water surface elevation η with different tank lengths l 40d 30d and 25d which make about 106 000 80 000 and 66 000 particles respectively the time consumed by different tank lengths is given in table 2 it can be seen that from fig 11 the water surface elevation with l 25d deviates from the analytical or reference solutions after t 4 0 d g 1 2 which may be caused by the superposition of the reflection waves and incident waves with the increase of the tank lengths the wave elevation tends to the analytical or reference solutions therefore if the tank length is long enough and simulation time is short enough it may avoid the effect of the wave reflections on results however for a longer time simulation with surface piercing structures special treatment like inner source generation of waves ning et al 2015 should be considered to avoid wave reflections at the end of water tank 5 interaction between wave and rigid plate 5 1 computational model in this section the interaction between solitary wave and a plate is simulated to validate the computational wave force as shown in fig 12 the model is presented based on seiffert et al s experimental model seiffert et al 2014 in present case the length of wave tank is 4 0 m and its height is 0 12 m the solitary wave is generated by a piston type wavemaker the plate is fixed at the middle of wave tank and 1 2 m away from wavemaker the plate length and thickness are 0 305 m and 0 0127 m respectively the plate is submerged in the water entirely and the top of plate is leveled with still water surface the still water depth d is 0 114 m and wave amplitude h a is 0 3d the particle space δ 0 002 is implemented here and 120 000 particles are generated this case requires 85 000 iterations which take about 17 h 5 2 numerical results time series of the total vertical and horizontal forces on the plate are shown in fig 13 a and b respectively in comparison with the experimental results the measured forces have be divided by the plate width 0 149m because the numerical simulations are implemented in two dimensional space while the experiments are three dimensional it should be noted here that t 0 does not necessarily indicate the time when experiments start seiffert et al 2014 in order to comparing with the experimental results the computed vertical force should subtract the initial still water pressure the vertical and horizontal forces by sph reach their peak at 2 03s and 2 12s respectively which are well agreement with results by the experiment the maximum value of vertical force by sph is slightly larger than the experimental result fig 14 shows snapshots of pressure and particles acquired by sph simulations at t 1 5s the wave starts to impact on the plate and the forces on the plate start to increase gradually at t 2 22s it can be observed that the water waves on top of the plate begin to dash against those below the plate and the water near the right side of the plate sprays and splashes on the plate the spray and splash bring about the oscillation of the vertical force after 2 4s as shown in fig 13 a 6 bottom hinged oscillating wave surge converter 6 1 computational model fig 15 shows the bottom hinged owsc model which is the same with the case given by m brito et al 2016 the flap is mounted at the bottom of the tank 7 92 m from the wavemaker the flap model is a 0 54 m 0 12 m box with a hinge height of 0 16 m the mass of flap is 33 kg the mass center is 0 16 m above the axis of the half bottom tube and the inertia is 1 84 kg m2 the wave tank is 18 m long with the 2 5 m slope for absorbing waves the off shore still water depth d is 0 69 m the regular waves with wave period t 2s and wave height h 0 12 m are generated by a piston type wavemaker located at the left end of the tank the gaussian function is adopted and three particle resolutions δ 0 01 m 0 0075 m and 0 005 m are implemented the total number of particles is about 100 000 180 000 and 390 000 respectively the case with δ 0 01 m requires 110 000 iterations and takes about 9 h 6 2 numerical results in this paper the power take off pto system is simplified to the restoring torque k d ω described in eq 2 37 if there is no pto system the damping coefficient kd is 0 furthermore the effect of the pto system on the flap angle may be considered by introducing the damping coefficient kd 35 fig 16 shows the time series of the flap angle θ predicted by present sph model in comparison with the results from sphysics brito et al 2016 which is an open source parallel cfd solver based on sph crespo et al 2015 the negative rotating angles denote counter clockwise rotations and the positive ones denote clockwise rotations the time variation of the flap angle from present sph model is in reasonable agreement with data from sphysics confirming the applicability of the present numerical model also the flap rotation angles from three resolutions almost coincide which shows a good convergence what s more we can see that the damping coefficient kd has significant influence on the flap angle which will be emphasize again in simulations of land hinged owsc fig 17 shows pressure snapshots of sph simulations at various time at time t 5s the flap is swinging back while at time t 6s it is swinging forth it can be also observed that the angles of the flap at t 5s and t 7s are both in second quadrant since the wave period is t 2s which also confirms the correct behavior under the action of regular waves 7 land hinged oscillating wave surge converter 7 1 computational model and boundary conditions in this section the interaction between waves and land hinged owsc is simulated by sph method and some parameters which likely have an effect on wave energy capturing efficient are investigated fig 18 shows the land hinged owsc model the length of water tank is l 40 m with water depth d 0 8 m the piston type wavemaker is located on the left end of the tank a pivoted absorber is fixed and semi immersed and its center of rotation is located at point o x r z r following harmonic wave loadings the absorber swings up and down around the rotation center o the profile of absorber is described in fig 19 the mass and inertia of the absorber are 79 kg and 83 5 kg m2 respectively and the mass center x c is marked in fig 19 too the gaussian function is adopted and the initial particle spacing δ is 0 02 in all simulations 7 2 results and discussion 7 2 1 the effect of heights of rotation center herein the symbol d sin is used to denote the distance between rotation center o and still water surface to investigate effect of d sin on rotation angles three different depths d sin 0 1 m 0 15 m and 0 2 m are simulated respectively regular waves with wave height h 0 25 m and period t 2s are produced by the wave maker located at the left end of the tank the damping coefficient of pto is k d 2000 fig 20 shows the time history of rotation angle θ for different d sin three different depths d sin produce almost the same swing amplitude it means that the distance of rotation center o to still water surface has few effects on wave energy capturing efficiency 7 2 2 the effect of wave heights for studying the impact of wave heights on movements of absorber four wave heights with the same period t 2s are investigated the four wave heights are 0 1 m 0 15 m 0 2 m and 0 25 m respectively the rotation center is located at point 6 0 0 9 i e d sin 0 1 m in this part the pto is shut down which denotes that the damping coefficient is zero the time series of the rotation angle θ can be observed in fig 21 the negative rotating angles denote clockwise rotations for different wave heights with the same period the phases of absorber are in good agreement whereas amplitudes of absorber increasingly grow with the increase of wave heights it means that the wave energy capturing efficiency increasingly grows with the increase of wave heights which makes a logical behavior under the action of regular waves 7 2 3 the effect of pto damping coefficients to explore the effect caused by pto damping coefficients different damping coefficients k d are exerted on the absorber under different wave conditions the instantaneous power p can be calculated by p k d ω 2 where ω denotes angular velocity of absorber and the active power p u can be computed by p u 1 t 0 t p t d t the rotation center is located at point 6 0 0 9 i e d sin 0 1 m fig 22 shows instantaneous power of absorber with different pto damping coefficients it can be seen that the peak of instantaneous power with k d 2000 is larger than those with k d 100 and 5000 fig 23 shows the active power p u with pto damping coeffcients for different periods with increasing of pto damping coeffcients the active power p u increases at first and then reduces thus there exists the most optimal damping coeffient which can help the absorber capture more wave energy comparing three curves of the active power p u for different wave periods it can be found that the optimum pto damping coefficient varies with wave periods the optimum pto damping coefficients are about 2000 3000 and 4000 for t 2s 3s and 4s respectively also it can be observed that when the optimal pto damping coefficient is adopted the wave period t 2s has lager active power than t 3s and 4s therefore the active power of land hinged owsc strongly depends on both the pto damping coefficients and the wave periods 8 conclusions standing waves regular waves the interaction between wave and rigid plate and bottom hinged oscillating wave surge converter owsc are simulated to validate the accuracy of numerical methods the results of sph are compared with the analytical solutions or reference results and good agreements are achieved these results demonstrate that sph method presented in this paper can give acceptable results for the simulations of voilent waves finally the weakly compressible sph scheme with diffusive terms is applied to investigate the hydrodynamics characteristics of land hinged oscillating wave surge converter owsc the following preliminary conclusions are obtained the selection of kernel function is critical for accuracy of sph method gaussian kernel can be regarded as a proper kernel function for simulations of waves for simulations of voilent waves fulid particles panetrating across solid walls may happen the modified boundary force model presented in this paper not only prevents the penetration of fluid particles across the solid walls but also has few effects on numerical accuracy generally it is able to avoid the effect of the wave reflections on internal flows if the tank length is long enough the distance of rotation center to still water surface has few effects on wave energy capturing efficiency the amplitudes of absorber increasingly grow with the increase of wave heights which means that the wave energy capturing efficiency increasingly grows with the increase of wave heights the pto damping coefficients and the wave periods have important effect on active power and there is the optimal damping coeffient for a fixed wave period acknowledgements the authors would like to

23582,this study observed an engineering project in which the vacuum preloading method incorporated with the vertical drain system was applied to the improvement of the dredged marine clay slurry as the fill as well as the in situ soft ground for land reclamation the site conditions field instrumentation construction process and partial requirements of the vacuum preloading project are described in this paper field monitoring data is presented and analyzed after the vacuum preloading the average degree of consolidation achieved was more than 88 and the bearing capacity of the dredged marine clay slurry was improved from less than 4 kpa to be higher than 50 kpa specifications of construction techniques were detailed which would be useful and referenceable to engineers three empirical prediction methods for estimating the ultimate settling and consolidation degree are reviewed several key parameters and their optimal values in the formulae are discussed and suggested respectively prediction results show that the asaoka s method is the most preferable for predicting the settling of dredged marine clay slurries with high initial water content improved by vacuum preloading keywords vacuum consolidation land reclamation dredged clay slurry settlement prediction 1 introduction the land reclamation from the sea is one of the most efficient ways to make up the land shortage in some coastal regions of china as available land resources are becoming increasingly scarce due to the rapid economic development and urbanization according to recent statistics 5880 km2 of sea will be reclaimed from the year 2016 2020 duan et al 2016 meanwhile about 3 108 m3 of dredged soils are annually yielded from waterways ports water conservation and water environmental engineering projects in china in recent years in order to fully utilize natural resources one of the major measures is to use these dredged marine clays as fill materials for land reclamations the initial reclaimed land which is hydraulically filled with dredged marine clays generally behaves as soup that has very high water content and extremely low bearing capacity such that a small bird cannot stand firm on the soup surface even weeks after the completion of the hydraulic fulfillment of dredged marine clay deposits its bearing capacity is still very low stabilizing these soft soils before commencing construction is essential for both long term and short term stability since they have very low permeability and are usually thick a long time period is usually needed to achieve the desired primary degree of consolidation 80 engineering measures have to be taken to enhance the bearing capacity a system of vacuum preloading incorporated with prefabricated vertical drains vppvds has become an attractive ground improvement method in terms of both cost and effectiveness indraratna 2010 when it is applied vertical drains provide a much shorter drainage path in a radial direction which reduce the required preload period significantly and vacuum pressure is used to enhance the efficiency of pvds negative pore pressures suction distributed along the drains and on the surface of the ground accelerate consolidation reduce pore water pressure and increase the effective stress the applications of vacuum preloading drainage method became popular until the 1980s qian et al 1992 shang et al 1998 today the vacuum preloading combined with pvds are used more and more in practical ground improvement all over the world tang and shang 2000 chai et al 2006 zhao et al 2011 cui et al 2012 mesri et al 2012 liu et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 seah et al 2016 zhuang and cui 2016 cai et al 2017 there are many efforts on the development of technique and theory of vacuum preloading with prefabricated vertical drains since the vacuum preloading was first proposed by kjellman 1952 the developments and applications of vacuum preloading techniques was reviewed by indraratna and redana 2000 chu et al 2008 griffin and o kelly 2014 several methods based on the vacuum preloading technique have been developed by many researchers such as the combined vacuum and fill surcharge preloading method leong et al 2000 yan and chu 2005 saowapakpiboon et al 2011 the vacuum preloading incorporated with electroosmotic method casagrande d r 1986 shang and lo 1997 baotian and vu 2010 the combined vacuum preloading and pneumatic fracturing method liu et al 2012 2016 and the combination of electroosmosis vacuum and surcharge preloading method liu et al 2014 although there are many studies and applications on the vacuum preloading method further investigations are still necessary for hydraulic filled clay land as their properties aforesaid are quite different than those of natural soft land the vacuum preloading are not always successfully used for such kinds of ground improvement works including in china tan and liew 2000 gue et al 2001 bao et al 2014 construction technique optimization and accurate prediction of settlement and consolidation degree are more challengeable le at al 2013 chung et al 2014 zhuang and cui 2016 wang et al 2016 2017 zheng et al 2017 because the reclaimed slurry is of high initial water content and high clay content the consolidation deformation would be large and the settlement would be more complicated terzaghi 1925 linear infinitesimal strain consolidation theory is not adapted to predict the ultimate settlement for cases which the deformation or settlement is larger than 15 20 as it concludes a number of simplifying assumptions the constant permeability and compressibility infinitesimal strain or deformation omitted self weight stress gibson 1967 proposed the nonlinear finite strain consolidation theory which removed the terzaghi s assumptions theoretically this theory may be acceptable for consolidation projects using dredged clay slurry with very high initial water content however to obtain analytical solutions from solving these consolidation equations of this theory would be complicated for engineers some empirical formulae based on measured data are simple and have a wide range of applications in practical engineering such as hyperbolic curve method tan et al 1991 mosleh a al shamrani 2003 yang and xu 2014 exponential curve method barron et al 1948 saowapakpiboon et al 2010 and asaoka s method asaoka 1978 zhuang and cui 2016 although the settlement data can be measured accurately appropriate parameters in these empirical formulae would have a direct influence on settling prediction accuracy the values of these parameters are affected by several factors such as the time interval and the initial calculation time how to appropriately determine the parameter values for hydraulic filling marine clay slurry with such high initial water content and high clay content still has no consensus conclusions hence the preference of the three settling prediction methods needs further evaluation the main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the reclaimed land consolidation effectiveness which used dredged marine clay slurry with high initial water content and high clay content as fills and consolidated by vacuum preloading with vertical drains a case study of leqing port zone is introduced several methods efficiently used to predict the ultimate settlement and consolidation degree are evaluated the general process of vacuum preloading and partial technical requirements used in the land treatment projects at wenzhou port in the zhejiang province of china are presented the deep soil lateral displacement and settling alongside pore water pressure variations during the engineering progress were monitored and analyzed according to data measured in the field three commonly used methods are introduced for predicting the ultimate settling several key parameters in the empirical formulae which have a direct influence on settling prediction accuracy are discussed in detail and preferable suggestions on obtaining the appropriate value of these parameters are given the optimal estimation method is validated for the final settling and consolidation degrees based on the field monitoring data 2 engineering background the leqing port zone is a major sector of the wenzhou port in the zhejiang province of china it is approximately 10 km away from leqing county a new reclamation engineering project was constructed to accommodate further expansion of the leqing port zone shown in fig 1 this included a sea embankment and two reclamation zones divided by a coffer dam which was used as a main road zones a and b occupy 2307 acres and 4939 acres respectively which were hydraulically filled using clay slurry dredged from the port yard and waterways from three different discharge locations in each zone these hydraulically filled areas require primary land treatment before engineering vehicles may be allowed to enter them the original geo profile of the land after completion of filling work is shown in fig 2 the top 0 6 5 m of the clay layer in the land treatment areas had been recently hydraulically filled using the dredged marine clay slurry the original seabed clay lay underneath this down to a depth of approximately 30 m the soil in both layers was soft and still undergoing consolidation the top layer most notably held a water concentration as high as 175 or even higher by volume and the existing seabed layer held a water content as high as 87 the bearing capacity of the filling slurry layer was too low for a bird to stand on in order to release water from the dredged soil in the two zones three adjacent drainage gates were installed in the embankments of zones a and b the drainage pipelines which connected the intakes and the sea had diameters of 0 8 m their bottom elevations were 0 m 0 m and 2 0 m respectively field monitoring of various parameters including the lateral displacement pore water pressure and settling of treated land areas during the preloading period was conducted at multiple locations as shown in fig 2 monitoring equipment was installed in every subarea all monitoring instruments were installed prior to preloading data points were recorded at regular intervals each day the monitoring data collected from two different subareas in zone b were chosen to be representative for the analysis in this study location a was marked along the edge subarea of zone b as shown in fig 2 whereas location b was marked in the corner subarea the sediment size of the fill material has a notable effect on the application of the vacuum preloading method which was evaluated using a particle analyzer tzc 5 the measurements of this instrument were made on the basis of the particle settling velocity and corresponding weight the analyzed samples were taken from three different locations in reclamation zone b as shown in fig 1 at the discharge outlet of the filling pipeline the coffer dam and the corner of zone b the sediment size at the dam is shown in fig 3 the mean size at the dam was 11 4 μm whereas the mean sizes at the corner and discharge outlet locations were 8 4 μm and 6 7 μm respectively this demonstrates that a coarser mean size of deposited particles is associated with a smaller distance to the coffer dam conversely finer mean sizes of deposited particles are associated with smaller distances to the discharge outlet location the liquid and plastic limits of the fill material were analyzed using a cone apex angle 30 penetro meter to calculate the determination of liquid and plastic limits method casagrande 1932 giving out a h w straight line denoting the relation between cone penetration depth and moisture content on the log log coordinates the liquid limit was defined as the moisture content at a penetration depth of 17 mm and the plastic limit was defined as the moisture content at a penetration depth of 2 mm soil samples were taken in situ on the surfaces of three different locations before land treatment was started three experimental tests were conducted the average liquid and plastic limits of the fill material were 54 and 35 respectively furthermore the plasticity index pi was measured to be 19 greater than 15 given this data the soil was regarded as highly plastic according to gratchev et al 2006 properties of the dredged marine clay slurry are summarized in table 1 the land reclamation construction process was adopted as follows 1 dredged material was hydraulically filled to a 3 5 m elevation at the first stage for both zones 2 after natural settling the elevation was reduced to 3 0 m the dredged materials of both zones was again hydraulically filled for the second stage to an elevation of 5 5 m 3 land improvement was applied to the entire territory using the vacuum preloading combined with vertical drains without bedding sands the land elevation following treatment was required to be 3 5 m zone a of the treated area was divided into 16 subareas the area of each subarea was approximately 100 m 156 m and zone b was divided into 30 subareas with an area of approximately 100 m 174 m for each subarea the planar distance between adjacent drainage boards was 0 8 m in zones a and b 3 technical process and requirements of vacuum preloading project 3 1 technical process the technical process of vacuum preloading without bedding sands can be arranged in the following sequence 1 preparations are made for construction and the surface ground is leveled 2 floating bridges are constructed to be the working road 3 polyethylene woven geotextiles are laid 4 plastic drainage boards and filtering pipelines are connected see fig 4 5 type b plastic drainage boards are installed the diameters of the main pipelines and soft filtering pipelines are both φ 50 mm see figs 5 and 6 6 monitoring equipment is installed including inclinometers piezometers and settlement gauges 7 nonwoven geotextile and sealing membrane are laid see fig 7 8 vacuum pumps and other subsidiary facilities are installed 9 vacuum loading is applied by starting the vacuum pumps see fig 8 10 a survey of the land consolidation is conducted to evaluate the treatment effectiveness see fig 9 11 vacuum loading is removed after the completion of consolidation settling 12 nonwoven geotextiles and sealing membranes are removed in the project observed by this study the mud was exposed to air after the nonwoven geotextiles and sealing membranes were removed the resulting abrupt evaporation under the summer sunshine caused the dried earth to crack as shown in fig 10 deep grooves were formed in a grid format a few days after exposure where the grid nodes were the locations of the drainage boards the grooves were as deep as 0 6 m with widths up to 4 6 cm though little settling was seen during this time period the water content of the surface layer thickness 0 6 m was reduced by approximately 3 8 significantly enhancing the bearing capacity of the land 3 2 construction technical requirements 3 2 1 drainage boards 1 type b drainage boards were used in this project the main characteristics of which are listed in table 2 the drainage boards were vertically inserted into the surface of the dredged clay slurry down to the designated level in a planar layout following a rectangular grid format boards were placed at intervals of 0 8 m 0 8 m the lower ends of the drainage boards were penetrated to the original bed level prior to the hydraulic fill it should be noted that if a vertical plastic board becomes close to the sediment mattresses underneath the embankment it should be held at a safe distance of 50 cm from the embankment to prevent air release during vacuum preloading 2 all drainage boards were manually inserted board locations were however quite accurate with horizontal errors less than 10 cm and vertical errors less than 1 5 3 the drainage boards and pipelines have to be connected on solid ground rather than in situ as shown in fig 4 the noses of each board had to be tightly wrapped to prevent punctures in the sealing membrane 4 mud had to be prevented from entering the drainage boards otherwise the drainage channels could become blocked and the effectiveness of drainage would be reduced the lower end of the drainage boards had to be effectively sealed 5 drainage boards were required to prevent phenomena such as twisting breaking and tearing retraction was also avoided if any of the above cases was observed during construction a new drainage board was inserted beside the original location the percentage of retraction in the boards was required to be less than 5 3 2 2 drainage pipelines 1 the drainage pipelines were constructed using 50 mm soft filtering pipelines the planar intervals between adjacent main pipelines were less than 12 m 2 the quality of the filtering pipelines was strictly controlled filtering pipelines with torn filtering cloth were not used 3 pipeline connections were firmly and completely sealed 4 the joints of the two main pipelines are connected with rubber hose pipeline fittings the interval between two joint were 25 m and positional deviations were less than 100 mm 5 the interface between jet pumps and filtering pipelines was not less than 5 m away from the boundary of the treatment area 3 2 3 woven and nonwoven geotextile 1 after natural deposition and evaporation a layer of 150 g m2 woven geotextiles was laid on the mud surface of the reclamation area 2 before laying down the sealing membranes a layer of 200 g m2 nonwoven geotextiles was laid above the woven geotextile layer nonwoven geotextiles could be sewed or lapped together if sewing was adopted the factory prefabricated stitching length should be not less than 5 cm if stitching length was greater than 20 cm nonwoven geotextiles should be sewed in suit the anti pull strength of the nylon thread was required to be more than 250 n the seams additionally needed to be wrapped up and the length of the lap joints between the nylon threads were required to be at least 80 cm 3 geotextiles must be laid smoothly without distortions folds or overlap 4 each geotextile layer was to extend at least 1 m out of the reclamation land boundary for better sealing properties and geotextile edges were fixed with sand or silt bags 5 all the main and filter pipelines were installed beneath the nonwoven geotextile layers in order to prevent punctures in the sealing membrane 6 during manual operations the workers were asked not to wear hard bottom shoes in order to avoid puncturing the geotextiles 3 2 4 sealing membranes 1 the sealing membranes used in this project generally made from polyethylene pe or polyvinyl chloride pvc was approximately 0 12 0 16 mm thick and at least two layers were laid in practice as a general rule all sealing membranes should be produced at once via thermal synthesis in a factory setting the total thickness of the sealing membranes was approximately 0 4 mm three layers were laid in this project the edges of those membranes were embedded in the sealing grooves at a depth of over 50 cm 2 because the vacuum preloading site was large the sealing membrane was spliced on site the overlap width of the adjacent membranes was not less than 2 m 3 the sizes of the embedded parts in the grooves were taken into account when processing the sealing membranes furthermore adequate sealing membranes should be reserved due to uneven settling and deformation of the reclaimed soil and the sealing membranes should be properly stretched as well as loose to prevent cracking 4 the dredged soil surface was cleaned and flatted carefully before the sealing membranes were laid shells and stones with sharp corners were removed 5 the sealing membranes were laid layer by layer afterwards technicians performed a check to determine whether the membranes were intact if not the damaged area was cleaned up first and then repaired in situ before progressing to the next step 6 the embedded depth of sealing membranes in the impermeable layer was not less than 0 8 m the adjacent reserved sealing membrane distance was not less than 40 cm in view of the seal groove length in order to prevent air leakage two methods were considered one was using clay to backfill the seal grooves the other was inserting the sealing membrane edges into the silt at the boundaries of each preloading zone with a depth of at least 80 cm and preference was depending on the in situ construction condition 7 during the process of laying the sealing membranes extra attention was paid to keep the drainage boards and drainage pipelines around seal grooves tightly connected 8 the sealing membranes between subareas were overlapped to embed the sealing membrane edges of adjacent subareas in the seal grooves the reserved membranes were covered with clay or stepped into mud directly 3 2 5 jet vacuum pump 1 the 7 5 kw jet type vacuum pump was adopted this project required a vacuum pressure not less than 96 kpa and the ability to maintain over 80 kpa vacuum pressure under the membranes 2 one jet vacuum pump was placed per 1000 m2 in order to achieve the desired vacuum pumping efficiency all were subjected to the designed degree of vacuum demands during the fully loaded process more than 80 of the jet vacuum pumps were observed to remain in operation 3 2 6 vacuum preloading 1 during the vacuum pumping process the vacuum degree under the membranes should experience stepwise increases to reduce the smear effect of the soil layer in this project the specific process followed was 1 complete a vacuum pumping test to ensure there was no air leakage 2 gradually increase the vacuum degree to 30 kpa 3 further increase the vacuum degree to 50 kpa and 4 increase the vacuum degree to its final level of 80 kpa 2 vacuum pumps were maintained in operation at the designated vacuum degree equal or greater than 80 kpa under the membrane these vacuum pumps were continuously executed for at least 300 days to meet the allowable land bearing capacity of 5000 kg m2 with a safety factor of 2 the standard of such an allowable bearing capacity was adopted in chinese geologic investigation code for port engineering jtj 240 97 ministry of communications 1997 3 spare pumps stood by in case pumps were damaged during the vacuum preloading 3 2 7 vacuum unloading vacuum unloading was conducted once the following conditions and requirements had been met 1 the consolidation degree of the treatment area was greater than 80 2 the measured average settling on the soil surface was less than 5 mm per day over 10 consecutive days 3 the indices of the dredged soil including shear stress bearing capacity and water content reached the land treatment acceptance criteria it should be emphasized that for these unloading criteria the first two were used as reference standards and the third was the control standard 4 observation data and analysis 4 1 lateral displacements lateral displacements were monitored by inclinometers located from the soil surface down to a depth of 36 m at 1 m intervals these inclinometers were installed on a fixed vertical guide the vertical profiles of lateral displacements over different durations of vacuum preloading at two of these locations are presented in fig 11 a and b these profiles were collected at a location near to the monitoring point of the pore water pressure profile the positive value represents inward lateral movements toward the treatment area due to an accident one of the inclinometers was broken during the first stage of vacuum preloading and as such only the first 50 days of monitoring data are uniformly presented fig 11 shows that 1 the lateral displacement increased inward as time elapsed and decreased sharply with the increase of depth 2 the maximum lateral displacement occurred at ground level because the top layer was newly hydraulically filled using dredged marine clay slurry with typical characteristics of high water content easy compressibility and strong plasticity so extensive deformation and consolidation occurred under the external load 3 the obvious lateral displacements occurred several days after vacuum preloading was applied because of the high free water content and as such the soil did not initially consolidate and was unable to bear the load after that point it developed fast 4 2 pore water pressures pore water pressures were monitored by piezometers located from the soil surface down to a depth of 36 m at 4 m intervals the pore water pressures at different depths are charted against increasing durations of vacuum preloading in fig 12 a and b theoretically the pore water pressures should continue to gradually decrease as preloading occurred provided that the jet pump maintained a constant vacuuming degree it should be noted that every pore water pressure curve has two remarkable rising processes caused by the intrusions of typhoons during which the on site vacuum pumps had to be powered off for the sake of safety and the underground water levels rose fig 12 shows that 1 in general pore water pressure was reduced during the continuous vacuum preloading period but there was no obvious variation in regularity at different depths 2 some time was required for the vacuum load to spread in the dredged soil during which the water in the soil infiltrated the vertical drainage boards before finally being discharged this process might also lead to the increase of pore water pressure during the first stage of vacuum preloading 3 when fig 11 is compared to fig 12 the time the soil incurred obvious lateral displacements closely corresponds to the time the pore water pressure began to decrease this shows that with a decrease in pore water pressure the dredged soil begins consolidation consistent with the principle of terzaghi 4 3 surface settling the surface settling process was monitored by settlement gauges during vacuum preloading the settling on the surface is plotted against the duration of vacuum preloading at two locations in fig 13 a and b the settling curves across durations are not very smooth some of these discontinuity points were caused by the uneven settling the settlement curves show that 1 a large settling rate was maintained after the vacuum load was applied however the settling rate became small in the last stage of the vacuum preloading period finally meeting the vacuum unloading standard and thereby stopping the load application 2 the reclaimed soil continued to experience large settling movements with average values over 2 m after the vacuum preloading treatment was completed this suggested that the silt had great compressibility 4 4 treatment effectiveness according to chinese geologic investigation code jtj 240 97 after vacuum preloading treatment the allowable bearing capacity should not be less than 50 kpa in the depth of 0 m 1 5 m from the soil surface and the corresponding water content should be less than 60 meanwhile the allowable bearing capacity should not be less than 40 kpa below the depth of 1 5m and the corresponding water content should be less than 65 in order to decide the unloading moment the allowable bearing capacities were regularly monitored using a vane shear meter at representative locations in the two sites respectively once the measured allowable bearing capacities met the unloading criteria all vacuum pumps in the site were stopped taking location a in zone b as the example after almost a year time of vacuum preloading geotechnical investigation was conducted in situ the final investigation results of the vane shear stress allowable bearing capacity and final water content are listed in table 3 which shows that the treatment effectiveness has met the design requirements compared to table 1 the initial water content had been reduced by more than three times the vane shear stress had been improved from 0 6 to 1 2 kpa to 10 6 14 6 kpa and the bearing capacity had been improved from 4 to 6 kpa to 54 75 kpa herein the bearing capacity fak was estimated as 5 14cu which was suggested by yan and chu 2003 according to the design code jtj 250 98 5 predictions of ultimate settlement and consolidation degree three commonly used methods are discussed for predicting the ultimate settlement and consolidation degree the hyperbolic curve method the exponential curve method and asaoka s observational method 5 1 hyperbolic curve method according to tan et al 1991 the relationship between the consolidation settling and corresponding time is postulated to approach a hyperbolic curve described by the following equation 1 s t s 0 t t 0 α β t t 0 where s t is the value of settling at any vacuum preloading time t s 0 is the accumulated settling after time t 0 under a stable load and α and β are two soil parameters that can be estimated from the measured settling specifically α is the intercept and β is the slope of the linear portion of the theoretical hyperbolic plot it is possible to rewrite eq 1 as 2 t t 0 s t s 0 α β t t 0 this can be further rewritten as 3 y βx α in which the ratio of time difference to corresponding settling difference is y t t 0 s t s 0 and the time difference is x t t 0 eq 3 can then be rewritten in the form of a matrix 4 y t 1 t 0 s 1 s 0 t 2 t 0 s 2 s 0 t n t 0 s n s 0 x t 1 t 0 t 2 t 0 t n t 0 based on the field monitoring data the values of α and β can be obtained by fitting the line of y versus x after applying n groups of t i s i their values are the slopes and intercepts of the fitted lines as shown in fig 14 a and b respectively at this point s t can be predicted using the following equation eq 5 5 s t 1 β α t t 0 s 0 when time t approaches infinity the ultimate settlement can be derived as 6 s s 0 1 β the settling at location a was measured for 359 days in total with 284 days under full loading the settling at location b was measured for 440 days in total with 353 days under stable full loading the calculation results for the ultimate settlements and the precision of verification are presented in table 4 during the predictions different sample sizes were selected from the measured data regarding the full loading time as initial time point t 0 the calculation results were compared in order to determine the differences in settling predictions when different sized data samples were used the settling predictions generated by the hyperbolic curve method are based on measured data theoretically a larger data sample size will correspond with a higher precision in the predictive process and the prediction result is closer to the actual value table 4 shows that for locations a and b the prediction results are stable and consistent when the data sample sizes are larger than 160 furthermore selecting sample size larger than 160 groups provides the most accurate prediction results the values of α and β are presented in fig 14 this figure reveals that the ultimate settlement can be reliably predicted even if limited groups of field measured data are used for this observed project five and a half months to six months of measured settling data after the full loading time point were sufficient to use the average settling rates at the final measured stage for locations a and b were 2 5 and 2 mm day and another 134 and 122 days were needed to achieve the predicted ultimate settlement requirements respectively the total settling time was expected to be approximately 500 days for location a and 560 days for location b hence once full loading had been applied only 30 32 of the total settling time was required to form a sufficiently accurate prediction of the ultimate settlement how to determine initial time t 0 is greatly important for the hyperbolic curve method tan et al 1991 proposed that the method becomes most useful after the consolidation degree reaches 40 in order to use the hyperbolic curve method the consolidation degrees should be continuously measured to locate the criteria 40 much field work would be required to fulfill the condition in this way in order to avoid that work load in the presented project the consolidation degrees at the selected initial time t 0 were 52 for location a and 45 for location b thus it is suitable to directly choose the full loading time point as the initial t 0 when using the hyperbolic curve method 5 2 exponential curve method the consolidation theory for radial consolidation using drain wells was first proposed by barron et al 1948 the relationship between the average degree of consolidation u avg and the time factor of consolidation can be expressed in the following form 7 u a v g 1 e β t here β is an undetermined parameter and the theoretical value of β 8 c h d e 2 f n c h is the horizontal coefficient of consolidation d e is the equivalent diameter of a unit cell of drain f n is a resistance factor for the effects of drainage spacing smear and well resistance such that f n n 2 n 2 1 ln n 3 n 2 1 4 n 2 and n is the drain spacing ratio as a type of simple analysis method according to zeng and xie 1989 u avg can be written as 8 u a v g s t s d s s d and eq 7 can be written in terms of settling as follows 9 s t s d s s d 1 e β t or 10 s t s s d 1 e β t s d where s s t and t are the same parameters as those in the hyperbolic curve method and s d is the settling caused by lateral deformation in order to obtain the ultimate settlement three groups of settling data t i s i i 1 2 3 need to be chosen from the curve of measured settling s against the time period t in the region where full vacuum load has been applied with these selections t 3 t 2 t 2 t 1 δt the ultimate settlement s can be derived as 11 s s 3 s 2 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 2 s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 and 12 β 1 δ t l n s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 substitute the values of s and β into equation 10 settling at any selected time t can be predicted because the prediction of settling is related to the time interval δt and the selected initial time t 1 three groups of different time intervals δt as well as three groups of different t i s i i 1 2 3 are used for each location to determine the differences in the predicted settling process the values of s and β and the accuracy verification of the formula are presented in table 5 respectively analysis results in table 5 show that different groups of t i s i i 1 2 3 result in different predicted final settling as such it can be stated that the data points used in predictive work have obvious effects on the prediction results generally for the same time interval δt larger initial time points t 1 are associated with smaller difference values between the predicted settling and the measured data furthermore for the same initial time point t 1 a longer time interval δt is expected to be associated with a smaller difference value between the predicted settling and measured data all errors were less than 4 with the exception of a single prediction result at location a such small errors indicate that the exponential curve method provides a good predictability in predicting the degree of settling in order to obtain a reliable prediction result for the ultimate settlement the selected initial point t 1 s 1 and the time interval δt are suggested to be as large as possible when choosing the measured data point on settling s against time period t curve in the region when the full vacuum load has been applied here the group of data points with the smallest errors were adopted to predict the settling and consolidation degrees for the two locations 5 3 asaoka s observational method based on the observed settling data asaoka 1978 proposed a new method for predicting the ultimate settlement by deriving mikasa 1965 one dimensional consolidation equation which can be expressed as 13 ε t z t c v 2 ε t z z 2 in which ε t z is the vertical strain t is the time z is the depth from the top of the clay stratum and c v is the coefficient of consolidation for any boundary condition the settling of the clay stratum can be expressed as 14 s t 0 h ε t z d z where h represents the thickness of clay stratum and s t represents the settling at time t introducing the discrete time as t j j δt where δt is a constant time interval and j 0 1 2 and by sequential differentiation eq 15 can be reduced to the first order approximation equation 15 s j β 0 β 1 s j 1 in which s j denotes the settling at the time t t j and the coefficients β 0 and β 1 are unknown plant parameters when t approaches infinity s j s j 1 s 16 s β 0 1 β 1 let the initial conditions be 17 s t 0 s 0 18 s t s s s 0 e t c 1 and 19 ln β 1 δ t c 1 according to asaoka 1978 if n 1 groups of settling observations s 0 s 1 s j are obtained at a constant time interval of δt δt t j t j 1 n points s j s j 1 for j 1 2 n can be plotted on the coordinate plane under a constant external load all these points will lay on a straight line where the values of β 0 and β 1 are given by the intercept and slope of the fitted straight line moreover the intercept point of this line with the 45 line represents the ultimate settlement in order to discover the influence of different time intervals δt on the predicted settling the asaoka plots at δt 30 40 and 50 days for locations a and b are shown in fig 15 the prediction results and accuracy analysis are shown in table 6 fig 15 and table 6 show that in general the predicted values of the ultimate settlement at different δt for each location are very close this indicates that asaoka s method provides a good stability the values of the settling prediction and the length of the time interval δt are negatively correlated so is the relation between the values of β 1 and δt the longer the time interval δt is the smaller the predicted ultimate settlement will be and the greater the error between the predicted and measured data is given this it is not suitable to choose an excessively long time interval when applying asaoka s method to predict the settling with consideration to minimizing the error value δt 30 days was adopted for both locations in this case a comparison of the prediction results using these three methods for estimating the ultimate settlements are presented in table 7 the settling processes predicted by these methods are furthermore plotted in fig 16 all three methods produced results which were sufficiently accurate to be acceptable as predictions of the ultimate settlements in vacuum preloading drainage projects the results in table 7 show that the ultimate settlements predicted by hyperbolic curve method for both locations are obviously the largest of the three whereas the results obtained using asaoka observational method are the smallest comparison results in fig 16 show that the settling processes predicted by the three methods at both locations are overall well consistent with the field measured data and the predicted ultimate settlements may be a little smaller than actual value however the settling processes predicted by the exponential curve method and asaoka s method are quite similar and close to the actual settling processes in this case study the accuracy of predictions using the exponential curve method and asaoka s method are higher than that provided by the hyperbolic curve method the corresponding prediction errors of exponential curve method generally less than 4 and asaoka s method generally less than 3 are smaller than those produced by the hyperbolic curve method mostly 4 5 hence the asaoka s method is the most preferable for predicting the settling of dredged marine clay slurries with high initial water content improved by vacuum preloading 5 4 consolidation degree the consolidation degree is one of the most important parameters for estimating the effectiveness of land treatment the degree of consolidation at any time t during the vacuum preloading period is typically presented using the following 20 u a v g s t s the adopted ultimate settlement s predicted by the three methods and the actual settlement st at time t are listed in table 8 in this observed project the last measured settling data was used as the actual settlement st so that the estimated consolidation degrees were corresponding to the vacuum time t 359 days for location a and t 440 days for location b table 8 shows that the consolidation degrees at both locations calculated using the exponential curve method and asaoka s method were greater than the result of the hyperbolic curve method however all prediction results were over 80 and therefore met the vacuum unloading requirement 6 conclusions this study observed an engineering project in which the vacuum preloading method incorporated with the vertical drain system was successfully applied to the improvement of the dredged marine clay slurry as the fill as well as the in situ soft ground for land reclamation the technical processes and partial requirements of vacuum preloading were summarized the deep soil lateral displacement and settling as well as the pore water presser variations during vacuum preloading were monitored and analyzed three empirical methods and several key parameters in these empirical formulae for estimating the ultimate settlement and consolidation degree were discussed several conclusions useful for the practical reclaimed land improvement projects using dredged marine clay slurries with high initial water content can be drawn from this study 1 land reclamation using dredged marine clay slurries is typical in china and other coastal developing countries the vacuum preloading combined with the vertical drain system was successfully applied in leqing port zone for this typical project type b drainage boards were used as vertical drains the intervals between the drainage boards were of 0 8 m 0 8 m the drainage system was constructed using 50 mm soft filtering pipelines the planar intervals between adjacent main pipelines were less than 12 m jet type vacuum pumps with 7 5 kw power was used to maintain over 80 kpa vacuum pressure under the membranes the vacuum preloading was maintained for almost a year time to improve bearing capacity from less than 4 6 kpa to be higher than 50 kpa and the initial water content was reduced by more than three times on average specifications of construction techniques for consolidating the dredged marine clay slurry with high initial water content and high clay content were detailed which would be useful and referenceable to engineers 2 after the vacuum preloading at leqing port zone the average degree of consolidation achieved was more than 88 and the land bearing capacity achieved was more than 75 kpa in the depth of 0 m 1 5 m from the soil surface and the corresponding water content was about 50 10 meanwhile the bearing capacity was more than 54 kpa below the depth of 1 5m and corresponding water content was about 54 40 3 overall all the hyperbolic curve method exponential curve method and asaoka s observational method can have sufficient accuracy so that they can predict the ultimate settlement for the exponential curve method it is suggested that the selected initial point t 1 s 1 and time interval δt should be as large as possible for the hyperbolic curve method it is better to assign the full loading time as the initial time and have at least 160 groups of measured settling data for the asaoka s method it is suggested to select the full loading time as the initial time and the time interval is better to be 30 days 4 the settling processes predicted by the exponential curve method and asaoka s method are quite similar and close to the actual settling processes in this case study the accuracy of predictions using the exponential curve method and asaoka s method are higher than that provided by the hyperbolic curve method hence the asaoka s method is the most

prediction methods for estimating the ultimate settling and consolidation degree are reviewed several key parameters and their optimal values in the formulae are discussed and suggested respectively prediction results show that the asaoka s method is the most preferable for predicting the settling of dredged marine clay slurries with high initial water content improved by vacuum preloading keywords vacuum consolidation land reclamation dredged clay slurry settlement prediction 1 introduction the land reclamation from the sea is one of the most efficient ways to make up the land shortage in some coastal regions of china as available land resources are becoming increasingly scarce due to the rapid economic development and urbanization according to recent statistics 5880 km2 of sea will be reclaimed from the year 2016 2020 duan et al 2016 meanwhile about 3 108 m3 of dredged soils are annually yielded from waterways ports water conservation and water environmental engineering projects in china in recent years in order to fully utilize natural resources one of the major measures is to use these dredged marine clays as fill materials for land reclamations the initial reclaimed land which is hydraulically filled with dredged marine clays generally behaves as soup that has very high water content and extremely low bearing capacity such that a small bird cannot stand firm on the soup surface even weeks after the completion of the hydraulic fulfillment of dredged marine clay deposits its bearing capacity is still very low stabilizing these soft soils before commencing construction is essential for both long term and short term stability since they have very low permeability and are usually thick a long time period is usually needed to achieve the desired primary degree of consolidation 80 engineering measures have to be taken to enhance the bearing capacity a system of vacuum preloading incorporated with prefabricated vertical drains vppvds has become an attractive ground improvement method in terms of both cost and effectiveness indraratna 2010 when it is applied vertical drains provide a much shorter drainage path in a radial direction which reduce the required preload period significantly and vacuum pressure is used to enhance the efficiency of pvds negative pore pressures suction distributed along the drains and on the surface of the ground accelerate consolidation reduce pore water pressure and increase the effective stress the applications of vacuum preloading drainage method became popular until the 1980s qian et al 1992 shang et al 1998 today the vacuum preloading combined with pvds are used more and more in practical ground improvement all over the world tang and shang 2000 chai et al 2006 zhao et al 2011 cui et al 2012 mesri et al 2012 liu et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 seah et al 2016 zhuang and cui 2016 cai et al 2017 there are many efforts on the development of technique and theory of vacuum preloading with prefabricated vertical drains since the vacuum preloading was first proposed by kjellman 1952 the developments and applications of vacuum preloading techniques was reviewed by indraratna and redana 2000 chu et al 2008 griffin and o kelly 2014 several methods based on the vacuum preloading technique have been developed by many researchers such as the combined vacuum and fill surcharge preloading method leong et al 2000 yan and chu 2005 saowapakpiboon et al 2011 the vacuum preloading incorporated with electroosmotic method casagrande d r 1986 shang and lo 1997 baotian and vu 2010 the combined vacuum preloading and pneumatic fracturing method liu et al 2012 2016 and the combination of electroosmosis vacuum and surcharge preloading method liu et al 2014 although there are many studies and applications on the vacuum preloading method further investigations are still necessary for hydraulic filled clay land as their properties aforesaid are quite different than those of natural soft land the vacuum preloading are not always successfully used for such kinds of ground improvement works including in china tan and liew 2000 gue et al 2001 bao et al 2014 construction technique optimization and accurate prediction of settlement and consolidation degree are more challengeable le at al 2013 chung et al 2014 zhuang and cui 2016 wang et al 2016 2017 zheng et al 2017 because the reclaimed slurry is of high initial water content and high clay content the consolidation deformation would be large and the settlement would be more complicated terzaghi 1925 linear infinitesimal strain consolidation theory is not adapted to predict the ultimate settlement for cases which the deformation or settlement is larger than 15 20 as it concludes a number of simplifying assumptions the constant permeability and compressibility infinitesimal strain or deformation omitted self weight stress gibson 1967 proposed the nonlinear finite strain consolidation theory which removed the terzaghi s assumptions theoretically this theory may be acceptable for consolidation projects using dredged clay slurry with very high initial water content however to obtain analytical solutions from solving these consolidation equations of this theory would be complicated for engineers some empirical formulae based on measured data are simple and have a wide range of applications in practical engineering such as hyperbolic curve method tan et al 1991 mosleh a al shamrani 2003 yang and xu 2014 exponential curve method barron et al 1948 saowapakpiboon et al 2010 and asaoka s method asaoka 1978 zhuang and cui 2016 although the settlement data can be measured accurately appropriate parameters in these empirical formulae would have a direct influence on settling prediction accuracy the values of these parameters are affected by several factors such as the time interval and the initial calculation time how to appropriately determine the parameter values for hydraulic filling marine clay slurry with such high initial water content and high clay content still has no consensus conclusions hence the preference of the three settling prediction methods needs further evaluation the main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the reclaimed land consolidation effectiveness which used dredged marine clay slurry with high initial water content and high clay content as fills and consolidated by vacuum preloading with vertical drains a case study of leqing port zone is introduced several methods efficiently used to predict the ultimate settlement and consolidation degree are evaluated the general process of vacuum preloading and partial technical requirements used in the land treatment projects at wenzhou port in the zhejiang province of china are presented the deep soil lateral displacement and settling alongside pore water pressure variations during the engineering progress were monitored and analyzed according to data measured in the field three commonly used methods are introduced for predicting the ultimate settling several key parameters in the empirical formulae which have a direct influence on settling prediction accuracy are discussed in detail and preferable suggestions on obtaining the appropriate value of these parameters are given the optimal estimation method is validated for the final settling and consolidation degrees based on the field monitoring data 2 engineering background the leqing port zone is a major sector of the wenzhou port in the zhejiang province of china it is approximately 10 km away from leqing county a new reclamation engineering project was constructed to accommodate further expansion of the leqing port zone shown in fig 1 this included a sea embankment and two reclamation zones divided by a coffer dam which was used as a main road zones a and b occupy 2307 acres and 4939 acres respectively which were hydraulically filled using clay slurry dredged from the port yard and waterways from three different discharge locations in each zone these hydraulically filled areas require primary land treatment before engineering vehicles may be allowed to enter them the original geo profile of the land after completion of filling work is shown in fig 2 the top 0 6 5 m of the clay layer in the land treatment areas had been recently hydraulically filled using the dredged marine clay slurry the original seabed clay lay underneath this down to a depth of approximately 30 m the soil in both layers was soft and still undergoing consolidation the top layer most notably held a water concentration as high as 175 or even higher by volume and the existing seabed layer held a water content as high as 87 the bearing capacity of the filling slurry layer was too low for a bird to stand on in order to release water from the dredged soil in the two zones three adjacent drainage gates were installed in the embankments of zones a and b the drainage pipelines which connected the intakes and the sea had diameters of 0 8 m their bottom elevations were 0 m 0 m and 2 0 m respectively field monitoring of various parameters including the lateral displacement pore water pressure and settling of treated land areas during the preloading period was conducted at multiple locations as shown in fig 2 monitoring equipment was installed in every subarea all monitoring instruments were installed prior to preloading data points were recorded at regular intervals each day the monitoring data collected from two different subareas in zone b were chosen to be representative for the analysis in this study location a was marked along the edge subarea of zone b as shown in fig 2 whereas location b was marked in the corner subarea the sediment size of the fill material has a notable effect on the application of the vacuum preloading method which was evaluated using a particle analyzer tzc 5 the measurements of this instrument were made on the basis of the particle settling velocity and corresponding weight the analyzed samples were taken from three different locations in reclamation zone b as shown in fig 1 at the discharge outlet of the filling pipeline the coffer dam and the corner of zone b the sediment size at the dam is shown in fig 3 the mean size at the dam was 11 4 μm whereas the mean sizes at the corner and discharge outlet locations were 8 4 μm and 6 7 μm respectively this demonstrates that a coarser mean size of deposited particles is associated with a smaller distance to the coffer dam conversely finer mean sizes of deposited particles are associated with smaller distances to the discharge outlet location the liquid and plastic limits of the fill material were analyzed using a cone apex angle 30 penetro meter to calculate the determination of liquid and plastic limits method casagrande 1932 giving out a h w straight line denoting the relation between cone penetration depth and moisture content on the log log coordinates the liquid limit was defined as the moisture content at a penetration depth of 17 mm and the plastic limit was defined as the moisture content at a penetration depth of 2 mm soil samples were taken in situ on the surfaces of three different locations before land treatment was started three experimental tests were conducted the average liquid and plastic limits of the fill material were 54 and 35 respectively furthermore the plasticity index pi was measured to be 19 greater than 15 given this data the soil was regarded as highly plastic according to gratchev et al 2006 properties of the dredged marine clay slurry are summarized in table 1 the land reclamation construction process was adopted as follows 1 dredged material was hydraulically filled to a 3 5 m elevation at the first stage for both zones 2 after natural settling the elevation was reduced to 3 0 m the dredged materials of both zones was again hydraulically filled for the second stage to an elevation of 5 5 m 3 land improvement was applied to the entire territory using the vacuum preloading combined with vertical drains without bedding sands the land elevation following treatment was required to be 3 5 m zone a of the treated area was divided into 16 subareas the area of each subarea was approximately 100 m 156 m and zone b was divided into 30 subareas with an area of approximately 100 m 174 m for each subarea the planar distance between adjacent drainage boards was 0 8 m in zones a and b 3 technical process and requirements of vacuum preloading project 3 1 technical process the technical process of vacuum preloading without bedding sands can be arranged in the following sequence 1 preparations are made for construction and the surface ground is leveled 2 floating bridges are constructed to be the working road 3 polyethylene woven geotextiles are laid 4 plastic drainage boards and filtering pipelines are connected see fig 4 5 type b plastic drainage boards are installed the diameters of the main pipelines and soft filtering pipelines are both φ 50 mm see figs 5 and 6 6 monitoring equipment is installed including inclinometers piezometers and settlement gauges 7 nonwoven geotextile and sealing membrane are laid see fig 7 8 vacuum pumps and other subsidiary facilities are installed 9 vacuum loading is applied by starting the vacuum pumps see fig 8 10 a survey of the land consolidation is conducted to evaluate the treatment effectiveness see fig 9 11 vacuum loading is removed after the completion of consolidation settling 12 nonwoven geotextiles and sealing membranes are removed in the project observed by this study the mud was exposed to air after the nonwoven geotextiles and sealing membranes were removed the resulting abrupt evaporation under the summer sunshine caused the dried earth to crack as shown in fig 10 deep grooves were formed in a grid format a few days after exposure where the grid nodes were the locations of the drainage boards the grooves were as deep as 0 6 m with widths up to 4 6 cm though little settling was seen during this time period the water content of the surface layer thickness 0 6 m was reduced by approximately 3 8 significantly enhancing the bearing capacity of the land 3 2 construction technical requirements 3 2 1 drainage boards 1 type b drainage boards were used in this project the main characteristics of which are listed in table 2 the drainage boards were vertically inserted into the surface of the dredged clay slurry down to the designated level in a planar layout following a rectangular grid format boards were placed at intervals of 0 8 m 0 8 m the lower ends of the drainage boards were penetrated to the original bed level prior to the hydraulic fill it should be noted that if a vertical plastic board becomes close to the sediment mattresses underneath the embankment it should be held at a safe distance of 50 cm from the embankment to prevent air release during vacuum preloading 2 all drainage boards were manually inserted board locations were however quite accurate with horizontal errors less than 10 cm and vertical errors less than 1 5 3 the drainage boards and pipelines have to be connected on solid ground rather than in situ as shown in fig 4 the noses of each board had to be tightly wrapped to prevent punctures in the sealing membrane 4 mud had to be prevented from entering the drainage boards otherwise the drainage channels could become blocked and the effectiveness of drainage would be reduced the lower end of the drainage boards had to be effectively sealed 5 drainage boards were required to prevent phenomena such as twisting breaking and tearing retraction was also avoided if any of the above cases was observed during construction a new drainage board was inserted beside the original location the percentage of retraction in the boards was required to be less than 5 3 2 2 drainage pipelines 1 the drainage pipelines were constructed using 50 mm soft filtering pipelines the planar intervals between adjacent main pipelines were less than 12 m 2 the quality of the filtering pipelines was strictly controlled filtering pipelines with torn filtering cloth were not used 3 pipeline connections were firmly and completely sealed 4 the joints of the two main pipelines are connected with rubber hose pipeline fittings the interval between two joint were 25 m and positional deviations were less than 100 mm 5 the interface between jet pumps and filtering pipelines was not less than 5 m away from the boundary of the treatment area 3 2 3 woven and nonwoven geotextile 1 after natural deposition and evaporation a layer of 150 g m2 woven geotextiles was laid on the mud surface of the reclamation area 2 before laying down the sealing membranes a layer of 200 g m2 nonwoven geotextiles was laid above the woven geotextile layer nonwoven geotextiles could be sewed or lapped together if sewing was adopted the factory prefabricated stitching length should be not less than 5 cm if stitching length was greater than 20 cm nonwoven geotextiles should be sewed in suit the anti pull strength of the nylon thread was required to be more than 250 n the seams additionally needed to be wrapped up and the length of the lap joints between the nylon threads were required to be at least 80 cm 3 geotextiles must be laid smoothly without distortions folds or overlap 4 each geotextile layer was to extend at least 1 m out of the reclamation land boundary for better sealing properties and geotextile edges were fixed with sand or silt bags 5 all the main and filter pipelines were installed beneath the nonwoven geotextile layers in order to prevent punctures in the sealing membrane 6 during manual operations the workers were asked not to wear hard bottom shoes in order to avoid puncturing the geotextiles 3 2 4 sealing membranes 1 the sealing membranes used in this project generally made from polyethylene pe or polyvinyl chloride pvc was approximately 0 12 0 16 mm thick and at least two layers were laid in practice as a general rule all sealing membranes should be produced at once via thermal synthesis in a factory setting the total thickness of the sealing membranes was approximately 0 4 mm three layers were laid in this project the edges of those membranes were embedded in the sealing grooves at a depth of over 50 cm 2 because the vacuum preloading site was large the sealing membrane was spliced on site the overlap width of the adjacent membranes was not less than 2 m 3 the sizes of the embedded parts in the grooves were taken into account when processing the sealing membranes furthermore adequate sealing membranes should be reserved due to uneven settling and deformation of the reclaimed soil and the sealing membranes should be properly stretched as well as loose to prevent cracking 4 the dredged soil surface was cleaned and flatted carefully before the sealing membranes were laid shells and stones with sharp corners were removed 5 the sealing membranes were laid layer by layer afterwards technicians performed a check to determine whether the membranes were intact if not the damaged area was cleaned up first and then repaired in situ before progressing to the next step 6 the embedded depth of sealing membranes in the impermeable layer was not less than 0 8 m the adjacent reserved sealing membrane distance was not less than 40 cm in view of the seal groove length in order to prevent air leakage two methods were considered one was using clay to backfill the seal grooves the other was inserting the sealing membrane edges into the silt at the boundaries of each preloading zone with a depth of at least 80 cm and preference was depending on the in situ construction condition 7 during the process of laying the sealing membranes extra attention was paid to keep the drainage boards and drainage pipelines around seal grooves tightly connected 8 the sealing membranes between subareas were overlapped to embed the sealing membrane edges of adjacent subareas in the seal grooves the reserved membranes were covered with clay or stepped into mud directly 3 2 5 jet vacuum pump 1 the 7 5 kw jet type vacuum pump was adopted this project required a vacuum pressure not less than 96 kpa and the ability to maintain over 80 kpa vacuum pressure under the membranes 2 one jet vacuum pump was placed per 1000 m2 in order to achieve the desired vacuum pumping efficiency all were subjected to the designed degree of vacuum demands during the fully loaded process more than 80 of the jet vacuum pumps were observed to remain in operation 3 2 6 vacuum preloading 1 during the vacuum pumping process the vacuum degree under the membranes should experience stepwise increases to reduce the smear effect of the soil layer in this project the specific process followed was 1 complete a vacuum pumping test to ensure there was no air leakage 2 gradually increase the vacuum degree to 30 kpa 3 further increase the vacuum degree to 50 kpa and 4 increase the vacuum degree to its final level of 80 kpa 2 vacuum pumps were maintained in operation at the designated vacuum degree equal or greater than 80 kpa under the membrane these vacuum pumps were continuously executed for at least 300 days to meet the allowable land bearing capacity of 5000 kg m2 with a safety factor of 2 the standard of such an allowable bearing capacity was adopted in chinese geologic investigation code for port engineering jtj 240 97 ministry of communications 1997 3 spare pumps stood by in case pumps were damaged during the vacuum preloading 3 2 7 vacuum unloading vacuum unloading was conducted once the following conditions and requirements had been met 1 the consolidation degree of the treatment area was greater than 80 2 the measured average settling on the soil surface was less than 5 mm per day over 10 consecutive days 3 the indices of the dredged soil including shear stress bearing capacity and water content reached the land treatment acceptance criteria it should be emphasized that for these unloading criteria the first two were used as reference standards and the third was the control standard 4 observation data and analysis 4 1 lateral displacements lateral displacements were monitored by inclinometers located from the soil surface down to a depth of 36 m at 1 m intervals these inclinometers were installed on a fixed vertical guide the vertical profiles of lateral displacements over different durations of vacuum preloading at two of these locations are presented in fig 11 a and b these profiles were collected at a location near to the monitoring point of the pore water pressure profile the positive value represents inward lateral movements toward the treatment area due to an accident one of the inclinometers was broken during the first stage of vacuum preloading and as such only the first 50 days of monitoring data are uniformly presented fig 11 shows that 1 the lateral displacement increased inward as time elapsed and decreased sharply with the increase of depth 2 the maximum lateral displacement occurred at ground level because the top layer was newly hydraulically filled using dredged marine clay slurry with typical characteristics of high water content easy compressibility and strong plasticity so extensive deformation and consolidation occurred under the external load 3 the obvious lateral displacements occurred several days after vacuum preloading was applied because of the high free water content and as such the soil did not initially consolidate and was unable to bear the load after that point it developed fast 4 2 pore water pressures pore water pressures were monitored by piezometers located from the soil surface down to a depth of 36 m at 4 m intervals the pore water pressures at different depths are charted against increasing durations of vacuum preloading in fig 12 a and b theoretically the pore water pressures should continue to gradually decrease as preloading occurred provided that the jet pump maintained a constant vacuuming degree it should be noted that every pore water pressure curve has two remarkable rising processes caused by the intrusions of typhoons during which the on site vacuum pumps had to be powered off for the sake of safety and the underground water levels rose fig 12 shows that 1 in general pore water pressure was reduced during the continuous vacuum preloading period but there was no obvious variation in regularity at different depths 2 some time was required for the vacuum load to spread in the dredged soil during which the water in the soil infiltrated the vertical drainage boards before finally being discharged this process might also lead to the increase of pore water pressure during the first stage of vacuum preloading 3 when fig 11 is compared to fig 12 the time the soil incurred obvious lateral displacements closely corresponds to the time the pore water pressure began to decrease this shows that with a decrease in pore water pressure the dredged soil begins consolidation consistent with the principle of terzaghi 4 3 surface settling the surface settling process was monitored by settlement gauges during vacuum preloading the settling on the surface is plotted against the duration of vacuum preloading at two locations in fig 13 a and b the settling curves across durations are not very smooth some of these discontinuity points were caused by the uneven settling the settlement curves show that 1 a large settling rate was maintained after the vacuum load was applied however the settling rate became small in the last stage of the vacuum preloading period finally meeting the vacuum unloading standard and thereby stopping the load application 2 the reclaimed soil continued to experience large settling movements with average values over 2 m after the vacuum preloading treatment was completed this suggested that the silt had great compressibility 4 4 treatment effectiveness according to chinese geologic investigation code jtj 240 97 after vacuum preloading treatment the allowable bearing capacity should not be less than 50 kpa in the depth of 0 m 1 5 m from the soil surface and the corresponding water content should be less than 60 meanwhile the allowable bearing capacity should not be less than 40 kpa below the depth of 1 5m and the corresponding water content should be less than 65 in order to decide the unloading moment the allowable bearing capacities were regularly monitored using a vane shear meter at representative locations in the two sites respectively once the measured allowable bearing capacities met the unloading criteria all vacuum pumps in the site were stopped taking location a in zone b as the example after almost a year time of vacuum preloading geotechnical investigation was conducted in situ the final investigation results of the vane shear stress allowable bearing capacity and final water content are listed in table 3 which shows that the treatment effectiveness has met the design requirements compared to table 1 the initial water content had been reduced by more than three times the vane shear stress had been improved from 0 6 to 1 2 kpa to 10 6 14 6 kpa and the bearing capacity had been improved from 4 to 6 kpa to 54 75 kpa herein the bearing capacity fak was estimated as 5 14cu which was suggested by yan and chu 2003 according to the design code jtj 250 98 5 predictions of ultimate settlement and consolidation degree three commonly used methods are discussed for predicting the ultimate settlement and consolidation degree the hyperbolic curve method the exponential curve method and asaoka s observational method 5 1 hyperbolic curve method according to tan et al 1991 the relationship between the consolidation settling and corresponding time is postulated to approach a hyperbolic curve described by the following equation 1 s t s 0 t t 0 α β t t 0 where s t is the value of settling at any vacuum preloading time t s 0 is the accumulated settling after time t 0 under a stable load and α and β are two soil parameters that can be estimated from the measured settling specifically α is the intercept and β is the slope of the linear portion of the theoretical hyperbolic plot it is possible to rewrite eq 1 as 2 t t 0 s t s 0 α β t t 0 this can be further rewritten as 3 y βx α in which the ratio of time difference to corresponding settling difference is y t t 0 s t s 0 and the time difference is x t t 0 eq 3 can then be rewritten in the form of a matrix 4 y t 1 t 0 s 1 s 0 t 2 t 0 s 2 s 0 t n t 0 s n s 0 x t 1 t 0 t 2 t 0 t n t 0 based on the field monitoring data the values of α and β can be obtained by fitting the line of y versus x after applying n groups of t i s i their values are the slopes and intercepts of the fitted lines as shown in fig 14 a and b respectively at this point s t can be predicted using the following equation eq 5 5 s t 1 β α t t 0 s 0 when time t approaches infinity the ultimate settlement can be derived as 6 s s 0 1 β the settling at location a was measured for 359 days in total with 284 days under full loading the settling at location b was measured for 440 days in total with 353 days under stable full loading the calculation results for the ultimate settlements and the precision of verification are presented in table 4 during the predictions different sample sizes were selected from the measured data regarding the full loading time as initial time point t 0 the calculation results were compared in order to determine the differences in settling predictions when different sized data samples were used the settling predictions generated by the hyperbolic curve method are based on measured data theoretically a larger data sample size will correspond with a higher precision in the predictive process and the prediction result is closer to the actual value table 4 shows that for locations a and b the prediction results are stable and consistent when the data sample sizes are larger than 160 furthermore selecting sample size larger than 160 groups provides the most accurate prediction results the values of α and β are presented in fig 14 this figure reveals that the ultimate settlement can be reliably predicted even if limited groups of field measured data are used for this observed project five and a half months to six months of measured settling data after the full loading time point were sufficient to use the average settling rates at the final measured stage for locations a and b were 2 5 and 2 mm day and another 134 and 122 days were needed to achieve the predicted ultimate settlement requirements respectively the total settling time was expected to be approximately 500 days for location a and 560 days for location b hence once full loading had been applied only 30 32 of the total settling time was required to form a sufficiently accurate prediction of the ultimate settlement how to determine initial time t 0 is greatly important for the hyperbolic curve method tan et al 1991 proposed that the method becomes most useful after the consolidation degree reaches 40 in order to use the hyperbolic curve method the consolidation degrees should be continuously measured to locate the criteria 40 much field work would be required to fulfill the condition in this way in order to avoid that work load in the presented project the consolidation degrees at the selected initial time t 0 were 52 for location a and 45 for location b thus it is suitable to directly choose the full loading time point as the initial t 0 when using the hyperbolic curve method 5 2 exponential curve method the consolidation theory for radial consolidation using drain wells was first proposed by barron et al 1948 the relationship between the average degree of consolidation u avg and the time factor of consolidation can be expressed in the following form 7 u a v g 1 e β t here β is an undetermined parameter and the theoretical value of β 8 c h d e 2 f n c h is the horizontal coefficient of consolidation d e is the equivalent diameter of a unit cell of drain f n is a resistance factor for the effects of drainage spacing smear and well resistance such that f n n 2 n 2 1 ln n 3 n 2 1 4 n 2 and n is the drain spacing ratio as a type of simple analysis method according to zeng and xie 1989 u avg can be written as 8 u a v g s t s d s s d and eq 7 can be written in terms of settling as follows 9 s t s d s s d 1 e β t or 10 s t s s d 1 e β t s d where s s t and t are the same parameters as those in the hyperbolic curve method and s d is the settling caused by lateral deformation in order to obtain the ultimate settlement three groups of settling data t i s i i 1 2 3 need to be chosen from the curve of measured settling s against the time period t in the region where full vacuum load has been applied with these selections t 3 t 2 t 2 t 1 δt the ultimate settlement s can be derived as 11 s s 3 s 2 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 2 s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 and 12 β 1 δ t l n s 2 s 1 s 3 s 2 substitute the values of s and β into equation 10 settling at any selected time t can be predicted because the prediction of settling is related to the time interval δt and the selected initial time t 1 three groups of different time intervals δt as well as three groups of different t i s i i 1 2 3 are used for each location to determine the differences in the predicted settling process the values of s and β and the accuracy verification of the formula are presented in table 5 respectively analysis results in table 5 show that different groups of t i s i i 1 2 3 result in different predicted final settling as such it can be stated that the data points used in predictive work have obvious effects on the prediction results generally for the same time interval δt larger initial time points t 1 are associated with smaller difference values between the predicted settling and the measured data furthermore for the same initial time point t 1 a longer time interval δt is expected to be associated with a smaller difference value between the predicted settling and measured data all errors were less than 4 with the exception of a single prediction result at location a such small errors indicate that the exponential curve method provides a good predictability in predicting the degree of settling in order to obtain a reliable prediction result for the ultimate settlement the selected initial point t 1 s 1 and the time interval δt are suggested to be as large as possible when choosing the measured data point on settling s against time period t curve in the region when the full vacuum load has been applied here the group of data points with the smallest errors were adopted to predict the settling and consolidation degrees for the two locations 5 3 asaoka s observational method based on the observed settling data asaoka 1978 proposed a new method for predicting the ultimate settlement by deriving mikasa 1965 one dimensional consolidation equation which can be expressed as 13 ε t z t c v 2 ε t z z 2 in which ε t z is the vertical strain t is the time z is the depth from the top of the clay stratum and c v is the coefficient of consolidation for any boundary condition the settling of the clay stratum can be expressed as 14 s t 0 h ε t z d z where h represents the thickness of clay stratum and s t represents the settling at time t introducing the discrete time as t j j δt where δt is a constant time interval and j 0 1 2 and by sequential differentiation eq 15 can be reduced to the first order approximation equation 15 s j β 0 β 1 s j 1 in which s j denotes the settling at the time t t j and the coefficients β 0 and β 1 are unknown plant parameters when t approaches infinity s j s j 1 s 16 s β 0 1 β 1 let the initial conditions be 17 s t 0 s 0 18 s t s s s 0 e t c 1 and 19 ln β 1 δ t c 1 according to asaoka 1978 if n 1 groups of settling observations s 0 s 1 s j are obtained at a constant time interval of δt δt t j t j 1 n points s j s j 1 for j 1 2 n can be plotted on the coordinate plane under a constant external load all these points will lay on a straight line where the values of β 0 and β 1 are given by the intercept and slope of the fitted straight line moreover the intercept point of this line with the 45 line represents the ultimate settlement in order to discover the influence of different time intervals δt on the predicted settling the asaoka plots at δt 30 40 and 50 days for locations a and b are shown in fig 15 the prediction results and accuracy analysis are shown in table 6 fig 15 and table 6 show that in general the predicted values of the ultimate settlement at different δt for each location are very close this indicates that asaoka s method provides a good stability the values of the settling prediction and the length of the time interval δt are negatively correlated so is the relation between the values of β 1 and δt the longer the time interval δt is the smaller the predicted ultimate settlement will be and the greater the error between the predicted and measured data is given this it is not suitable to choose an excessively long time interval when applying asaoka s method to predict the settling with consideration to minimizing the error value δt 30 days was adopted for both locations in this case a comparison of the prediction results using these three methods for estimating the ultimate settlements are presented in table 7 the settling processes predicted by these methods are furthermore plotted in fig 16 all three methods produced results which were sufficiently accurate to be acceptable as predictions of the ultimate settlements in vacuum preloading drainage projects the results in table 7 show that the ultimate settlements predicted by hyperbolic curve method for both locations are obviously the largest of the three whereas the results obtained using asaoka observational method are the smallest comparison results in fig 16 show that the settling processes predicted by the three methods at both locations are overall well consistent with the field measured data and the predicted ultimate settlements may be a little smaller than actual value however the settling processes predicted by the exponential curve method and asaoka s method are quite similar and close to the actual settling processes in this case study the accuracy of predictions using the exponential curve method and asaoka s method are higher than that provided by the hyperbolic curve method the corresponding prediction errors of exponential curve method generally less than 4 and asaoka s method generally less than 3 are smaller than those produced by the hyperbolic curve method mostly 4 5 hence the asaoka s method is the most preferable for predicting the settling of dredged marine clay slurries with high initial water content improved by vacuum preloading 5 4 consolidation degree the consolidation degree is one of the most important parameters for estimating the effectiveness of land treatment the degree of consolidation at any time t during the vacuum preloading period is typically presented using the following 20 u a v g s t s the adopted ultimate settlement s predicted by the three methods and the actual settlement st at time t are listed in table 8 in this observed project the last measured settling data was used as the actual settlement st so that the estimated consolidation degrees were corresponding to the vacuum time t 359 days for location a and t 440 days for location b table 8 shows that the consolidation degrees at both locations calculated using the exponential curve method and asaoka s method were greater than the result of the hyperbolic curve method however all prediction results were over 80 and therefore met the vacuum unloading requirement 6 conclusions this study observed an engineering project in which the vacuum preloading method incorporated with the vertical drain system was successfully applied to the improvement of the dredged marine clay slurry as the fill as well as the in situ soft ground for land reclamation the technical processes and partial requirements of vacuum preloading were summarized the deep soil lateral displacement and settling as well as the pore water presser variations during vacuum preloading were monitored and analyzed three empirical methods and several key parameters in these empirical formulae for estimating the ultimate settlement and consolidation degree were discussed several conclusions useful for the practical reclaimed land improvement projects using dredged marine clay slurries with high initial water content can be drawn from this study 1 land reclamation using dredged marine clay slurries is typical in china and other coastal developing countries the vacuum preloading combined with the vertical drain system was successfully applied in leqing port zone for this typical project type b drainage boards were used as vertical drains the intervals between the drainage boards were of 0 8 m 0 8 m the drainage system was constructed using 50 mm soft filtering pipelines the planar intervals between adjacent main pipelines were less than 12 m jet type vacuum pumps with 7 5 kw power was used to maintain over 80 kpa vacuum pressure under the membranes the vacuum preloading was maintained for almost a year time to improve bearing capacity from less than 4 6 kpa to be higher than 50 kpa and the initial water content was reduced by more than three times on average specifications of construction techniques for consolidating the dredged marine clay slurry with high initial water content and high clay content were detailed which would be useful and referenceable to engineers 2 after the vacuum preloading at leqing port zone the average degree of consolidation achieved was more than 88 and the land bearing capacity achieved was more than 75 kpa in the depth of 0 m 1 5 m from the soil surface and the corresponding water content was about 50 10 meanwhile the bearing capacity was more than 54 kpa below the depth of 1 5m and corresponding water content was about 54 40 3 overall all the hyperbolic curve method exponential curve method and asaoka s observational method can have sufficient accuracy so that they can predict the ultimate settlement for the exponential curve method it is suggested that the selected initial point t 1 s 1 and time interval δt should be as large as possible for the hyperbolic curve method it is better to assign the full loading time as the initial time and have at least 160 groups of measured settling data for the asaoka s method it is suggested to select the full loading time as the initial time and the time interval is better to be 30 days 4 the settling processes predicted by the exponential curve method and asaoka s method are quite similar and close to the actual settling processes in this case study the accuracy of predictions using the exponential curve method and asaoka s method are higher than that provided by the hyperbolic curve method hence the asaoka s method is the most preferable for predicting the settling of dredged marine clay slurries with high initial water content applied by vacuum preloading acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial

23583,the preliminary design stage for a naval surface ship requires several performance parameters to be considered including stability operability and survivability these parameters have to be considered for many compartments constrained by a limited space so this problem is complex and with many possible design alternatives however the arrangement during the actual design of a ship depends heavily on having experienced designers and parent ships there is no mechanism to quantitatively evaluate the arrangement design for these reasons the probability of changes in the design increases as the design progresses this study proposes a method to arrange a naval surface ship while considering the stability operability and survivability and a prototype program based on the proposed method is herein developed first a template model is defined consisting of a data structure to represent the arrangement information of the ship second methods are studies to quantitatively evaluate the stability operability and survivability of the ship by referring existing studies third two stage optimization problems for the arrangement design are mathematically formulated selecting design variables objective functions and constraints finally a user interface is developed to input the given data and to output the optimization result for the arrangement design the applicability of the proposed method is verified by implementing an example of a 7000 ton class missile destroyer the result shows that the proposed method can be effective in producing better alternatives for the arrangement design during the preliminary design stage keywords arrangement design naval surface ship stability operability survivability multistage optimization 1 introduction a naval surface ship is designed to participate in several missions in battle so it must be suitable for exposure to human made hostility this is the fundamental reason for which such ships must have different design concept from conventional ships in addition numerous crew members must live on the ship for extended periods and thus their living conditions must also be considered in the arrangement design in particular the arrangement design is one of the most important parts because it defines the design philosophy of the ship as such many compartments including tanks rooms and equipment are placed in limited space on the ship there are many alternatives for the arrangement design and our hope is to select a better alternative if possible the best one in less time the performance parameters have to be considered during the arrangement design including the stability operability and survivability of the ship first the stability refers to the ability to restore the ship when it is inclined for some reason although stability is a basic condition for any ship not just naval surface ships it is also necessary to consider stability even after damage due to an attack unlike with conventional ships the stability of a naval surface ship is considered for when the ship is intact or damaged second the operability is the ability for effective flow of the crew and supplies throughout the ship considering the characteristics of the naval surface ship where crew and weapons share space the operability has to be considered for efficient logistic movement within the ship finally the survivability is the ability for the ship to survive under various types of threat the survivability can be regarded as the most important consideration for a naval surface ship when in battle and it is also an important part of the design of a naval surface ship many things are considered when analyzing the survivability of a ship which can be measured through various interpretations during the actual design of the ship the arrangement design in the preliminary design stage is important because the earlier the design stage is the less the cost associated with the design and at the same time the higher the flexibility of the design therefore it is important to carefully consider the performance mentioned above in the preliminary design stage as mentioned above the naval surface ship has a number of compartments that must fit in limited space and there are many alternatives for its arrangement thus an optimization process may find the better or best arrangement for the naval surface ship while considering many criteria including the stability operability and survivability of course the criteria mentioned above are necessary for merchant ships for a safe return to port as well the problem mentioned above is difficult to solve but an optimization technique can efficiently solve it within the allowable time therefore this study involves a mathematical formulation for the optimization problem of finding a better arrangement however it is very difficult to formulate an optimization problem while considering all variables in the arrangement design so the optimization process is subdivided into two stages bulkhead arrangement in the hull and room arrangement in the superstructure 2 related studies several researchers have proposed methods to solve arrangement problems of ships and in this section we summarize past studies related to arrangement design in naval architecture byun 1998 proposed a rule based expert system incorporating a knowledge base to support the compartment design of a commercial ship shin et al 2002 proposed an expert system to arrange the machinery on a ship they proposed an expert system to evaluate the feasibility of design alternatives for machinery arrangement lee et al 2003 2005 used an improved genetic algorithm to arrange rooms and passages in the superstructure of a naval surface ship taking into account its operability including the flow of crews and supplies boulougouris and papanikolaou 2004 proposed a method to arrange compartments in the hull of a naval surface ship and also proposed methods to assess the stability and survivability they then formulated an optimization problem for the compartment arrangement and solved it using a multi objective genetic algorithm moga helvacioglu and insel 2005 proposed a multistage expert system to arrange the compartments on a container ship andrews 2006 proposed the building block method to perform the initial arrangement design of a naval surface ship the building block method allows the arrangement design according to various design requirements and designer s preferences and it also enables naval architectural calculations nick 2008 proposed a method to generate evaluate and optimize the compartment arrangement of a naval surface ship she defined the allocation as the assignment of space compartment to a deck of a ship and the arrangement is used to determine the topology and geometry of the space for the assignment of each deck oers et al 2008 proposed an optimization method for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship they determined a pareto optimal set from various objective functions parsons et al 2008 conducted zone deck optimization and detailed room arrangement in the zone deck through fuzzy optimization and allocation optimization that is they performed the arrangement design with two steps allocation and arrangement in their study the relationship between compartments and the requirements of designers were reflected roh et al 2009 proposed a method to arrange bulkheads in the hull of a naval surface ship they formulated an optimization problem for the bulkhead arrangement of which objective functions are to maximize the space for the armament and the structural strength while satisfying stability requirements chung et al 2011 proposed a rule based expert system to optimize the compartments in the pressure hull of a submarine shin 2013 proposed a method to arrange rooms in the superstructure of a naval surface ship by considering its survivability he tried to quantify the survivability by using fmea failure mode and effective analysis and fta fault tree analysis ju et al 2014 proposed a method to arrange rooms in the superstructure of a naval surface ship he used the slp systematic layout planning method to solve an optimization problem for the room arrangement of which objective functions are to optimize the survivability and operability kim et al 2015 proposed an expert system to arrange the compartments and equipment in the pressure hull of a submarine the proposed expert system was based on the arrangement evaluation model aem to evaluate the feasibility of the design alternatives and the arrangement template model atm to store the arrangement information kim and roh 2016 proposed an arrangement method of a submarine based on the expert system and the optimization technique in their study the arrangement design was mathematically formulated as a three stage optimization problem for compartments sub compartments and equipment jung 2016 proposed a method to arrange rooms in the superstructure of a naval surface ship and also proposed a method to evaluate the integrated survivability considering the vulnerability susceptibility and recoverability as seen above the most relevant studies have focused separately on the compartment bulkheads or rooms arrangement in the hull or in the superstructure but not both furthermore not all performance such as stability operability and survivability were considered even though it is important to consider them simultaneously in the design of naval surface ships thus this study proposes a method to optimally arrange bulkheads and rooms considering the major aspects of the performance as a naval surface ship table 1 shows a summary of related studies and a comparison of those studies with this study the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 3 describes the method proposed in this study for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship in section 4 the proposed arrangement method is applied to a bulkhead arrangement and a room arrangement and the results of an actual application are discussed the final section presents the overall results of this study and briefly discusses the remaining work left for future study 3 arrangement design method of a naval surface ship this study proposes a method for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship fig 1 shows the configuration of the proposed method as shown in this figure the proposed method consists mainly of six components the template model stability module operability module survivability module optimization module and user interface the arrangement design requires a data structure that can store arrangement information in this study the template model fig 1 1 is used as the data structure for the arrangement design of the naval surface ship it was hierarchically defined to store various pieces of information related to the bulkheads decks compartments tanks and rooms also the template model is used to interface various information among the other modules fig 1 2 to 5 and the user interface fig 1 6 to evaluate various performance parameters including the stability operability and survivability of the given alternative for the arrangement design the stability module fig 1 2 the operability module fig 1 3 and the survivability module fig 1 4 were developed in addition bending moment was calculated separately these modules give us quantitative values for each performance parameter using a reasonable method and the values are used in the optimization module as objective functions and constraints for the optimization in the field of engineering optimization techniques have gained widespread use to obtain an optimal design according to specific requirements in this study an optimization technique is used to derive the arrangement design of a naval surface ship thus the optimization module fig 1 5 was developed and it includes the mathematical formulation of the optimization problems and an optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problems the user interface is also needed for the designer to easily utilize the components that are mentioned above in this study the user interface fig 1 6 was developed as a tool for the input and output of the arrangement design including a function of 3d visualization 3 1 stability module for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship the stability module is used to assess the stability of a naval surface ship under intact and damaged conditions such assessment can be done by verifying some stability criteria 3 1 1 evaluation of intact stability to verify the criteria for the intact stability a gz righting arm curve and an ha heeling arm curve should be calculated as shown in fig 2 to calculate the gz curve the buoyancy and weight changes should be considered for different heel angles thus if the positions of the bulkheads associated with liquid tanks change the gz curve should be calculated considering the free surface effect of the liquid tanks moore and paulling 2010 with these curves the adherence to the conditions for intact stability can be checked as summarized in table 2 brown and deybach 1998 referring to fig 2 and table 2 the ratio of the righting arm at the intersection of the gz and ha curves gz0 to the maximum righting arm gzmax should be less than 0 6 the ratio between capsizing and restoring energy that is the ratio of area a2 to a1 should be greater than 1 4 finally the equilibrium heel angle ϕ 0 should be less than 15 deg for some severe cases such as lifting heavy weights over the side crowding of crews to one side high speed turning and so on 3 1 2 evaluation of the damage stability the damage stability of a naval surface ship can be roughly checked using a deterministic approach the basis to determine the extent of flooding is the length of damage to the shell at any point along the ship s length resulting from an attack with a weapon or a collision in particular the combatant type naval surface ships of over 90 m in length should meet criteria for adequate subdivision to resist underwater damage sarchin and goldberg 1962 that is they should be capable of withstanding flooding from a shell opening equal to 12 5 of the ship s length longitudinal extent at any point fore and aft the maximum transverse extent is assumed to be that caused by penetrating damage to but not including any center bulkhead and the maximum vertical extent is assumed for all decks to be opened because of the effect of the resulting high flooding free surface and possible unsymmetrical flooding with this assumption for the extent of the damage satisfying the damage stability can be checked with the criteria summarized in table 3 referring to fig 3 and table 3 the equilibrium heel angle ϕ 0 should be less than 15 deg the ratio of area a2 to a1 should be greater than 1 4 and the difference between gzmax and ha at the angle corresponding to gzmax should be greater than 0 075 m the area a1 should be greater than 0 02 m rad finally the margin line should be higher than the waterline in the damaged state republic of korea navy 2014 kim et al 2017a 3 2 operability module for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship the operability can be referred to as the ability to represent the effectiveness of the flow of crews and supplies in the ship in this study the operability was represented with the adjacency index ai that is calculated using the adjacency coefficient q ij and the distance d ij between the compartments i and j as shown in eq 1 kim et al 2017b 1 a i i 1 n c 1 j i 1 n c q i j d i j in eq 1 the symbol n c is the number of compartments 3 2 1 adjacency index between compartments the adjacency coefficient is a constant that quantitatively represents the degree of closeness between compartments and it can be calculated from the affinities and antagonism as shown in eq 2 kim et al 2017b 2 q i j a f f i n i t y i j a n t a g o n i s m i j in eq 2 the affinity is the characteristic that makes it particularly advantageous to locate one compartment close to another specific compartment and it is related to the movement of crews and supplies between compartments a frequent movement of crews and supplies is anticipated between specific compartments then it becomes advantageous to locate these compartments close to each other the antagonism represents the characteristics that preclude a compartment from being separately and safely located near another specific compartment as a consequence the adjacency coefficient between each compartment can be calculated by subtracting the antagonism from the affinity the adjacency coefficients q ij between the compartments can then be determined by a designer and are given as one of the input data for the arrangement design 3 2 2 distance calculation between compartments there are many rooms including passages in the superstructure thus when we calculate the distance d ij between the compartments i e the room i and j the passages between them should also be considered in this study dijkstra s algorithm from graph theory was used to determine an accurate distance lee et al 2003 2005 for example to find the shortest path between compartments 3 and 10 and its distance all possible relationships among compartments 3 10 and the passages can be represented in the adjacency graph as shown in fig 4 b in the adjacency graph of fig 4 b each node represents the compartment 3 and 10 or the passage a b c and d each edge represents the distance between the compartment and horizontal passage or between the horizontal and vertical passages when using dijkstra s algorithm the length of each edge must be calculated to determine the shortest path and its distance between compartments i and j to do this two starting points for the distance calculation called base points should first be defined in this study a centroid center of area of the compartment is used as the base point for the compartment however for the passage it is difficult to define the base point if the centroid of the passage is used as the base point the redundant distances may be included in the resulting distance between the compartments to avoid making this error the base points for the vertical and horizontal passages are defined as follows for the vertical passage b and c the centroid of the passage is used as the base point for the horizontal passage a and d the y and x coordinates of the base point are assumed as the vertical centroid of the horizontal passage for the y coordinate and x f x p 2 for the x coordinate here x f and x p represent the horizontal centroids of the compartment and the vertical passage respectively for example the x coordinate x a1 p of the base point for the horizontal passage a1 is assumed as the horizontal center point between compartment 3 and the vertical passage b the y coordinate y a1 p is assumed as the vertical center point of the horizontal passage a1 as shown in fig 4 a an example defining the base points for the horizontal passages is shown in fig 4 a and the corresponding adjacency graph is shown in fig 4 b 3 3 survivability module for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship according to said 1995 the survivability is defined as the capability of a ship and its onboard systems to avoid and withstand a weapons effects environment without sustaining impairment of their ability to accomplish designated missions the survivability has three components vulnerability susceptibility and recoverability the vulnerability refers to the inability of a ship to withstand damage from one or more attacks its vincibility and to its liability to serious damage or loss when attacked by weapons the susceptibility refers to the inability of a ship to avoid being damaged in the pursuit of its mission and to its probability of being attacked lastly the recoverability refers to the ability of a ship and its crew to prevent loss and restore mission essential functions from an attack due to one or more weapons among these the vulnerability can be improved by adjusting the positions of the bulkheads and decks and the locations of rooms therefore this study handles the vulnerability as a major component that represents the survivability of the ship regarding the arrangement design of a naval surface ship two vulnerability scenarios for the bulkheads in the hull and for rooms in the superstructure are defined and evaluated as follows 3 3 1 bulkhead damage vulnerability if an explosion due to an attack occurs within the compartment of a naval surface ship the pressure of the explosion will act on adjacent bulkheads and decks as shown in fig 5 at this time if the pressure due to the explosion can be minimized we can say that the vulnerability of the ship may be reduced in this sense minimizing all explosion pressure of the bulkheads induced by all explosives may be a criterion to select a better alternative in the arrangement design in terms of the vulnerability thus the bulkhead damage vulnerability v bd can be represented using eq 3 3 v b d i 1 n b d p r i in eq 3 the symbol p r i is the explosion pressure of the ith bulkhead or deck due to an explosive and the symbol n b d is the number of bulkheads and decks in the hull the explosion pressure p r i of the bulkhead or deck due to an explosive can be calculated using eq 4 us department of the army 1990 choi et al 2015 this equation is an empirical fit equation for the reflected pressure according to the distance from the explosive point to the bulkhead or deck 4 p r i 2 p 0 p s n d i γ 1 p s n d i 2 γ 1 p s n d i 2 γ in eq 4 the symbol p 0 is the ambient air pressure in pa 101 300 pa at sea level the symbol p snd is the non dimensional side on overpressure in pa defined as eq 5 and the symbol γ is the specific heat ratio of p 0 and p snd taken as 1 4 5 p s n d i 0 55 r i p 0 e w w 1 3 1 95 in eq 5 the symbol r i is the distance from the center of the explosion to the ith bulkhead or deck in m the symbol e w is the explosive energy per unit mass in m2 s2 and the symbol w is the charge mass of an explosive in kg in eq 4 p r i is a function of the distance of bulkheads or decks from the explosive point therefore to calculate the vulnerability of the ship the positions of explosives corresponding to threats have to be defined the types of threats also have to be selected in this study anti ship missile asms torpedoes and mines were considered as major threats to the ship for each threat the longitudinal damage distribution was assumed by referring to existing studies harmsen and krikke 2000 boulougouris and papanikolaou 2004 we assumed that asms follow a piecewise linear distribution along the ship s length torpedoes follow a normal distribution and mines follow a linear distribution as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the distribution of the asms has its peak point at midship because the midship part has the largest area being detected and the remaining part shows a linear change due to the characteristics of torpedos which target a ship by sensing the noise radiated underwater that is usually generated by an engine and propeller the midpoint of the normal distribution slightly moved to the stern of the ship in the case of mines the probability of damage of the stern is zero and the probability of damage to the bow side behaves linearly as they will explode by the pressure over which the ship passes in this study for all threats the explosive energy per unit mass e w was assumed to be 4 184 109 m2 s2 and the charge mass w of the asms torpedoes and mines was assumed to be 161 kg 300 kg and 113 4 kg respectively by referring to existing studies harmsen and krikke 2000 boulougouris and papanikolaou 2004 3 3 2 room damage vulnerability similarly the concept of the vulnerability can be applied to rooms in the superstructure in this study the room damage vulnerability is defined as a summation of the multiplication of the probability being damaged and the importance factor of each room as shown in eq 6 6 v r d i 1 n r p i e i in eq 6 the symbol p i and e i are the probability of damage and the importance factor of the ith room respectively and the symbol n r is the number of rooms in the superstructure 1 probability of damage of the room a naval ship has a probability of being attacked along her length breadth and depth if a certain room is placed in a certain position of the superstructure the room has its own probability of damage according to its x y and z positions as shown in fig 7 in this study the probability of damage of the ith room is defined as the multiplication of the probability of damage length p dl and the probability of impact p ip as shown in eq 7 przemieniecki 1994 boulougouris and papanikolaou 2004 7 p i p d l i p i p i the probability of the damage length p dl is again defined as eq 8 that is p dl means the fraction of the target e g room that is assumed to have been damaged within a certain radius from the explosive point of an explosive 8 p d l i 0 a i d a m a i 0 a i 1 2 π 1 2 2 1 45222 ln r s s r s k a i exp ln 2 a i r s s r s k 2 1 2 2 1 45222 ln r s s r s k 2 in eq 8 the symbol a i is the longitudinal transverse or vertical distance between the centroid of the ith room and the explosive point which is normalized by the ship s length breadth or depth whichever is lesser r sk is the sure kill radius that is assumed in this study as 0 02l l ship s length and r ss is the sure save radius that is assumed as 0 15l by referring to existing studies boulougouris and papanikolaou 2004 the probability of impact p ip is defined as eq 9 9 p i p i x 1 i a i 2 x 2 i a i 2 imp x x d x y 1 i a i 2 y 2 i a i 2 imp y y d y z 1 i a i 2 z 2 i a i 2 imp z z d z in eq 9 the coordinates x 1 i and x 2 i are the x coordinates aft and forward which are normalized by the ship s length of the ith room respectively the coordinates y 1 i and y 2 i are y coordinates of the port and starboard which are normalized by the ship s breadth of the ith room respectively the coordinates z 1 i and z 2 i are the z coordinates of the bottom and top of the ith room respectively and these are normalized by the ship s depth including the superstructure function imp x x is the impact density function along the longitudinal direction for each threat considering that the asms follow a piecewise linear distribution along the ship s length the torpedoes follow a normal distribution and the mines follow a linear distribution imp x x for each threat are assumed to follow eqs 10 12 10 imp x x 4 x 4 x 4 i f x 0 5 i f x 0 5 for asm 11 imp x x 1 2 π σ exp 1 2 σ 2 x 0 4 2 for torpedoes in eq 11 the symbol σ is standard deviation of normal distribution 12 imp x x 0 8 x 4 i f x 0 5 i f x 0 5 for mines similarly function imp y y is the impact density function along the transverse direction for each threat in this study we assume that this probability for all threats follows parabolic distribution along the ship s breadth as shown in eq 13 13 imp y y 2 y 0 5 2 5 12 for asm torpedoes and mines finally function imp z z is the impact density function along the vertical direction for each threat in this study we assume that this probability for all threats follows a linear distribution along the ship s depth including the superstructure as shown in eqs 14 and 15 14 imp z z 2 for asm 15 imp z z 2 z 2 for torpedoes and mines when calculating the room damage vulnerability the longitudinal damage distribution for each threat was assumed as the same as that of the bulkhead damage vulnerability in fig 6 2 importance factor of the room if a specific room including equipment is damaged such equipment can also have damage in this sense if a room has important equipment the room should be more carefully considered during the arrangement design considering this fact the importance factor e i of each room can be defined by a summation of the multiplication of the importance coefficient and the number of each piece of equipment in the room as shown in eq 16 16 e i k 1 n r i i e i k n e i k in eq 16 the symbol n r i is the number of all pieces of equipment in the ith room the symbols i e k and n e ik are the importance factor between 0 and 1 and the number of the kth equipment in the ith room respectively the importance factor i e ik for all equipment can be determined by a designer and are given as input data for the arrangement design 3 4 optimization module for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship this section describes an optimization method for the arrangement of a naval surface ship as mentioned earlier the arrangement method for the naval surface ship was formulated in two stages in this study the first stage is the bulkhead arrangement where the positions of the bulkheads and decks in the hull are determined by minimizing the maximum bending moment at the intact state the space for liquid tanks and the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to the attack the second stage is the room arrangement where the sequence of rooms and the positions of passages in the superstructure are determined by minimizing the adjacency index between the rooms and the room damage vulnerability due to the attack since the changes of the second stage such as weight distribution are unknown in the first stage the constraints related to stability in the first stage are confirmed again after the optimization of the second stage in other words we check the stability criteria again after two optimization stages whether the derived arrangement is feasible or not the configuration for the optimization procedure is shown in fig 8 for the optimization at each stage the mathematical formulation of the optimization problems is described below 3 4 1 formulation for the bulkhead arrangement the bulkhead arrangement in the hull is carried out in the first stage and several things need to be considered for this regarding the strength combat performance and survivability of a naval surface ship the positions of the bulkheads and decks in the hull are important during the bulkhead arrangement to ensure the structural strength the maximum bending moment at the intact state should be minimized in addition to ensure the combat performance the space for the armament should be maximized that is the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks such as fuel oil tanks fots fresh water tanks fwts water ballast tanks wbts and lubrication oil tanks lots should be minimized finally to ensure a sufficient survivability of the ship the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to an attack should be minimized for these reasons the process for the bulkhead arrangement was formulated as an optimization problem in this study 1 input data when performing a bulkhead arrangement a hull form and compartment model of the naval surface ship is required such information includes the number of bulkheads and decks and the locations of the compartments including the liquid tanks of the ship also the information of the weight and the weight distribution at the loading conditions such as minimum operating condition and full load condition are also needed to assess the stability requirement in this study only two loading conditions that have a high possibility to cause a severe state of a ship were considered here the minimum operating condition means that a ship carries the minimum amount of cargo required for operation and it can cause a severe state in terms of the stability because the draft is relatively low the full load condition means that a ship carries all cargo fully and it can cause a large amount of bending moment of course if we consider more loading conditions the optimal design will be more robust the bending moment and the stability during the optimization of the bulkhead arrangement were considered as the objective function and the constraints respectively to prevent the space for liquid tanks from becoming too small during the optimization the required volume for the liquid tanks fots fwts wbts and lots should also be prepared to evaluate the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to the attack in section 3 3 1 the longitudinal damage distribution the explosive energy per unit mass and the charge mass of the asms torpedoes and mines are required finally the minimum length for each of the engine rooms and the minimum deck height should be input to prevent those values from becoming too small during the optimization these input data for the bulkhead arrangement can be summarized in table 4 2 design variables in this stage the design variables are the positions of the bulkheads and decks in the hull fig 9 and table 5 show the design variables for the optimization of the bulkhead arrangement 3 objective functions as previously mentioned it is very important to ensure the structural strength combat performance and survivability of a ship in the bulkhead arrangement therefore we introduced three objective functions to ensure these are obtained in the first stage of the optimization the first objective function of this stage minimizes the maximum bending moment at the intact state at this time two loading conditions such as the full load condition and minimum operating condition were considered in this study for each loading condition the maximum bending moment can be obtained by calculating the buoyancy curve the weight curve the load curve the shear force curve and the bending moment curve in the longitudinal direction of the ship the bending moment can be obtained from the weight curve and the buoyancy curve of a ship under the given loading condition here the weight curve represents weight distribution of the ship in the longitudinal direction thus if the positions of bulkheads change the weight curve changes the load curve is obtained by summing up two curves if the load curve is integrated along the longitudinal direction the shear force curve can be obtained if the shear force curve is integrated again along the longitudinal direction the bending moment curve can be obtained this objective function is intended to minimize the maximum value of the maximum bending moments for the two loading conditions the second objective function minimizes the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks to maximize the space for the armament the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks can be obtained by summing up all volumes of the liquid tanks including the fots fwts wbts and lots the third objective function minimizes the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to an attack in section 3 3 1 the bulkhead damage vulnerability v bd can be calculated by using eq 3 the objective functions for the optimization of the bulkhead arrangement are then summarized in table 6 4 constraints when arranging the bulkheads and decks in the hull some issues including the stability should be considered thus the following constraints were formulated to consider such aspects a constraints related to the criteria for intact and damage stability as mentioned in section 3 1 a naval surface ship should satisfy the criteria for intact and damage stability the criteria were used as constraints for the optimization in this stage as shown in eqs 17 24 eqs 17 19 are the criteria for the intact stability and eqs 20 24 are the criteria for the damage stability 17 g 1 g z 0 g z max 0 6 0 in the intact state 18 g 2 1 4 a 2 a 1 0 in the intact state 19 g 3 ϕ 0 15 0 in the intact state 20 g 4 ϕ 0 15 0 in the damaged state 21 g 5 1 4 a 2 a 1 0 in the damaged state 22 g 6 0 075 g z max h a 0 in the damaged state 23 g 7 0 02 a 1 0 in the damaged state 24 g 8 d i s t 0 in the damaged state b constraints related to the required volumes for liquid tanks in general the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks may have required a given volume for operation thus there are constraints that bind the upper and lower limits for each liquid tank as shown in eqs 25 32 25 g 9 v f o t min v f o t 0 26 g 10 v f o t v f o t max 0 27 g 11 v f w t min v f w t 0 28 g 12 v f w t v f w t max 0 29 g 13 v w b t min v w b t 0 30 g 14 v w b t v w b t max 0 31 g 15 v l o t min v l o t 0 32 g 16 v l o t v l o t max 0 c constraints related to the required length for the engine rooms if the length of each of the engine rooms should have a minimum length such requirements can be formulated as constraints as shown in eqs 33 34 33 g 17 l e r min x 5 x 6 0 34 g 18 l e r min x 7 x 8 0 in eqs 33 34 the values x 5 x 6 and x 7 x 8 are the length of each of the engine rooms as shown in fig 9 d constraints related to the required deck height if the height between the adjacent decks should have the minimum distance such requirements can be formulated as constraints as shown in eqs 35 39 35 g 19 h d e c k min z 1 0 0 36 g 20 h d e c k min z 2 z 1 0 37 g 21 h d e c k min z 3 z 2 0 38 g 22 h d e c k min z 4 z 3 0 39 g 23 h d e c k min d z 4 0 in eq 39 the symbol d is the depth of the ship thus the optimization problem for the bulkhead arrangement has n b d 18 in fig 9 design variables 3 objective functions and 23 inequality constraints this problem is a kind of multi objective constrained optimization problem 3 4 2 formulation for the room arrangement next the room arrangement in the superstructure is carried out in the second stage and several things need to be considered as in the first stage regarding the operability and survivability of a naval surface ship the sequence of rooms and the positions of the passages in the superstructure are important during the room arrangement to ensure the operability the adjacency index that represents the effectiveness of the flow of crews and supplies in the ship should be minimized also to ensure a sufficient survivability of the ship the room damage vulnerability due to the attack should be minimized for these reasons the process for the room arrangement was formulated as an optimization problem in this study 1 input data when performing a room arrangement a hull form and a compartment model of the naval surface ship are required as in the bulkhead arrangement such information includes a number of bulkheads and decks in addition the number of rooms the number of passages of each deck and the locations of the entrance doors and inclined ladders in the superstructure should also be given and the positions of the bulkheads and the decks in the hull that were obtained from the first stage are used as one of input data in this stage the locations of entrance doors of rooms and the locations of inclined ladders play a very important role in determining the distance d ij in eq 1 therefore this study reflected them and when calculating the distance between each room we defined the distance d ij so that it can only move through entrance doors and inclined ladders the locations of entrance doors and inclined ladders used as input information in this study are shown in fig 11 the locations of entrance doors and inclined ladders are not included in the design variables but since the locations are dependent on the bulkheads and the passages they are changed following the related bulkheads and passages during the optimization process in the future we will include them as design variables of the optimization problem to evaluate the operability of the ship the adjacency coefficients between rooms is needed to evaluate the room damage vulnerability due to the attack in section 3 3 2 the longitudinal damage distribution of all threats the number of all equipment in the rooms and the importance factor and the number of each equipment in the rooms should also be given the minimum area for each room should be input to prevent its value from becoming too small during the optimization finally the number and the required locations of the specific rooms e g engine room bridge etc should be defined these input data for the room arrangement are summarized in table 7 2 design variables in this stage the design variables are the sequence of rooms and positions of passages in the superstructure fig 10 and table 8 show the design variables for the optimization of the room arrangement in this figure the number in the square bracket means the region id where each room is to be allocated thus r 1 or1 r 2 so1 r 3 or2 r 4 so2 r 5 so3 r 33 cr10 that is the location of each room can be represented as an array of the room id e g or1 cr1 etc through an encoding process in a genetic algorithm ga and after optimization the array can be converted into the room arrangement through the decoding process 3 objective functions as previously mentioned it is very important to ensure the operability and sufficient survivability of the ship in the room arrangement in the superstructure therefore we introduced two objective functions to ensure these are obtained in the second stage of the optimization the first objective function of this stage minimizes the adjacency index ai in eq 1 between the rooms for this the distance d ij between the rooms should be calculated by using the method in section 3 2 2 the second objective function minimizes the room damage vulnerability due to an attack in section 3 3 2 the room damage vulnerability v rd can be calculated by using eq 6 the objective functions for the optimization of the room arrangement are summarized in table 9 4 constraints when arranging the rooms and passages in the superstructure some issues should be considered including the ship owner s requirements thus the following constraints were formulated to consider such aspects a constraints related to the required area for rooms if the area of each room should have the minimum area according to the ship owner s requirements such requirements can be formulated as constraints as shown in eq 40 40 g i a i min a i 0 i 1 n r b constraints related to the required locations of the specific rooms if specific rooms such as the engine room er1 er2 bridge br and heli cargo hc should have fixed locations such requirements can be formulated as constraints as shown in eq 41 41 g n r i r i r i req 0 i 1 n r f l thus the optimization problem for the room arrangement has n r 33 12 45 in fig 10 design variables 2 objective functions and n r n rfl 33 4 37 constraints this problem is also a kind of multi objective constrained optimization problem 3 4 3 optimization algorithm optimization algorithms are divided into global and local optimization algorithms and several types of algorithms are available for global optimization including ga goldberg 1989 davis 1991 global optimization algorithms may be suitable for large scale problems that have many local optima but they require more iterations to obtain an acceptable optimum in comparison with local optimization algorithms several classes of local optimization algorithms also exist including sequential linear programming slp arora 2012 sequential quadratic programming sqp arora 2012 and a method for feasible directions mfd vanderplaats 1984 each of these local optimization algorithms can be used to effectively find the optimum however in some cases these local optimization algorithms find an optimum that is relatively close to the starting point in addition the objective functions and constraints presented in this study include nonlinear equations which are difficult to be solved with general optimization algorithms also since the permutation is used in the second stage as design variables the algorithm which can handle the permutation should be used in this study nsga ii deb et al 2002 which is a kind of multiobjective ga was used to solve multi objective nonlinear optimization problems of this study of course spea ii zitzler et al 2001 and smpso nebro et al 2009 can be used through comparative tests among them by us nsga ii that had shown the best performance was finally selected and used to solve the optimization problems of this study 4 application of the proposed method for the naval surface ship 4 1 prototype program a prototype program was developed using the proposed method in the c programing language and it consists of the template model stability module operability module survivability module optimization module and user interface as shown in fig 1 fig 12 shows the components and the screenshot of the prototype program to verify the applicability of the proposed method and the prototype program they were applied to an example of the arrangement design of the naval surface ship 4 2 description of an example as mentioned earlier the proposed method focuses on the arrangement design of the naval surface ship the bulkhead arrangement was optimized in the first stage of optimization and in the second stage the room arrangement was optimized a 7000 ton class missile destroyer was selected as an example in this study the length breadth and draft of the ship are 154 m 20 m and 9 4 m respectively the bulkhead arrangement in the hull including tanks is shown in fig 9 and the room arrangement in the superstructure is shown in fig 10 in this study we optimized the arrangement of 14 bulkheads and 4 decks during the first stage after optimizing the bulkhead arrangement we have optimized the arrangement of 33 rooms and 12 passages and we then present each result of the arrangement more details of the input data are summarized in table 10 table 11 shows the adjacency coefficients q ij between the rooms of the example 4 3 optimization of the bulkhead arrangement the arrangement of the 14 bulkheads and 4 decks was optimized in the first stage as mentioned earlier in this stage the positions of the bulkheads and the decks were optimized to minimize the maximum bending moment at the intact state to minimize the auxiliary space for liquid tanks and to minimize the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to the attack as mentioned in section 3 4 1 three objective functions were used to optimize the bulkhead arrangement therefore three dimensional pareto optimal set can be obtained as a result of optimization in this section we compared the initial design and two optimal designs as the first optimal design the design alternative with a large influence of damage vulnerability which is an important factor in the bulkhead arrangement was selected as the second optimal design the design alternative evenly considering all the effects of the objective functions was selected through the normalization of three objective functions table 12 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the bulkhead arrangement between the initial design and the first optimal design large influence of damage vulnerability in the case of the initial design the values of the objective functions were calculated to be the same as the optimal design that is they were calculated according to the formulation mentioned in section 3 4 1 as shown in table 12 the maximum bending moment in the intact state decreased from 362 261 kn m initial design to 321 860 kn m first optimal design by 11 1 also the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks decreased from 4390 m3 initial design to 3823 m3 first optimal design by 12 9 the bulkhead damage vulnerability improved significantly from 13 81 gpa initial design to 6 89 gpa first optimal design by 50 1 further comparisons between the initial design and the first optimal design for the bulkhead arrangement are shown in table 13 and fig 13 the bulkhead damage vulnerability depends on the summation of the explosion pressures p r i of the bulkheads and decks due to explosives such as asms torpedoes and mines as shown in eq 3 from eqs 4 and 5 we can see that the explosion pressure of the bulkhead or deck is inversely proportional to its distance from the explosion point meanwhile the distribution of the explosion points by the asms and torpedoes has its peak point near the midship as shown in fig 6 the distribution by the mines has its peak point near fore body therefore to minimize the bulkhead damage vulnerability the distances between the bulkheads near the midship and fore body were changed during the optimization that is in the case of the midship the distances between x 6 and x 7 and between x 8 and x 9 increased as a result the distances between x 5 and x 6 1st engine room and between x 7 and x 8 2nd engine room decreased in the case of the fore body the distance between x 11 and x 12 increased however the distance between x 10 and x 11 decreased table 14 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the bulkhead arrangement between the initial design and the second optimal design even influence of three objective functions as shown in table 14 the maximum bending moment in the intact state decreased from 362 261 kn m initial design to 315 058 kn m second optimal design by 13 0 also the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks decreased from 4390 m3 initial design to 3813 m3 second optimal design by 13 1 the bulkhead damage vulnerability improved from 13 81 gpa initial design to 11 61 gpa second optimal design by 15 9 further comparisons between the initial design and the second optimal design for the bulkhead arrangement are shown in table 15 and fig 14 in the second optimal design the distances between the bulkheads near the midship were narrowed as compared with the initial design as shown in fig 14 they caused the reduction of the capacity of liquid tanks as a result the weight of the midship was reduced and the bending moment was reduced accordingly we can see that the maximum bending moment at the intact state and the auxiliary space for liquid tanks of the second optimal design are slightly better than those of the first optimal design as shown in tables 12 and 14 that is the improvement of them were not so much as compared with the improvement of the bulkhead damage vulnerability of the first optimal design this is because the bulkhead damage vulnerability is very sensitive to the positions of the bulkheads in practice the bulkheads should be located at the frames of the ship to take into account manufacturability to reflect this the post processing process was done to move the bulkheads of the optimal designs to the adjacent frames the frame spacing of the naval surface ship used in this example is assumed to be 0 5 m thus this process means moving the optimal positions of the bulkheads to the nearest frame of 0 5 m spacing this process was applied to the second optimal design and the results without and with this process were compared table 16 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the bulkhead arrangement between the second optimal designs without and with post processing as shown in table 16 the maximum bending moment in the intact state increased from 315 508 kn m without post processing to 330 857 kn m with post processing by 5 0 also the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks increased from 3813 m3 without post processing to 3824 m3 with post processing by 0 3 the bulkhead damage vulnerability deteriorated from 11 61 gpa without post processing to 12 85 gpa with post processing by 10 7 further comparisons between the second optimal designs without and with post processing for the bulkhead arrangement are shown in table 17 as a result of comparing the objective functions of the two design the maximum bending moment at the intact state and the auxiliary space for liquid tanks showed a similar or slight increase however as described above the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to the attack was very sensitive to the positions of the bulkheads so that the amount of increase was greater than the others if we take some disadvantage in the objective functions we can enhance manufacturability at the same time therefore the post processing process is necessary for practical design 4 4 optimization of the room arrangement next the arrangement of 33 rooms and 12 passages was optimized in the second stage in this stage the sequence of rooms and the positions of the passages were optimized to minimize the adjacency index between the rooms and to minimize the room damage vulnerability due to the attack as mentioned in section 3 4 2 two objective functions were used to optimize the room arrangement therefore two dimensional pareto optimal set can be obtained as a result of optimization in this section we compared the initial design and two optimal designs as the first optimal design the design alternative with a large influence of adjacency index which is an important factor in the room arrangement was selected as the second optimal design the design alternative evenly considering all the effects of the objective functions was selected through the normalization of two objective functions table 18 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the room arrangement between the initial design and the first optimal design large influence of adjacency index when performing the optimization the adjacency information for the room arrangement was extracted through a consultation with experts of naval surface ships in the case of the initial design the values of objective functions were calculated to be the same as the optimal design that is they were calculated according to the formulation mentioned in section 3 4 2 as shown in table 18 the adjacency index of the optimal design decreased from 21 976 initial design to 16 359 first optimal design by 25 6 and the room damage vulnerability improved slightly from 0 134 initial design to 0 127 first optimal design by 5 2 more comparisons between the initial design and the first optimal design for the room arrangement are shown in table 19 and fig 15 according to the adjacency coefficients between rooms in table 11 the galley ga and the crew rooms cr1 cr10 the commander room cor and the command control room cc the executive office room xo and the cc and the xo and the cor have a high value 3 of the adjacency coefficient between them the ga and the er the cor and the er and the xo and the er have a low value 2 of the adjacency coefficient between them to minimize the adjacency index the rooms with a high value of the adjacency coefficient should be arranged close to each other and the rooms with a low value should be arranged apart from each other in fig 15 we can see that the optimal design satisfied these requirements well relative to the initial design the room damage vulnerability depends on the summation of the multiplication of the probability of damage p i due to explosives and the importance factor e i of rooms as shown in eq 6 the probability of damage of the rooms is proportional to the multiplication of the probability of damage length p dl and the probability of impact p ip as shown in eq 7 to minimize the room damage vulnerability the rooms e g command control room equipment storages with a high importance factor should be arranged apart from the explosive points as far as possible since most of the explosive points are located at midship and at the fore body such rooms should be arranged away from the points as shown in fig 15 in the case of the initial design some of the equipment storage eq2 and eq3 is located midship however we can see that such rooms were arranged aft and forward in the optimal design in addition the cc was also located in the fore body but after optimization we can see that it moved to after body as a result the room damage vulnerability of the optimal design was lower than that of the initial design table 20 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the room arrangement between the initial design and the second optimal design even influence of two objective functions as shown in table 20 the adjacency index decreased from 21 976 initial design to 18 435 second optimal design by 16 1 and the room damage vulnerability improved slightly from 0 134 initial design to 0 114 second optimal design by 14 9 unlike the previous results it can be seen that the two objective functions were improved at a similar rate more comparisons between the initial design and the optimal design for the room arrangement are shown in table 21 and fig 16 in the second optimal design the equipment storage eq4 moved to the after body as shown in fig 16 we can see that the vulnerability of the second optimal design is slightly better than that of the first optimal design this is because explosive points are concentrated relatively in the midship and the fore body if we look closely at the optimization results some parts of the optimal design would be quickly challenged by an experienced designer for example it is hard to believe that anyone would place crew rooms on the o 2 deck just after of the bridge this is a serious work area of the ship not a rest and recreation area the crew wants to be away from officers and close to the mess decks when off duty further it appears that the area of the command control room cc has been shrunk and personnel access distance from the bridge to the cc has been more than doubled by the optimization process to reflect these considerations we adjusted several adjacency coefficients for calculating the adjacency index the adjacency coefficient between the bridge br and the commander room cor was adjusted to 3 to make it easier for the captain to access the bridge similar reason the adjacency coefficient between the br and the executive officer room xo was adjusted to a high value 3 and other adjacency coefficients was adjusted so that crews and officers could be away from the operational area during off duty that is the adjacency coefficient between the cc and the crew room cr the cc and officer room or the br and the cr and the br and the or were adjusted to a low value 2 in addition constraints were added so that the cr would not be located at o 2 deck as similar with eqs 35 39 table 22 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the room arrangement between the second optimal designs without and with adjustment of adjacency coefficients and constraints as shown in table 22 the adjacency index increased from 18 435 without adjustment to 19 595 with adjustment by 6 3 and the room damage vulnerability slightly deteriorated from 0 113 without adjustment to 0 124 with adjustment by 9 7 by changing the adjacency coefficients and constraints we can see that both objective function values were worse than the second optimal design more comparisons between the second optimal designs without and with adjustment for the room arrangement are shown in fig 17 due to the change of adjacency coefficients and constraints the distances between the cor and the cc the br and the cc and the br and the xo were closer the cor and the xo moved to the upper deck of the fore body in addition all of the cr were placed on the main deck so that the optimal design similar to an actual naval surface ship was obtained 5 conclusion and future studies this study proposed an arrangement method for a naval surface ship in the preliminary design stage it is not easy to consider all requirements for the performance parameters of the ship including the stability operability and survivability in a short period of time an optimization technique was introduced here to effectively solve such problem first a template model is defined as the data structure to represent the arrangement information of the ship second methods were studied to quantitatively evaluate the stability operability and survivability of the ship by referring existing studies third two stage optimization problems for the arrangement design were mathematically formulated with the selection of the design variables objective functions and constraints finally a user interface was developed to input the given data and to output the optimization results for the arrangement design to check the applicability of the proposed method a prototype program based on the proposed method was developed and then the method was applied to an example of a 7000 ton class missile destroyer the results show that the method could yield a better alternative for the arrangement design in terms of the objective functions that were selected for the optimization in the future a mathematical formulation of the optimization module will be further refined to obtain a more realistic arrangement design also the survivability module will be improved to consider various aspects of the survivability besides the vulnerability further considerations of the interface between the hull and the superstructure of the ship will be made for the optimization process in the future to increase the applicability of the proposed method it will be applied to various types of naval surface ships acknowledgments this study was partially

23583,the preliminary design stage for a naval surface ship requires several performance parameters to be considered including stability operability and survivability these parameters have to be considered for many compartments constrained by a limited space so this problem is complex and with many possible design alternatives however the arrangement during the actual design of a ship depends heavily on having experienced designers and parent ships there is no mechanism to quantitatively evaluate the arrangement design for these reasons the probability of changes in the design increases as the design progresses this study proposes a method to arrange a naval surface ship while considering the stability operability and survivability and a prototype program based on the proposed method is herein developed first a template model is defined consisting of a data structure to represent the arrangement information of the ship second methods are studies to quantitatively evaluate the stability operability and survivability of the ship by referring existing studies third two stage optimization problems for the arrangement design are mathematically formulated selecting design variables objective functions and constraints finally a user interface is developed to input the given data and to output the optimization result for the arrangement design the applicability of the proposed method is verified by implementing an example of a 7000 ton class missile destroyer the result shows that the proposed method can be effective in producing better alternatives for the arrangement design during the preliminary design stage keywords arrangement design naval surface ship stability operability survivability multistage optimization 1 introduction a naval surface ship is designed to participate in several missions in battle so it must be suitable for exposure to human made hostility this is the fundamental reason for which such ships must have different design concept from conventional ships in addition numerous crew members must live on the ship for extended periods and thus their living conditions must also be considered in the arrangement design in particular the arrangement design is one of the most important parts because it defines the design philosophy of the ship as such many compartments including tanks rooms and equipment are placed in limited space on the ship there are many alternatives for the arrangement design and our hope is to select a better alternative if possible the best one in less time the performance parameters have to be considered during the arrangement design including the stability operability and survivability of the ship first the stability refers to the ability to restore the ship when it is inclined for some reason although stability is a basic condition for any ship not just naval surface ships it is also necessary to consider stability even after damage due to an attack unlike with conventional ships the stability of a naval surface ship is considered for when the ship is intact or damaged second the operability is the ability for effective flow of the crew and supplies throughout the ship considering the characteristics of the naval surface ship where crew and weapons share space the operability has to be considered for efficient logistic movement within the ship finally the survivability is the ability for the ship to survive under various types of threat the survivability can be regarded as the most important consideration for a naval surface ship when in battle and it is also an important part of the design of a naval surface ship many things are considered when analyzing the survivability of a ship which can be measured through various interpretations during the actual design of the ship the arrangement design in the preliminary design stage is important because the earlier the design stage is the less the cost associated with the design and at the same time the higher the flexibility of the design therefore it is important to carefully consider the performance mentioned above in the preliminary design stage as mentioned above the naval surface ship has a number of compartments that must fit in limited space and there are many alternatives for its arrangement thus an optimization process may find the better or best arrangement for the naval surface ship while considering many criteria including the stability operability and survivability of course the criteria mentioned above are necessary for merchant ships for a safe return to port as well the problem mentioned above is difficult to solve but an optimization technique can efficiently solve it within the allowable time therefore this study involves a mathematical formulation for the optimization problem of finding a better arrangement however it is very difficult to formulate an optimization problem while considering all variables in the arrangement design so the optimization process is subdivided into two stages bulkhead arrangement in the hull and room arrangement in the superstructure 2 related studies several researchers have proposed methods to solve arrangement problems of ships and in this section we summarize past studies related to arrangement design in naval architecture byun 1998 proposed a rule based expert system incorporating a knowledge base to support the compartment design of a commercial ship shin et al 2002 proposed an expert system to arrange the machinery on a ship they proposed an expert system to evaluate the feasibility of design alternatives

including the flow of crews and supplies boulougouris and papanikolaou 2004 proposed a method to arrange compartments in the hull of a naval surface ship and also proposed methods to assess the stability and survivability they then formulated an optimization problem for the compartment arrangement and solved it using a multi objective genetic algorithm moga helvacioglu and insel 2005 proposed a multistage expert system to arrange the compartments on a container ship andrews 2006 proposed the building block method to perform the initial arrangement design of a naval surface ship

were reflected roh et al 2009 proposed a method to arrange bulkheads in the hull of a naval surface ship they formulated an optimization problem for the bulkhead arrangement of which objective

optimization technique in their study the arrangement design was mathematically formulated as a three stage optimization problem for compartments sub compartments and equipment jung 2016 proposed a method to arrange rooms in the superstructure of a naval surface ship and also proposed a method to evaluate the integrated survivability considering the vulnerability susceptibility and recoverability as seen above the most relevant studies have focused separately on the compartment bulkheads or rooms arrangement in the hull or in the superstructure but not both furthermore not all performance such as stability operability and survivability were considered even though it is important to consider them simultaneously in the design of naval surface ships thus this study proposes a method to optimally arrange bulkheads and rooms considering the major aspects of the performance as a naval surface ship table 1 shows a summary of related studies and a comparison of those studies with this study the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 3 describes the method proposed in this study for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship in section 4 the proposed arrangement method is applied to a bulkhead arrangement and a room arrangement and the results of an actual application are discussed the final section presents the overall results of this study and briefly discusses the remaining work left for future study 3 arrangement design method of a naval surface ship this study proposes a method for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship fig 1 shows the configuration of the proposed method as shown in this figure the proposed method consists mainly of six components the template model stability module operability module survivability module optimization module and user interface the arrangement design requires a data structure that can store arrangement information in this study the template model fig 1 1 is used as the data structure for the arrangement design of the naval surface ship it was hierarchically defined to store various pieces of information related to the bulkheads decks compartments tanks and rooms also the template model is used to interface various information among the other modules fig 1 2 to 5 and the user interface fig 1 6 to evaluate various performance parameters including the stability operability and survivability of the given alternative for the arrangement design the stability module fig 1 2 the operability module fig 1 3 and the survivability module fig 1 4 were developed in addition bending moment was calculated separately these modules give us quantitative values for each performance parameter using a reasonable method and the values are used in the optimization module as objective functions and constraints for the optimization in the field of engineering optimization techniques have gained widespread use to obtain an optimal design according to specific requirements in this study an optimization technique is used to derive the arrangement design of a naval surface ship thus the optimization module fig 1 5 was developed and it includes the mathematical formulation of the optimization problems and an optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problems the user interface is also needed for the designer to easily utilize the components that are mentioned above in this study the user interface fig 1 6 was developed as a tool for the input and output of the arrangement design including a function of 3d visualization 3 1 stability module for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship the stability module is used to assess the stability of a naval surface ship under intact and damaged conditions such assessment can be done by verifying some stability criteria 3 1 1 evaluation of intact stability to verify the criteria for the intact stability a gz righting arm curve and an ha heeling arm curve should be calculated as shown in fig 2 to calculate the gz curve the buoyancy and weight changes should be considered for different heel angles thus if the positions of the bulkheads associated with liquid tanks change the gz curve should be calculated considering the free surface effect of the liquid tanks moore and paulling 2010 with these curves the adherence to the conditions for intact stability can be checked as summarized in table 2 brown and deybach 1998 referring to fig 2 and table 2 the ratio of the righting arm at the intersection of the gz and ha curves gz0 to the maximum righting arm gzmax should be less than 0 6 the ratio between capsizing and restoring energy that is the ratio of area a2 to a1 should be greater than 1 4 finally the equilibrium heel angle ϕ 0 should be less than 15 deg for some severe cases such as lifting heavy weights over the side crowding of crews to one side high speed turning and so on 3 1 2 evaluation of the damage stability the damage stability of a naval surface ship can be roughly checked using a deterministic approach the basis to determine the extent of flooding is the length of damage to the shell at any point along the ship s length resulting from an attack with a weapon or a collision in particular the combatant type naval surface ships of over 90 m in length should meet criteria for adequate subdivision to resist underwater damage sarchin and goldberg 1962 that is they should be capable of withstanding flooding from a shell opening equal to 12 5 of the ship s length longitudinal extent at any point fore and aft the maximum transverse extent is assumed to be that caused by penetrating damage to but not including any center bulkhead and the maximum vertical extent is assumed for all decks to be opened because of the effect of the resulting high flooding free surface and possible unsymmetrical flooding with this assumption for the extent of the damage satisfying the damage stability can be checked with the criteria summarized in table 3 referring to fig 3 and table 3 the equilibrium heel angle ϕ 0 should be less than 15 deg the ratio of area a2 to a1 should be greater than 1 4 and the difference between gzmax and ha at the angle corresponding to gzmax should be greater than 0 075 m the area a1 should be greater than 0 02 m rad finally the margin line should be higher than the waterline in the damaged state republic of korea navy 2014 kim et al 2017a 3 2 operability module for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship the operability can be referred to as the ability to represent the effectiveness of the flow of crews and supplies in the ship in this study the operability was represented with the adjacency index ai that is calculated using the adjacency coefficient q ij and the distance d ij between the compartments i and j as shown in eq 1 kim et al 2017b 1 a i i 1 n c 1 j i 1 n c q i j d i j in eq 1 the symbol n c is the number of compartments 3 2 1 adjacency index between compartments the adjacency coefficient is a constant that quantitatively represents the degree of closeness between compartments and it can be calculated from the affinities and antagonism as shown in eq 2 kim et al 2017b 2 q i j a f f i n i t y i j a n t a g o n i s m i j in eq 2 the affinity is the characteristic that makes it particularly advantageous to locate one compartment close to another specific compartment and it is related to the movement of crews and supplies between compartments a frequent movement of crews and supplies is anticipated between specific compartments then it becomes advantageous to locate these compartments close to each other the antagonism represents the characteristics that preclude a compartment from being separately and safely located near another specific compartment as a consequence the adjacency coefficient between each compartment can be calculated by subtracting the antagonism from the affinity the adjacency coefficients q ij between the compartments can then be determined by a designer and are given as one of the input data for the arrangement design 3 2 2 distance calculation between compartments there are many rooms including passages in the superstructure thus when we calculate the distance d ij between the compartments i e the room i and j the passages between them should also be considered in this study dijkstra s algorithm from graph theory was used to determine an accurate distance lee et al 2003 2005 for example to find the shortest path between compartments 3 and 10 and its distance all possible relationships among compartments 3 10 and the passages can be represented in the adjacency graph as shown in fig 4 b in the adjacency graph of fig 4 b each node represents the compartment 3 and 10 or the passage a b c and d each edge represents the distance between the compartment and horizontal passage or between the horizontal and vertical passages when using dijkstra s algorithm the length of each edge must be calculated to determine the shortest path and its distance between compartments i and j to do this two starting points for the distance calculation called base points should first be defined in this study a centroid center of area of the compartment is used as the base point for the compartment however for the passage it is difficult to define the base point if the centroid of the passage is used as the base point the redundant distances may be included in the resulting distance between the compartments to avoid making this error the base points for the vertical and horizontal passages are defined as follows for the vertical passage b and c the centroid of the passage is used as the base point for the horizontal passage a and d the y and x coordinates of the base point are assumed as the vertical centroid of the horizontal passage for the y coordinate and x f x p 2 for the x coordinate here x f and x p represent the horizontal centroids of the compartment and the vertical passage respectively for example the x coordinate x a1 p of the base point for the horizontal passage a1 is assumed as the horizontal center point between compartment 3 and the vertical passage b the y coordinate y a1 p is assumed as the vertical center point of the horizontal passage a1 as shown in fig 4 a an example defining the base points for the horizontal passages is shown in fig 4 a and the corresponding adjacency graph is shown in fig 4 b 3 3 survivability module for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship according to said 1995 the survivability is defined as the capability of a ship and its onboard systems to avoid and withstand a weapons effects environment without sustaining impairment of their ability to accomplish designated missions the survivability has three components vulnerability susceptibility and recoverability the vulnerability refers to the inability of a ship to withstand damage from one or more attacks its vincibility and to its liability to serious damage or loss when attacked by weapons the susceptibility refers to the inability of a ship to avoid being damaged in the pursuit of its mission and to its probability of being attacked lastly the recoverability refers to the ability of a ship and its crew to prevent loss and restore mission essential functions from an attack due to one or more weapons among these the vulnerability can be improved by adjusting the positions of the bulkheads and decks and the locations of rooms therefore this study handles the vulnerability as a major component that represents the survivability of the ship regarding the arrangement design of a naval surface ship two vulnerability scenarios for the bulkheads in the hull and for rooms in the superstructure are defined and evaluated as follows 3 3 1 bulkhead damage vulnerability if an explosion due to an attack occurs within the compartment of a naval surface ship the pressure of the explosion will act on adjacent bulkheads and decks as shown in fig 5 at this time if the pressure due to the explosion can be minimized we can say that the vulnerability of the ship may be reduced in this sense minimizing all explosion pressure of the bulkheads induced by all explosives may be a criterion to select a better alternative in the arrangement design in terms of the vulnerability thus the bulkhead damage vulnerability v bd can be represented using eq 3 3 v b d i 1 n b d p r i in eq 3 the symbol p r i is the explosion pressure of the ith bulkhead or deck due to an explosive and the symbol n b d is the number of bulkheads and decks in the hull the explosion pressure p r i of the bulkhead or deck due to an explosive can be calculated using eq 4 us department of the army 1990 choi et al 2015 this equation is an empirical fit equation for the reflected pressure according to the distance from the explosive point to the bulkhead or deck 4 p r i 2 p 0 p s n d i γ 1 p s n d i 2 γ 1 p s n d i 2 γ in eq 4 the symbol p 0 is the ambient air pressure in pa 101 300 pa at sea level the symbol p snd is the non dimensional side on overpressure in pa defined as eq 5 and the symbol γ is the specific heat ratio of p 0 and p snd taken as 1 4 5 p s n d i 0 55 r i p 0 e w w 1 3 1 95 in eq 5 the symbol r i is the distance from the center of the explosion to the ith bulkhead or deck in m the symbol e w is the explosive energy per unit mass in m2 s2 and the symbol w is the charge mass of an explosive in kg in eq 4 p r i is a function of the distance of bulkheads or decks from the explosive point therefore to calculate the vulnerability of the ship the positions of explosives corresponding to threats have to be defined the types of threats also have to be selected in this study anti ship missile asms torpedoes and mines were considered as major threats to the ship for each threat the longitudinal damage distribution was assumed by referring to existing studies harmsen and krikke 2000 boulougouris and papanikolaou 2004 we assumed that asms follow a piecewise linear distribution along the ship s length torpedoes follow a normal distribution and mines follow a linear distribution as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the distribution of the asms has its peak point at midship because the midship part has the largest area being detected and the remaining part shows a linear change due to the characteristics of torpedos which target a ship by sensing the noise radiated underwater that is usually generated by an engine and propeller the midpoint of the normal distribution slightly moved to the stern of the ship in the case of mines the probability of damage of the stern is zero and the probability of damage to the bow side behaves linearly as they will explode by the pressure over which the ship passes in this study for all threats the explosive energy per unit mass e w was assumed to be 4 184 109 m2 s2 and the charge mass w of the asms torpedoes and mines was assumed to be 161 kg 300 kg and 113 4 kg respectively by referring to existing studies harmsen and krikke 2000 boulougouris and papanikolaou 2004 3 3 2 room damage vulnerability similarly the concept of the vulnerability can be applied to rooms in the superstructure in this study the room damage vulnerability is defined as a summation of the multiplication of the probability being damaged and the importance factor of each room as shown in eq 6 6 v r d i 1 n r p i e i in eq 6 the symbol p i and e i are the probability of damage and the importance factor of the ith room respectively and the symbol n r is the number of rooms in the superstructure 1 probability of damage of the room a naval ship has a probability of being attacked along her length breadth and depth if a certain room is placed in a certain position of the superstructure the room has its own probability of damage according to its x y and z positions as shown in fig 7 in this study the probability of damage of the ith room is defined as the multiplication of the probability of damage length p dl and the probability of impact p ip as shown in eq 7 przemieniecki 1994 boulougouris and papanikolaou 2004 7 p i p d l i p i p i the probability of the damage length p dl is again defined as eq 8 that is p dl means the fraction of the target e g room that is assumed to have been damaged within a certain radius from the explosive point of an explosive 8 p d l i 0 a i d a m a i 0 a i 1 2 π 1 2 2 1 45222 ln r s s r s k a i exp ln 2 a i r s s r s k 2 1 2 2 1 45222 ln r s s r s k 2 in eq 8 the symbol a i is the longitudinal transverse or vertical distance between the centroid of the ith room and the explosive point which is normalized by the ship s length breadth or depth whichever is lesser r sk is the sure kill radius that is assumed in this study as 0 02l l ship s length and r ss is the sure save radius that is assumed as 0 15l by referring to existing studies boulougouris and papanikolaou 2004 the probability of impact p ip is defined as eq 9 9 p i p i x 1 i a i 2 x 2 i a i 2 imp x x d x y 1 i a i 2 y 2 i a i 2 imp y y d y z 1 i a i 2 z 2 i a i 2 imp z z d z in eq 9 the coordinates x 1 i and x 2 i are the x coordinates aft and forward which are normalized by the ship s length of the ith room respectively the coordinates y 1 i and y 2 i are y coordinates of the port and starboard which are normalized by the ship s breadth of the ith room respectively the coordinates z 1 i and z 2 i are the z coordinates of the bottom and top of the ith room respectively and these are normalized by the ship s depth including the superstructure function imp x x is the impact density function along the longitudinal direction for each threat considering that the asms follow a piecewise linear distribution along the ship s length the torpedoes follow a normal distribution and the mines follow a linear distribution imp x x for each threat are assumed to follow eqs 10 12 10 imp x x 4 x 4 x 4 i f x 0 5 i f x 0 5 for asm 11 imp x x 1 2 π σ exp 1 2 σ 2 x 0 4 2 for torpedoes in eq 11 the symbol σ is standard deviation of normal distribution 12 imp x x 0 8 x 4 i f x 0 5 i f x 0 5 for mines similarly function imp y y is the impact density function along the transverse direction for each threat in this study we assume that this probability for all threats follows parabolic distribution along the ship s breadth as shown in eq 13 13 imp y y 2 y 0 5 2 5 12 for asm torpedoes and mines finally function imp z z is the impact density function along the vertical direction for each threat in this study we assume that this probability for all threats follows a linear distribution along the ship s depth including the superstructure as shown in eqs 14 and 15 14 imp z z 2 for asm 15 imp z z 2 z 2 for torpedoes and mines when calculating the room damage vulnerability the longitudinal damage distribution for each threat was assumed as the same as that of the bulkhead damage vulnerability in fig 6 2 importance factor of the room if a specific room including equipment is damaged such equipment can also have damage in this sense if a room has important equipment the room should be more carefully considered during the arrangement design considering this fact the importance factor e i of each room can be defined by a summation of the multiplication of the importance coefficient and the number of each piece of equipment in the room as shown in eq 16 16 e i k 1 n r i i e i k n e i k in eq 16 the symbol n r i is the number of all pieces of equipment in the ith room the symbols i e k and n e ik are the importance factor between 0 and 1 and the number of the kth equipment in the ith room respectively the importance factor i e ik for all equipment can be determined by a designer and are given as input data for the arrangement design 3 4 optimization module for the arrangement design of a naval surface ship this section describes an optimization method for the arrangement of a naval surface ship as mentioned earlier the arrangement method for the naval surface ship was formulated in two stages in this study the first stage is the bulkhead arrangement where the positions of the bulkheads and decks in the hull are determined by minimizing the maximum bending moment at the intact state the space for liquid tanks and the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to the attack the second stage is the room arrangement where the sequence of rooms and the positions of passages in the superstructure are determined by minimizing the adjacency index between the rooms and the room damage vulnerability due to the attack since the changes of the second stage such as weight distribution are unknown in the first stage the constraints related to stability in the first stage are confirmed again after the optimization of the second stage in other words we check the stability criteria again after two optimization stages whether the derived arrangement is feasible or not the configuration for the optimization procedure is shown in fig 8 for the optimization at each stage the mathematical formulation of the optimization problems is described below 3 4 1 formulation for the bulkhead arrangement the bulkhead arrangement in the hull is carried out in the first stage and several things need to be considered for this regarding the strength combat performance and survivability of a naval surface ship the positions of the bulkheads and decks in the hull are important during the bulkhead arrangement to ensure the structural strength the maximum bending moment at the intact state should be minimized in addition to ensure the combat performance the space for the armament should be maximized that is the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks such as fuel oil tanks fots fresh water tanks fwts water ballast tanks wbts and lubrication oil tanks lots should be minimized finally to ensure a sufficient survivability of the ship the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to an attack should be minimized for these reasons the process for the bulkhead arrangement was formulated as an optimization problem in this study 1 input data when performing a bulkhead arrangement a hull form and compartment model of the naval surface ship is required such information includes the number of bulkheads and decks and the locations of the compartments including the liquid tanks of the ship also the information of the weight and the weight distribution at the loading conditions such as minimum operating condition and full load condition are also needed to assess the stability requirement in this study only two loading conditions that have a high possibility to cause a severe state of a ship were considered here the minimum operating condition means that a ship carries the minimum amount of cargo required for operation and it can cause a severe state in terms of the stability because the draft is relatively low the full load condition means that a ship carries all cargo fully and it can cause a large amount of bending moment of course if we consider more loading conditions the optimal design will be more robust the bending moment and the stability during the optimization of the bulkhead arrangement were considered as the objective function and the constraints respectively to prevent the space for liquid tanks from becoming too small during the optimization the required volume for the liquid tanks fots fwts wbts and lots should also be prepared to evaluate the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to the attack in section 3 3 1 the longitudinal damage distribution the explosive energy per unit mass and the charge mass of the asms torpedoes and mines are required finally the minimum length for each of the engine rooms and the minimum deck height should be input to prevent those values from becoming too small during the optimization these input data for the bulkhead arrangement can be summarized in table 4 2 design variables in this stage the design variables are the positions of the bulkheads and decks in the hull fig 9 and table 5 show the design variables for the optimization of the bulkhead arrangement 3 objective functions as previously mentioned it is very important to ensure the structural strength combat performance and survivability of a ship in the bulkhead arrangement therefore we introduced three objective functions to ensure these are obtained in the first stage of the optimization the first objective function of this stage minimizes the maximum bending moment at the intact state at this time two loading conditions such as the full load condition and minimum operating condition were considered in this study for each loading condition the maximum bending moment can be obtained by calculating the buoyancy curve the weight curve the load curve the shear force curve and the bending moment curve in the longitudinal direction of the ship the bending moment can be obtained from the weight curve and the buoyancy curve of a ship under the given loading condition here the weight curve represents weight distribution of the ship in the longitudinal direction thus if the positions of bulkheads change the weight curve changes the load curve is obtained by summing up two curves if the load curve is integrated along the longitudinal direction the shear force curve can be obtained if the shear force curve is integrated again along the longitudinal direction the bending moment curve can be obtained this objective function is intended to minimize the maximum value of the maximum bending moments for the two loading conditions the second objective function minimizes the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks to maximize the space for the armament the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks can be obtained by summing up all volumes of the liquid tanks including the fots fwts wbts and lots the third objective function minimizes the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to an attack in section 3 3 1 the bulkhead damage vulnerability v bd can be calculated by using eq 3 the objective functions for the optimization of the bulkhead arrangement are then summarized in table 6 4 constraints when arranging the bulkheads and decks in the hull some issues including the stability should be considered thus the following constraints were formulated to consider such aspects a constraints related to the criteria for intact and damage stability as mentioned in section 3 1 a naval surface ship should satisfy the criteria for intact and damage stability the criteria were used as constraints for the optimization in this stage as shown in eqs 17 24 eqs 17 19 are the criteria for the intact stability and eqs 20 24 are the criteria for the damage stability 17 g 1 g z 0 g z max 0 6 0 in the intact state 18 g 2 1 4 a 2 a 1 0 in the intact state 19 g 3 ϕ 0 15 0 in the intact state 20 g 4 ϕ 0 15 0 in the damaged state 21 g 5 1 4 a 2 a 1 0 in the damaged state 22 g 6 0 075 g z max h a 0 in the damaged state 23 g 7 0 02 a 1 0 in the damaged state 24 g 8 d i s t 0 in the damaged state b constraints related to the required volumes for liquid tanks in general the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks may have required a given volume for operation thus there are constraints that bind the upper and lower limits for each liquid tank as shown in eqs 25 32 25 g 9 v f o t min v f o t 0 26 g 10 v f o t v f o t max 0 27 g 11 v f w t min v f w t 0 28 g 12 v f w t v f w t max 0 29 g 13 v w b t min v w b t 0 30 g 14 v w b t v w b t max 0 31 g 15 v l o t min v l o t 0 32 g 16 v l o t v l o t max 0 c constraints related to the required length for the engine rooms if the length of each of the engine rooms should have a minimum length such requirements can be formulated as constraints as shown in eqs 33 34 33 g 17 l e r min x 5 x 6 0 34 g 18 l e r min x 7 x 8 0 in eqs 33 34 the values x 5 x 6 and x 7 x 8 are the length of each of the engine rooms as shown in fig 9 d constraints related to the required deck height if the height between the adjacent decks should have the minimum distance such requirements can be formulated as constraints as shown in eqs 35 39 35 g 19 h d e c k min z 1 0 0 36 g 20 h d e c k min z 2 z 1 0 37 g 21 h d e c k min z 3 z 2 0 38 g 22 h d e c k min z 4 z 3 0 39 g 23 h d e c k min d z 4 0 in eq 39 the symbol d is the depth of the ship thus the optimization problem for the bulkhead arrangement has n b d 18 in fig 9 design variables 3 objective functions and 23 inequality constraints this problem is a kind of multi objective constrained optimization problem 3 4 2 formulation for the room arrangement next the room arrangement in the superstructure is carried out in the second stage and several things need to be considered as in the first stage regarding the operability and survivability of a naval surface ship the sequence of rooms and the positions of the passages in the superstructure are important during the room arrangement to ensure the operability the adjacency index that represents the effectiveness of the flow of crews and supplies in the ship should be minimized also to ensure a sufficient survivability of the ship the room damage vulnerability due to the attack should be minimized for these reasons the process for the room arrangement was formulated as an optimization problem in this study 1 input data when performing a room arrangement a hull form and a compartment model of the naval surface ship are required as in the bulkhead arrangement such information includes a number of bulkheads and decks in addition the number of rooms the number of passages of each deck and the locations of the entrance doors and inclined ladders in the superstructure should also be given and the positions of the bulkheads and the decks in the hull that were obtained from the first stage are used as one of input data in this stage the locations of entrance doors of rooms and the locations of inclined ladders play a very important role in determining the distance d ij in eq 1 therefore this study reflected them and when calculating the distance between each room we defined the distance d ij so that it can only move through entrance doors and inclined ladders the locations of entrance doors and inclined ladders used as input information in this study are shown in fig 11 the locations of entrance doors and inclined ladders are not included in the design variables but since the locations are dependent on the bulkheads and the passages they are changed following the related bulkheads and passages during the optimization process in the future we will include them as design variables of the optimization problem to evaluate the operability of the ship the adjacency coefficients between rooms is needed to evaluate the room damage vulnerability due to the attack in section 3 3 2 the longitudinal damage distribution of all threats the number of all equipment in the rooms and the importance factor and the number of each equipment in the rooms should also be given the minimum area for each room should be input to prevent its value from becoming too small during the optimization finally the number and the required locations of the specific rooms e g engine room bridge etc should be defined these input data for the room arrangement are summarized in table 7 2 design variables in this stage the design variables are the sequence of rooms and positions of passages in the superstructure fig 10 and table 8 show the design variables for the optimization of the room arrangement in this figure the number in the square bracket means the region id where each room is to be allocated thus r 1 or1 r 2 so1 r 3 or2 r 4 so2 r 5 so3 r 33 cr10 that is the location of each room can be represented as an array of the room id e g or1 cr1 etc through an encoding process in a genetic algorithm ga and after optimization the array can be converted into the room arrangement through the decoding process 3 objective functions as previously mentioned it is very important to ensure the operability and sufficient survivability of the ship in the room arrangement in the superstructure therefore we introduced two objective functions to ensure these are obtained in the second stage of the optimization the first objective function of this stage minimizes the adjacency index ai in eq 1 between the rooms for this the distance d ij between the rooms should be calculated by using the method in section 3 2 2 the second objective function minimizes the room damage vulnerability due to an attack in section 3 3 2 the room damage vulnerability v rd can be calculated by using eq 6 the objective functions for the optimization of the room arrangement are summarized in table 9 4 constraints when arranging the rooms and passages in the superstructure some issues should be considered including the ship owner s requirements thus the following constraints were formulated to consider such aspects a constraints related to the required area for rooms if the area of each room should have the minimum area according to the ship owner s requirements such requirements can be formulated as constraints as shown in eq 40 40 g i a i min a i 0 i 1 n r b constraints related to the required locations of the specific rooms if specific rooms such as the engine room er1 er2 bridge br and heli cargo hc should have fixed locations such requirements can be formulated as constraints as shown in eq 41 41 g n r i r i r i req 0 i 1 n r f l thus the optimization problem for the room arrangement has n r 33 12 45 in fig 10 design variables 2 objective functions and n r n rfl 33 4 37 constraints this problem is also a kind of multi objective constrained optimization problem 3 4 3 optimization algorithm optimization algorithms are divided into global and local optimization algorithms and several types of algorithms are available for global optimization including ga goldberg 1989 davis 1991 global optimization algorithms may be suitable for large scale problems that have many local optima but they require more iterations to obtain an acceptable optimum in comparison with local optimization algorithms several classes of local optimization algorithms also exist including sequential linear programming slp arora 2012 sequential quadratic programming sqp arora 2012 and a method for feasible directions mfd vanderplaats 1984 each of these local optimization algorithms can be used to effectively find the optimum however in some cases these local optimization algorithms find an optimum that is relatively close to the starting point in addition the objective functions and constraints presented in this study include nonlinear equations which are difficult to be solved with general optimization algorithms also since the permutation is used in the second stage as design variables the algorithm which can handle the permutation should be used in this study nsga ii deb et al 2002 which is a kind of multiobjective ga was used to solve multi objective nonlinear optimization problems of this study of course spea ii zitzler et al 2001 and smpso nebro et al 2009 can be used through comparative tests among them by us nsga ii that had shown the best performance was finally selected and used to solve the optimization problems of this study 4 application of the proposed method for the naval surface ship 4 1 prototype program a prototype program was developed using the proposed method in the c programing language and it consists of the template model stability module operability module survivability module optimization module and user interface as shown in fig 1 fig 12 shows the components and the screenshot of the prototype program to verify the applicability of the proposed method and the prototype program they were applied to an example of the arrangement design of the naval surface ship 4 2 description of an example as mentioned earlier the proposed method focuses on the arrangement design of the naval surface ship the bulkhead arrangement was optimized in the first stage of optimization and in the second stage the room arrangement was optimized a 7000 ton class missile destroyer was selected as an example in this study the length breadth and draft of the ship are 154 m 20 m and 9 4 m respectively the bulkhead arrangement in the hull including tanks is shown in fig 9 and the room arrangement in the superstructure is shown in fig 10 in this study we optimized the arrangement of 14 bulkheads and 4 decks during the first stage after optimizing the bulkhead arrangement we have optimized the arrangement of 33 rooms and 12 passages and we then present each result of the arrangement more details of the input data are summarized in table 10 table 11 shows the adjacency coefficients q ij between the rooms of the example 4 3 optimization of the bulkhead arrangement the arrangement of the 14 bulkheads and 4 decks was optimized in the first stage as mentioned earlier in this stage the positions of the bulkheads and the decks were optimized to minimize the maximum bending moment at the intact state to minimize the auxiliary space for liquid tanks and to minimize the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to the attack as mentioned in section 3 4 1 three objective functions were used to optimize the bulkhead arrangement therefore three dimensional pareto optimal set can be obtained as a result of optimization in this section we compared the initial design and two optimal designs as the first optimal design the design alternative with a large influence of damage vulnerability which is an important factor in the bulkhead arrangement was selected as the second optimal design the design alternative evenly considering all the effects of the objective functions was selected through the normalization of three objective functions table 12 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the bulkhead arrangement between the initial design and the first optimal design large influence of damage vulnerability in the case of the initial design the values of the objective functions were calculated to be the same as the optimal design that is they were calculated according to the formulation mentioned in section 3 4 1 as shown in table 12 the maximum bending moment in the intact state decreased from 362 261 kn m initial design to 321 860 kn m first optimal design by 11 1 also the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks decreased from 4390 m3 initial design to 3823 m3 first optimal design by 12 9 the bulkhead damage vulnerability improved significantly from 13 81 gpa initial design to 6 89 gpa first optimal design by 50 1 further comparisons between the initial design and the first optimal design for the bulkhead arrangement are shown in table 13 and fig 13 the bulkhead damage vulnerability depends on the summation of the explosion pressures p r i of the bulkheads and decks due to explosives such as asms torpedoes and mines as shown in eq 3 from eqs 4 and 5 we can see that the explosion pressure of the bulkhead or deck is inversely proportional to its distance from the explosion point meanwhile the distribution of the explosion points by the asms and torpedoes has its peak point near the midship as shown in fig 6 the distribution by the mines has its peak point near fore body therefore to minimize the bulkhead damage vulnerability the distances between the bulkheads near the midship and fore body were changed during the optimization that is in the case of the midship the distances between x 6 and x 7 and between x 8 and x 9 increased as a result the distances between x 5 and x 6 1st engine room and between x 7 and x 8 2nd engine room decreased in the case of the fore body the distance between x 11 and x 12 increased however the distance between x 10 and x 11 decreased table 14 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the bulkhead arrangement between the initial design and the second optimal design even influence of three objective functions as shown in table 14 the maximum bending moment in the intact state decreased from 362 261 kn m initial design to 315 058 kn m second optimal design by 13 0 also the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks decreased from 4390 m3 initial design to 3813 m3 second optimal design by 13 1 the bulkhead damage vulnerability improved from 13 81 gpa initial design to 11 61 gpa second optimal design by 15 9 further comparisons between the initial design and the second optimal design for the bulkhead arrangement are shown in table 15 and fig 14 in the second optimal design the distances between the bulkheads near the midship were narrowed as compared with the initial design as shown in fig 14 they caused the reduction of the capacity of liquid tanks as a result the weight of the midship was reduced and the bending moment was reduced accordingly we can see that the maximum bending moment at the intact state and the auxiliary space for liquid tanks of the second optimal design are slightly better than those of the first optimal design as shown in tables 12 and 14 that is the improvement of them were not so much as compared with the improvement of the bulkhead damage vulnerability of the first optimal design this is because the bulkhead damage vulnerability is very sensitive to the positions of the bulkheads in practice the bulkheads should be located at the frames of the ship to take into account manufacturability to reflect this the post processing process was done to move the bulkheads of the optimal designs to the adjacent frames the frame spacing of the naval surface ship used in this example is assumed to be 0 5 m thus this process means moving the optimal positions of the bulkheads to the nearest frame of 0 5 m spacing this process was applied to the second optimal design and the results without and with this process were compared table 16 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the bulkhead arrangement between the second optimal designs without and with post processing as shown in table 16 the maximum bending moment in the intact state increased from 315 508 kn m without post processing to 330 857 kn m with post processing by 5 0 also the auxiliary space for the liquid tanks increased from 3813 m3 without post processing to 3824 m3 with post processing by 0 3 the bulkhead damage vulnerability deteriorated from 11 61 gpa without post processing to 12 85 gpa with post processing by 10 7 further comparisons between the second optimal designs without and with post processing for the bulkhead arrangement are shown in table 17 as a result of comparing the objective functions of the two design the maximum bending moment at the intact state and the auxiliary space for liquid tanks showed a similar or slight increase however as described above the bulkhead damage vulnerability due to the attack was very sensitive to the positions of the bulkheads so that the amount of increase was greater than the others if we take some disadvantage in the objective functions we can enhance manufacturability at the same time therefore the post processing process is necessary for practical design 4 4 optimization of the room arrangement next the arrangement of 33 rooms and 12 passages was optimized in the second stage in this stage the sequence of rooms and the positions of the passages were optimized to minimize the adjacency index between the rooms and to minimize the room damage vulnerability due to the attack as mentioned in section 3 4 2 two objective functions were used to optimize the room arrangement therefore two dimensional pareto optimal set can be obtained as a result of optimization in this section we compared the initial design and two optimal designs as the first optimal design the design alternative with a large influence of adjacency index which is an important factor in the room arrangement was selected as the second optimal design the design alternative evenly considering all the effects of the objective functions was selected through the normalization of two objective functions table 18 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the room arrangement between the initial design and the first optimal design large influence of adjacency index when performing the optimization the adjacency information for the room arrangement was extracted through a consultation with experts of naval surface ships in the case of the initial design the values of objective functions were calculated to be the same as the optimal design that is they were calculated according to the formulation mentioned in section 3 4 2 as shown in table 18 the adjacency index of the optimal design decreased from 21 976 initial design to 16 359 first optimal design by 25 6 and the room damage vulnerability improved slightly from 0 134 initial design to 0 127 first optimal design by 5 2 more comparisons between the initial design and the first optimal design for the room arrangement are shown in table 19 and fig 15 according to the adjacency coefficients between rooms in table 11 the galley ga and the crew rooms cr1 cr10 the commander room cor and the command control room cc the executive office room xo and the cc and the xo and the cor have a high value 3 of the adjacency coefficient between them the ga and the er the cor and the er and the xo and the er have a low value 2 of the adjacency coefficient between them to minimize the adjacency index the rooms with a high value of the adjacency coefficient should be arranged close to each other and the rooms with a low value should be arranged apart from each other in fig 15 we can see that the optimal design satisfied these requirements well relative to the initial design the room damage vulnerability depends on the summation of the multiplication of the probability of damage p i due to explosives and the importance factor e i of rooms as shown in eq 6 the probability of damage of the rooms is proportional to the multiplication of the probability of damage length p dl and the probability of impact p ip as shown in eq 7 to minimize the room damage vulnerability the rooms e g command control room equipment storages with a high importance factor should be arranged apart from the explosive points as far as possible since most of the explosive points are located at midship and at the fore body such rooms should be arranged away from the points as shown in fig 15 in the case of the initial design some of the equipment storage eq2 and eq3 is located midship however we can see that such rooms were arranged aft and forward in the optimal design in addition the cc was also located in the fore body but after optimization we can see that it moved to after body as a result the room damage vulnerability of the optimal design was lower than that of the initial design table 20 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the room arrangement between the initial design and the second optimal design even influence of two objective functions as shown in table 20 the adjacency index decreased from 21 976 initial design to 18 435 second optimal design by 16 1 and the room damage vulnerability improved slightly from 0 134 initial design to 0 114 second optimal design by 14 9 unlike the previous results it can be seen that the two objective functions were improved at a similar rate more comparisons between the initial design and the optimal design for the room arrangement are shown in table 21 and fig 16 in the second optimal design the equipment storage eq4 moved to the after body as shown in fig 16 we can see that the vulnerability of the second optimal design is slightly better than that of the first optimal design this is because explosive points are concentrated relatively in the midship and the fore body if we look closely at the optimization results some parts of the optimal design would be quickly challenged by an experienced designer for example it is hard to believe that anyone would place crew rooms on the o 2 deck just after of the bridge this is a serious work area of the ship not a rest and recreation area the crew wants to be away from officers and close to the mess decks when off duty further it appears that the area of the command control room cc has been shrunk and personnel access distance from the bridge to the cc has been more than doubled by the optimization process to reflect these considerations we adjusted several adjacency coefficients for calculating the adjacency index the adjacency coefficient between the bridge br and the commander room cor was adjusted to 3 to make it easier for the captain to access the bridge similar reason the adjacency coefficient between the br and the executive officer room xo was adjusted to a high value 3 and other adjacency coefficients was adjusted so that crews and officers could be away from the operational area during off duty that is the adjacency coefficient between the cc and the crew room cr the cc and officer room or the br and the cr and the br and the or were adjusted to a low value 2 in addition constraints were added so that the cr would not be located at o 2 deck as similar with eqs 35 39 table 22 shows a comparison of the objective function values for the room arrangement between the second optimal designs without and with adjustment of adjacency coefficients and constraints as shown in table 22 the adjacency index increased from 18 435 without adjustment to 19 595 with adjustment by 6 3 and the room damage vulnerability slightly deteriorated from 0 113 without adjustment to 0 124 with adjustment by 9 7 by changing the adjacency coefficients and constraints we can see that both objective function values were worse than the second optimal design more comparisons between the second optimal designs without and with adjustment for the room arrangement are shown in fig 17 due to the change of adjacency coefficients and constraints the distances between the cor and the cc the br and the cc and the br and the xo were closer the cor and the xo moved to the upper deck of the fore body in addition all of the cr were placed on the main deck so that the optimal design similar to an actual naval surface ship was obtained 5 conclusion and future studies this study proposed an arrangement method for a naval surface ship in the preliminary design stage it is not easy to consider all requirements for the performance parameters of the ship including the stability operability and survivability in a short period of time an optimization technique was introduced here to effectively solve such problem first a template model is defined as the data structure to represent the arrangement information of the ship second methods were studied to quantitatively evaluate the stability operability and survivability of the ship by referring existing studies third two stage optimization problems for the arrangement design were mathematically formulated with the selection of the design variables objective functions and constraints finally a user interface was developed to input the given data and to output the optimization results for the arrangement design to check the applicability of the proposed method a prototype program based on the proposed method was developed and then the method was applied to an example of a 7000 ton class missile destroyer the results show that the method could yield a better alternative for the arrangement design in terms of the objective functions that were selected for the optimization in the future a mathematical formulation of the optimization module will be further refined to obtain a more realistic arrangement design also the survivability module will be improved to consider various aspects of the survivability besides the vulnerability further considerations of the interface between the hull and the superstructure of the ship will be made for the optimization process in the future to increase the applicability of the proposed method it will be applied to various types of naval surface ships acknowledgments this study was partially

23584,unmanned merchant vessels prototypes are expected to come into operation within a few years this revolutionary shift in the shipping industry is feared to negatively impact the safety of maritime transportation therefore in order to support future designers of remotely operated merchant vessels system we applied system theoretic process analysis stpa identifying the most likely safety control structure of the analysed system and investigating it the aim was to suggest potential ways of increasing the system s safety and to assess the effectiveness of such measures results indicate that the implementation of remotely controlled merchant vessels and in a wider sense unmanned ships and ensuring their safety shall consist of executing various controls on regulatory organisational and technical plains potential effectiveness is evaluated and some recommendations are given on how to ensure the safety of such systems keywords unmanned vessels remote operation stamp stpa safety of transportation 1 introduction as unmanned technologies development gains momentum in various domains it is postulated that similar can also be achieved in marine transportation herein ships could be operated remotely from a shore control centre or even proceed autonomously supporters of such a shift argue that it would reduce shipping costs environmental impact and threats to humans working for the industry porathe 2016 while some more sceptical authors are of the opinion that the safety of maritime transportation can be negatively affected wróbel et al 2017 it is therefore of utmost importance to ensure that such vessels at least do not reduce the level of safety burmeister et al 2014b besides technical considerations and social controversies bitner et al 2014 safety became the most important issue to resolve numerous research projects reports or scientific papers have recently been published in the field initially only some basic ideas have been developed and refined iijima and hayashi 1991 rødseth et al 2013 rødseth and burmeister 2012 jalonen et al 2017 then the concept was developed and some safety issues have been addressed including those pertaining to unmanned ships navigation johansen and perez 2016 theunissen 2014 and remote control man et al 2015 porathe et al 2014 wahlström et al 2015 as safety of unmanned navigation remained in focus there were attempts to utilise experience gained in other domains wahlström et al 2015 in order to assess it finally there were numerous attempts of identifying and quantifying hazards present in this field burmeister et al 2014b heikkilä et al 2017 hogg and ghosh 2016 kretschmann et al 2015a 2015b rødseth and burmeister 2015a rødseth and tjora 2014a wróbel et al 2016 jalonen et al 2017 security issues were considered as part of feasibility and safety analysis and were also addressed separately dobryakova et al 2015 the conclusion of the above is that in general there is a potential within unmanned vessels technology to improve safety of transportation kretschmann et al 2015a but more data is required and some issues still require addressing in order to reduce the uncertainties burmeister et al 2014b wróbel et al 2017 nevertheless a reliability and probability based approach to safety analysis as applied in afore mentioned research is neither exhaustive nor free of significant drawbacks such analyses can only be performed for systems reliability structure of which is known for remotely controlled vessels their concepts of design are still being developed and the final structure of the system remains uncertain therefore it is impractical to assess their safety in its reliability based form leveson 2011 furthermore a great deal of systems understanding and safety improvements originates from knowledge gained during actual operations or even through accidents investigations mazaheri et al 2015 stoop and dekker 2012 since no quantitative or qualitative data is available here this approach cannot be applied above considerations suggest that a different method of analysing the safety of remotely controlled ships shall be applied system theoretic process analysis stpa a relatively new method of including safety in system s design has recently emerged leveson 2011 2002 rooted in system theoretic accident model and process stamp it has been applied in some innovative domains owens et al 2008 including maritime sector abrecht 2016 aps et al 2015 kwon 2016 it is said to better encompass and help mitigate some hazards that are specific to modern highly automated and complex systems altabbakh et al 2014 bjerga et al 2016 however a safety analysis based on a systemic approach has not been applied to remotely controlled shipping systems to date a gap this paper is intended to bridge therefore we apply stpa to assess the safety of a remotely controlled generic merchant vessel and provide future designers of such systems with advice pertaining to which of its parts are likely to fail and how furthermore we suggest some measures to mitigate hazards and qualitatively assess their potential effectiveness by applying a mitigation potential analysis the paper consists of four sections the introduction and conclusions firstly the description of anticipated unmanned ships systems layout is given together with general assumptions and some considerations regarding its impact on safety secondly the method of safety analysis is introduced namely system theoretic process analysis stpa it is followed by section 3 describing the results of the study which are then discussed in section 4 together with brief assessment and communication of uncertainties last but not least conclusions are drawn 2 remotely operated vessels proof of concept this section introduces general considerations pertaining to unmanned ship and their safety the reduction of merchant ships crews progressed for some time already with some of the vessels becoming technically and legally acceptable to be operated by crews of eight or even less this was an effect of implementing new technologies mainly in the engine department bertram 2002 it is postulated that further progress in this field can lead to a complete elimination of the necessity to employ any crewmembers on board most operational requirements as specified in international conventions are in the form of functions to be performed with only few of the rules specifically requiring that those functions shall be performed by on board crew members aawa 2016 imo 2011 it is anticipated that the overall design of such unmanned ships shall be significantly different to those operated nowadays in many aspects including hull design and propulsion arrangement grøtli et al 2015 however the greatest and the most important difference will be that all of her subsystems will be to a large extent controlled either remotely or in an autonomous mode the ship would traverse an open sea in ballast or laden condition with no crew present on board the system s basic functions will be performed automatically without involving human operators who would be stationed in a so called shore based control centre and capable of remotely supervising the vessel or taking over its control using a dedicated satellite communication link this would be possible whenever the ship encounters a situation that for any reason cannot be handled by the automated control system or whenever deemed necessary by that the vessels are anticipated to follow an adjustable autonomy scheme depending on the condition of the ship herself and the mission being executed particular levels of autonomy in the maritime industry have been published by lloyd s register of shipping lr 2016 and are presented in table 1 below upon approaching the port of destination a berthing or conning crew might be required to board the ship by launch boat or helicopter in order to bring her to the berth burmeister et al 2014b an arrangement similar to this of maritime pilots boarding ocean going vessels nowadays since port manoeuvres are the most demanding part of passage ahmed and hasegawa 2013 coastal states might be unwilling to allow unmanned vessels to operate in their inland waters hooydonk 2014 rødseth and burmeister 2015a rødseth and tjora 2014a 2014b van den boogaard et al 2016 due to the uncertainty concerning their safety and security performance at least in the initial phases of such vessels implementation such a concept means that the system must be capable of operating in multiple autonomy modes ranging from al 0 to al 5 and switching between them without reducing system s overall safety performance in this paper we focus on the remote control mode which corresponds to autonomy level 3 here an operator located on shore will have an overall command over a handful of vessels traversing different seas porathe et al 2014 s he will oversee decision making supervision and trouble shooting thus simultaneously performing tasks that today require many crewmembers expertise decision support tools can be of some help in this however as soon as a situation develops in a particularly difficult direction an assistance of full bridge team is said to be available in order to better deal with the problem kretschmann et al 2015a still such a team will be located in a shore based control centre some distance away from the vessel which can potentially create further issues just to mention communication link unreliability flawed situation awareness and an inability to manually operate equipment ahvenjärvi 2016 porathe et al 2014 the level of operator s involvement can be adjusted as required such an approach will require an extensive redesign of the ships in order to accommodate numerous sensors or prolonged maintenance free periods rødseth and burmeister 2015b the fact that a vessel is controlled remotely will affect virtually all aspects of her operation including navigation power generation fuel management cargo conditioning and fire safety all those are mutually related krata et al 2016 krata and szlapczynska 2018 krata and wawrzynski 2017 and thus a systemic approach is required to fully apprehend the effect of implementing a remote control into merchant vessels operation on maritime safety 3 methods the majority of risk assessment methods currently in use are based on the assumption that accidents are caused by particular safety critical components not being able to serve their purpose salmon et al 2012 this belief in reliability theory s significance contributed to safety analysts and accident investigators refraining from analysing concealed causes of accidents leveson 2011 those may be of non technical nature and belong to organisational or sociological domains willey 2014 as such they have often been neglected for the reason that it is difficult to quantify human behaviour and reliability of human operator montewka et al 2017 or supervisor for instance therefore in this section a different method of safety assessment is presented as given in leveson 2011 3 1 system theoretic approach a systemic insight has been proposed so as to address the safety issue on higher organisational levels including operational practices and management policies ensuring that hazards are controlled in each point of the system s structure kee et al 2017 leveson 2011 salmon et al 2015 in this approach referred to as system theoretic accident model and process stamp it is inadequate interactions between a system s components that lead to accidents the nature of such interactions shall ensure that the system as a whole remains within safety limits kazaras et al 2014 as a consequence of the above violation of these defined safety constraints leads to the emergence of a hazard a system state or set of conditions that together with a particular set of worst case conditions will lead to an accident a system s states that could lead to safety constraint violation are inspected and ways of mitigating such violation sought it is recommended to refrain from calculating probabilities of system transitioning to an unsafe state bjerga et al 2016 due to a lack of empirical data particularly in initial phases of system development a stamp based approach also takes into consideration one more aspect that can potentially prove vital when addressing the safety of a highly innovative system of a remotely controlled ship nowadays systems composed of thousands of technologically advanced components are run by relatively small crews who are often physically separated from the system for cost effectiveness or safety reasons for instance such crews must have a perfect understanding a mental model and perception of the system s status and related automation with the shift from a manual to remote control people reportedly became less familiar with the systems under their supervision norman 1989 another important factor is that the majority of processes are conducted automatically leaving humans with merely supervisory functions and requiring them to step in as soon as the automation cannot control the system any longer leveson 2011 utilising remote control may contribute to a limited perception of the actual state of the controlled process boredom loss of focus skill degradation and loss of situational awareness porathe et al 2014 wahlström et al 2015 in case any unusual event occurs it is essential that operator s mental model of the process reflects its actual condition such a case was relatively simple to achieve when operators controlled the machinery from local stations and could confirm systems components condition visually aurally or even olfactory with progressing separation of workers from physical components the potential of mental model s accuracy degradation grew the reasons for that could be various just to mention possible inconsistencies between system s initial design and actual layout improper management of change or inadequate insufficient training moreover as a tendency to introduce more automation into systems progressed another factor leading to an increased likelihood of unwelcome events surfaced a human operator s mental model of the automation itself in old fashioned systems confirmation of an actuator s operation was in many cases appearing almost instantly as a system s condition change could be observed locally in remote control s case this is much more complicated here operators decisions are enforced by actuators and progress is monitored by sensors this means in short that firstly the operator must make proper decision based on information fed and their own mental model of the system then such decision must be translated by software into actuators command and thus relayed to the latter next relevant actuators must enforce operator s decision in a proper way progress of such action must be monitored by sensors and their readings transmitted to the operator who must check if they match his initial intentions basically things can go wrong in each of these steps and proper measures shall be taken to prevent it from happening herein in a process of safety guided design leveson 2011 safety ii paradigm can be invoked focusing on making entire socio technical systems capable of succeeding under expected and unexpected conditions alike hollnagel 2014 in order to achieve this safety is to be embedded in the design from the very beginning of system s existence in which stamp and related methods can assist altabbakh et al 2014 as they are said to be more effective safety management tools than previously applied methods kazaras et al 2014 in relation to unmanned merchant vessels as an emergent technology such an approach creates the opportunity for both performing proactive safety assessment as well as assessing feasibility of system theoretic approach in this aspect the latter could be accomplished not sooner than some period after remotely controlled vessels implementation therefore we apply the system theoretic process analysis stpa a tool rooted in stamp with the intention to accumulate information about how the safety constraints can be violated and how to prevent such violations in order to evaluate measures of increasing safety we apply mitigation potential analysis as described in section 2 3 3 2 stpa although the stpa can be used at any stage of the system life cycle leveson 2011 this study s goal is to apply it to a system which is still at a concept phase namely a remotely controlled merchant ship the aim of stpa based safety analysis is to determine how the behavioural safety constraints which are derived from system hazards can be violated and how to prevent such violations the ultimate goal is to identify scenarios leading to identified hazards and thus to losses so they can be either mitigated or controlled without involving unnecessary costs firstly an identification of the potential for inadequate control of the system that could lead to a hazardous state is conducted those can result from inadequate control or enforcement of the safety constraints which in turn can occur because a a control action required for safety is not provided or not followed b an unsafe control action is provided c a potentially safe control action is provided at the wrong time or in the wrong sequence d a control action required for safety is stopped too soon or applied too long secondly it is determined on how each potentially hazardous control action identified in first step could occur this can consist of examination of the control loop in order to see what could cause it furthermore control and mitigation measures can be suggested for multiple controllers of the same component or safety constraint identification of conflicts and potential coordination problems should be carried out this step can be augmented by a consideration on how the designed controls could degrade over time and building in protection against it including management of change procedures performance audits or accident and incident analysis for instance in the case of remotely controlled merchant vessels ensuring the reliable and precise communication between the ship and control centre will be one of the most vital functions of the system such interaction between two of the system s components is referred to as a control function and can be inadequate in one or more ways as listed above these ways are analysed further with respect to potential causes and consequences of such inadequacy it is postulated that most the cost effective and efficient way of designing for safety in case of extremely complex systems is to carry out safety assessment in parallel with engineering the system itself leveson 2011 in this model design decisions are analysed by safety analysts and feedback is given to improve the safety of the system in an iterative process however it cannot be done here since it remains unclear whether the generic unmanned ship is in fact to be designed and come into operation in the foreseeable future therefore this study focuses on an as accurate as possible assessment of ship s safety features basing on available information in hope to provide future system designers with reliable evaluation and suggestions pertaining to how the system should in fact be designed in order to perform such analysis the stpa was supported by a mitigation potential analysis 3 3 mitigation potential analysis for the reason of the unavailability of data required for traditional safety assessment a hazard mitigation potential has been chosen as a surrogate for a likelihood an element of traditionally understood risk dulac and leveson 2009 reasons for its use include the potential for eliminating or controlling the hazard in the design or operations has a direct and important impact on the likelihood of the hazard occurrence mitigatibility of the hazard can be determined before the system s architecture or design is selected mitigation potential scale is used as listed below and presented in fig 1 1 reduction of damage if an accident does occur 2 reduction of the likelihood that the hazard results in an accident 3 reduction of the likelihood that the hazard will occur 4 complete elimination of the hazard from design a design process will involve safety driven optimization of a system aiming in the reduction of an accident s likelihood thereby it can be understood as searching for and implementing hazard control measures having higher mitigation potential assigned those with the greatest mitigation potential are viewed as being more efficient and cost effective when it comes to accident prevention and in a worst case scenario damage reduction safety control structure is studied and ways of mitigating control functions inadequacy are sought and assigned the mitigation potential value for example elimination of a necessity for communication link s existence could be assigned a higher value of mitigation potential than implementing algorithms to ensure a correctness of data transferred in our study we assigned the mitigation potential to each of the potentially inadequate control functions occurrence mitigating measures rather than to the hazards themselves as a result we quantified the potential of unsafe control function leading to the hazard instead of hazard leading to an accident this was done because of a low detail level of our model 3 4 creating a safety control structure in order to perform the stpa and mitigation potential analysis a safety control structure was first developed as given in fig 2 this was achieved by reviewing the available literature pertaining to remotely controlled vessels see for instance aawa 2016 ahvenjärvi 2016 burmeister et al 2014b kretschmann et al 2015a man et al 2015 2014 porathe 2016 rødseth and brage 2014 rødseth and burmeister 2015a rødseth and lee 2015 wróbel et al 2016 and brainstorm based workshop the latter involved experts engaged in the design of an unmanned river crossing ferry whose knowledge was elicited similarly a list of hazards and safety constraints was created in order to systematize knowledge regarding the safety of a remotely controlled generic merchant vessel by generic we mean a ship that is designed and operated for transporting cargo between ports to be more specific such an unmanned vessel is expected to traverse oceans in an autonomous mode al 5 and enter ports as done nowadays which is with full complement of crew on board al 0 or al 1 burmeister et al 2014a we focused on what is in between the navigation in high traffic density areas or otherwise demanding or non standard conditions such conditions shall be defined in order to provide the system with a procedure of safe and smooth transition from al 5 autonomy to al 3 remote control a call for operator s assistance in other words nevertheless such generic ship is defined as not having any special requirements pertaining to cargo stowage bulk carriers general cargo or container vessels can serve as a good example although they can be technologically advanced their cargo conditioning equipment and technology as well as safety features are far simpler than those of tankers or passenger vessels for instance after the safety control structure as well as hazards and constraints list had been created we performed the stpa each of the control functions was investigated in order to identify potential consequences and causes of it being inadequate then we sought mitigation measures that might reduce the potential of such inadequacy such measures were assigned the mitigation potential results of the above are presented in section 3 as well as in appendices 4 results this section presents the list of hazards and safety constraints as well as high level safety control structure and its description 4 1 safety control structure the remotely controlled vessel s system level decisions are made by an operator on shore data fed by various sensors is used to provide the operator with an artificial situation awareness the sensors can be either environmental or internal while the former will pertain to the navigational situation around the vessel and will include global navigation satellite systems gnss receivers radars cameras echosounders etc burmeister et al 2014b kretschmann et al 2015a the latter will monitor the vessel s interior just to mention its stability condition or machinery status krata and wawrzynski 2017 wawrzyński and krata 2016a 2016b the issue of disagreement between particular sensors indications could be resolved by data fusion algorithms filipowicz and neumann 2008 which would require at least some of the sensors to be doubled or tripled the data should be as accurate as possible to allow an operator to make proper decisions in ample time and keep all the parameters within the limits such decisions will be executed by actuators to control ship s movements as well as other processes ballast water management cargo conditioning and fire safety monitoring can be listed here but virtually all parameters of the vessel s performance should be controllable to a certain degree such a degree will depend on the vessel s technical condition her mission status or the complexity of navigation situation ensuring proper functioning of those auxiliary systems will be required to provide the vessel s main function carriage of commodities between ports to which the propulsion is vital here the use of azimuthal thrusters or similar devices can be nominated as candidates for providing the vessel with propulsion as these appliances can both create thrust and direct it in a desired way another advantage of using them instead of traditional shaft propeller and rudder is the potential for providing the redundancy when two or more devices are installed nevertheless since this issue is yet to be resolved by actual designers of the vessel in our analysis we keep using expressions of engine or rudder to describe the propulsion and steering subsystem in general no matter the actual design these appliances will be used to control what is here referred to as navigation meaning vessel s course and speed some shipboard processes shall be controlled automatically by the on board control subsystem but an overriding authority should be with the operator one of the reasons behind such arrangement is that a fail safe mechanism shall be provided in case the operator s decisions cannot be relayed to the vessel and she shall proceed on her own for some time hogg and ghosh 2016 an operator s primary objective will be to ensure that the vessel is following the pre planned route in a safe and efficient manner it shall be at the operator s discretion to amend the passage plan if required for the purpose of collision avoidance or any other similarly in order to achieve it the operator shall be in possession of up to date model of the environment charts nautical publications mental model of the ship and all of its controllers are also of a great importance additional data for example regarding expected traffic or weather conditions could be obtained from external sources in order to extend the operator s perception of the situation around the vessel under control at least in the initial phases of system implementation the experience of seafarers in handling demanding situations will need to be exploited together with their ability of maintaining situation awareness ahvenjärvi 2016 bertram 2002 seafarers particularly master mariners or chief engineers with additional training in remote control appear to be suitable candidates for the position of shore based operators hogg and ghosh 2016 the operator s role will therefore be similar to that of today s vessels crews except for the fact that s he will need to achieve it from some distance by use of remote controllers in order for these to act properly a secure and reliable communication link needs to be provided and some fail safe mechanism developed for the occasion that communication is not available for some reason the only feasible ways of transmitting the necessary data worldwide today is satellite communication however at certain areas other protocols can be used for example vhf radio communication or mobile wireless telecommunication höyhtyä et al 2017 furthermore should neither of these be available high frequency hf communication can be nominated as a backup since it can provide a global coverage no matter which of communication technologies is used its reliability will be vital to provide integrity of the system this includes protections against cyberterrorism rødseth and lee 2015 further components of the system include various actors that can have an influence on remotely controlled vessels safety performance on higher hierarchy levels these include the international maritime organisation and flag state administrations classification societies and companies managing the ships and control centres such actors will issue certain procedures guidelines and regulations governing the ways in which not only the ships themselves but also the entire systems shall be designed constructed and operated vessels management companies shall be responsible for coordinating operators actions by issuing operational procedures organising training and management of on board subsystems maintenance the low detail structure of the anticipated system focusing on safety control structure is depicted in fig 2 the system of a remotely controlled ship can therefore be defined as all technical organisational and human based arrangements purposely designed or utilized in order to perform a safe navigation of a sea going vessel controlled remotely the defined system will consist of each component that has been either designed or can be intentionally used as its part that would include not only the ship itself but also the shore based control centre software hardware and liveware involved operational procedures and legislation in other words everything on which the system s designers can have a certain degree of control the natural environment and ships other than unmanned will to a large extent remain outside of the system thus will be generally referred to as the environment this will unfortunately also include threats to security such as cyberterrorism those in general remain out of this analysis scope even though illegal activities can affect virtually each of the system s components the relationships between the components of this defined system as well as the system and the environment are referred to as control functions ensuring their proper functioning prevents safety constraints violations safety controls in order to determine ways in which control functions can potentially be dangerous and quantify a potential of preventing them from becoming such we performed stpa followed by mitigation potential analysis as can be seen in fig 2 the elaborated structure consists of a rather limited number of components and relationships between them this is due to the fact that the present fall 2017 stage of technology development does not allow for more detailed analysis nevertheless most if not all of the control functions could be broken into higher level of details where more components are included however without knowing the exact design of a remotely controlled vessel s system such an approach cannot be supported the depicted safety control structure is the reasonable compromise between speculation on future systems layout and views presented in available literature some consequences of this approach are given in section 4 2 4 2 hazards and constraints list based on the developed system s safety control structure we compiled a list of hazards and related safety constraints as given in table 2 as can be seen the occurrence of certain hazards may propagate into the emergence of others therefore mitigation measures capable of protecting against multiple hazards simultaneously can be characterized by greatest effectiveness 4 2 1 interactions analysis upon elaborating the safety control structure and hazards list we then proceeded to analyse each of the control functions in accordance with stpa principles this was done with regard to their position within the system potential hazards resulting from it being inadequate consequences of such inadequacy in each of four potential cases not provided unsafe provided incorrect timing incorrect duration potential causes of inadequacy feasible mitigation measures and their potential potential protections against degradation in time the above factors were elaborated and compiled in a form of tables an example of which is presented in table 3 the full catalogue of control functions is given in appendices the analysis of this function proceeded as follows its position within the system was first reviewed to determine control loops affecting it and being affected see fig 2 thence hazards resulting from its potential inadequacy were identified since shore ship communication is one of the most essential to remotely controlled vessel s safety failure to provide it can directly lead to the emergence of any of hazards as listed in table 2 as virtually all on board activities are controlled through it potential causes as well as consequences of the communication link s failure were then refined with respect to the four types of inadequacy as given in section 2 2 ways of ensuring that the communication link remains safe reliable and efficient were then sought together with measures of degradation control by refining potential causes of inadequacy and recommendations on mitigation measures we aimed at providing future system designers and operators with suggestions on how certain issues can be resolved in order to embed safety in the design of remotely controlled merchant vessels system the obtained results are discussed within section 4 5 discussion results of the analysis performed are discussed within section 4 1 while uncertainties are addressed in section 4 2 5 1 discussion of study s results in total forty six control functions have been analysed affecting twenty four high level components of the system a catalogue of the control functions and results of their analysis are given in appendices where each of the functions is addressed separately however in full accordance with its position within the entire structure numbers refer to those depicted in fig 2 5 1 1 control functions inadequacy most of the controls could be inadequate in multiple ways as given in section 2 2 as a result it can be deduced that not only shall they be provided but also every effort should be taken in order to ensure that they are provided correctly in proper time and in a proper sequence in relation to other this can be achieved by implementing suitable algorithms or procedures disabling certain functions of the system unless certain conditions are met on the other hand it might prove beneficial to allow operators to override such restrictions in order to utilise their experience in unexpected conditions for instance 5 1 2 hazards emerging many of the control functions potential inadequacies may result in the emergence of virtually any of the hazards 1 6b 9 12 35 40 for instance this may be attributed to three factors relatively low detail level of the analysis where only very general statements could be made in relation to the system s structure and thus it was recommended to consider somewhat worse consequences of particular control function s failure fact that most of the control functions whose inadequacy would result in emergence of any hazard refer to high level of system s hierarchy such as management or legal aspects complexity of the system and nature of mutual interactions between its components may lead to multidirectional failure propagation due to operators and managers inability to counteract it wróbel et al 2016 the above indicate a need for further research in the domain of unmanned shipping to which however more empirical data may be required 5 1 3 causal categories each potential cause as given in appendices tables can be assigned to one of three causal categories human resulting from human error operational unsuitable procedures algorithms legal acts or technical hardware malfunctions results of such categorization and breakdown of inadequacy causes against control function s position within the system are depicted in fig 3 initially we expected to blame the environmental conditions for at least some of inadequacies but none of potential causes could be assigned to such a category this can be attributed to the fact that with the system theory applied the environmental conditions by themselves do not create a hazard instead it is the system s inability to measure or counteract them that do the most prominent results reveal that the majority of safety constraint violations within the vessel can potentially be attributed to technical issues see control functions 19 through 25 in appendices which emphasizes the importance of ensuring sufficient reliability of vessel s technical equipment furthermore a relatively high number of potential causes for control functions inadequacy pertains to the interaction between shore based facilities and legal or organisational environment 1 8 however mistakes made at levels of hierarchy so far removed from daily routine for instance international conventions legislation process can in many cases be corrected by a good seamanship knudsen 2009 similarly a low number of potential causes can be attributed to human factor while the very concept of a remotely controlled vessel implies that humans actions will have a great impact on the system s safety 10c 12 35 38 man et al 2015 2014 porathe et al 2014 stokey et al 1999 however methods of evaluating the significance of particular control functions inadequacy for the safety of systems in question are lacking and should be elaborated by academia to help distinguish which parts of the system are the most vulnerable 5 1 4 mitigation potential by reviewing the results of mitigation potential analysis one may notice an overrepresentation of mitigation measures aiming in reduction of the likelihood that the hazard will occur or reduction of the likelihood that the hazard results in an accident see fig 4 other values were relatively rarely used as they consisted of complete hazard elimination or reduction of damage should the hazard accident occur this can be attributed to the fact that little can be done to completely eliminate the likelihood of certain hazards at this stage of technology s development as well as the level of detail in which the system is analysed this is particularly apparent when discussing the mitigation potential of various procedures they themselves were to large extent assigned value 3 reduction of the likelihood that the hazard will occur 1 4 10c 33 and 35 but it must be kept in mind that the procedures existence does not mitigate the hazard by itself it is humans writing or following them that do so 5 1 5 remote control issues as mentioned before should the hazard occur on board and lead to an accident the operator located some hundreds miles away may find himself in a position in which s he has very little or no means of affecting the way in which such a situation develops causes for that can be sought in a trait of remote control itself where operators are unable to make the necessary manual adjustments as argued in wróbel et al 2017 this can have massive consequences for unmanned vessels where at some point failures can propagate rapidly wróbel et al 2016 such propagation could be interrupted onboard manned vessels operated nowadays in which case a crew would step in and fight the emergency therefore it might prove best to focus on reducing the likelihood of control becoming inadequate as can be seen in the mitigation potential analysis some of the worst results pertain to ensuring both way communication between the shore based control centre and the vessel 15 through 18 if such a link is broken information cannot be transmitted from vessel to operator and in turn his her decisions cannot be relayed to the vessel which becomes uncontrollable the issue of the operator s actual influence on the vessel s performance and potential consequences of inability to provide secure and efficient communication between them raises yet another concern it will be necessary to compose a contingency plan aiming in failing to safe in case the communication link ceases operation automatic shutdown of propulsion and commencement of drifting might seem to be a tempting idea but a possibility that such failure will occur in a frequented waters or where the currents are strong must not be neglected if so it might be better to embed a fail safe mechanism consisting of autonomous steering into safer waters control functions 17 18 in that case the necessity of having efficient autonomous control algorithms as a backup makes remote control impractical perhaps the fact that the communication link between operator and the vessel is so vital and vulnerable will actually make al 5 safer than al 3 contrary to logic or at least intuition they both argue that a human operator should be a backup for machine not the other way around hence al 3 and al 5 can both be considered as a backup for the other which of these will prove easier to implement and operate will depend on actual operational circumstances and their design and are likely to be the subject of more detailed study once more data is available nevertheless an ultimate contingency planning on regaining control over a dead ship shall be elaborated which might require dispatching a salvors team to embark the vessel no matter its position even in the middle of the ocean before she sinks or becomes impossible to trace calculation of potential costs of such operation might successfully divert shipping company decision makers attention to resilience engineering 5 1 6 hazards mitigation mitigation of many hazards can be achieved by introducing the redundancy to some safety critical subsystems or devices 16 20 and 25 although such an approach is said to be non optimal leveson 2011 it proved successful when ensuring the safety of complex systems although sometimes at the expense of cost effectiveness and higher initial investments since the redundancy is often named as the first choice solution it is also mentioned as a measure of ensuring numerous control functions adequacy despite any other effort taken to ensure the adequacy of control function it may prove useful as a final line of defence against thrusters failure for instance apart from the design of the vessel its control algorithms and other technical issues operational procedures and training shall also be in focus insufficient training of operators or incorrect information within a manual can lead to many of the listed control functions becoming inadequate 10a 10c 13 25 for instance on the other hand if the procedures are easy to understand and properly encompass the situation they might work as a good measure of mitigation the same can be attributed to the training a well trained and experienced operator having adequate control over the vessel can find the best solution to the situation encountered his her attitude can prevent both omission and commission errors from happening 5 1 7 protection against controls degradation as for the protection against control degradation the proper attitude of decision makers and operators 5a 9 12 13 32 procedures on the maintenance of equipment 25 and accident incident investigations 3 6a 10a 12 31 can be listed as feasible most of them are also included as a primary means of mitigating the control functions inadequacy to this point we can argue that skill degradation and overreliance on the automation can cause a system s overall degradation and shall be fought against with full commitment of all personnel involved in any level of system s hierarchy foreman et al 2015 5 2 uncertainties although system theoretic methods are believed to provide more insightful models of analysed systems behaviour or accidents than previously used ones they are not free from uncertainties in the remotely operated merchant vessel s case these will mainly originate from the assumption that the analysed model of the system is a sound representation of a real one which is still in a concept phase and is liable to change therefore they will propagate from system s safety control structure formulation into further steps of the analysis there are two major approaches to dealing with the uncertainties reduction by improved modelling and better information bjerga et al 2016 normally in stpa the uncertainties are reduced by a better modelling of the system which is impossible since this study is merely one of first steps in the iterative process of a safety driven design the only remaining approach to uncertainties treatment is therefore their better communication since the very aim of safety assessment is to inform decision makers and managers on potential hazards related to certain operations flage and aven 2009 such as unmanned navigation it is also essential to consider the possibility of error goerlandt and reniers 2016 and make the future users of the study aware of potential drawbacks of the analysis having data on the strength of analysts statements the final users could make better informed decisions bjerga et al 2016 therefore a method of classifying uncertainties as suggested in flage and aven 2009 can be applied it is argued that the uncertainty can be minor moderate or significant particular values are assigned by the analysts based on guidelines as given in table 4 when conducting hazard analysis particularly of a system to be built in future it is also essential to address the so called black swans scenarios that for some reason have not been analysed these are divided into three groups a unknown unknowns events that were completely unknown to the scientific environment b unknown knowns events that were not on the list of known events from the perspective of those who carried out a safety analysis but were better acknowledged by others aven 2015 c known unknowns events existence of which was expected by analysts but no further data pertaining to them could be elaborated flage and aven 2015 with respect to the above taxonomy potential causes of uncertainty pertaining to the study are listed in table 5 together with significance category as can be seen in table 5 larger uncertainties pertain to earlier phases of model creation and hazard analysis as the assessment proceeds consecutive stages can be assigned a lesser likelihood of black swans existence such a situation generates the phenomenon that at some stage little more can be said about the system unless certain issues are resolved on earlier stages in the remotely controlled vessel s case this will require carrying out an actual design of the system and then the iterative process of 1 assessing its safety 2 creating recommendations for design improvement 3 implementing them if feasible 4 assessing the safety of upgraded model and so on as mentioned in section 2 2 another dimension of uncertainty can be observed within some of the items as listed in table 5 to this point it cannot be elaborated which of the control functions has the greatest impact on the system s overall safety performance the likelihood and consequences of each of the control functions becoming inadequate can be different and depends on various factors just to name their position within the system or human element s impact on it similarly mitigation measures actual rather than potential effectiveness should be analysed even having the same mitigation potential assigned some can still be more feasible than others in order to address these issues more empirical data is required or a new method of compiling the existing one summing up we are in the position that at the current level of remotely controlled merchant vessel technology s development and volume of publicly available information pertaining to its future shape the performed qualitative analysis cannot be further enhanced at this point for instance as remotely controlled vessels performance will depend on its software s integrity this must be first developed to proceed with the safety assessment any further the fact that control algorithms will be contained in virtually any of system s components as depicted in fig 2 gives decent impression of how much work needs to be done since stamp and stpa are per se reported to be efficient tools for hazard identification and assessment altabbakh et al 2014 bjerga et al 2016 leveson 2011 vast majority of the uncertainties will result from data unavailability due to technology being innovative this novelty also does not permit uncertainties to be reduced through better modelling of the system in question thus only can they be evaluated and communicated nevertheless such communication can indicate areas in which the further research shall be conducted in order to collect more data and reduce the uncertainties themselves it also helps assess the validity of the study 6 conclusions the preliminary safety control structure and hazards list has been created for the system whose purpose will be to ensure remotely controlled merchant vessel s navigation and cargo transportation without negatively affecting the overall level of maritime safety the structure has then been analysed in accordance with system theoretic process analysis framework scenarios in which particular control functions can become ineffective or inadequate have been identified furthermore potential mitigation measures have been examined and evaluated with some recommendations given the purpose of the research was to provide further designers of similar systems with these recommendations by achieving that we fulfilled the very aim of our study results indicate that the implementation of remotely controlled merchant vessels and in a wider sense unmanned ships and ensuring their safety shall consist of executing various controls on regulatory organisational and technical plains they must all be in place and their effectiveness must be secured furthermore the potential degradation of this fragile structure over time must be constantly counteracted in which training and proper attitude of the decision makers can be vital uncertainties discussed pertain mainly to insufficient data on how the vessels in question will in fact be operated providing such information can propel further more detailed safety assessments and vice versa the hereby paper is just one of the first steps in this long iterative process the development of technology shall be an unending process and the same should apply to the safety assessment in addition to that the safety of merchant vessels having potential of being operated in an autonomous mode shall be investigated further attention shall be directed at minimalizing uncertainties acknowledgements the authors appreciate the financial contributions from finnish funding agency for technology innovation tekes since this research was co funded by the

23584,unmanned merchant vessels prototypes are expected to come into operation within a few years this revolutionary shift in the shipping industry is feared to negatively impact the safety of maritime transportation therefore in order to support future designers of remotely operated merchant vessels system we applied system theoretic process analysis stpa identifying the most likely safety control structure of the analysed system and investigating it the aim was to suggest potential ways of increasing the system s safety and to assess the effectiveness of such measures results indicate that the implementation of remotely controlled merchant vessels and in a wider sense unmanned ships and ensuring their safety shall consist of executing various controls on regulatory organisational and technical plains potential effectiveness is evaluated and some recommendations are given on how to ensure the safety of such systems keywords unmanned vessels remote operation stamp stpa safety of transportation 1 introduction as unmanned technologies development gains momentum in various domains it is postulated that similar can also be achieved in marine transportation herein ships could be operated remotely from a shore control centre or even proceed autonomously supporters of such a shift argue that it would reduce shipping costs environmental impact and threats to humans working for the industry porathe 2016 while some more sceptical authors are of the opinion that the safety of maritime transportation can be negatively affected wróbel et al 2017 it is therefore of utmost importance to ensure that such vessels at least do not reduce the level of safety burmeister et al 2014b besides technical considerations and social controversies bitner et al 2014 safety became the most important issue to resolve numerous research projects reports or scientific papers have recently been published in the field initially only some basic ideas have been developed and refined iijima and hayashi 1991 rødseth et al 2013 rødseth and burmeister 2012 jalonen et al 2017 then the concept was developed and some safety issues have been addressed including those pertaining to unmanned ships navigation johansen and perez 2016 theunissen 2014 and remote control man et al 2015 porathe et al 2014 wahlström et al 2015 as safety of unmanned navigation remained in focus there were attempts to utilise experience gained in other domains wahlström et al 2015 in order to assess it finally there were numerous attempts of identifying and quantifying hazards present in this field burmeister et al 2014b heikkilä et al 2017 hogg and ghosh 2016 kretschmann et al 2015a 2015b rødseth and burmeister 2015a rødseth and tjora 2014a wróbel et al 2016 jalonen et al 2017 security issues were considered as part of feasibility and safety analysis and were also addressed separately dobryakova et al 2015 the conclusion of the above is that in general there is a potential within unmanned vessels technology to improve safety of transportation kretschmann et al 2015a but more data is required and some issues still require addressing in order to reduce the uncertainties burmeister et al 2014b wróbel et al 2017 nevertheless a reliability and probability based approach to safety analysis as applied in afore mentioned research is neither exhaustive nor free of significant drawbacks such analyses can only be performed for systems reliability structure of which is known for remotely controlled vessels their concepts of design are still being developed and the final structure of the system remains uncertain therefore it is impractical to assess their safety in its reliability based form leveson 2011 furthermore a great deal of systems understanding and safety improvements originates from knowledge gained during actual operations or even through accidents investigations mazaheri et al 2015 stoop and dekker 2012 since no quantitative or qualitative data is available here this approach cannot be applied above considerations suggest that a different method of analysing the safety of remotely controlled ships shall be applied system theoretic process analysis stpa a relatively new method of including safety in system s design has recently emerged leveson 2011 2002 rooted in system theoretic accident model and process stamp it has been applied in some innovative domains owens et al 2008 including maritime sector abrecht 2016 aps et al 2015 kwon 2016 it is said to better encompass and help mitigate some hazards that are specific to modern highly automated and complex systems altabbakh et al 2014 bjerga et al 2016 however a safety analysis based on a systemic approach has not been applied to remotely controlled shipping systems to date a gap this paper is intended to bridge therefore we apply stpa to assess the safety of a remotely controlled generic merchant vessel and provide future designers of such systems with advice pertaining to which of its parts are likely to fail and how furthermore we suggest some measures to mitigate hazards and qualitatively assess their potential effectiveness by applying a mitigation potential analysis the paper consists of four sections the introduction and conclusions firstly the description of anticipated unmanned ships systems layout is given together with general assumptions and some considerations regarding its impact on safety secondly the method of safety analysis is introduced namely system theoretic process analysis stpa it is followed by section 3 describing the results of the study which are then discussed in section 4 together with brief assessment and communication of uncertainties last but not least conclusions are drawn 2 remotely operated vessels proof of concept this section introduces general considerations pertaining to unmanned ship and their safety the reduction of merchant ships crews progressed for some time already with some of the vessels becoming technically and legally acceptable to be operated by crews of eight or even less this was an effect of implementing new technologies mainly in the engine department bertram 2002 it is postulated that further progress in this field can lead to a complete elimination of the necessity to employ any crewmembers on board most operational requirements as specified in international conventions are in the form of functions to be performed with only few of the rules specifically requiring that those functions shall be performed by on board crew members aawa 2016 imo 2011 it is anticipated that the overall design of such unmanned ships shall be significantly different to those operated nowadays in many aspects including hull design and propulsion arrangement grøtli et al 2015 however the greatest and the most important difference will be that all of her subsystems will be to a large extent controlled either remotely or in an autonomous mode the ship would traverse an open sea in ballast or laden condition with no crew present on board the system s basic functions will be performed automatically without involving human operators who would be stationed in a so called shore based control centre and capable of remotely supervising the vessel or taking over its control using a dedicated satellite communication link this would be possible whenever the ship encounters a situation that for any reason cannot be handled by the automated control system or whenever deemed necessary by that the vessels are anticipated to follow an adjustable autonomy scheme depending on the condition of the ship herself and the mission being executed particular levels of autonomy in the maritime industry have been published by lloyd s register of shipping lr 2016 and are presented in table 1 below upon approaching the port of destination a berthing or conning crew might be required to board the ship by launch boat or helicopter in order to bring her to the berth burmeister et al 2014b an arrangement similar to this of maritime pilots boarding ocean going vessels nowadays since port manoeuvres are the most demanding part of passage ahmed and hasegawa 2013 coastal states might be unwilling to allow unmanned vessels to operate in their inland waters hooydonk 2014 rødseth and burmeister 2015a rødseth and tjora 2014a 2014b van den boogaard et al 2016 due to the uncertainty concerning their safety and security performance at least in the initial phases of such vessels implementation such a concept means that the system must be capable of operating in multiple autonomy modes ranging from al 0 to al 5 and switching between them without reducing system s overall safety performance in this paper we focus on the remote control mode which corresponds to autonomy level 3 here an operator located on shore will have an overall command over a handful of vessels traversing different seas porathe et al 2014 s he will oversee decision making supervision and trouble shooting thus simultaneously performing tasks that today require many crewmembers expertise decision support tools can be of some help in this however as soon as a situation develops in a particularly difficult direction an assistance of full bridge team is said to be available in order to better deal with the problem kretschmann et al 2015a still such a team will be located in a shore based control centre some distance away from the vessel which can potentially create further issues just to mention communication link unreliability flawed situation awareness and an inability to manually operate equipment ahvenjärvi 2016 porathe et al 2014 the level of operator s involvement can be adjusted as required such an approach will require an extensive redesign of the ships in order to accommodate numerous sensors or prolonged maintenance free periods rødseth and burmeister 2015b the fact that a vessel is controlled remotely will affect virtually all aspects of her operation including navigation power generation fuel management cargo conditioning and fire safety all those are mutually related krata et al 2016 krata and szlapczynska 2018 krata and wawrzynski 2017 and thus a systemic approach is required to fully apprehend the effect of implementing a remote control into merchant vessels operation on maritime safety 3 methods the majority of risk assessment methods currently in use are based on the assumption that accidents are caused by particular safety critical components not being able to serve their purpose salmon et al 2012 this belief in reliability theory s significance contributed to safety analysts and accident investigators refraining from analysing concealed causes of accidents leveson 2011 those may be of non technical nature and belong to organisational or sociological domains willey 2014 as such they have often been neglected for the reason that it is difficult to quantify human behaviour and reliability of human operator montewka et al 2017 or supervisor for instance therefore in this section a different method of safety assessment is presented as given in leveson 2011 3 1 system theoretic approach a systemic insight has been proposed so as to address the safety issue on higher organisational levels including operational practices and management policies ensuring that hazards are controlled in each point of the system s structure kee et al 2017 leveson 2011 salmon et al 2015 in this approach referred to as system theoretic accident model and process stamp it is inadequate interactions between a system s components that lead to accidents the nature of such interactions shall ensure that the system as a whole remains within safety limits kazaras et al 2014 as a consequence of the above violation of these defined safety constraints leads to the emergence of a hazard a system state or set of conditions that together with a particular set of worst case conditions will lead to an accident a system s states that could lead to safety constraint violation are inspected and ways of mitigating such violation sought it is recommended to refrain from calculating probabilities of system transitioning to an unsafe state bjerga et al 2016 due to a lack of empirical data particularly in initial phases of system development a stamp based approach also takes into consideration one more aspect that can potentially prove vital when addressing the safety of a highly innovative system of a remotely controlled ship nowadays systems composed of thousands of technologically advanced components are run by relatively small crews who are often physically separated from the system for cost effectiveness or safety reasons for instance such crews must have a perfect understanding a mental model and perception of the system s status and related automation with the shift from a manual to remote control people reportedly became less familiar with the systems under their supervision norman 1989 another important factor is that the majority of processes are conducted automatically leaving humans with merely supervisory functions and requiring them to step in as soon as the automation cannot control the system any longer leveson 2011 utilising remote control may contribute to a limited perception of the actual state of the controlled process boredom loss of focus skill degradation and loss of situational awareness porathe et al 2014 wahlström et al 2015 in case any unusual event occurs it is essential that operator s mental model of the process reflects its actual condition such a case was relatively simple to achieve when operators controlled the machinery from local stations and could confirm systems components condition visually aurally or even olfactory with progressing separation of workers from physical components the potential of mental model s accuracy degradation grew the reasons for that could be various just to mention possible inconsistencies between system s initial design and actual layout improper management of change or inadequate insufficient training moreover as a tendency to introduce more automation into systems progressed another factor leading to an increased likelihood of unwelcome events surfaced a human operator s mental model of the automation itself in old fashioned systems confirmation of an actuator s operation was in many cases appearing almost instantly as a system s condition change could be observed locally in remote control s case this is much more complicated here operators decisions are enforced by actuators and progress is monitored by sensors this means in short that firstly the operator must make proper decision based on information fed and their own mental model of the system then such decision must be translated by software into actuators command and thus relayed to the latter next relevant actuators must enforce operator s decision in a proper way progress of such action must be monitored by sensors and their readings transmitted to the operator who must check if they match his initial intentions basically things can go wrong in each of these steps and proper measures shall be taken to prevent it from happening herein in a process of safety guided design leveson 2011 safety ii paradigm can be invoked focusing on making entire socio technical systems capable of succeeding under expected and unexpected conditions alike hollnagel 2014 in order to achieve this safety is to be embedded in the design from the very beginning of system s existence in which stamp and related methods can assist altabbakh et al 2014 as they are said to be more effective safety management tools than previously applied methods kazaras et al 2014 in relation to unmanned merchant vessels as an emergent technology such an approach creates the opportunity for both performing proactive safety assessment as well as assessing feasibility of system theoretic approach in this aspect the latter could be accomplished not sooner than some period after remotely controlled vessels implementation therefore we apply the system theoretic process analysis stpa a tool rooted in stamp with the intention to accumulate information about how the safety constraints can be violated and how to prevent such violations in order to evaluate measures of increasing safety we apply mitigation potential analysis as described in section 2 3 3 2 stpa although the stpa can be used at any stage of the system life cycle leveson 2011 this study s goal is to apply it to a system which is still at a concept phase namely a remotely controlled merchant ship the aim of stpa based safety analysis is to determine how the behavioural safety constraints which are derived from system hazards can be violated and how to prevent such violations the ultimate goal is to identify scenarios leading to identified hazards and thus to losses so they can be either mitigated or controlled without involving unnecessary costs firstly an identification of the potential for inadequate control of the system that could lead to a hazardous state is conducted those can result from inadequate control or enforcement of the safety constraints which in turn can occur because a a control action required for safety is not provided or not followed b an unsafe control action is provided c a potentially safe control action is provided at the wrong time or in the wrong sequence d a control action required for safety is stopped too soon or applied too long secondly it is determined on how each potentially hazardous control action identified in first step could occur this can consist of examination of the control loop in order to see what could cause it furthermore control and mitigation measures can be suggested for multiple controllers of the same component or safety constraint identification of conflicts and potential coordination problems should be carried out this step can be augmented by a consideration on how the designed controls could degrade over time and building in protection against it including management of change procedures performance audits or accident and incident analysis for instance in the case of remotely controlled merchant vessels ensuring the reliable and precise communication between the ship and control centre will be one of the most vital functions of the system such interaction between two of the system s components is referred to as a control function and can be inadequate in one or more ways as listed above these ways are analysed further with respect to potential causes and consequences of such inadequacy it is postulated that most the cost effective and efficient way of designing for safety in case of extremely complex systems is to carry out safety assessment in parallel with engineering the system itself leveson 2011 in this model design decisions are analysed by safety analysts and feedback is given to improve the safety of the system in an iterative process however it cannot be done here since it remains unclear whether the generic unmanned ship is in fact to be designed and come into operation in the foreseeable future therefore this study focuses on an as accurate as possible assessment of ship s safety features basing on available information in hope to provide future system designers with reliable evaluation and suggestions pertaining to how the system should in fact be designed in order to perform such analysis the stpa was supported by a mitigation potential analysis 3 3 mitigation potential analysis for the reason of the unavailability of data required for traditional safety assessment a hazard mitigation potential has been chosen as a surrogate for a likelihood an element of traditionally understood risk dulac and leveson 2009 reasons for its use include the potential for eliminating or controlling the hazard in the design or operations has a direct and important impact on the likelihood of the hazard occurrence mitigatibility of the hazard can be determined before the system s architecture or design is selected mitigation potential scale is used as listed below and presented in fig 1 1 reduction of damage if an accident does occur 2 reduction of the likelihood that the hazard results in an accident 3 reduction of the likelihood that the hazard will occur 4 complete elimination of the hazard from design a design process will involve safety driven optimization of a system aiming in the reduction of an accident s likelihood thereby it can be understood as searching for and implementing hazard control measures having higher mitigation potential assigned those with the greatest mitigation potential are viewed as being more efficient and cost effective when it comes to accident prevention and in a worst case scenario damage reduction safety control structure is studied and ways of mitigating control functions inadequacy are sought and assigned the mitigation potential value for example elimination of a necessity for communication link s existence could be assigned a higher value of mitigation potential than implementing algorithms to ensure a correctness of data transferred in our study we assigned the mitigation potential to each of the potentially inadequate control functions occurrence mitigating measures rather than to the hazards themselves as a result we quantified the potential of unsafe control function leading to the hazard instead of hazard leading to an accident this was done because of a low detail level of our model 3 4 creating a safety control structure in order to perform the stpa and mitigation potential analysis a safety control structure was first developed as given in fig 2 this was achieved by reviewing the available literature pertaining to remotely controlled vessels see for instance aawa 2016 ahvenjärvi 2016 burmeister et al 2014b kretschmann et al 2015a man et al 2015 2014 porathe 2016 rødseth and brage 2014 rødseth and burmeister 2015a rødseth and lee 2015 wróbel et al 2016 and brainstorm based workshop the latter involved experts engaged in the design of an unmanned river crossing ferry whose knowledge was elicited similarly a list of hazards and safety constraints was created in order to systematize knowledge regarding the safety of a remotely controlled generic merchant vessel by generic we mean a ship that is designed and operated for transporting cargo between ports to be more specific such an unmanned vessel is expected to traverse oceans in an autonomous mode al 5 and enter ports as done nowadays which is with full complement of crew on board al 0 or al 1 burmeister et al 2014a we focused on what is in between the navigation in high traffic density areas or otherwise demanding or non standard conditions such conditions shall be defined in order to provide the system with a procedure of safe and smooth transition from al 5 autonomy to al 3 remote control a call for operator s assistance in other words nevertheless such generic ship is defined as not having any special requirements pertaining to cargo stowage bulk carriers general cargo or container vessels can serve as a good example although they can be technologically advanced their cargo conditioning equipment and technology as well as safety features are far simpler than those of tankers or passenger vessels for instance after the safety control structure as well as hazards and constraints list had been created we performed the stpa each of the control functions was investigated in order to identify potential consequences and causes of it being inadequate then we sought mitigation measures that might reduce the potential of such inadequacy such measures were assigned the mitigation potential results of the above are presented in section 3 as well as in appendices 4 results this section presents the list of hazards and safety constraints as well as high level safety control structure and its description 4 1 safety control structure the remotely controlled vessel s system level decisions are made by an operator on shore data fed by various sensors is used to provide the operator with an artificial situation awareness the sensors can be either environmental or internal while the former will pertain to the navigational situation around the vessel and will include global navigation satellite systems gnss receivers radars cameras echosounders etc burmeister et al 2014b kretschmann et al 2015a the latter will monitor the vessel s interior just to mention its stability condition or machinery status krata and wawrzynski 2017 wawrzyński and krata 2016a 2016b the issue of disagreement between particular sensors indications could be resolved by data fusion algorithms filipowicz and neumann 2008 which would require at least some of the sensors to be doubled or tripled the data should be as accurate as possible to allow an operator to make proper decisions in ample time and keep all the parameters within the limits such decisions will be executed by actuators to control ship s movements as well as other processes ballast water management cargo conditioning and fire safety monitoring can be listed here but virtually all parameters of the vessel s performance should be controllable to a certain degree such a degree will depend on the vessel s technical condition her mission status or the complexity of navigation situation ensuring proper functioning of those auxiliary systems will be required to provide the vessel s main function carriage of commodities between ports to which the propulsion is vital here the use of azimuthal thrusters or similar devices can be nominated as candidates for providing the vessel with propulsion as these appliances can both create thrust and direct it in a desired way another advantage of using them instead of traditional shaft propeller and rudder is the potential for providing the redundancy when two or more devices are installed nevertheless since this issue is yet to be resolved by actual designers of the vessel in our analysis we keep using expressions of engine or rudder to describe the propulsion and steering subsystem in general no matter the actual design these appliances will be used to control what is here referred to as navigation meaning vessel s course and speed some shipboard processes shall be controlled automatically by the on board control subsystem but an overriding authority should be with the operator one of the reasons behind such arrangement is that a fail safe mechanism shall be provided in case the operator s decisions cannot be relayed to the vessel and she shall proceed on her own for some time hogg and ghosh 2016 an operator s primary objective will be to ensure that the vessel is following the pre planned route in a safe and efficient manner it shall be at the operator s discretion to amend the passage plan if required for the purpose of collision avoidance or any other similarly in order to achieve it the operator shall be in possession of up to date model of the environment charts nautical publications mental model of the ship and all of its controllers are also of a great importance additional data for example regarding expected traffic or weather conditions could be obtained from external sources in order to extend the operator s perception of the situation around the vessel under control at least in the initial phases of system implementation the experience of seafarers in handling demanding situations will need to be exploited together with their ability of maintaining situation awareness ahvenjärvi 2016 bertram 2002 seafarers particularly master mariners or chief engineers with additional training in remote control appear to be suitable candidates for the position of shore based operators hogg and ghosh 2016 the operator s role will therefore be similar to that of today s vessels crews except for the fact that s he will need to achieve it from some distance by use of remote controllers in order for these to act properly a secure and reliable communication link needs to be provided and some fail safe mechanism developed for the occasion that communication is not available for some reason the only feasible ways of transmitting the necessary data worldwide today is satellite communication however at certain areas other protocols can be used for example vhf radio communication or mobile wireless telecommunication höyhtyä et al 2017 furthermore should neither of these be available high frequency hf communication can be nominated as a backup since it can provide a global coverage no matter which of communication technologies is used its reliability will be vital to provide integrity of the system this includes protections against cyberterrorism rødseth and lee 2015 further components of the system include various actors that can have an influence on remotely controlled vessels safety performance on higher hierarchy levels these include the international maritime organisation and flag state administrations classification societies and companies managing the ships and control centres such actors will issue certain procedures guidelines and regulations governing the ways in which not only the ships themselves but also the entire systems shall be designed constructed and operated vessels management companies shall be responsible for coordinating operators actions by issuing operational procedures organising training and management of on board subsystems maintenance the low detail structure of the anticipated system focusing on safety control structure is depicted in fig 2 the system of a remotely controlled ship can therefore be defined as all technical organisational and human based arrangements purposely designed or utilized in order to perform a safe navigation of a sea going vessel controlled remotely the defined system will consist of each component that has been either designed or can be intentionally used as its part that would include not only the ship itself but also the shore based control centre software hardware and liveware involved operational procedures and legislation in other words everything on which the system s designers can have a certain degree of control the natural environment and ships other than unmanned will to a large extent remain outside of the system thus will be generally referred to as the environment this will unfortunately also include threats to security such as cyberterrorism those in general remain out of this analysis scope even though illegal activities can affect virtually each of the system s components the relationships between the components of this defined system as well as the system and the environment are referred to as control functions ensuring their proper functioning prevents safety constraints violations safety controls in order to determine ways in which control functions can potentially be dangerous and quantify a potential of preventing them from becoming such we performed stpa followed by mitigation potential analysis as can be seen in fig 2 the elaborated structure consists of a rather limited number of components and relationships between them this is due to the fact that the present fall 2017 stage of technology development does not allow for more detailed analysis nevertheless most if not all of the control functions could be broken into higher level of details where more components are included however without knowing the exact design of a remotely controlled vessel s system such an approach cannot be supported the depicted safety control structure is the reasonable compromise between speculation on future systems layout and views presented in available literature some consequences of this approach are given in section 4 2 4 2 hazards and constraints list based on the developed system s safety control structure we compiled a list of hazards and related safety constraints as given in table 2 as can be seen the occurrence of certain hazards may propagate into the emergence of others therefore mitigation measures capable of protecting against multiple hazards simultaneously can be characterized by greatest effectiveness 4 2 1 interactions analysis upon elaborating the safety control structure and hazards list we then proceeded to analyse each of the control functions in accordance with stpa principles this was done with regard to their position within the system potential hazards resulting from it being inadequate consequences of such inadequacy in each of four potential cases not provided unsafe provided incorrect timing incorrect duration potential causes of inadequacy feasible mitigation measures and their potential potential protections against degradation in time the above factors were elaborated and compiled in a form of tables an example of which is presented in table 3 the full catalogue of control functions is given in appendices the analysis of this function proceeded as follows its position within the system was first reviewed to determine control loops affecting it and being affected see fig 2 thence hazards resulting from its potential inadequacy were identified since shore ship communication is one of the most essential to remotely controlled vessel s safety failure to provide it can directly lead to the emergence of any of hazards as listed in table 2 as virtually all on board activities are controlled through it potential causes as well as consequences of the communication link s failure were then refined with respect to the four types of inadequacy as given in section 2 2 ways of ensuring that the communication link remains safe reliable and efficient were then sought together with measures of degradation control by refining potential causes of inadequacy and recommendations on mitigation measures we aimed at providing future system designers and operators with suggestions on how certain issues can be resolved in order to embed safety in the design of remotely controlled merchant vessels system the obtained results are discussed within section 4 5 discussion results of the analysis performed are discussed within section 4 1 while uncertainties are addressed in section 4 2 5 1 discussion of study s results in total forty six control functions have been analysed affecting twenty four high level components of the system a catalogue of the control functions and results of their analysis are given in appendices where each of the functions is addressed separately however in full accordance with its position within the entire structure numbers refer to those depicted in fig 2 5 1 1 control functions inadequacy most of the controls could be inadequate in multiple ways as given in section 2 2 as a result it can be deduced that not only shall they be provided but also every effort should be taken in order to ensure that they are provided correctly in proper time and in a proper sequence in relation to other this can be achieved by implementing suitable algorithms or procedures disabling certain functions of the system unless certain conditions are met on the other hand it might prove beneficial to allow operators to override such restrictions in order to utilise their experience in unexpected conditions for instance 5 1 2 hazards emerging many of the control functions potential inadequacies may result in the emergence of virtually any of the hazards 1 6b 9 12 35 40 for instance this may be attributed to three factors relatively low detail level of the analysis where only very general statements could be made in relation to the system s structure and thus it was recommended to consider somewhat worse consequences of particular control function s failure fact that most of the control functions whose inadequacy would result in emergence of any hazard refer to high level of system s hierarchy such as management or legal aspects complexity of the system and nature of mutual interactions between its components may lead to multidirectional failure propagation due to operators and managers inability to counteract it wróbel et al 2016 the above indicate a need for further research in the domain of unmanned shipping to which however more empirical data may be required 5 1 3 causal categories each potential cause as given in appendices tables can be assigned to one of three causal categories human resulting from human error operational unsuitable procedures algorithms legal acts or technical hardware malfunctions results of such categorization and breakdown of inadequacy causes against control function s position within the system are depicted in fig 3 initially we expected to blame the environmental conditions for at least some of inadequacies but none of potential causes could be assigned to such a category this can be attributed to the fact that with the system theory applied the environmental conditions by themselves do not create a hazard instead it is the system s inability to measure or counteract them that do the most prominent results reveal that the majority of safety constraint violations within the vessel can potentially be attributed to technical issues see control functions 19 through 25 in appendices which emphasizes the importance of ensuring sufficient reliability of vessel s technical equipment furthermore a relatively high number of potential causes for control functions inadequacy pertains to the interaction between shore based facilities and legal or organisational environment 1 8 however mistakes made at levels of hierarchy so far removed from daily routine for instance international conventions legislation process can in many cases be corrected by a good seamanship knudsen 2009 similarly a low number of potential causes can be attributed to human factor while the very concept of a remotely controlled vessel implies that humans actions will have a great impact on the system s safety 10c 12 35 38 man et al 2015 2014 porathe et al 2014 stokey et al 1999 however methods of evaluating the significance of particular control functions inadequacy for the safety of systems in question are lacking and should be elaborated by academia to help distinguish which parts of the system are the most vulnerable 5 1 4 mitigation potential by reviewing the results of mitigation potential analysis one may notice an overrepresentation of mitigation measures aiming in reduction of the likelihood that the hazard will occur or reduction of the likelihood that the hazard results in an accident see fig 4 other values were relatively rarely used as they consisted of complete hazard elimination or reduction of damage should the hazard accident occur this can be attributed to the fact that little can be done to completely eliminate the likelihood of certain hazards at this stage of technology s development as well as the level of detail in which the system is analysed this is particularly apparent when discussing the mitigation potential of various procedures they themselves were to large extent assigned value 3 reduction of the likelihood that the hazard will occur 1 4 10c 33 and 35 but it must be kept in mind that the procedures existence does not mitigate the hazard by itself it is humans writing or following them that do so 5 1 5 remote control issues as mentioned before should the hazard occur on board and lead to an accident the operator located some hundreds miles away may find himself in a position in which s he has very little or no means of affecting the way in which such a situation develops causes for that can be sought in a trait of remote control itself where operators are unable to make the necessary manual adjustments as argued in wróbel et al 2017 this can have massive consequences for unmanned vessels where at some point failures can propagate rapidly wróbel et al 2016 such propagation could be interrupted onboard manned vessels operated nowadays in which case a crew would step in and fight the emergency therefore it might prove best to focus on reducing the likelihood of control becoming inadequate as can be seen in the mitigation potential analysis some of the worst results pertain to ensuring both way communication between the shore based control centre and the vessel 15 through 18 if such a link is broken information cannot be transmitted from vessel to operator and in turn his her decisions cannot be relayed to the vessel which becomes uncontrollable the issue of the operator s actual influence on the vessel s performance and potential consequences of inability to provide secure and efficient communication between them raises yet another concern it will be necessary to compose a contingency plan aiming in failing to safe in case the communication link ceases operation automatic shutdown of propulsion and commencement of drifting might seem to be a tempting idea but a possibility that such failure will occur in a frequented waters or where the currents are strong must not be neglected if so it might be better to embed a fail safe mechanism consisting of autonomous steering into safer waters control functions 17 18 in that case the necessity of having efficient autonomous control algorithms as a backup makes remote control impractical perhaps the fact that the communication link between operator and the vessel is so vital and vulnerable will actually make al 5 safer than al 3 contrary to logic or at least intuition they both argue that a human operator should be a backup for machine not the other way around hence al 3 and al 5 can both be considered as a backup for the other which of these will prove easier to implement and operate will depend on actual operational circumstances and their design and are likely to be the subject of more detailed study once more data is available nevertheless an ultimate contingency planning on regaining control over a dead ship shall be elaborated which might require dispatching a salvors team to embark the vessel no matter its position even in the middle of the ocean before she sinks or becomes impossible to trace calculation of potential costs of such operation might successfully divert shipping company decision makers attention to resilience engineering 5 1 6 hazards mitigation mitigation of many hazards can be achieved by introducing the redundancy to some safety critical subsystems or devices 16 20 and 25 although such an approach is said to be non optimal leveson 2011 it proved successful when ensuring the safety of complex systems although sometimes at the expense of cost effectiveness and higher initial investments since the redundancy is often named as the first choice solution it is also mentioned as a measure of ensuring numerous control functions adequacy despite any other effort taken to ensure the adequacy of control function it may prove useful as a final line of defence against thrusters failure for instance apart from the design of the vessel its control algorithms and other technical issues operational procedures and training shall also be in focus insufficient training of operators or incorrect information within a manual can lead to many of the listed control functions becoming inadequate 10a 10c 13 25 for instance on the other hand if the procedures are easy to understand and properly encompass the situation they might work as a good measure of mitigation the same can be attributed to the training a well trained and experienced operator having adequate control over the vessel can find the best solution to the situation encountered his her attitude can prevent both omission and commission errors from happening 5 1 7 protection against controls degradation as for the protection against control degradation the proper attitude of decision makers and operators 5a 9 12 13 32 procedures on the maintenance of equipment 25 and accident incident investigations 3 6a 10a 12 31 can be listed as feasible most of them are also included as a primary means of mitigating the control functions inadequacy to this point we can argue that skill degradation and overreliance on the automation can cause a system s overall degradation and shall be fought against with full commitment of all personnel involved in any level of system s hierarchy foreman et al 2015 5 2 uncertainties although system theoretic methods are believed to provide more insightful models of analysed systems behaviour or accidents than previously used ones they are not free from uncertainties in the remotely operated merchant vessel s case these will mainly originate from the assumption that the analysed model of the system is a sound representation of a real one which is still in a concept phase and is liable to change therefore they will propagate from system s safety control structure formulation into further steps of the analysis there are two major approaches to dealing with the uncertainties reduction by improved modelling and better information bjerga et al 2016 normally in stpa the uncertainties are reduced by a better modelling of the system which is impossible since this study is merely one of first steps in the iterative process of a safety driven design the only remaining approach to uncertainties treatment is therefore their better communication since the very aim of safety assessment is to inform decision makers and managers on potential hazards related to certain operations flage and aven 2009 such as unmanned navigation it is also essential to consider the possibility of error goerlandt and reniers 2016 and make the future users of the study aware of potential drawbacks of the analysis having data on the strength of analysts statements the final users could make better informed decisions bjerga et al 2016 therefore a method of classifying uncertainties as suggested in flage and aven 2009 can be applied it is argued that the uncertainty can be minor moderate or significant particular values are assigned by the analysts based on guidelines as given in table 4 when conducting hazard analysis particularly of a system to be built in future it is also essential to address the so called black swans scenarios that for some reason have not been analysed these are divided into three groups a unknown unknowns events that were completely unknown to the scientific environment b unknown knowns events that were not on the list of known events from the perspective of those who carried out a safety analysis but were better acknowledged by others aven 2015 c known unknowns events existence of which was expected by analysts but no further data pertaining to them could be elaborated flage and aven 2015 with respect to the above taxonomy potential causes of uncertainty pertaining to the study are listed in table 5 together with significance category as can be seen in table 5 larger uncertainties pertain to earlier phases of model creation and hazard analysis as the assessment proceeds consecutive stages can be assigned a lesser likelihood of black swans existence such a situation generates the phenomenon that at some stage little more can be said about the system unless certain issues are resolved on earlier stages in the remotely controlled vessel s case this will require carrying out an actual design of the system and then the iterative process of 1 assessing its safety 2 creating recommendations for design improvement 3 implementing them if feasible 4 assessing the safety of upgraded model and so on as mentioned in section 2 2 another dimension of uncertainty can be observed within some of the items as listed in table 5 to this point it cannot be elaborated which of the control functions has the greatest impact on the system s overall safety performance the likelihood and consequences of each of the control functions becoming inadequate can be different and depends on various factors just to name their position within the system or human element s impact on it similarly mitigation measures actual rather than potential effectiveness should be analysed even having the same mitigation potential assigned some can still be more feasible than others in order to address these issues more empirical data is required or a new method of compiling the existing one summing up we are in the position that at the current level of remotely controlled merchant vessel technology s development and volume of publicly available information pertaining to its future shape the performed qualitative analysis cannot be further enhanced at this point for instance as remotely controlled vessels performance will depend on its software s integrity this must be first developed to proceed with the safety assessment any further the fact that control algorithms will be contained in virtually any of system s components as depicted in fig 2 gives decent impression of how much work needs to be done since stamp and stpa are per se reported to be efficient tools for hazard identification and assessment altabbakh et al 2014 bjerga et al 2016 leveson 2011 vast majority of the uncertainties will result from data unavailability due to technology being innovative this novelty also does not permit uncertainties to be reduced through better modelling of the system in question thus only can they be evaluated and communicated nevertheless such communication can indicate areas in which the further research shall be conducted in order to collect more data and reduce the uncertainties themselves it also helps assess the validity of the study 6 conclusions the preliminary safety control structure and hazards list has been created for the system whose purpose will be to ensure remotely controlled merchant vessel s navigation and cargo transportation without negatively affecting the overall level of maritime safety the structure has then been analysed in accordance with system theoretic process analysis framework scenarios in which particular control functions can become ineffective or inadequate have been identified furthermore potential mitigation measures have been examined and evaluated with some recommendations given the purpose of the research was to provide further designers of similar systems with these recommendations by achieving that we fulfilled the very aim of our study results indicate that the implementation of remotely controlled merchant vessels and in a wider sense unmanned ships and ensuring their safety shall consist of executing various controls on regulatory organisational and technical plains they must all be in place and their effectiveness must be secured furthermore the potential degradation of this fragile structure over time must be constantly counteracted in which training and proper attitude of the decision makers can be vital uncertainties discussed pertain mainly to insufficient data on how the vessels in question will in fact be operated providing such information can propel further more detailed safety assessments and vice versa the hereby paper is just one of the first steps in this long iterative process the development of technology shall be an unending process and the same should apply to the safety assessment in addition to that the safety of merchant vessels having potential of being operated in an autonomous mode shall be investigated further attention shall be directed at
