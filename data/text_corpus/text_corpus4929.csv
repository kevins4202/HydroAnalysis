24645,understanding the impact of land use conversion from forests to plantations on soil organic carbon soc stocks is critical for sustainable land and forest management in northeast india nei the present study was conducted in west garo hills district of meghalaya state in nei to evaluate the impact of plantations rubber tea areca nut cashew nut and pineapple on soc stocks in comparison with a natural forest soil samples were collected from plantations of different age classes 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 25 30 and 30 40 years old to assess their potential for c storage rothc model was run at equilibrium on forest land use and thereafter was calibrated and validated to model soc stocks in the plantations over the 40 years chrono sequence using the baseline average climate data results showed that with increase in age of plantations at 40 years soc stocks decreased to 57 4 50 3 and 44 4 mg c ha 1 in rubber areca nut and pineapple plantations at the average rate of 0 41 0 58 and 0 73 mg c ha 1 yr 1 respectively this corresponded to a soc stock loss of about 22 32 and 40 compared to the initial soc stock under forest 73 6 mg c ha 1 conversely soc stocks in tea and cashew nut plantations increased to 83 4 and 75 4 mg c ha 1 at the average rate of 0 24 and 0 05 mg c ha 1 yr 1 corresponding to a soc gain of about 13 and 2 5 compared to that under forest over 40 years the data on abrupt climate change acc scenario by rothc simulations showed that rubber areca nut pineapple and forest land uses would lose carbon at the rate of 0 65 0 65 1 42 and 0 13 mg c ha 1 yr 1 respectively conversely tea and cashew nut plantations might gain c at the rate of 0 35 and 0 23 mg c ha 1 yr 1 respectively representing a valuableoption for storing c and mitigating and adapting to climate change further protecting and restoring natural forests and or mixed stands of native tree species might reduce the risks of the loss of biodiversity and be a viable option for sustainable land management in nei keywords soil organic carbon tropical plantations forest conversion chronosequence rothc 1 introduction soil organic carbon soc is one of the most important indicators of soil health and known to provide many ecosystem services ess like regulating greenhouse gas ghg emissions mitigating climate change increasing soil productivity and moderating water cycle craswell and lefroy 2001 pacala and socolow 2004 lal 2004 jiang et al 2006 the global estimates of the pedologic stocks to 1 m depth are 1550 pg 1 pg 1015 g for soc and 750 pg for soil inorganic carbon sic much higher than those of other terrestrial carbon pools i e atmosphere 820 pg and vegetation 560 pg reflecting the capacity of soil to sequester atmospheric c the geological c pool fossil fuels is 4130 pg and the oceanic pool 38 000 pg lal 2016 however the atmospheric c stock is increasing at the rate of 5 pg yr friedlingstein et al 2019 during the last few decades scientific research has focused on increasing soil c as a strategy to mitigate climate change smith et al 2008 and improve soil health post and kwon 2000 soc stocks decrease following conversion of forests to other land uses brahma et al 2018 and unsustainable soil management such as conventional tillage crop residue removal and in field burning excessive input of agrochemicals and reduced addition of exogenous organic matter chenu et al 2019 thus any sustainable land management practice for increasing soil c should be based on eco intensification strategies supporting its medium term efficiency and long term sustainability that are important to addressing the climate change and food security issues lal 2019 soil management and land use strategies have different effects on soc sequestration rate and storage paustian et al 2016 and soc sequestration is also affected by climatic conditions as well as soil type and differs among countries minasny et al 2017 reported global average rates of c sequestration by afforestation 0 6 mg c ha 1 yr 1 and conversion of cropland to pasture 0 5 mg c ha 1 yr 1 as indicator of a high soc sequestration potential land use change luc activities transitions between various natural vegetation types croplands and pastures are among the major sources of anthropogenic c emissions and deforestation accounts for 10 12 of c emission friedlingstein et al 2019 moreover luc activities are often linked with a loss of soil c since the supply of organic material from plant litter and the c mineralization rate are decreased and co2 emissions from soil are increased poeplau and don 2013 thus quantifying changes in soil c due to luc is important to understanding changes in soil health and the climate ipcc 2019 during the last few decades northeast india nei has faced rapid changes in land use pattern brahma et al 2018 mishra et al 2019 2020 the region is a part of indo burma biogeographic realm and is mainly covered with tropical and sub tropical forests that are well known for acting as a c sink wei et al 2014 however any anthropogenic luc in tropical regions may transform the sink into a c source iqbal and tiwari 2016 and degrade soil health abera and wolde meskel 2013 different studies in tropical climates have indicated a general decrease in soc stocks when forests are converted to agroforestry and plantations soc stocks 0 50 cm following forest conversion to rubber agroforestry rubber and oil palm plantations in sumatra were the lowest under oil palm plantation 66 1 mg c ha 1 compared to the native forest 77 0 mg c ha 1 guillaume et al 2018 in the mizoram state of nei soc stocks under different plantation systems were on average 47 lower than those of the forest land use ranging from 74 under mango mangifera indica to 29 under areca nut areca catechu plantations singh et al 2018 a meta analysis with a focus on tropical forest conversion to different land uses indicated that soc stocks decreased on average by 18 9 when forests were converted to plantations shanmugam et al 2018 plantation systems primarily converted from forest lands can become c sinks on a long term basis however research information in nei about soc content of these plantation systems and its changes with the age of plantations is limited to bamboo nath et al 2015 tea kalita et al 2016 and rubber plantations nath et al 2018 systems chrono sequence studies are based on the space for time substitution approach over a series of sites on which the current land use has been practiced for different time periods rather than repeated measurements over time this approach an alternative to long term studies was first applied to vegetation dynamics pickett 1989 in the chrono sequence approach soil sampling is repeated in space to compare soc changes among sites with homogeneous conditions soil climate topography etc that have the same land use history prior to conversion to the current land use ipcc 2003 therefore it is assumed that soc stocks were identical prior to the change in land use cerri et al 2003 ideally the reference sites for sampling should be under a natural vegetation cover e g forest or conventional land management e g moldboard ploughing with these assumptions using chrono sequence field studies combined with appropriate modeling is a suitable strategy for assessing changes in soc stock smith et al 2012 this approach was used to assess changes in soc stocks upon conversion from forest to pasture ecosystems in the brazilian amazon basin cerri et al 2003 2007 and in a no till nt cereals chrono sequence in northeast spain under a semi arid climate in comparison with conventional tillage Ã¡lvaro fuentes et al 2014 simulation models are increasingly being used globally to assess the effects of land use land use change and projected climate change on soil c dynamics brilli et al 2017 the rothc model jenkinson et al 1994 coleman and jenkinson 2014 is widely used to simulate changes in soc stocks rothc is a monthly time step model which calculates total organic c in soil using a few but easily available inputs and is the most widely used soil c simulation model since 2000 fao 2019 despite the ecological and economic importance of the nei studies related to soc dynamics and their simulation under land use change from natural vegetation to plantation systems are scanty mishra et al 2020 in addition there is a strong need to assess the soc sequestration potential of the main plantation systems with an increase in the plantation age to evaluate their viability for sustainable land management in comparison with the forest land use therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to assess the soc stocks under different plantations in nei and to determine the variation in soc stocks within the chrono sequence and 2 to predict changes in soc stocks with the rothc model under the baseline and projected abrupt climate change acc conditions and evaluate the trend in soc stocks these two objectives were realized by testing the following hypotheses i soc stocks are affected by the conversion of forests to plantation systems and ii soc stocks differ among different plantations and are affected by acc 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and climatic data meghalaya state in nei region of india a part of the indo burma biodiversity hotspot comprising diverse biota with high level of endemism

of the largest districts of meghalaya with an area of 3714 kmÂ² soils of the study site are alfisols order and ultic hapludalfs subgroup soil survey staff 2014 the baseline climatic data of the district tura region meghalaya were obtained from the west garo hills district and local research station and laboratories for a 30 years period 1987 2018 climate is warm and temperature is uniform throughout the year average 24 6 c while rainfall total 4000 mm follows a monsoonal pattern with 90 of total rainfall received between april and september data for the projected climate change 2019 2050 were derived from the meghalaya state climate change action plan 2015 these data include climate projections based on the hadcm3 gcm pope et al 2000 and the re gridded outputs of the precis climate model used in india rupa kumar et al 2006 these data are based on the sres a1b mid term emission scenarios projections under acc temperature increased to 26 4 c 1 8 c and rainfall to about 4100 mm 2 5 the plantations evaluated in the present study were rubber tea pineapple cashew nut and areca nut the age of plantations for soil sampling section 2 2 and the previous history of the land uses were confirmed by interviewing the landowners and local people tea plantations are typically grown within complex systems with shade trees mainly albizia spp which are n fixing species the nearby forest area used as the reference site included schima wallichii ghugra magnolia spp sopas alstonia scholaris satian sterculia villosa odal garuga pinnata zia adina cordifolia holdu and albizia procera koroi in the common upper canopy along with undergrowth of erianthus spp thysanolaena spp eupatorium odoratum etc 2 2 soil sampling and analysis a chrono sequence approach was adopted for soil sampling in 2018 soil samples were collected from five plantation systems rubber tea pineapple cashew nut and areca nut of seven age classes 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 25 30 and 30 40 years old and a nearby forest native land use in each age class and in each plantation three quadrats of 10 10 m were randomly laid down and soil samples at 0 30 cm consistent with the depth for carbon accounting ipcc 2006 were collected from four corners and center to obtain a composite sample thus a total of 105 soil samples 5 land uses 7 age classes 3 replications were collected over an area of 310 km2 fig 1 similarly 21 soil samples 7 sites 3 replications were randomly collected in the forest area all the collected soil samples 126 were transferred to laboratory for further processing and analyses at all sampling sites soil cores volume 94 2 cm3 diameter 4 cm length 7 5 cm were also collected inserting the cores horizontally at 15 cm and oven dried 105 c for 48 h for bulk density estimation blake and hartge 1986 a part of samples was air dried under shade ground and sieved 2 mm to determine the gravel content fraction particle size distribution was determined by the hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 and ph in a soil water suspension 1 2 5 using a systronics ph system 361 soc content grams per 100 g was determined with the walkley black walkley and black 1934 method and soc stocks mg c

types arable land grasslands and forestland soc stock expressed in mg c ha 1 is simulated using five c pools coleman and jenkinson 2014 decomposable plant material dpm resistant plant material rpm microbial biomass c bio and humified organic matter hum that are active pools and one inert organic matter pool iom incoming plant c fig 2 is split between dpm and rpm depending on the dpm rpm ratio of the plant material default values are 1 44 for agricultural crops and improved grassland 0 67 for unimproved grassland and scrub 0 25 for deciduous or tropical woodlands both dpm and rpm decompose to form co2 bio hum in proportions determined by the clay content of the soil the bio hum is then split into 46 bio and 54 hum and both decompose to form more co2 bio and hum iom is calculated from soc stock with the formula proposed by falloon et al 1998 the model has a monthly step and required input data are monthly climate soil clay content soil cover information decomposition is faster in bare soils compared to soils covered by vegetation quantity mg c ha 1 and quality dpm rpm ratio of returned plant residues to soil and farmyard manure inputs fym the input data to run simulations are

pan evaporation in mm clay content in and soil depth in cm open pan evaporation can be calculated from potential evapotranspiration thornthwaite and mather 1955 rothc is designed to run in two modes direct in which known carbon inputs are used to calculate the changes in soc stocks and inverse when carbon inputs are calculated at equilibrium state for 10 000 years from known soc stocks in this study fig 2 rothc was firstly run at equilibrium in inverse mode on the forest land use under the baseline climate conditions average climate 1987 2018 considering the average soc stock of all the forest sites measured in 2018 that was equal to 73 6 mg c ha 1 dpm rpm was set to 0 25 deciduous or tropical woodland and a c input of 10 8 mg c ha 1 was required to match the measured soc stock thereafter the model was calibrated in direct mode on the five plantations using the measured soc stocks over the 7 age classes of the chrono sequence the model was run for 40 years in the direct mode for the five plantations by manually and iteratively adjusting the c inputs required to fit simultaneously the measured soc stocks of the seven age classes of the chrono sequence for each plantation the average clay content of all the 21 soil samplings of the chrono sequence was used cerri et al 2003 for the 7 age classes the corresponding average baseline climate data backward order were as follows 2018 2014 age 0 5 5 years 2013 2009 age 5 10 5 years 2008 2004 age 10 15 5 years 2003 1999 age 15 20 5 years 1998 1994 age 20 25 5 years 1993 1989 age 25 30 5 years and 1996 1987 age 30 40 10 years model settings dmp rpm and c inputs for the different land uses are given in table 1 thereafter rothc was run under the projected acc conditions for 32 years from 2019 to 2050 see section 2 1 with the same parametrization for c inputs and decomposability of plant material dpm rpm previously used for forest and plantation sites 2 4 statistical analysis model predictions were compared with

results 3 1 general soil parameters the summary of soil parameters is presented in table 2 the mean value of bd was the lowest for the forest sites 1 10 0 09 mg m 3 but did not statistically differ from that under cashew nut 1 14 0 07 mg m 3 and pineapple 1 12 0 09 mg m 3 conversely rubber sites had the highest and significantly different bd 1 23 0 11 mg m 3 the soils of the studied land uses were acidic ph 4 5 to 5 5 except forest soils which were slightly acidic ph 6 in the studied soils silt content ranged from 16 1 under rubber to 25 7 under forest clay content from 13 7 under forest to 32 4 under cashew nut and sand content from 42 3 under cashew nut to 61 8 under areca nut the mean soc content was the highest under forest 2 61 0 27 and not statistically different than that under tea plantations 2 44 0 47 the lowest soc content was recorded under areca nut plantations 1 59 0 47 the soc contents were similar under pineapple 2 17 0 49 and cashew nut 2 24 0 37 but were significantly higher than those under rubber plantations 1 94 0 41 3 2 measured soc stocks average soc stocks measured in the plantations of different ages over the chrono sequence are given in table

ha 1 the soc stock for the 30 40 years old plantations 71 2 0 03 mg c ha 1 was statistically similar to that of the 20 25 years old plantations 65 9 5 8 mg c ha 1 the rate of change in soc stock for rubber over the chrono sequence was 0 17 mg c ha 1 yr 1 table 4 the mean soc stocks in 0 5 5 10 and 10 15 years old tea plantations fig 3b were 48 5 3 7 67 3 4 4 and 94 3 7 4 mg c ha 1 respectively thereafter soc stocks decreased over time and the decline was more marked in the 20 25 years old 74 0 9 1 mg c ha 1 than those under other age plantations the soc stocks were similar 84 mg c ha 1 for the 15 20 25 30 and 30 40 years old plantations and indicated a steady state condition the rate of change in soc stock under tea over the chrono sequence was 0 89 mg c ha 1 yr 1 table 3 the initial soc stock under areca nut fig 3c of 61 4 8 2 mg c ha 1 for the 0 5 years old plantations decreased to 28 0 1 2 mg c ha 1 under the 10 15 years old plantations the soc stocks increased to 59 8 6 6 mg c ha 1 for the 25 30 years old plantations the rate of change in soc stock for areca nut over the chrono sequence was 0 20 mg c ha 1 yr 1 table 3 the average soc stocks under cashew nut fig 3d was the minimum for the 10 15 years old plantations 45 3 2 7 mg c ha 1 and increased with an increase in age to the highest 78 6 8 3 mg c ha 1 level for the 30 40 years old plantations the rate of change of soc stock for cashew nut over the chrono sequence was 0 51 mg c ha 1 yr 1 table 3 the soc stocks under pineapple for 0 5 5 10 and 10 15 years old pineapple plantations fig 3e were 65 7 3 5 74 0 5 4 and 63 3 3 8 mg c ha 1 respectively however soc stocks decreased with the increase of plantation age and the minimum values were recorded for the 30 40 years old pineapple plantations 44 5 7 4 mg c ha 1 the rate of change of soc stock for pineapple over the chrono sequence was 0 53 mg c ha 1 yr 1 table 3 3 3 model evaluation the simulations for all five plantation systems were validated based on mae rmse and ef the values of mae rmse and ef for the rubber simulations fig 4 a were 1 10 2 91 and 0 87 respectively and the standard deviation sd of the observed values 9 35 mg c ha 1 was higher than rmse the values of mae rmse and ef for the tea simulations fig 4b were 2 13 5 64 and 0 83 respectively and the sd of the observed values 15 13 mg c ha 1 was much higher than rmse similarly the rmse values for areca nut cashew nut and pineapple simulations fig 4c d e 4 86 3 19 and 1 72 respectively were lower than the sd of the observed values 12 05 12 20 and 10 56 mg c ha 1 in addition ef values for areca nut cashew nut and pineapple simulations fig 4c d e were 0 80 0 89 and 0 95 respectively these results indicate a strong agreement between observed and simulated data justifying the use of rothc model to simulate soc stock for the five plantation systems in nei it is worth pointing out that changing the dpm rpm ratio and or the c inputs during the chrono sequence calibration can affect the simulation results in the different land uses thus an accurate calibration of these parameters is required to get the best agreement with the observed data in rubber calibrations dpm rpm was set to 0 25 table 1 but decreasing the maximum c input to 5 mg c ha 1 compared to the best calibration 7 mg c ha 1 resulted in a low agreement between observed and simulated data mae 9 18 rmse 24 29 ef 8 20 in tea the maximum c input was set to 13 mg c ha 1 and in the best calibration the dpm rpm ratio table 1 was set to 1 44 age 0 5 0 67 age 6 10 and 0 25 age 11 40 using a dpm rpm ratio of 1 44 age 0 5 and 0 67 age 6 40 the agreement was lower mae 5 35 rmse 14 16 ef 0 06 in areca nut the dpm rpm ratio was set to 1 44 in the first 15 years and thereafter to 0 25 table 1 with a maximum c input of 8 mg c ha 1 increasing the maximum c input to 10 mg c ha 1 compared to the best calibration slightly changed the agreement between observed and simulated data mae 1 91 rmse 5 04 ef 0 79 in cashew nut the dpm rpm ratio was set to 1 44 in the first 5 years and thereafter to 0 25 table 1 with a maximum c input of 12 mg c ha 1 but decreasing the maximum c input to 10 mg c ha 1 compared to the best calibration resulted in a low agreement between observed and simulated data mae 11 64 rmse 30 79 ef 9 41 in pineapple dpm rpm ratio was set to 1 44 and in the best calibration the maximum carbon input table 1 was set to 10 mg c ha 1 from age 6 to 20 with a gradual decrease from 8 to 2 mg c ha 1 onwards using a maximum carbon input of 10 mg c ha 1 from age 6 to 40 resulted in a lower agreement between observed and simulated data mae 4 27 rmse 11 30 ef 1 07 consequently the possible ranges of soc decrease at the age of 40 years would be 22 1 38 8 20 7 31 7 and 11 1 39 7 compared to the forest at equilibrium for rubber areca nut and pineapple respectively the corresponding ranges of soc increase would be 7 0 13 3 for tea while for cashew nut soc would increase by 2 5 with the best calibration and decrease by 5 with lower c inputs 3 4 baseline climate simulations results presented in table 4 and fig 3f show that over the 40 years chrono sequence average climate 1987 2018 soc stocks decreased from the initial value at equilibrium of the forest land use 73 6 mg c ha 1 to 57 4 44 4 and 50 3 mg c ha 1 under rubber pineapple and areca nut plantations respectively the mean rate of loss was 0 41 0 73 and 0 58 mg c ha 1 yr 1 corresponding with a soc loss of about 22 40 and 32 respectively compared with the stock under forest conversely the soc stocks under tea and cashew nut plantations increased to 83 4 and 75 4 mg c ha 1 respectively i e 0 24 and 0 05 mg c ha 1 yr 1 with a soc gain of about 13 and 2 5 compared to that under forest over the 40 years chrono sequence 3 5 climate change simulations all simulations under acc refer to a period of 32 years 2019 2050 and are based on the hadcm3 model and the sres a1b mid term emission scenario described in section 2 1 table 4 and fig 3f the soc stocks under forest land use decreased slightly to 69 5 mg c ha 1 i e 0 13 mg c ha 1 yr 1 with a soc loss of 5 6 compared to the initial value at equilibrium 73 6 mg c ha 1 the simulations indicated that under the climate change scenario soc stocks will decrease to 52 7 28 2 and 52 8 mg c ha 1 under rubber pineapple and areca nut plantations respectively i e 0 65 1 42 and 0 65 mg c ha 1 yr 1 with a soc loss of 28 4 61 7 and 28 3 respectively compared to that under forest at equilibrium conversely soc stocks increased to 84 9 and 80 8 mg c ha 1 under tea and cashew nut plantations i e 0 35 and 0 23 mg c ha 1 yr 1 indicating the potential of gaining 15 4 and 9 8 respectively compared to that under forest at equilibrium 4 discussion the review of scientific literature indicates scant and inconclusive information about change in soc stocks upon conversion from tropical and subtropical native forest to plantations over chrono sequence studies some researchers i e covington 1981 lal 2005 indicated that land use change involving forest clear cutting reduces c stock in the standing living biomass and the native forest floor during the first 15 20 years based on the data from some soils of indonesia cameroon and peru van straaten et al 2015 reported that conversion of forest to plantations oil palm rubber and cocoa depleted soc content by up to 50 during the first 10 20 years such land use changes strongly reduce the initial soc stock due to soil disturbance mixing of litter layer and accelerated soil erosion thereafter a new equilibrium is reached at a timescale depending on the growth rate of the vegetation for the new land use in relation to the establishment of the studied plantations following the forest clear cutting the data presented indicate differences in soc stocks and temporal trends among plantations as follows 4 1 rubber plantations there was no clear trend in the measured soc stocks over the chrono sequence under rubber plantations table 3 fig 3a in fact similar values of soc stocks were observed for the 0 5 and 20 25 years old plantations about 65 mg c ha 1 5 10 and 30 40 years old plantations about 72 mg c ha 1 as well as for the 10 15 and 25 30 years old plantations about 50 mg c ha 1 in another study for the same district of meghalaya state of nei mishra and sarkar 2020 reported the soc stock of 54 6 mg c ha 1 for a 10 years old rubber plantation in mizoram state of nei lungmuana et al 2019 reported the soc stock of 44 8 mg c ha 1 for a 14 years old rubber plantation established on land previously under a shifting cultivation simulation of soc stocks with rothc indicated a decline from 64 mg c ha 1 in the 0 5 years old plantations to 57 mg c ha 1 i e 7 mg c ha 1 at the average rate of 0 17 mg c ha 1 yr 1 for the 30 40 years old plantations fig 3a the simulated data showed that under the baseline climate conditions for the conversion of the natural forest to rubber plantations table 4 and fig 3f the soc stocks would decrease to 57 4 mg c ha 1 0 41 mg c ha 1 yr 1 with a cumulative loss of 22 1 compared to that under the natural forest these results are in accord with the loss of 19 3 reported by de blÃ©court et al 2013 for a tropical region in china as well as with the soc decrease by 29 and 23 reported by nath et al 2018 in assam state india in 27 and 34 years old rubber plantations respectively under acc conditions the conversion of the natural forest to rubber plantations table 4 and fig 3f would result in a further decline in soc stocks to 52 7 mg c ha 1 with a 28 4 loss compared to the initial value under the natural forest 0 65 mg c ha 1 yr 1 loss of soc following the conversion of forests to rubber plantations are a consequence of local management practices that include the removal of the vegetation understory de blÃ©court et al 2013 the average c input table 1 used in the simulations 6 7 mg c ha 1 was slightly lower than that used for the study in tropical china 9 mg c ha 1 by liu et al 2017 over a chrono sequence of 7 13 19 25 and 47 years old rubber plantations liu and colleagues also reported a slight decrease in soc stocks over the chrono sequence and indicated that only degraded forests could benefit from the conversion to rubber plantations due to a rapid biomass growth rate of rubber however conversion of a natural undisturbed forests would result in a net c loss they also reported that the productive life span of rubber is limited and close to 40 years 4 2 tea plantations tea plantations in the area are typically grown within systems with shade trees kalita et al 2016 and mainly include albizia spp which are n fixing species that can also increase soc contents mao et al 2010 the measured soc stocks attained the maximum value under the 10 15 years old plantations 94 3 mg c ha 1 and thereafter reached an almost steady state condition about 84 mg c ha 1 but with a minimum value 74 0 mg c ha 1 for the 20 25 years old plantations table 3 and fig 3b li et al 2015 reported that soc concentrations were significantly lower in older 50 yr compared to 23 yr tea plantations in southwest china a similar trend was reported by kalita et al 2016 for tea plantations in assam india which also did not report a clear increase or decrease with the age of the plantation specifically soc stocks were 35 7 32 2 45 4 and

tea plantation different dpm rmp ratios were used to simulate soc stocks over the chrono sequence to represent the progressive development and re establishment of a vegetation cover integrated in an agroforestry system and more similar to that of the native tropical forest table 1 average c inputs were set at 9 8 mg c ha 1 which is in accord with those reported by other authors for assam kalita 2015 and meghalaya mishra et al 2020 in nei soc stocks with rothc simulations increased from 56 mg c ha 1 under the 0 5 years old plantations to 83 mg c ha 1 i e 27 mg c ha 1 at an average rate of 0 67 mg c ha 1 yr 1 in the 30 40 years old plantations fig 3b under the baseline climate conditions the simulated results show that conversion of the natural forest to tea plantations table 4 and fig 3f would increase soc stocks to 83 4 mg c ha 1 0 24 mg c ha 1 yr 1 and result in a 13 3 gain in soc compared to the antecedent stocks under the natural forest under acc conversion of the natural forest

plantations areca nuts produce fruits at 5 10 years after transplantation and bear fruits for more than 30 years however farmers do not remove senescent trees and new ones are planted based on availability of adequate space different dpm rmp ratios were considered to simulate soc stock over the chrono sequence in the context of a gradual development of a vegetation cover similar to that of a tropical forest table 1 average c inputs were set at 3 6 mg c ha 1 measured soc stocks table 3 and fig 3c decreased from 61 4 mg c ha 1 for the 0 5 years old plantations to 28 0 mg c ha 1 for 10 15

the 30 40 years old plantations fig 3c similar soc stocks were reported by singh et al 2018 and sahoo et al 2019 for areca nut plantations in mizoram state of nei region sahoo et al 2019 also indicated that soc stocks in areca nut plantations were about 24 lower than those of forest lands similarly brahma et al 2018 reported 28 lower soc stocks under a 30 year old areca nut plantation than that of natural forest in assam state of nei under the baseline climate conditions of the simulated results conversion of natural forest to areca nut plantations table 4 and fig 3f decreased soc

plantations cashew nut trees start bearing fruits 3 years after planting reach full bearing during the tenth year and provide remunerative yields for another 20 years different dpm rmp ratios were considered to simulate soc stocks over the chrono sequence in consideration of the gradual development of a vegetation cover similar to that of a tropical forest table 1 average c inputs were set at 8 1 mg c ha 1 which is in accord with those reported for the herbaceous biomass and litter by bello et al 2017 for a tropical region of benin in west africa measured soc stocks table 3 and fig 3d indicated a decline up to 10 15 years of age 45 3 mg c ha 1 and increased to 78 6 mg c ha 1 for the 30 40 years old plantations similar values in 15 years old plantations were reported by bello et al 2017 which ranged from 40 to 58 mg c ha 1 depending on the agro ecological zone simulation of soc stocks with rothc indicated an increase from 53 mg c ha 1 for the 0 5 years old plantations to 75 mg c ha 1 i e 23 mg c ha 1 and equal to 0 57 mg c ha 1 yr 1 for the 30 40 years old plantations table 3 and fig 3d under the baseline climate conditions for the simulated results conversion of natural forest to cashew nut plantations table 4 and fig 3f would increase soc stocks to 75 4 mg c ha 1 and result in a 2 5 soc gain 0 05 mg c ha 1 yr 1 compared to the initial value under a natural forest under climate change conditions conversion of the natural forest to cashew nut plantations table 4 and fig 3f would increase soc stocks to 80 8 mg c ha 1 with a 9 8 soc gain 0 23 mg c ha 1 yr 1 compared to the initial value under the natural forest the potential of cashew nut to store large amounts of soc comparable with that under forests is also confirmed by kar et al 2020 who studied different land uses in odisha state india 4 5 pineapple plantations the planting material e g suckers and crowns bear flowers after 12 20 months since plantation establishment local cultivation practices neither use chemical fertilizers nor the removal of slips and suckers and plantations are left to regrow for several years after the first fruit harvest mathew et al 2011 dpm rmp ratio of 1 44 was considered to simulate soc stock over the chrono sequence and average c inputs were set to 6 3 mg c ha 1 table 1 measured soc stocks table 3 and fig 3e declined from 65 7 to 44 5 mg c ha 1 in the 30 40 years old plantations at a rate of 0 53 mg c ha 1 yr 1 soc stocks with rothc simulations decreased from 60 mg c ha 1 in the 0 5 years old plantations to 44 mg c ha 1 i e 16 mg c ha 1 and equal to 0 40 mg c ha 1 yr 1 in the 30 40 years old plantations fig 3e the simulated results under the baseline climate conditions show that conversion of the natural forest to pineapple plantations table 4 and fig 3f decreased soc stocks to 44 4 mg c ha 1 with a soc loss of 39 7 0 73 mg c ha 1 yr 1 compared to the initial value under the natural forest under climate change conditions conversion of natural forest to pineapple plantations table 4 and fig 3f would decrease soc stocks to 28 2 mg c ha 1 with a 61 7 soc loss 1 42 mg c ha 1 yr 1 compared to the initial value under the natural forest sierra et al 2015 stated that a scarce availability of data on alternative cropping systems is a serious limitation for assessing their impacts on soc stocks in many tropical regions in particular data availability is extremely scanty for pineapple and no chrono sequence studies are available mukul 2014 reported a soc stock of 19 9 mg c ha 1 0 20 cm for pineapple agroforestry in bangladesh about 60 lower than that under a forest land use 34 0 mg c ha 1 for a pineapple plantation in guadeloupe eastern caribbean sea sierra et al 2015 reported that soc stocks declined by 15 after 6 year from the introduction of pineapple following a sugarcane monoculture about 0 7 mg c ha 1 yr 1 gnanavelrajah et al 2008 indicated that changes in soc stocks within a same land use differed among different soil series in a tropical region of thailand with a general increase for a soil of a lower clay content and a decrease mostly for soil of a higher clay content the possible reason is that soils with high clay content are associated with high initial soc stocks that require high c inputs either to be maintained or enhanced thus it may be possible to increase soc stocks by choice of an appropriate land use 4 6 natural forest simulated results under acc conditions show that soc stocks table 4 and fig 3f decreased to 69 5 mg c ha 1 with a 5 6 soc loss compared to the initial value under a natural forest 73 6 mg c ha 1 this soc loss 4 1 mg c ha 1 is equal to 0 13 mg c ha 1 yr 1 and indicate that soc stocks under forest may also be negatively affected by acc as was also indicated by previous studies in nagaland state in nei mishra et al 2019 reporting that simulated soc decreased by 0 04 mg c ha 1 yr 1 similarly soc stock decreases under climate change in natural forests were found in iran soleimani et al 2017 with an average loss of 0 09 mg c ha 1 yr 1 kÃ¶chy et al 2015 using a global spatially explicit analysis on a 75 years scale stated that acc might result in a decrease in the soc stock in the case of tropical mountain forests where the probability that native forests are converted to cropland or plantations is high and decomposition is faster reforestation of degraded forests also affects soc content depending on the tree species soleimani et al 2019 reported that soc stocks increased by 25 and 1 1 26 years after the reforestation with cypress and alder respectively and decreased by 4 and 12 when the forest was converted to quercus and maple stands tropical forests are rich in biodiversity and show a great potential for carbon storage at ecosystem level kothandaraman et al 2020 indicated that in western ghats india tropical dry deciduous tropical semi evergreen and tropical evergreen forests can store 336 8 mg c ha 1 as average 70 5 and 25 of the total are stored in live vegetation 234 3 mg c ha 1 woody vegetation and understory detritus 17 6 mg c ha 1 litter and deadwood and soil 84 9 mg c ha 1 0 30 cm respectively the bonn challenge www bonnchallenge org launched in 2011 by the german government and the international union for conservation of nature aims to restore 350 mha of forest by 2030 three main methods are available i leaving degraded and abandoned agricultural land return to natural forest through natural regeneration ii converting marginal agricultural lands into plantations of valuable trees e g for paper or rubber production and iii switching to agroforestry i e growing crops and useful trees together natural regeneration is the cheapest and technically easiest option and recovery can be accelerated by planting native species lewis et al 2019 under this initiative india has committed 21 mha of degraded land and of this area 10 4 mha 49 5 are under the three restoration methods in particular natural restoration of forest covers 6 5 mha 62 5 agroforestry 3 6 mha 34 6 and plantations 0 3 mha 2 9 other research highlights the need to increase the focus on protecting and restoring natural forests and or mixed plantations of native tree species rather than promoting low diversity plantations osuri et al 2020 4 7 modeling uncertainties this may be the first modeling study to assess trends in soc stocks under different plantations with a chrono sequence approach and under projected acc conditions among sources of uncertainties in the simulated data are 1 a limited number of soil samplings for each age class three 2 alteration in the soc decomposition because of changes in temperature and rainfall patterns under acc which can affect model outputs and 3 a constant rate of c inputs to the soil during the simulation under acc conditions while higher or lower inputs could derive from the increase decrease of both above ground biomass and the input of residues in the plantations mishra et al 2020 5 conclusions the data presented support the first hypothesis that soc stocks are affected by the conversion of forests to plantations the rate of change of measured soc stocks over the chrono sequence ages i e 0 5 and 30 40 years old plantations increased slightly for rubber plantations but were lower than that under the forest soc stocks increased for cashew nut and tea plantations and were higher than that under the forest conversely soc stocks decreased in areca nut and pineapple plantations and were lower than that under the forest in relation to the second hypothesis simulated results indicated that under acc soc stocks would further decrease for rubber areca nut and pineapple plantations with high soc losses compared to that under the forest prior to conversion about 30 60 conversely soc stocks would increase under cashew nut and tea plantations about 10 15 compared to that under the forest before the conversion in summary results indicate that among the various land use changes from forest to plantations tea and cashew nut can provide an option for increasing soc stocks with a view to providing farmers with a financial income conversely conversion to pineapple plantations and to a lower extent also to rubber and areca nut plantations can only provide farmers with an optimal income but are not sustainable in terms of soc storage and acc mitigation additionally the permanent nature of tea plantations due to refilling of aged tea bushes with young ones avoids c loss incurred during the clear felling which is also common in other plantation crops such as rubber and areca nut therefore tea plantations conserve the stored ecosystem carbon over a long period of time and hence can contribute to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation redd when better integrated with appropriate agroforestry systems however tea and other plantation types should be preferably established on barren and degraded lands to avoid further clearance of forests and fulfill the commitments of the bonn challenge in the nei region there is a strong need to identify viable alternatives to slash and burn agriculture but recommended soil management practices following conversion of forests to plantations must maintain or enhance soc stocks and overall soil health increasing the focus on protecting and restoring natural forests and or mixed stands of native tree species rather than promoting low diversity plantations can help to maintain biodiversity and is essential for the provision of a wide range of ecosystem services that are

24645,understanding the impact of land use conversion from forests to plantations on soil organic carbon soc stocks is critical for sustainable land and forest management in northeast india nei the present study was conducted in west garo hills district of meghalaya state in nei to evaluate the impact of plantations rubber tea areca nut cashew nut and pineapple on soc stocks in comparison with a natural forest soil samples were collected from plantations of different age classes 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 25 30 and 30 40 years old to assess their potential for c storage rothc model was run at equilibrium on forest land use and thereafter was calibrated and validated to model soc stocks in the plantations over the 40 years chrono sequence using the baseline average climate data results showed that with increase in age of plantations at 40 years soc stocks decreased to 57 4 50 3 and 44 4 mg c ha 1 in rubber areca nut and pineapple plantations at the average rate of 0 41 0 58 and 0 73 mg c ha 1 yr 1 respectively this corresponded to a soc stock loss of about 22 32 and 40 compared to the initial soc stock under forest 73 6 mg c ha 1 conversely soc stocks in tea and cashew nut plantations increased to 83 4 and 75 4 mg c ha 1 at the average rate of 0 24 and 0 05 mg c ha 1 yr 1 corresponding to a soc gain of about 13 and 2 5 compared to that under forest over 40 years the data on abrupt climate change acc scenario by rothc simulations showed that rubber areca nut pineapple and forest land uses would lose carbon at the rate of 0 65 0 65 1 42 and 0 13 mg c ha 1 yr 1 respectively conversely tea and cashew nut plantations might gain c at the rate of 0 35 and 0 23 mg c ha 1 yr 1 respectively representing a valuableoption for storing c and mitigating and adapting to climate change further protecting and restoring natural forests and or mixed stands of native tree species might reduce the risks of the loss of biodiversity and be a viable option for sustainable

increasing soil c as a strategy to mitigate climate change smith et al 2008 and improve soil health post and kwon 2000 soc stocks decrease following conversion of forests to other land uses brahma et al 2018 and unsustainable soil management such as conventional tillage crop residue removal and in field burning excessive input of agrochemicals and reduced addition of exogenous organic matter chenu et al 2019 thus any sustainable land management practice for increasing soil c should be based on eco intensification strategies supporting its medium term efficiency and long term sustainability that are important to addressing the climate change and food security issues lal 2019 soil management and land use strategies have different effects on soc sequestration rate and storage paustian et al

vegetation types croplands and pastures are among the major sources of anthropogenic c emissions and deforestation accounts for 10 12 of c emission friedlingstein et al 2019 moreover luc activities are often linked with a loss of soil c since the supply of organic material from plant litter and the c mineralization rate are decreased and co2 emissions from soil are increased poeplau and don 2013 thus quantifying changes in soil c due to luc is important to understanding changes in soil health and the climate ipcc 2019 during the last few decades northeast india nei has faced rapid changes in

plantation systems and its changes with the age of plantations is limited to bamboo nath et al 2015 tea kalita et al 2016 and rubber plantations nath et al 2018 systems chrono sequence studies are based on the space for time substitution approach over a series of sites on which the current land use has been practiced for different time periods rather than repeated measurements over time this approach an alternative to long term studies was first applied to vegetation dynamics pickett 1989 in the chrono sequence approach soil sampling is repeated in space to compare soc changes among sites with homogeneous conditions soil climate topography etc that have the same land use history prior to conversion to the current land use ipcc 2003 therefore it is assumed that soc stocks were identical prior to the change in land use cerri et al 2003 ideally the reference sites for sampling should be under a natural vegetation cover e g forest or conventional land management e g moldboard ploughing with these assumptions using chrono sequence field studies combined with appropriate modeling is a suitable strategy for assessing changes in soc stock smith et al 2012 this approach was used to assess changes in soc stocks upon conversion from forest to pasture ecosystems in the brazilian amazon basin cerri et al 2003 2007 and in a no till nt cereals chrono sequence in northeast spain under a semi arid climate in comparison with conventional tillage Ã¡lvaro fuentes et al 2014 simulation models are increasingly being used globally to assess the effects of land use land use change and projected climate change on soil c dynamics brilli et al 2017 the rothc model jenkinson et al 1994 coleman and jenkinson 2014 is widely used to simulate changes in soc stocks rothc is a monthly time step model which calculates total organic c in soil using a few but easily available inputs and is the most widely used soil c simulation model since 2000 fao 2019 despite the ecological and economic importance of the nei studies related to soc dynamics and their simulation under land use change from natural vegetation to plantation systems are scanty mishra et al 2020 in addition there is a strong need to assess the soc sequestration potential of the main plantation systems with an increase in the plantation age to evaluate their viability for sustainable land management in comparison with the forest land use therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to assess the soc stocks under different plantations in nei and to determine the variation in soc stocks within the chrono sequence and 2 to predict changes in soc stocks with the rothc model under the baseline and projected abrupt climate change acc conditions and evaluate the trend in soc stocks these two objectives were realized by testing the following hypotheses i soc stocks are affected by the conversion of forests to plantation systems and ii soc stocks differ among different plantations and are affected by acc 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and climatic data meghalaya state in nei region of india a part of the indo burma biodiversity hotspot comprising diverse biota with high level of endemism

sampling in 2018 soil samples were collected from five plantation systems rubber tea pineapple cashew nut and areca nut of seven age classes 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 25 30 and 30 40 years old and a nearby forest native land use in each age class and in each plantation three quadrats of 10 10 m were randomly laid down and soil samples at 0 30 cm consistent with the depth for carbon accounting ipcc 2006 were collected from four corners and center to obtain a composite sample thus a total of 105 soil samples 5 land uses 7 age classes 3 replications were collected over an area of 310 km2 fig

direct in which known carbon inputs are used to calculate the changes in soc stocks and inverse when carbon inputs are calculated at equilibrium state for 10 000 years from known soc stocks in this study fig 2 rothc was firstly run at equilibrium in inverse mode on the forest land use under the baseline climate conditions average climate 1987 2018 considering the average soc stock of all the forest sites measured in 2018 that was equal to 73 6 mg c ha 1 dpm rpm was set to 0 25 deciduous or tropical woodland and a c input of 10 8 mg c ha 1 was required to match the measured soc stock thereafter the model was calibrated in direct mode on the five plantations using the measured soc stocks over the 7 age classes of the chrono sequence the model was run for 40 years in the direct mode for the five plantations by manually and iteratively adjusting the c inputs required to fit simultaneously the measured soc stocks of the seven age classes of the chrono sequence for each plantation the average clay content of all the 21 soil samplings of the chrono sequence was used cerri et al 2003 for the 7 age classes the corresponding average baseline climate data backward order were as

ha 1 the soc stock for the 30 40 years old plantations 71 2 0 03 mg c ha 1 was statistically similar to that of the 20 25 years old plantations 65 9 5 8 mg c ha 1 the rate of change in soc stock for rubber over the chrono sequence was 0 17 mg c ha 1 yr 1 table 4 the mean soc stocks in 0 5 5 10 and 10 15 years old tea plantations fig 3b were 48 5 3 7 67 3 4 4 and 94 3 7 4 mg c ha 1 respectively thereafter soc stocks decreased over time and the decline was more marked in the 20 25 years old 74 0 9 1 mg c ha 1 than those under other age plantations the soc stocks were similar 84 mg c ha 1 for the 15 20 25 30 and 30 40 years old plantations and indicated a steady state condition the rate of change in soc stock under tea over the chrono sequence was 0 89 mg c ha 1 yr 1 table 3 the initial soc stock under areca nut fig 3c of 61 4 8 2 mg c ha 1 for the 0 5 years old plantations decreased to 28 0 1 2 mg c ha 1 under the 10 15 years old plantations the soc stocks increased to 59 8 6 6 mg c ha 1 for the 25 30 years old plantations the rate of change in soc stock for areca nut over the chrono sequence was 0 20 mg c ha 1 yr 1 table 3 the average soc stocks under cashew nut fig 3d was the minimum for the 10 15 years old plantations 45 3 2 7 mg c ha 1 and increased with an increase in age to the highest 78 6 8 3 mg c ha 1 level for the 30 40 years old plantations the rate of change of soc stock for cashew nut over the chrono sequence was 0 51 mg c ha 1 yr 1 table 3 the soc stocks under pineapple for 0 5 5 10 and 10 15 years old pineapple plantations fig 3e were 65 7 3 5 74 0 5 4 and 63 3 3 8 mg c ha 1 respectively however soc stocks decreased with the increase of plantation age and the minimum values were recorded for the 30 40 years old pineapple plantations 44 5 7 4 mg c ha

mae rmse and ef the values of mae rmse and ef for the rubber simulations fig 4 a were 1 10 2 91 and 0 87 respectively and the standard deviation sd of the observed values 9 35 mg c ha 1 was higher than rmse the values of mae rmse and ef for the tea simulations fig 4b were 2 13 5 64 and 0 83 respectively and the sd of the observed values 15 13 mg c ha 1 was much higher than rmse similarly the rmse values for areca nut cashew nut and pineapple simulations fig 4c d e 4 86 3 19 and 1 72 respectively were lower than the sd of the observed values 12 05 12 20 and 10 56 mg c ha 1 in addition ef values for areca nut cashew nut and pineapple simulations fig 4c d e were 0 80 0 89 and 0 95 respectively these results indicate a strong agreement between observed and simulated data justifying the use of rothc model to simulate soc stock for the five plantation systems in nei it is worth pointing out that changing the dpm rpm ratio and or the c inputs during the chrono sequence calibration can affect the simulation results in the different land uses thus an accurate calibration of these parameters is required to get the best agreement with the observed data in rubber calibrations dpm rpm was set to 0 25 table 1 but decreasing the maximum c input to 5 mg c ha 1 compared to the best calibration 7 mg c ha 1 resulted in a low agreement between observed and simulated data mae 9 18 rmse 24 29 ef 8 20 in tea the maximum c input was set to 13 mg c ha 1 and in the best calibration the dpm rpm ratio table 1 was set to 1 44 age 0 5 0 67 age 6 10 and 0 25 age 11 40 using a dpm rpm ratio of 1 44 age 0 5 and 0 67 age 6 40 the agreement was lower mae 5 35 rmse 14 16 ef 0 06 in areca nut the dpm rpm ratio was set to 1 44 in the first 15 years and thereafter to 0 25 table 1 with a maximum c input of 8 mg c ha 1 increasing the maximum c input to 10 mg c ha 1 compared to the best calibration slightly changed the agreement between observed and simulated data mae 1 91 rmse 5 04 ef 0 79 in cashew nut the dpm rpm ratio was set to 1 44 in the first 5 years and thereafter to 0 25 table 1 with a maximum c input of 12 mg c ha 1 but decreasing the maximum c input to 10 mg c ha 1 compared to the best calibration resulted in a low agreement between observed and simulated data mae 11 64 rmse 30 79 ef 9 41 in pineapple dpm rpm ratio was set to 1 44 and in the best calibration the maximum carbon input table 1 was set to 10 mg c ha 1 from age 6 to 20 with a gradual decrease from 8 to 2 mg c ha 1 onwards using a maximum carbon input of 10 mg c ha 1 from age 6 to 40 resulted in a lower agreement between observed and simulated data mae 4 27 rmse 11 30 ef 1 07 consequently the possible ranges of soc decrease at the age of 40 years would be 22 1 38 8 20 7 31 7 and 11 1 39 7 compared to the forest at equilibrium for rubber areca nut and pineapple respectively the corresponding ranges of soc increase would be 7 0 13 3 for tea while for cashew nut soc would increase by 2 5 with the best calibration and decrease by 5 with lower c inputs 3 4 baseline climate simulations results presented in table 4 and fig 3f show that over the 40 years chrono sequence average climate 1987 2018 soc stocks decreased from the initial value at equilibrium of the forest land use 73 6 mg c ha 1 to 57 4 44 4 and 50 3 mg c ha 1 under rubber pineapple and areca nut plantations respectively the mean rate of loss was 0 41 0 73 and 0 58 mg c ha 1 yr 1 corresponding with a soc loss of about 22 40 and 32 respectively compared with the stock under forest conversely the soc stocks under tea and cashew nut plantations increased to 83 4 and 75 4 mg c ha 1 respectively i e 0 24 and 0 05 mg c ha 1 yr 1 with a soc gain of about 13 and 2 5 compared to that under forest over the 40 years chrono sequence 3 5 climate change simulations all simulations under acc refer to a period of 32 years 2019 2050 and are based on the hadcm3 model and the sres a1b mid term emission scenario described in section 2 1 table 4 and fig 3f the soc stocks under forest land use decreased slightly to 69 5 mg c ha 1 i e 0 13 mg c ha 1 yr 1 with a soc loss of 5 6 compared to the initial value at equilibrium 73 6 mg c ha 1 the simulations indicated that under the climate change scenario soc stocks will decrease to 52 7 28 2 and 52 8 mg c ha 1 under rubber pineapple and areca nut plantations respectively i e 0 65 1 42 and 0 65 mg c ha 1 yr 1 with a soc loss of 28 4 61 7 and 28 3 respectively compared to that under forest at equilibrium conversely soc stocks increased to 84 9 and 80 8 mg c ha 1 under tea and cashew nut plantations i e 0 35 and 0 23 mg c ha 1 yr 1 indicating the potential of gaining 15 4 and 9 8 respectively compared to that under forest at equilibrium 4 discussion the review of scientific literature indicates scant and inconclusive information about change in soc stocks upon conversion from tropical and subtropical native forest to plantations over chrono sequence studies some researchers i e covington 1981 lal 2005 indicated that land use change involving forest clear cutting reduces c stock in the standing living biomass and the native forest floor during the first 15 20 years based on the data from some soils of indonesia cameroon and peru van straaten et al 2015 reported that conversion of forest to plantations oil palm rubber and cocoa depleted soc content by up to 50 during the first 10 20 years such land use changes strongly reduce the initial soc stock due to soil disturbance mixing of litter layer and accelerated soil erosion thereafter a new equilibrium is reached at a timescale depending on the growth rate of the vegetation for the new land use in relation to the establishment of the studied plantations following the forest clear cutting the data presented indicate differences in soc stocks and temporal trends among plantations as follows 4 1 rubber plantations there was no clear trend in the measured soc stocks over the chrono sequence under rubber plantations table 3 fig 3a in fact similar values of soc stocks were observed for the 0 5 and 20 25 years old plantations about 65 mg c ha 1 5 10 and 30 40 years old plantations about 72 mg c ha 1 as well as for the 10 15 and 25 30 years old plantations about 50 mg c ha 1 in another study for the same district of meghalaya state of nei mishra and sarkar 2020 reported the soc stock of 54 6 mg c ha 1 for a 10 years old rubber plantation in mizoram state of nei lungmuana et al 2019 reported the soc stock of 44 8 mg c ha 1 for a 14 years old rubber plantation established on land previously under a shifting cultivation simulation of soc stocks with rothc indicated a decline from 64 mg c ha 1 in the 0 5 years old plantations to 57 mg c ha 1 i e 7 mg c ha 1 at the average rate of 0 17 mg c ha 1 yr 1 for the 30 40 years old plantations fig 3a the simulated data showed that under the baseline climate conditions for the conversion of the natural forest to rubber plantations table 4 and fig 3f the soc stocks would decrease to 57 4 mg c ha 1 0 41 mg c ha 1 yr 1 with a cumulative loss of 22 1 compared to that under the natural forest these results are in accord with the loss of 19 3 reported by de blÃ©court et al 2013 for a tropical region in china as well as with the soc decrease by 29 and 23 reported by nath et al 2018 in assam state india in 27 and 34 years old rubber plantations respectively under acc conditions the conversion of the natural forest to rubber plantations table 4 and fig 3f would result in a further decline in soc stocks to 52 7 mg c ha 1 with a 28 4 loss compared to the initial value under the natural forest 0 65 mg c ha 1 yr 1 loss of soc following the conversion of forests to rubber plantations are a consequence of local management practices that include the removal of the vegetation understory de blÃ©court et al 2013 the average c input table 1 used in the simulations 6 7 mg c ha 1 was slightly lower than that used for the study in tropical china 9 mg c ha 1 by liu et al 2017 over a chrono sequence of 7 13 19 25 and 47 years old rubber plantations liu and colleagues also reported a slight decrease in soc stocks over the chrono sequence and indicated that only degraded forests could benefit from the conversion to rubber plantations due to a rapid biomass growth rate of rubber however conversion of a natural undisturbed forests would result in a net c loss they also reported that the productive life span of rubber is limited and close to 40 years 4 2 tea plantations tea plantations in the area are typically grown within systems with shade trees kalita et al 2016 and mainly include albizia spp which are n fixing species that can also increase soc contents mao et al 2010 the measured soc stocks attained the maximum value under the 10 15 years old plantations 94 3 mg c ha 1 and thereafter reached an almost steady state condition about 84 mg c ha 1 but with a minimum value 74 0 mg c ha 1 for the 20 25 years old plantations table 3 and fig 3b li et al 2015 reported that soc concentrations were significantly lower in older 50 yr compared to 23 yr tea plantations in southwest china a similar trend was reported by kalita et al 2016 for tea plantations in assam india which also did not report a clear increase or decrease with the age of the plantation specifically soc stocks were 35 7 32 2 45 4 and 32 1 mg c ha 1 under 5 10 10 15 20 25 and 25 30 years old plantations in the same district of meghalaya state of nei mishra and sarkar 2020 reported a soc stock of 62 8 mg c ha 1 under a 10 year old tea plantation different dpm rmp ratios were used to simulate soc stocks over the chrono sequence to represent the progressive development and re establishment of a vegetation cover integrated in an agroforestry system and more similar to that of the native tropical forest table 1 average c inputs were set at 9 8 mg c ha 1 which is in accord with those reported by other authors for assam kalita 2015 and meghalaya mishra et al 2020 in nei soc stocks with rothc simulations increased from 56 mg c ha 1 under the 0 5 years old plantations to 83 mg c ha 1 i e 27 mg c ha 1 at an average rate of 0 67 mg c ha 1 yr 1 in the 30 40 years old plantations fig 3b under the baseline climate conditions the simulated results show that conversion of the natural forest to tea plantations table 4 and fig 3f would increase soc stocks to 83 4 mg c ha 1 0 24 mg c ha 1 yr 1 and result in a 13 3 gain in soc compared to the antecedent stocks under the natural forest under acc conversion of the natural forest to tea plantations table 4 and fig 3f would increase soc stocks to 84 9 mg c ha 1 with a 15 4 gain in soc 0 35 mg c ha 1 yr 1 compared to the initial value under the natural forest 4 3 areca nut plantations areca nuts produce fruits at 5 10 years after transplantation and bear fruits for more than 30 years however farmers do not remove senescent trees and new ones are planted based on availability of adequate space different dpm rmp ratios were considered to simulate soc stock over the chrono sequence in the context of a gradual development of a vegetation cover similar to that of a tropical forest table 1 average c inputs were set at 3 6 mg c ha 1 measured soc stocks table 3 and fig 3c decreased from 61 4 mg c ha 1 for the 0 5 years old plantations to 28 0 mg c ha 1 for 10 15 years old plantations and increased up to 59 8 mg c ha 1 for the 25 30 years old plantations in mizoram state of nei lungmuana et al 2019 reported a soc stock of 42 2 mg c ha 1 for a 22 years old areca nut plantation established on land previously under shifting cultivation these results are in accord with the measured value 44 5 mg c ha 1 in the chrono sequence at age 20 25 years of the present study soc stocks with rothc simulations indicated a decrease from 52 mg c ha 1 for the 0 5 years old plantations to 50 mg c ha 1 i e 2 mg c ha 1 at an average rate of 0 05 mg c ha 1 yr 1 for the 30 40 years old plantations fig 3c similar soc stocks were reported by singh et al 2018 and sahoo et al 2019 for areca nut plantations in mizoram state of nei region sahoo et al 2019 also indicated that soc stocks in areca nut plantations were about 24 lower than those of forest lands similarly brahma et al 2018 reported 28 lower soc stocks under a 30 year old areca nut plantation than that of natural forest in assam state of nei under the baseline climate conditions of the simulated results conversion of natural forest to areca nut plantations table 4 and fig 3f decreased soc stocks to 50 3 mg c ha 1 0 58 mg c ha 1 yr 1 with a 31 7 soc loss compared to the initial value for the natural forest under acc conditions conversion of the natural forest to areca nut plantations table 4 and fig 3f would result in a slight increase in soc stocks to 52 8 mg c ha 1 but with a 28 3 soc loss 0 65 mg c ha 1 yr 1 compared to the initial value for the natural forest 4 4 cashew nut plantations cashew nut trees start bearing fruits 3 years after planting reach full bearing during the tenth year and provide remunerative yields for another 20 years different dpm rmp ratios were considered to simulate soc stocks over the chrono sequence in consideration of the gradual development of a vegetation cover similar to that of a tropical forest table 1 average c inputs were set at 8 1 mg c ha 1 which is in accord with those reported for the herbaceous biomass and litter by bello et al 2017 for a tropical region of benin in west africa measured soc stocks table 3 and fig 3d indicated a decline up to 10 15 years of age 45 3 mg c ha 1 and increased to 78 6 mg c ha 1 for the 30 40 years old plantations similar values in 15 years old plantations were reported by bello et al 2017 which ranged from 40 to 58 mg c ha 1 depending on the agro ecological zone simulation of soc stocks with rothc indicated an increase from 53 mg c ha 1 for the 0 5 years old plantations to 75 mg c ha 1 i e 23 mg c ha 1 and equal to 0 57 mg c ha 1 yr 1 for the 30 40 years old plantations table 3 and fig 3d under the baseline climate conditions for the simulated results conversion of natural forest to cashew nut plantations table 4 and fig 3f would increase soc stocks to 75 4 mg c ha 1 and result in a 2 5 soc gain 0 05 mg c ha 1 yr 1 compared to the initial value under a natural forest under climate change conditions conversion of the natural forest to cashew nut plantations table 4 and fig 3f would increase soc stocks to 80 8 mg c ha 1 with a 9 8 soc gain 0 23 mg c ha 1 yr 1 compared to the initial value under the natural forest the potential of cashew nut to store large amounts of soc comparable with that under forests is also confirmed by kar et al 2020 who studied different land uses in odisha state india 4 5 pineapple plantations the planting material e g suckers and crowns bear flowers after 12 20 months since plantation establishment local cultivation practices neither use chemical fertilizers nor the removal of slips and suckers and plantations are left to regrow for several years after the first fruit harvest mathew et al 2011 dpm rmp ratio of 1 44 was considered to simulate soc stock over the chrono sequence and average c inputs were set to 6 3 mg c ha 1 table 1 measured soc stocks table 3 and fig 3e declined from 65 7 to 44 5 mg c ha 1 in the 30 40 years old plantations at a rate of 0 53 mg c ha 1 yr 1 soc stocks with rothc simulations decreased from 60 mg c ha 1 in the 0 5 years old plantations to 44 mg c ha 1 i e 16 mg c ha 1 and equal to 0 40 mg c ha 1 yr 1 in the 30 40 years old plantations fig 3e the simulated results under the baseline climate conditions show that conversion of the natural forest to pineapple plantations table 4 and fig 3f decreased soc stocks to 44 4 mg c ha 1 with a soc loss of 39 7 0 73 mg c ha 1 yr 1 compared to the initial value under the natural forest under climate change conditions conversion of natural forest to pineapple plantations table 4 and fig 3f would decrease soc stocks to 28 2 mg c ha 1 with a 61 7 soc loss 1 42 mg c ha 1 yr 1 compared to the initial value under the natural forest sierra et al 2015 stated that a scarce availability of data on alternative cropping systems is a serious limitation for assessing their impacts on soc stocks in many tropical regions in particular data availability is extremely scanty for pineapple and no chrono sequence studies are available mukul 2014 reported a soc stock of 19 9 mg c ha 1 0 20 cm for pineapple agroforestry in bangladesh about 60 lower than that under a forest land use 34 0 mg c ha 1 for a pineapple plantation in guadeloupe eastern caribbean sea sierra et al 2015 reported that soc stocks declined by 15 after 6 year from the introduction of pineapple following a sugarcane monoculture about 0 7 mg c ha 1 yr 1 gnanavelrajah et al 2008 indicated that changes in soc stocks within a same land use differed among different soil series in a tropical region of thailand with a general increase for a soil of a lower clay content and a decrease mostly for soil of a higher clay content the possible reason is that soils with high clay content are associated with high initial soc stocks that require high c inputs either to be maintained or enhanced thus it may be possible to increase soc stocks by choice of an appropriate land use 4 6 natural forest simulated results under acc conditions show that soc stocks table 4 and fig 3f decreased to 69 5 mg c ha 1 with a 5 6 soc loss compared to the initial value under a natural forest 73 6 mg c ha 1 this soc loss 4 1 mg c ha 1 is equal to 0 13 mg c ha 1 yr 1 and indicate that soc stocks under forest may also be negatively affected by acc as was also indicated by previous studies in nagaland state in nei mishra et al 2019 reporting that simulated soc decreased by 0 04 mg c ha 1 yr 1 similarly soc stock decreases under climate change in natural forests were found in iran soleimani et al 2017 with an average loss of 0 09 mg c ha 1 yr 1 kÃ¶chy et al 2015 using a global spatially explicit analysis on a 75 years scale stated that acc might result in a decrease in the soc stock in the case of tropical mountain forests where the probability that native forests are converted to cropland or plantations is high and decomposition is faster reforestation of degraded forests also affects soc content depending on the tree species soleimani et al 2019 reported that soc stocks increased by 25 and 1 1 26 years after the reforestation with cypress and alder respectively and decreased by 4 and 12 when the forest was converted to quercus and maple stands tropical forests are rich in biodiversity and show a great potential for carbon storage at ecosystem level kothandaraman et al 2020 indicated that in western ghats india tropical dry deciduous tropical semi evergreen and tropical evergreen forests can store 336 8 mg c ha 1 as average 70 5 and 25 of the total are stored in live vegetation 234 3 mg c ha 1 woody vegetation and understory detritus 17 6 mg c ha 1 litter and deadwood and soil 84 9 mg c ha 1 0 30 cm respectively the bonn challenge www bonnchallenge org launched in 2011 by the german government and the international union for conservation of nature aims to restore 350 mha of forest by 2030 three main methods are available i leaving degraded and abandoned agricultural land return to natural forest through natural regeneration ii converting marginal agricultural lands into plantations of valuable trees e g for paper or rubber production and iii switching to agroforestry i e growing crops and useful trees together natural regeneration is the cheapest and technically easiest option and recovery can be accelerated by planting native species lewis et al 2019 under this initiative india has committed 21 mha of degraded land and of this area 10 4 mha 49 5 are under the three restoration methods in particular natural restoration of forest covers 6 5 mha 62 5 agroforestry 3 6 mha 34 6 and plantations 0 3 mha 2 9 other research highlights the need to increase the focus on protecting and restoring natural forests and or mixed plantations of native tree species rather than promoting low diversity plantations osuri et al 2020 4 7 modeling uncertainties this may be the first modeling study to assess trends in soc stocks under different plantations with a chrono sequence approach and under projected acc conditions among sources of uncertainties in the simulated data are 1 a limited number of soil samplings for each age class three 2 alteration in the soc decomposition because of changes in temperature and rainfall patterns under acc which can affect model outputs and 3 a constant rate of c inputs to the soil during the simulation under acc conditions while higher or lower inputs could derive from the increase decrease of both above ground biomass and the input of residues in the plantations mishra et al 2020 5 conclusions the data presented support the first hypothesis that soc stocks are affected by the conversion of forests to plantations the rate of change of measured soc stocks over the chrono sequence ages i e 0 5 and 30 40 years old plantations increased slightly for rubber plantations but were lower than that under the forest soc stocks increased for cashew nut and tea plantations and were higher than that under the forest conversely soc stocks decreased in areca nut and pineapple plantations and were lower than that under the forest in relation to the second hypothesis simulated results indicated that under acc soc stocks would further decrease for rubber areca nut and pineapple plantations with high soc losses compared to that under the forest prior to conversion about 30 60 conversely soc stocks would increase under cashew nut and tea plantations about 10 15 compared to that under the forest before the conversion in summary results indicate that among the various land use changes from forest to plantations tea and cashew nut can provide an option for increasing soc stocks with a view to providing farmers with a financial income conversely conversion to pineapple plantations and to a lower extent also to rubber and areca nut plantations can only provide farmers with an optimal income but are not sustainable in terms of soc storage and acc mitigation additionally the permanent nature of tea plantations due to refilling of aged tea bushes with young ones avoids c loss incurred during the clear felling which is also common in other plantation crops such as rubber and areca nut therefore tea plantations conserve the stored ecosystem carbon over a long period of time and hence can contribute to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation redd when better integrated with appropriate agroforestry systems however tea and other plantation types should be preferably established on barren and degraded lands to avoid further clearance of forests and fulfill the commitments of the bonn challenge in the nei region there is a strong need to identify viable alternatives to slash and burn agriculture but recommended soil management practices following conversion of forests to plantations must maintain or enhance soc stocks and overall soil health increasing the focus on protecting and restoring natural forests and or mixed stands of native tree species rather than promoting low diversity plantations can help to maintain biodiversity and is essential for the provision of a wide range of ecosystem services that are

24646,human wildlife interactions occur where human societies interface with the natural landscape some of these interactions can be problematic and lead to negative outcomes such as the destruction of property or injury to humans or wildlife especially when they involve large carnivores such as bears developing management strategies to mitigate these negative outcomes can be costly time consuming and ethically problematic we developed an agent based model of black bears foraging in the forest urban interface of a small resort community to simulate and test a variety of management strategies the model allows to quickly and cost effectively identify those strategies such as attractant management and deterrence measures that are most likely to reduce the number of bears that become habituated to human areas and conditioned to anthropogenic food sources although increasing the likelihood that a bear is deterred from human areas did have some effect model outcomes indicated that the elimination of sources of anthropogenic food was the more effective management strategy however the model also revealed that interactions between the spatial configurations of these two approaches impacted the overall effectiveness of each notably the random distribution of an increase in deterrence across the area of interest in conjunction with a focus on attractant removal around the perimeter of said area was the most effective spatial implementation of the two strategies together this result provides a quantitative confirmation that reducing anthropogenic food availability should be the highest priority for managers seeking to reduce the number of conflict bears in urban areas but also that the spatial configuration of any applied strategies is important to consider the agent based modelling approach proved a fast and cost effective way to compare a variety of possible management strategies and the different ways in which they can be arranged in a specific landscape keywords black bears ursus americanus agent based modelling individual based modelling human wildlife interactions wildlife management 1 introduction human wildlife interactions are common for species whose habitat requirements overlap with our own the american black bear ursus americanus is one such species black bears range extends over much of north america and they favour many habitats that are suitable for human settlements garshelis et al 2016 understanding how best to reduce negative human bear interactions for the safety of bears and humans is a key management concern for affected communities black bears are omnivores whose natural diet includes insects herbaceous vegetation berries fish and mammals they are also attracted to anthropogenic food sources such as improperly stored garbage fruit trees and gardens lewis et al 2015 although black bear foraging on anthropogenic food sources is more prevalent when high quality natural food is not available baruch mordo et al 2014 obbard et al 2014 as urban area increases so does the potential overlap of human and bear territory and therefore the opportunity for a bear to access anthropogenic food sources such as kitchen scraps or garbage that have a high caloric value bears that obtain such a food reward are at risk of becoming food conditioned and may learn to associate anthropogenic features with a high quality food source hopkins et al 2010 society and mccullough 1982 if bears are not deterred or otherwise interdicted from the anthropogenic food source or the anthropogenic features in general they are at risk of becoming habituated to humans appleton 2006 elfstrÃ¶m et al 2014 herrero et al 2005 they may lose their wariness of urban areas and people making them less likely to flee when they are confronted by a human homstol 2011 mazur 2010 bears that are both habituated to humans and food conditioned hereafter conflict bears are at a high risk of a negative human bear interaction hebblewhite et al 2003

1994 lethal control measures are used in cases where a conflict bear poses a potential threat to the public spencer et al 2007 however it does not appear that even increased harvest quotas have a measurable effect on the number of human bear conflicts obbard et al 2014 and the destruction of black bears is not always a socially acceptable recourse baruch mordo et al 2011 can et al 2014 noel and pienaar 2017 further eliminating conflict bears is likely to impose sink dynamics on the local population baruch mordo et al 2014 beckmann and lackey 2008 hebblewhite et al 2003 such a dynamic where urban areas act as sinks for the general population could disproportionately affect females in the population females with cubs tend to inhabit near urban areas more frequently than do adult males elfstrÃ¶m et al 2014 either due to competition with males or potentially using the proximity to urban areas as a predator shield as has been found in some studies of brown bears ursus arctos steyaert et al 2016 this uneven sex distribution may compound the local sink dynamic as cubs of food conditioned females tend to also forage in urban areas they are thus more likely to become conflict bears and die due to interactions with people or anthropogenic features mazur and seher 2008 non lethal responses exist but their long term effectiveness is questionable translocation is sometimes attempted but continued use of this practice may be due to social pressure rather than to a high rate of success spencer et al 2007 black bears are intelligent and able to travel long distances they may return to their home range after a translocation appleton 2006 elfstrÃ¶m et al 2014 alternatively they may be relocated to an already occupied territory and face higher mortality rates another option is aversive conditioning which attempts to forge in the bear an association between humans and a negative stimulus this approach can be effective but it requires persistent application mazur 2010 and cannot reduce the degree to which a bear is food conditioned already homstol 2011 in general strategies like aversive conditioning translocation and lethal control are responses to bear behaviour they inherently address a symptom of the larger problem of human bear habitat overlap rather than reducing the potential for negative human bear interactions recent research highlights the need for more proactive strategies like reducing or eliminating food attractants available to bears by means such as public education baruch mordo et al 2011 gore et al 2006 policy change noel and pienaar 2017 harvesting or removing urban attractants like fruiting trees and bushes lewis et al 2015 or using active deterrents like electric fencing that excludes bears from strong attractants such as garbage dumps such proactive approaches which can be implemented in anticipation of bear presence should have some theoretically ideal implementation however optimal bear management strategies will differ between locations or communities due to variation in urban and natural landscape configurations can et al 2014 there is no globally optimal implementation strategy for mitigation of negative human bear interactions experimentally determining locally optimal implementations is not possible or sensible due to economic constraints time and labour demands and ethical concerns individual or agent based modelling allows for the simulation of a variety of different landscapes and management strategies at the level of individual animals grimm and railsback 2005 and is potentially an effective tool for exploring solutions to mitigating negative human wildlife interactions marley et al 2017 built a toy model that simulated black bear movement in a fictional urban and natural landscape to evaluate the likelihood of human bear conflict over a range of deterrence and food reward configurations and fractions that framework has been extended to include more realistic bear movement modelling using the resort municipality of whistler whistler british columbia canada as a case study marley et al 2019 in the present work we describe an improved and empirically validated version of this agent based model and use the model to explore the relative effectiveness of bear deterrence anthropogenic attractant removal and other management tools in reducing the number of conflict bears in a human community our simulations allowed us to compare the overall effectiveness of these different strategies as well as the interactions and synergies between them in search of the most effective management approach for whistler the results show that managing anthropogenic food sources is the single most important factor in the reduction of human bear interactions in human communities but also highlight the need to consider interactions between different spatial configurations of management strategy applications 2 study area the modelled area is in southwestern british columbia bc canada roughly 100 km north northwest of the city of vancouver bc it encompasses the entirety of the resort municipality of whistler fig 1 and represents roughly 188 9 km2 of natural and developed landscape 3 methods we used the netlogo modelling environment v6 1 1 wilensky 1999 to develop a model that simulates the movement and foraging behaviour of an individual bear moving through a landscape that represents the resort municipality of whistler bc empirical data and expert opinion as described below were used to derive landscape characteristics bear movement rules and bear habituation rules the overall model represents the whistler spatial landscape and can simulate the movement of a single bear based on the real world bear movement patterns as derived from gps collar data additionally it is visually easy to understand and communicate the model mechanics and results due to the cartographic representation of the model landscape see fig 2 for a snapshot taken from the working model 3 1 model parameter derivation 3 1 1 landscape characteristics bear food value the study area is a mosaic of natural and urban landscapes with varying levels of productivity and food availability to assign natural food values for the model landscape areas were ranked using spatial vegetation community composition data from a terrestrial ecosystem mapping tem project green 2004 evaluated with expert consultation from tony hamilton large carnivore specialist for the bc ministry of environment conservation science section different groupings of plant species were designated as individual bear habitat types and final food values for a given bear habitat type depended on the plant species present elevation and structural stage as determined by the time since last disturbance this process which converts tem landscape characteristics to a simple relative weighting of the food value as perceived by the bear would translate to other landscapes in the province for which tem data are available an assessment of another landscape for which tem data are available using this method would therefore allow the model described in this paper to be applied to that assessed landscape with relatively little additional effort in terms of landscape or data analysis a bear s vegetative diet differs seasonally bears consume more green vegetation early in the late spring and early summer and rely heavily on berries and other mast in the late summer and early fall baruch mordo 2012 coogan and raubenheimer 2016 accordingly the natural food value was assessed for two independent seasons designated the pre berry and berry seasons fig 3 for urban areas food value was determined by analysing detailed land use zoning information with a resource selection function johnson et al 2006 zoning classes visited more often by real bears were assumed to have a higher food value than those visited less frequently these derived values were scaled to match the natural food values such that maximum and minimum urban food values and natural food values were equal see fig 4 for a model snapshot depicting the initialized model landscape with included natural and urban food values 3 1 2 bear movement model derivation we calculated step length and turning angle distributions from bear movement data from eight bears seven males one female whose movement overlapped the study area homstol 2011 using the statistical language r 3 6 3 r core team 2020 and the package adehabitatlt v0 3 25 calenge 2006 location fixes for the bear movement data used for movement derivation were recorded hourly the distribution of the step lengths is bimodal figure c1 a the bear step lengths can be divided into short steps of less than 90 m and long steps of greater than or equal to 90 m we visually assessed the distribution of turn angles for the short and long steps figures c1 b c1 c short steps tended to be associated with a 180 degree turn whereas long steps tended to preserve directionality turn angles associated with long steps were most frequently between 50 and 50 these distributions were used to parameterize model bear movement as described below including turn angle differentiation in the separation of movement modes allows for an improved approximation of bear behaviour than earlier versions of this model which associated modelled step lengths with all possible turn angles 3 1 3 movement validation to assess whether the bear movement rules adequately modelled the movement behaviour of real world bears we ran a truncated version of the model for each gps collar location within the study area boundaries we used the r package adehabitatlt to calculate the heading of the bear at that point based on the bear s angle of travel from its previous location calenge 2015 we loaded these points and their associated heading data into the netlogo model of the food landscape derived in section 3 1 1 and used each point and heading combination as the start point from which the model bear could make its movement selection we then compared the food value of the location chosen by the model bear and the food value of the location chosen by the real bear for each start choice point pair available in the study area n 6115 to ensure that the model bear selection weighting is representative of the selection weighting made by real bears we recorded the food value selected for each start choice pair in addition to the twenty food values from which that value was chosen by both real bears and model bears for each such selection array we scaled all food values to the maximum value in the array and then ranked the value selected according to its position in the scaled array with this approach each value selected by the bear was assigned a ranking proportional to the maximum value available to the bear to obtain a distance value from the food value selected to the maximum food value available we calculated these distance values for all start choice pairs and compared the distribution of distance values for real bears to the distribution of distance values for the model bears to evaluate how closely the model bear food value selection mirrored that of the real bears validation results for both food value selection and the weighting of that selection are reported in the movement validation subsection of the results 3 2 model overview the model processes described in this section serve as an overview in brief a complete model description following the odd overview design concepts details protocol which is a standard framework for describing agent based models grimm et al 2020 2010 2006 is available in appendix d the purpose of this model is to simulate a black bear moving through the natural and anthropogenic landscape of the resort municipality of whistler the model compares different management strategies and evaluates their relative effectiveness within the model evaluating these strategies and their interactions provides support for actual management decisions we are specifically comparing the effectiveness of attractant management increased deterrence and reactive deterrence in reducing bear presence within urban cells to ensure that the model is realistic enough to model real bear behaviour in the context of different management regimes we considered patterns of movement and food selection we compared real and model bear step length and turn angles along with each bear s selection of food values in the landscape to determine that the model bear adequately represents the behaviour of real bears in our landscape the behaviour of the model bear is the product of the interaction between movement rules derived from gps collar data see section 3 1 2 and the estimated food value of the landscape see section 3 1 1 these movement rules and landscape characteristics inform the following processes that occur at each time step representing one hour of passed time first the bear determines whether it is in an urban or natural area if it is an urban cell the bear may be deterred and will leave the area if the bear is not deterred it will determine whether it can access food from the current urban area if it can access urban food or if it is in a natural area the bear assesses the food value of the nearby landscape and may either eat or move if the food nearby is sufficient the bear will decrease the local food value if nearby food values are below a threshold the bear will attempt to move to a higher value region see fig 5 for a flow diagram that describes the bear behaviour for a single time step when the bear moves it generates an array of possible target destinations chosen in accordance with its movement rules it selects a target destination from this array with a higher likelihood of choosing a high value target than one with a low food value in the original whistler model marley et al 2019 the bear would move directly to the target destination without interacting with the intervening cells in this modified version of the model the bear transits the landscape in an approximation of continuous movement it moves towards the target cell on a cell by cell basis always moving closer to the target cell but by way of the highest value intervening cells rather than in a direct straight path fig 6 with this rudimentary pathfinding the model bear can interact with the landscape on a more continuous scale and can interact with the model landscape as it moves towards its target this modified movement model allows the model to explore aspects of existing management approaches such as the possibility of mid movement deterrence and the exploration of management approaches that could not previously be explored like reactive deterrence agents or exclusion fencing each time the bear successfully obtains food from an urban area the bear s food conditioning and habituation levels increase in contrast every time the bear is deterred its habituation decreases these two values are tracked throughout the model run and if their combined value exceeds a threshold the bear is considered a conflict bear and the model run terminates we based this threshold value on a conflict tracking matrix used by conservation officers to determine when a particular bear should be destroyed bc ministy of forestslands 2016 appendix d 2 2 appendix figure d1 if the combined value of food conditioning and habituation never reach that threshold level the model runs for 4800 time steps to simulate 200 days the key design concepts of this model pertain to negative human bear interactions their causes and potential ways to decrease these negative interactions the first design concept is that negative human bear interactions are due at least partially to bears opportunistically foraging on anthropogenic food sources second there are different management strategies that can have different levels of effectiveness with regard to the reduction of opportunistic foraging and therefore conflict bears by modelling bear movement throughout the simulated landscape it should be possible to determine which management approaches are the most effective 3 3 scenario descriptions 3 3 1 attractant management and deterrence configuration and proportion we modelled both attractant management and increased deterrence independently to assess the impact of spatial configuration and proportion of the management approach applied we used three different possible spatial configurations random cluster and perimeter see fig 7 for examples of these configurations for each of these configurations we applied attractant management or increased deterrence to a range of proportions of urban cells from 60 100 in 10 increments for each of these fifteen combinations we ran the model 100 times for both attractant management and increased deterrence n 3000 3 3 2 attractant management configuration and increased deterrence configuration to model the interaction between configurations we ran scenarios with implementations of each spatial configuration of attractant management combined with each spatial configuration of increased deterrence attractant management and increased deterrence was applied to 75 of urban cells each management approach was implemented independently of the other the application of one management approach in a cell made the application of the other no more or less likely see appendix d 4 3 2 for each of these nine combinations we generated 100 replicate landscapes using the same initial parameters and ran the model once for each replicate n 900 3 3 3 proportion of urban area with attractant management and increased deterrence we explored the interaction between the proportion of urban cells with attractant management and the proportion of urban cells with increased deterrence the only configuration for either management approach in this scenario was random see appendix d 4 3 2 for each value from 20 100 in 20 increments each possible combination of proportion of each management approach was simulated for each of these twenty five combinations of starting parameters we generated 100 replicate landscapes and ran the model once using each of these replicates n 2500 3 3 4 reactive deterrence to evaluate the effectiveness of reactive deterrence imitating the role of a conservation officer we varied the delay and the persistence of reactive deterrence increased deterrence and attractant management were each applied independently to 75 of the urban cells and the only configuration for either management approach in this scenario was random see appendix d 4 3 2 any cells that triggered reactive deterrence increased their deterrence probability by a factor of 2 5 we assessed response delays from zero to three hours and persistence durations from two to four hours and ran 100 simulations of each possible combination of those variables n y 1200 3 4 analysis for all model scenarios described above see section scenario descriptions we fit a key outcome of the model runs the frequency that the bear becomes a conflict bear to a binomial logistic model using a generalized linear model glm we used predictor variables as appropriate for the given scenario and included interaction terms between different management approaches if significant predictor variables and interaction terms are described in table 1 we also calculated the proportion of steps taken by bears that ended in an urban cell for all scenarios evaluated and modelled that proportion as a function of the predictor variables relevant for a given scenario these values were transformed 4 results 4 1 movement validation there is reasonable agreement between cell selection in the food landscape by real and simulated bears for both berry and pre berry seasons although there are differences between real and simulated bears the densities of selected food values have similar peak values and the same overall distribution shape suggesting that the underlying patterns of food selection are the same fig 8 a model bears and real bears appear to have similar non optimal foraging behaviour when selecting food values from those available model bears selected the highest value food cell available roughly 42 of the time collared bears were only marginally more likely to select the highest value food cell at roughly 46 of the time the rank distribution of the remaining values selected by both real and model bears is similar fig 8b 4 2 attractant management configuration and proportion the proportion of urban area with attractant management and the spatial configuration of the attractant management applied both affected the likelihood that a bear would become a conflict bear over the course of a model run fig 9 a the proportion of urban area with attractant management has a significant negative effect on the probability of a bear becoming a conflict bear table 2 the perimeter configuration appears to be less effective than either the random or cluster configurations it results in a significant increase in the proportion of conflict bears generated however the interaction between the perimeter configuration and the proportion of managed area lessens the magnitude of this increase the proportion and configuration of attractant management also affected the number of steps that ended in an urban cell fig 9c while the proportion of managed cells was still highly significant appendix e1 the difference between management configurations was lower although the perimeter configuration was still significantly more likely to produce conflict bears 4 3 increased deterrence configuration and proportion increased deterrence proportion and configuration had a less dramatic effect on the model bear s final status compared to different values of attractant management fig 9b the proportion of urban cells with increased deterrence had a significant effect on the proportion of bears that became conflict bears table 3 however neither the cluster nor the perimeter configurations impacted the final status of the conflict bear differently from the random configuration the proportion and configuration of increased deterrence had very little effect on the fraction of bear steps that ended in an urban cell fig 9d the proportion of managed cells was still significant appendix e2 but the magnitude of the effect was small there was no significant difference between the random and cluster or random and perimeter configurations of increased deterrence 4 4 attractant management configuration and increased deterrence configuration the interactions between the configurations of attractant management and increased deterrence were unpredictable some of the combinations were far more effective at reducing the likelihood of a conflict bear than others fig 10 a the most effective combinations used a random configuration of increased deterrence with either a cluster or perimeter configuration of attractant management both the cluster and perimeter configurations of attractant management significantly lowered the proportion of conflict bears but the configuration of increased deterrence had no apparent effect table 4 however some configurations of increased deterrence did have a significant interaction with certain configurations of attractant management for example the interaction between clustered attractant management and clustered increased deterrence had an overall significant effect that reduced the effectiveness of either management configuration independently fig 10a table 4 the configuration of management strategies had little impact on the proportion of steps that ended in an urban cell the most effective combination of strategies was a random implementation of increased deterrence coupled with a perimeter configuration of attractant management however the difference in the proportion of conflict bears generated between different strategy combinations was less than 5 in fact none of the configurations for either management strategy appeared to have a significant effect appendix c3a appendix e3 and only the interaction between perimeter configurations had any degree of significance at all 4 5 proportion of urban area with attractant management and increased deterrence unsurprisingly the proportion of urban area with attractant management and the proportion of urban area with increased deterrence had an additive effect fig 10b the higher the proportion of each management approach the lower the likelihood of a bear becoming a conflict bear however the proportion of urban area with attractant management had a much stronger effect that the proportion of urban area with increased deterrence the mean proportion of conflict bears generated did not fall below 60 without having both increased deterrence and attractant management applied to at least 60 of the urban area the proportion of each management strategy applied had a significant effect overall table 4 the interaction between the proportions was significant as well as either increased the overall effect of the other decreased the effect of the proportions of increased deterrence and attractant management on the proportion of steps that end in urban cells is less predictable there is some decrease in that proportion of steps as the urban area with increased deterrence or attractant management increases appendix c3b but there is no obvious trend overall the proportion of increased deterrence appears to have a stronger effect but the maximum difference between combinations is minor 12 although the magnitude of the effect for either proportion was minor for both attractant management and increased deterrence the effect of the proportion applied had a significant effect on the number of bear steps that ended in an urban cell appendix e4 4 6 reactive deterrence a delayed increase in deterrence probability had a marked impact on the likelihood of a conflict bear fig 11 additional delay time between bear arrival and the reactive deterrence linearly increased the proportion of conflict bears generated the persistence of the reactive deterrence had little to no effect within groups this visualization is reinforced in table 5 the delay period has a large significant effect whereas the persistence of reactive deterrence has a minor and non significant effecttable 6 the fraction of steps that ended in an urban cell were similarly affected although to a lesser degree appendix c4 the response delay did impact the fraction of steps but only by around 5 over a range of zero to three hours of delay although this effect was of a low magnitude it was nevertheless significant appendix e5 the persistence duration had no perceptible significant effect 5 discussion 5 1 bear movement and food landscape validation modelling the behaviour and interactions of intelligent animals that learn and display individual behaviour patterns is challenging if the behaviour model is oversimplified model output will neither reflect the actions of such animals in the real world nor will it be able to provide meaningful implications for management conversely a movement model can be over fitted for a single individual in which case it would not be applicable to other local animals and could not be used to generate useful management recommendations we used the optimality of foraging behaviour as a metric for comparison between real and model bears the close approximation of average model bear behaviour to average real bear behaviour with regards to the optimal selection of food values on the landscape provided confirmation that the model was performing adequately even with simple movement and food selection rules see section 4 1 although the movement of model bears was a close approximation of the movement of the real bears used to derive the movement model see section 3 1 2 the number of real bears for which gps collar data were available in the study area was limited with only eight total bears and an unequal distribution of sexes seven males one female it is unlikely that the movement model so derived is representative of bears generally and we are unable to confidently say that the movement model used in this agent based model would adequately predict the movement of female bears within the study area 5 2 management strategy exploration 5 2 1 attractant management the results of simulations exploring the relationship between conflict bears and the proportion of urban area with attractant management confirmed the effectiveness of attractant management as a strategy for reducing the number of conflict bears in a human community the more urban area with attractant management implemented the fewer conflict bears were generated the removal of attractants serves to functionally reduce the overlap between human and bear habitat decreasing the intersectional area of these habitats where interactions are likely should lead to a reduction in interactions between species and accordingly so too should the number of problematic interactions that lead to conflict bears in reality increasing the amount of attractant management could be achieved by any number of strategies increasing the number of bear proof bins publicly available strictly enforcing management bylaws using fencing to exclude bears from gardens and waste sites restricting or removing native fruit bearing plants from urban parks and gardens and a variety of other methods the overall message from these simulations is a confirmation of a common literature consensus lower availability of high calorie and highly attractive anthropogenic food leads to fewer food conditioned bears baruch mordo 2012 mccarthy and seavoy 1994 peine 2001 model results also mirror real world systems where attractant management has been improved and negative human bear interactions have subsequently decreased madison 2008 schirokauer and boyd 1995 the spatial configuration of attractant management also played a significant role especially at higher levels of attractant management application fig 7a the perimeter configuration was notably less effective than either the random or cluster configurations especially when the attractant management strategy was applied to nearly the entire urban area this may be due to model bears that pierce the management perimeter having free access to anthropogenic food located in the interior urban areas short of a deterrence event such bears would have little reason to seek food from non urban sources and would quickly develop food conditioning like model bears real bears could easily bypass a perimeter of attractant managed cells either by traversing them directly or by using riparian or other green corridors the perimeter configuration is likely not the optimal spatial configuration of this management strategy the amount or configuration of attractant management had a less obvious effect on the proportion of bear steps that ended in an urban cell than on the proportion of conflict bears overall however there are some interesting differences in configuration effectiveness at different application proportions of attractant management fig 7c for example when 70 of the urban cells had attractant management applied the random configuration was less effective in reducing the step proportion than either the perimeter or cluster configurations at any higher proportion the random and cluster configurations were both more effective than the perimeter configuration this inflection may imply that at lower rates of attractant management the perimeter configuration does have some limited success in terms of deflecting foraging bears at the natural urban interface however once the management is applied to a high enough proportion of urban area the bears that penetrate the perimeter configuration can wander freely in the urban interior at a rate that is not possible when either the random or cluster configuration is applied this reinforces that the perimeter configuration is not an ideal implementation for attractant management 5 2 2 increased deterrence increased deterrence in the model was much less effective than attractant management increasing the urban area with increased deterrence did significantly reduce the proportion of conflict bears generated fig 6b but the magnitude of reduction was limited to around 20 fewer conflict bears when the increased deterrence strategy was applied to the entire urban area increased deterrence had a similar effect on the proportion of steps that ended in an urban cell although the effect was again significant the percentage change from 60 to 100 application of increased deterrence was about 5 fig 7d the draw of high value anthropogenic food and the associated food conditioning was enough to overcome any avoidance behaviour due to the increased likelihood of deterrence this outcome of relatively low impact of increased deterrence parallels results from studies that found little long term success in deterring bears from accessible anthropogenic food sources even with the use of active aversive conditioning measures intended to cause an association between humans and pain or noise stimuli for treated bears homstol 2011 leigh and chamberlain 2008 it is possible that frequent and repeated applications of such techniques may be successful with bears that have not already been exposed to anthropogenic food mazur 2010 an improved version of this model could accommodate differences in deterrence effectiveness between naÃ¯ve and human aware bears along with a differentiation between deterrence measures such as low impact noisemakers compared to pain causing stimuli such as rubber bullets 5 2 3 interaction between the two main management strategies the interaction between the application proportion of attractant management and increased deterrence was not surprising the higher the percentage application of both strategies the fewer conflict bears were produced fig 8b attractant management is clearly more impactful but the trend direction in the proportion of conflict bears generated is the same for either strategy interestingly there was no large interaction effect between the amount of each strategy applied on the proportion of steps ending in urban cells appendix c2b model bears could always attempt to enter urban areas regardless of the deterrence measures in place or the accessibility of food this is likely true of real bears as well as they are capable of smelling food from great distances and can travel quickly without a complete barrier around urban areas bear forays in search of anthropogenic food will likely decrease to a certain point and then plateau rather than stopping entirely the interactions between the spatial configurations of the strategies are less clear there is no combination of like configurations that is the most effective of the options for a given configuration for example cluster attractant management and cluster increased deterrence one of the heterogeneous combinations is always more effective than a like pairing fig 8a only in the case of randomly applied attractant management and perimeter applied increased deterrence is the combination of matching configurations not the least effective this trend is most clear when each strategy is applied in the perimeter spatial configuration this combination of strategies generated the highest proportion of conflict bears since the perimeter strategy was in general less effective for both attractant management and increased deterrence when tested on their own it follows that any bears that penetrate the managed perimeter would be free from either attractant management or increased deterrence measures the perimeter configuration performed poorly for each strategy independently and in combination it is surprising that one of the combinations of strategies most effective at reducing the proportion of conflict bears was perimeter applied attractant management in combination with randomly applied increased deterrence fig 8a this outcome is likely due to synergy between the configurations first foraging model bears are less likely to be attracted to the attractant managed border since food is not accessible on those cells compared to food readily available on nearby natural cells second any bears that do manage to penetrate the attractant managed border of urban areas have a high likelihood of being deterred even within the urban core since increased deterrence is applied randomly throughout a similar synergy is probably occurring in the case of the other most effective configuration combinations of clustered attractant management and random increased deterrence large clusters of urban area including segments of the border are unappealing to model bears due to attractant management any bears that move into a cluster without attractant management are likely to be deterred to the nearest natural cell due to the randomly configured increased deterrence 5 3 reactive deterrence we used response delay and persistence of that response as a proxy for real world reactive agents that respond to bear sightings and actively seek out the bear to deter it such as conservation officers park rangers or trained dog teams it appears that the key factor in the effectiveness of such a response is its rapidity for both the proportion of conflict bears generated and the proportion of steps that ended in an urban cell the persistence of the response had no bearing on the outcome table 5 a rapid reactive response was highly effective in reducing the proportion of conflict bears generated but the decay in effectiveness was swift for each additional hour of delay between a bear entering an urban area and the local increase in deterrence likelihood the proportion of conflict bears increased by 15 25 quick response times in the model are analogous to having sufficient personnel available to respond to bear sightings to effectively employ reactive deterrence in a real world scenario the delay between a bear sighting and the arrival of deterrence agents should be made as short as possible through the employment of enough trained staff to respond quickly to bear sightings alternatively this strategy would likely work well as a support to passive strategies like attractant management 5 4 comparison to previous model the major modifications in relation to the previously published model marley et al 2019 pertain to movement the movement model now incorporates multiple modes of movement foraging and travel for both turn angles and step lengths for the model bear the model bear now travels across the landscape in a functionally continuous way rather than ignoring potential barrier features like lakes glaciers etc and the model bear moves in an indirect path to simulate natural pathfinding through a landscape varied in perceived food value even with these modifications some of the key results are similar across both models for example both models indicate that preventative action such as limiting bear access to anthropogenic food sources is the most effective approach to reduce the number of conflict bears generated and that perimeter configurations of management strategies tend to be less effective than either random or clustered configuration this may indicate that in cases where time or resources are limited using a simpler movement model may give adequate or equivalent results as a more complex movement model in this paper we extended the prior analyses and incorporated examination of the interaction between spatial configurations and explored the additional management approach of reactive deterrence that would not have been suitably explored without continuous movement 5 5 future strategy exploration and model improvement bear movement in the model presented here is simplified the bears follow basic movement rules as they seek out potential target cells with sufficient food accordingly the evaluation of food values and the implementation of those values into the model landscape is critical the food values in this model are likely conservative they are based substantively on the assessment of vegetation inventories green 2004 and rely on expert opinion ideally food values in future models could be based on step selection functions thurfjell et al 2014 or other similar approaches and evaluate multiple landscape characteristics to better approximate the landscape as perceived by bears given sufficient collar location data such an approach could be used to determine urban and natural food values concurrently since urban food values are scaled relative to natural food values in this model it is possible that model bears are undervaluing urban food which is typically of a high caloric value model bears do not learn in a meaningful or impactful way and since memory is implemented on a cell by cell basis the likelihood that a model bear s prior actions will affect its later decisions is low additionally for some potential management strategies limited data are available that describe bear response to those strategies for example high resolution gps collar data or other tracking records for bear interactions with electric fencing are absent or limited in the literature for these reasons more complicated management strategies than those described in the results section or strategies that rely on more advanced artificial bear intelligence were not successfully implemented in this iteration of the whistler bear model a variety of large scale fencing strategies were attempted with mixed results see appendix d 4 3 7 for an implementation based on available movement data as expected implementing a complete barrier around any urban areas was 100 effective in reducing the probability of conflict bears as this approach completely excluded model bears from any anthropogenic food we tested more practical and nuanced approaches as well such as strategically placing linear or curved barrier fences across key movement corridors as determined from gps paths taken by real bears or placing fences at intervals around the entirety of the urban area none of these more specifically formulated fences reduced the likelihood of the generation of a conflict bear in some cases a specific fencing implementation actually increased the proportion of conflict bears generated in such cases the bears appeared to pass through a gap in the fencing and then would often bounce back if they attempted to leave the urban area these bears were essentially trapped in or near urban areas by the fencing intended to keep them out it seems likely that real bears would be able to navigate such obstacles more successfully whether by scent or memory thus conclusions from the fencing implementations were not expected to translate well to real bears we also explored management strategies that employed vegetation modification to alter bear behaviour as a proxy for techniques like supplemental feeding partridge et al 2001 robbins et al 2004 we tried a variety of modifications to the food landscape examples of which include the reduction of natural food values in a band encircling any urban areas the increase of natural food values in a band placed far from urban areas and point increases of the natural food value however due to the limited per step potential steps there was little likelihood that a model bear would be affected by these modifications only in extreme and unrealistic cases such as a 200 m wide band of enriched natural food was the model bear effectively diverted from urban areas these unsuccessful attempts to investigate an alternative management strategy highlight the need for behavioural models that accurately reflect the actions of intelligent animals that can learn and remember rather than simply following basic movement rules improved sensing and diffuse memory are two components that could be incorporated into this model to explore more complicated management strategies 6 conclusion the principal outcome of this study is a quantitative confirmation that the reduction of anthropogenic food available as forage is the single most important factor to consider in the management of black bears other approaches such as increasing the likelihood that a bear will be deterred from a site with human food do influence the probability of the generation of a conflict bear but the magnitude of this influence is relatively small compared to the effect of attractant management in management scenarios with limited resources the reduction of anthropogenic food sources should be prioritized above other strategies in most cases of course multiple management strategies would be employed in tandem no applied strategy will ever be 100 effective but multiple strategies implemented in the same system can shore up weaknesses in each other this was most evident in comparing effectiveness amongst model strategies combining perimeter configured attractant management on its own an ineffective configuration with randomly configured increased deterrence being one of the most effective possible combinations this case study provides an example of an agent based modelling approach to evaluating diverse management strategies in a cost effective fast and ethically sound manner the variety and number of approaches explored in a simulated environment would not be possible in an experiential learning context for example the real world time required to test even a small number of the replicates modelled above makes experimental testing unfeasible for comparing the effectiveness of one strategy over another additionally the model s replication of the natural and urban configurations allows for tailored management regimes the ability to simulate various strategy types and configurations multiple times in an identical landscape which would prove challenging with any long lived animal can generate management plans customized to specific communities although this model was configured for the whistler landscape the agent based modelling approach used here could easily be adapted for other communities using appropriate landscape data and either the current bear movement parameters or movement parameters derived from bears local to the community of interest once constructed such a model can be modified to simulate a variety of questions and scenarios specific to that community given appropriate gps collar data the model could also be modified to simulate movement and behaviour of other species as needed this approach using agent based modelling to test management strategies can thereby be generally applicable to any community seeking to explore solutions for reducing local human wildlife

24646,human wildlife interactions occur where human societies interface with the natural landscape some of these interactions can be problematic and lead to negative outcomes such as the destruction of property or injury to humans or wildlife especially when they involve large carnivores such as bears developing management strategies to mitigate these negative outcomes can be costly time consuming and ethically problematic we developed an agent based model of black bears foraging in the forest urban interface of a small resort community to simulate and test a variety of management strategies the model allows to quickly and cost effectively identify those strategies such as attractant management and deterrence measures that are most likely to reduce the number of bears that become habituated to human areas and conditioned to anthropogenic food sources although increasing the likelihood that a bear is deterred from human areas did have some effect model outcomes indicated that the elimination of sources of anthropogenic food was the more effective management strategy however the model also revealed that interactions between the spatial configurations of these two approaches impacted the overall effectiveness of each notably the random distribution of an increase in deterrence across the area of interest in conjunction with a focus on attractant removal around the perimeter of said area was the most effective spatial implementation of the two strategies together this result provides a quantitative confirmation that reducing anthropogenic food availability should be the highest priority for managers seeking to reduce the number of conflict bears in urban areas but also that the spatial configuration of any applied strategies is important to consider the agent based modelling approach proved a fast and cost effective way to compare a variety of possible management strategies and the different ways in which they can be arranged in a specific landscape keywords black bears ursus americanus agent based modelling individual based modelling human wildlife interactions wildlife management 1 introduction human wildlife interactions are common for species whose habitat requirements overlap with our own the american black bear ursus americanus is one such species black bears range extends over much of north america and they favour many habitats that are suitable for human settlements garshelis et al 2016 understanding how best to reduce negative human bear interactions for the safety of bears and humans is a key management concern for affected communities black bears are omnivores whose natural diet includes insects herbaceous vegetation berries fish and mammals they are also attracted to anthropogenic food sources such as improperly stored garbage fruit trees and gardens lewis et al 2015 although black bear foraging on anthropogenic food sources is more prevalent when high quality natural food is not available baruch mordo et al 2014 obbard et al 2014 as urban area increases so does the potential overlap of human and bear territory and therefore the opportunity for a bear to access anthropogenic food sources such as kitchen scraps or garbage that have a high caloric value bears that obtain such a food reward are at risk of becoming food conditioned and may learn to associate anthropogenic features with a high quality food source hopkins et al 2010 society and mccullough 1982 if bears are not deterred or otherwise interdicted from the anthropogenic food source or the anthropogenic features in general they are at risk of becoming habituated to humans appleton 2006 elfstrÃ¶m et al 2014 herrero et al 2005 they may lose their wariness of urban areas and people making them less likely to flee when they are confronted by a human homstol 2011 mazur 2010 bears that are both habituated to humans and food conditioned hereafter conflict bears are at a high risk of a negative human bear interaction hebblewhite et al 2003 herrero and higgins 2003 lewis et al 2015 conflict bears may damage human property or crops and may also pose a threat to pets or humans herrero et al 2011 herrero and higgins 2003 mccarthy and seavoy 1994 lethal control measures are used in cases where a conflict bear poses a potential threat to the public spencer et al 2007 however it does not appear that even increased harvest quotas have a measurable effect on the number of human bear conflicts obbard et al 2014 and the destruction of black bears is not always a socially acceptable recourse baruch mordo et al 2011 can et al 2014 noel and pienaar 2017 further eliminating conflict bears is likely to impose sink dynamics on the local population baruch mordo et al 2014 beckmann and lackey 2008 hebblewhite et al 2003 such a dynamic where urban areas act as sinks for the general population could disproportionately affect females in the population females with cubs tend to inhabit near urban areas more frequently than do adult males elfstrÃ¶m et al 2014 either due to competition with males or potentially using the proximity to urban areas as a predator shield as has been found in some studies of brown bears ursus arctos steyaert et al 2016 this uneven sex distribution may compound the local sink dynamic as cubs of food conditioned females tend to also forage in urban areas they are thus more likely to become conflict bears and die due to interactions with people or anthropogenic features mazur and seher 2008 non lethal responses exist but their long term effectiveness is questionable translocation is sometimes attempted but continued use of this practice may be due to social pressure rather than to a high rate of success spencer et al 2007 black bears are intelligent and able to travel long distances they may return to their home range after a translocation appleton 2006 elfstrÃ¶m et al 2014 alternatively they may be relocated to an already occupied territory and face higher mortality rates another option is aversive conditioning which attempts to forge in the bear an association between humans and a negative stimulus this approach can be effective but it requires persistent application mazur 2010 and cannot reduce the degree to which a bear is food conditioned already homstol 2011 in general strategies like aversive conditioning translocation and lethal control are responses to bear behaviour they inherently address a symptom of the larger problem of human bear habitat overlap rather than reducing the potential for negative human bear interactions recent research highlights the need for more proactive strategies like reducing or eliminating food attractants available to bears by means such as public education baruch mordo et al 2011 gore et al 2006 policy change noel and pienaar 2017 harvesting or removing urban attractants like fruiting trees and bushes lewis et al 2015 or using active deterrents like electric fencing that excludes bears from strong attractants such as garbage dumps such proactive approaches which can be implemented in anticipation of bear presence should have some theoretically ideal implementation however optimal bear management strategies will differ between locations or communities due to variation in urban and natural landscape configurations can et al 2014 there is no globally optimal implementation strategy for mitigation of negative human bear interactions experimentally determining locally optimal implementations is not possible or sensible due to economic constraints time and labour demands and ethical concerns individual or agent based modelling allows for the simulation of a variety of different landscapes and management strategies at the level of individual animals grimm and railsback 2005 and is potentially an effective tool for exploring solutions to mitigating negative human wildlife interactions marley et al 2017 built a toy model that simulated black bear movement in a fictional urban and natural landscape to evaluate the likelihood of human bear conflict over a range of deterrence and food reward configurations and fractions that framework has been extended to include more realistic bear movement modelling using the resort municipality of whistler whistler british columbia canada as a case study marley et al 2019 in the present work we describe an improved and empirically validated version of this agent based model and use the model to explore the relative effectiveness of bear deterrence anthropogenic attractant removal and other management tools in reducing the number of conflict bears in a human community our simulations allowed us to compare the overall effectiveness of these different strategies as well as the interactions and synergies between them in search of the most effective management approach for whistler the results show that managing anthropogenic food sources is the single most important factor in the reduction of human bear interactions in human communities but also highlight the need to consider interactions between different spatial configurations of management strategy applications 2 study area the modelled area is in southwestern british columbia bc canada roughly 100 km north northwest of the city of vancouver bc it encompasses the entirety of the resort municipality of whistler fig 1 and represents roughly 188 9 km2 of natural and developed landscape 3 methods we used the netlogo modelling environment v6 1 1 wilensky 1999 to develop a model that simulates the movement and foraging behaviour of an individual bear moving through a landscape that represents the resort municipality of whistler bc empirical data and expert opinion as described below were used to derive landscape characteristics bear movement rules and bear habituation rules the overall model represents the whistler spatial landscape and can simulate the movement of a single bear based on the real world bear movement patterns as derived from gps collar data additionally it is visually easy to understand and communicate the model mechanics and results due to the cartographic representation of the model landscape see fig 2 for a snapshot taken from the working model 3 1 model parameter derivation 3 1 1 landscape characteristics bear food value the study area is a mosaic of natural and urban landscapes with varying levels of productivity and food availability to assign natural food values for the model landscape areas were ranked using spatial vegetation community composition data from a terrestrial ecosystem mapping tem project green 2004 evaluated with expert consultation from tony hamilton large carnivore specialist for the bc ministry of environment conservation science section different groupings of plant species were designated as individual bear habitat types and final food values for a given bear habitat type depended on the plant species present elevation and structural stage as determined by the time since last disturbance this process which converts tem landscape characteristics to a simple relative weighting of the food value as perceived by the bear would translate to other landscapes in the province for which tem data are available an assessment of another landscape for which tem data are available using this method would therefore allow the model described in this paper to be applied to that assessed landscape with relatively little additional effort in terms of landscape or data analysis a bear s vegetative diet differs seasonally bears consume more green vegetation early in the late spring and early summer and rely heavily on berries and other mast in the late summer and early fall baruch mordo 2012 coogan and raubenheimer 2016 accordingly the natural food value was assessed for two independent seasons designated the pre berry and berry seasons fig 3 for urban areas food value was determined by analysing detailed land use zoning information with a resource selection function johnson et al 2006 zoning classes visited more often by real bears were assumed to have a higher food value than those visited less frequently these derived values were scaled to match the natural food values such that maximum and minimum urban food values and natural food values were equal see fig 4 for a model snapshot depicting the initialized model landscape with included natural and urban food values 3 1 2 bear movement model derivation we calculated step length and turning angle distributions from bear movement data from eight bears seven males one female whose movement overlapped the study area homstol 2011 using the statistical language r 3 6 3 r core team 2020 and the package adehabitatlt v0 3 25 calenge 2006 location fixes for the bear movement data used for movement derivation were recorded hourly the distribution of the step lengths is bimodal figure c1 a the bear step lengths can be divided into short steps of less than 90 m and long steps of greater than or equal to 90 m we visually assessed the distribution of turn angles for the short and long steps figures c1 b c1 c short steps tended to be associated with a 180 degree turn whereas long steps tended to preserve directionality turn angles associated with long steps were most frequently between 50 and 50 these distributions were used to parameterize model bear movement as described below including turn angle differentiation in the separation of movement modes allows for an improved approximation of bear behaviour than earlier versions of this model which associated modelled step lengths with all possible turn angles 3 1 3 movement validation to assess whether the bear movement rules adequately modelled the movement behaviour of real world bears we ran a truncated version of the model for each gps collar location within the study area boundaries we used the r package adehabitatlt to calculate the heading of the bear at that point based on the bear s angle of travel from its previous location calenge 2015 we loaded these points and their associated heading data into the netlogo model of the food landscape derived in section 3 1 1 and used each point and heading combination as the start point from which the model bear could make its movement selection we then compared the food value of the location chosen by the model bear and the food value of the location chosen by the real bear for each start choice point pair available in the study area n 6115 to ensure that the model bear selection weighting is representative of the selection weighting made by real bears we recorded the food value selected for each start choice pair in addition to the twenty food values from which that value was chosen by both real bears and model bears for each such selection array we scaled all food values to the maximum value in the array and then ranked the value selected according to its position in the scaled array with this approach each value selected by the bear was assigned a ranking proportional to the maximum value available to the bear to obtain a distance value from the food value selected to the maximum food value available we calculated these distance values for all start choice pairs and compared the distribution of distance values for real bears to the distribution of distance values for the model bears to evaluate how closely the model bear food value selection mirrored that of the real bears validation results for both food value selection and the weighting of that selection are reported in the movement validation subsection of the results 3 2 model overview the model processes described in this section serve as an overview in brief a complete model description following the odd overview design concepts details protocol which is a standard framework for describing agent based models grimm et al 2020 2010 2006 is available in appendix d the purpose of this model is to simulate a black bear moving through the natural and anthropogenic landscape of the resort municipality of whistler the model compares different management strategies and evaluates their relative effectiveness within the model evaluating these strategies and their interactions provides support for actual management decisions we are specifically comparing the effectiveness of attractant management increased deterrence and reactive deterrence in reducing bear presence within urban cells to ensure that the model is realistic enough to model real bear behaviour in the context of different management regimes we considered patterns of movement and food selection we compared real and model bear step length and turn angles along with each bear s selection of food values in the landscape to determine that the model bear adequately represents the behaviour of real bears in our landscape the behaviour of the model bear is the product of the interaction between movement rules derived from gps collar data see section 3 1 2 and the estimated food value of the landscape see section 3 1 1 these movement rules and landscape characteristics inform the following processes that occur at each time step representing one hour of passed time first the bear determines whether it is in an urban or natural area if it is an urban cell the bear may be deterred and will leave the area if the bear is not deterred it will determine whether it can access food from the current urban area if it can access urban food or if it is in a natural area the bear assesses the food value of the nearby landscape and may either eat or move if the food nearby is sufficient the bear will decrease the local food value if nearby food values are below a threshold the bear will attempt to move to a higher value region see fig 5 for a flow diagram that describes the bear behaviour for a single time step when the bear moves it generates an array of possible target destinations chosen in accordance with its movement rules it selects a target destination from this array with a higher likelihood of choosing a high value target than one with a low food value in the original whistler model marley et al 2019 the bear would move directly to the target destination without interacting with the intervening cells in this modified version of the model the bear transits the landscape in an approximation of continuous movement it moves towards the target cell on a cell by cell basis always moving closer to the target cell but by way of the highest value intervening cells rather than in a direct straight path fig 6 with this rudimentary pathfinding the model bear can interact with the landscape on a more continuous scale and can interact with the model landscape as it moves towards its target this modified movement model allows the model to explore aspects of existing management approaches such as the possibility of mid movement deterrence and the exploration of management approaches that could not previously be explored like reactive deterrence agents or exclusion fencing each time the bear successfully obtains food from an urban area the bear s food conditioning and habituation levels increase in contrast every time the bear is deterred its habituation decreases these two values are tracked throughout the model run and if their combined value exceeds a threshold the bear is considered a conflict bear and the model run terminates we based this threshold value on a conflict tracking matrix used by conservation officers to determine when a particular bear should be destroyed bc ministy of forestslands 2016 appendix d 2 2 appendix figure d1 if the combined value of food conditioning and habituation never reach that threshold level the model runs for 4800 time steps to simulate 200 days the key design concepts of this model pertain to negative human bear interactions their causes and potential ways to decrease these negative interactions the first design concept is that negative human bear interactions are due at least partially to bears opportunistically foraging on anthropogenic food sources second there are different management strategies that can have different levels of effectiveness with regard to the reduction of opportunistic foraging and therefore conflict bears by modelling bear movement throughout the simulated landscape it should be possible to determine which management approaches are the most effective 3 3 scenario descriptions 3 3 1 attractant management and deterrence configuration and proportion we modelled both attractant management and increased deterrence independently to assess the impact of spatial configuration and proportion of the management approach applied we used three different possible spatial configurations random cluster and perimeter see fig 7 for examples of these configurations for each of these configurations we applied attractant management or increased deterrence to a range of proportions of urban cells from 60 100 in 10 increments for each of these fifteen combinations we ran the model 100 times for both attractant management and increased deterrence n 3000 3 3 2 attractant management configuration and increased deterrence configuration to model the interaction between configurations we ran scenarios with implementations of each spatial configuration of attractant management combined with each spatial configuration of increased deterrence attractant management and increased deterrence was applied to 75 of urban cells each management approach was implemented independently of the other the application of one management approach in a cell made the application of the other no more or less likely see appendix d 4 3 2 for each of these nine combinations we generated 100 replicate landscapes using the same initial parameters and ran the model once for each replicate n 900 3 3 3 proportion of urban area with attractant management and increased deterrence we explored the interaction between the proportion of urban cells with attractant management and the proportion of urban cells with increased deterrence the only configuration for either management approach in this scenario was random see appendix d 4 3 2 for each value from 20 100 in 20 increments each possible combination of proportion of each management approach was simulated for each of these twenty five combinations of starting parameters we generated 100 replicate landscapes and ran the model once using each of these replicates n 2500 3 3 4 reactive deterrence to evaluate the effectiveness of reactive deterrence imitating the role of a conservation officer we varied the delay and the persistence of reactive deterrence increased deterrence and attractant management were each applied independently to 75 of the urban cells and the only configuration for either management approach in this scenario was random see appendix d 4 3 2 any cells that triggered reactive deterrence increased their deterrence probability by a factor of 2 5 we assessed response delays from zero to three hours and persistence durations from two to four hours and ran 100 simulations of each possible combination of those variables n y 1200 3 4 analysis for all model scenarios described above see section scenario descriptions we fit a key outcome of the model runs the frequency that the bear becomes a conflict bear to a binomial logistic model using a generalized linear model glm we used predictor variables as appropriate for the given scenario and included interaction terms between different management approaches if significant predictor variables and interaction terms are described in table 1 we also calculated the proportion of steps taken by bears that ended in an urban cell for all scenarios evaluated and modelled that proportion as a function of the predictor variables relevant for a given scenario these values were transformed 4 results 4 1 movement validation there is reasonable agreement between cell selection in the food landscape by real and simulated bears for both berry and pre berry seasons although there are differences between real and simulated bears the densities of selected food values have similar peak values and the same overall distribution shape suggesting that the underlying patterns of food selection are the same fig 8 a model bears and real bears appear to have similar non optimal foraging behaviour when selecting food values from those available model bears selected the highest value food cell available roughly 42 of the time collared bears were only marginally more likely to select the highest value food cell at roughly 46 of the time the rank distribution of the remaining values selected by both real and model bears is similar fig 8b 4 2 attractant management configuration and proportion the proportion of urban area with attractant management and the spatial configuration of the attractant management applied both affected the likelihood that a bear would become a conflict bear over the course of a model run fig 9 a the proportion of urban area with attractant management has a significant negative effect on the probability of a bear becoming a conflict bear table 2 the perimeter configuration appears to be less effective than either the random or cluster configurations it results in a significant increase in the proportion of conflict bears generated however the interaction between the perimeter configuration and the proportion of managed area lessens the magnitude of this increase the proportion and configuration of attractant management also affected the number of steps that ended in an urban cell fig 9c while the proportion of managed cells was still highly significant appendix e1 the difference between management configurations was lower although the perimeter configuration was still significantly more likely to produce conflict bears 4 3 increased deterrence configuration and proportion increased deterrence proportion and configuration had a less dramatic effect on the model bear s final status compared to different values of attractant management fig 9b the proportion of urban cells with increased deterrence had a significant effect on the proportion of bears that became conflict bears table 3 however neither the cluster nor the perimeter configurations impacted the final status of the conflict bear differently from the random configuration the proportion and configuration of increased deterrence had very little effect on the fraction of bear steps that ended in an urban cell fig 9d the proportion of managed cells was still significant appendix e2 but the magnitude of the effect was small there was no significant difference between the random and cluster or random and perimeter configurations of increased deterrence 4 4 attractant management configuration and increased deterrence configuration the interactions between the configurations of attractant management and increased deterrence were unpredictable some of the combinations were far more effective at reducing the likelihood of a conflict bear than others fig 10 a the most effective combinations used a random configuration of increased deterrence with either a cluster or perimeter configuration of attractant management both the cluster and perimeter configurations of attractant management significantly lowered the proportion of conflict bears but the configuration of increased deterrence had no apparent effect table 4 however some configurations of increased deterrence did have a significant interaction with certain configurations of attractant management for example the interaction between clustered attractant management and clustered increased deterrence had an overall significant effect that reduced the effectiveness of either management configuration independently fig 10a table 4 the configuration of management strategies had little impact on the proportion of steps that ended in an urban cell the most effective combination of strategies was a random implementation of increased deterrence coupled with a perimeter configuration of attractant management however the difference in the proportion of conflict bears generated between different strategy combinations was less than 5 in fact none of the configurations for either management strategy appeared to have a significant effect appendix c3a appendix e3 and only the interaction between perimeter configurations had any degree of significance at all 4 5 proportion of urban area with attractant management and increased deterrence unsurprisingly the proportion of urban area with attractant management and the proportion of urban area with increased deterrence had an additive effect fig 10b the higher the proportion of each management approach the lower the likelihood of a bear becoming a conflict bear however the proportion of urban area with attractant management had a much stronger effect that the proportion of urban area with increased deterrence the mean proportion of conflict bears generated did not fall below 60 without having both increased deterrence and attractant management applied to at least 60 of the urban area the proportion of each management strategy applied had a significant effect overall table 4 the interaction between the proportions was significant as well as either increased the overall effect of the other decreased the effect of the proportions of increased deterrence and attractant management on the proportion of steps that end in urban cells is less predictable there is some decrease in that proportion of steps as the urban area with increased deterrence or attractant management increases appendix c3b but there is no obvious trend overall the proportion of increased deterrence appears to have a stronger effect but the maximum difference between combinations is minor 12 although the magnitude of the effect for either proportion was minor for both attractant management and increased deterrence the effect of the proportion applied had a significant effect on the number of bear steps that ended in an urban cell appendix e4 4 6 reactive deterrence a delayed increase in deterrence probability had a marked impact on the likelihood of a conflict bear fig 11 additional delay time between bear arrival and the reactive deterrence linearly increased the proportion of conflict bears generated the persistence of the reactive deterrence had little to no effect within groups this visualization is reinforced in table 5 the delay period has a large significant effect whereas the persistence of reactive deterrence has a minor and non significant effecttable 6 the fraction of steps that ended in an urban cell were similarly affected although to a lesser degree appendix c4 the response delay did impact the fraction of steps but only by around 5 over a range of zero to three hours of delay although this effect was of a low magnitude it was nevertheless significant appendix e5 the persistence duration had no perceptible significant effect 5 discussion 5 1 bear movement and food landscape validation modelling the behaviour and interactions of intelligent animals that learn and display individual behaviour patterns is challenging if the behaviour model is oversimplified model output will neither reflect the actions of such animals in the real world nor will it be able to provide meaningful implications for management conversely a movement model can be over fitted for a single individual in which case it would not be applicable to other local animals and could not be used to generate useful management recommendations we used the optimality of foraging behaviour as a metric for comparison between real and model bears the close approximation of average model bear behaviour to average real bear behaviour with regards to the optimal selection of food values on the landscape provided confirmation that the model was performing adequately even with simple movement and food selection rules see section 4 1 although the movement of model bears was a close approximation of the movement of the real bears used to derive the movement model see section 3 1 2 the number of real bears for which gps collar data were available in the study area was limited with only eight total bears and an unequal distribution of sexes seven males one female it is unlikely that the movement model so derived is representative of bears generally and we are unable to confidently say that the movement model used in this agent based model would adequately predict the movement of female bears within the study area 5 2 management strategy exploration 5 2 1 attractant management the results of simulations exploring the relationship between conflict bears and the proportion of urban area with attractant management confirmed the effectiveness of attractant management as a strategy for reducing the number of conflict bears in a human community the more urban area with attractant management implemented the fewer conflict bears were generated the removal of attractants serves to functionally reduce the overlap between human and bear habitat decreasing the intersectional area of these habitats where interactions are likely should lead to a reduction in interactions between species and accordingly so too should the number of problematic interactions that lead to conflict bears in reality increasing the amount of attractant management could be achieved by any number of strategies increasing the number of bear proof bins publicly available strictly enforcing management bylaws using fencing to exclude bears from gardens and waste sites restricting or removing native fruit bearing plants from urban parks and gardens and a variety of other methods the overall message from these simulations is a confirmation of a common literature consensus lower availability of high calorie and highly attractive anthropogenic food leads to fewer food conditioned bears baruch mordo 2012 mccarthy and seavoy 1994 peine 2001 model results also mirror real world systems where attractant management has been improved and negative human bear interactions have subsequently decreased madison 2008 schirokauer and boyd 1995 the spatial configuration of attractant management also played a significant role especially at higher levels of attractant management application fig 7a the perimeter configuration was notably less effective than either the random or cluster configurations especially when the attractant management strategy was applied to nearly the entire urban area this may be due to model bears that pierce the management perimeter having free access to anthropogenic food located in the interior urban areas short of a deterrence event such bears would have little reason to seek food from non urban sources and would quickly develop food conditioning like model bears real bears could easily bypass a perimeter of attractant managed cells either by traversing them directly or by using riparian or other green corridors the perimeter configuration is likely not the optimal spatial configuration of this management strategy the amount or configuration of attractant management had a less obvious effect on the proportion of bear steps that ended in an urban cell than on the proportion of conflict bears overall however there are some interesting differences in configuration effectiveness at different application proportions of attractant management fig 7c for example when 70 of the urban cells had attractant management applied the random configuration was less effective in reducing the step proportion than either the perimeter or cluster configurations at any higher proportion the random and cluster configurations were both more effective than the perimeter configuration this inflection may imply that at lower rates of attractant management the perimeter configuration does have some limited success in terms of deflecting foraging bears at the natural urban interface however once the management is applied to a high enough proportion of urban area the bears that penetrate the perimeter configuration can wander freely in the urban interior at a rate that is not possible when either the random or cluster configuration is applied this reinforces that the perimeter configuration is not an ideal implementation for attractant management 5 2 2 increased deterrence increased deterrence in the model was much less effective than attractant management increasing the urban area with increased deterrence did significantly reduce the proportion of conflict bears generated fig 6b but the magnitude of reduction was limited to around 20 fewer conflict bears when the increased deterrence strategy was applied to the entire urban area increased deterrence had a similar effect on the proportion of steps that ended in an urban cell although the effect was again significant the percentage change from 60 to 100 application of increased deterrence was about 5 fig 7d the draw of high value anthropogenic food and the associated food conditioning was enough to overcome any avoidance behaviour due to the increased likelihood of deterrence this outcome of relatively low impact of increased deterrence parallels results from studies that found little long term success in deterring bears from accessible anthropogenic food sources even with the use of active aversive conditioning measures intended to cause an association between humans and pain or noise stimuli for treated bears homstol 2011 leigh and chamberlain 2008 it is possible that frequent and repeated applications of such techniques may be successful with bears that have not already been exposed to anthropogenic food mazur 2010 an improved version of this model could accommodate differences in deterrence effectiveness between naÃ¯ve and human aware bears along with a differentiation between deterrence measures such as low impact noisemakers compared to pain causing stimuli such as rubber bullets 5 2 3 interaction between the two main management strategies the interaction between the application proportion of attractant management and increased deterrence was not surprising the higher the percentage application of both strategies the fewer conflict bears were produced fig 8b attractant management is clearly more impactful but the trend direction in the proportion of conflict bears generated is the same for either strategy interestingly there was no large interaction effect between the amount of each strategy applied on the proportion of steps ending in urban cells appendix c2b model bears could always attempt to enter urban areas regardless of the deterrence measures in place or the accessibility of food this is likely true of real bears as well as they are capable of smelling food from great distances and can travel quickly without a complete barrier around urban areas bear forays in search of anthropogenic food will likely decrease to a certain point and then plateau rather than stopping entirely the interactions between the spatial configurations of the strategies are less clear there is no combination of like configurations that is the most effective of the options for a given configuration for example cluster attractant management and cluster increased deterrence one of the heterogeneous combinations is always more effective than a like pairing fig 8a only in the case of randomly applied attractant management and perimeter applied increased deterrence is the combination of matching configurations not the least effective this trend is most clear when each strategy is applied in the perimeter spatial configuration this combination of strategies generated the highest proportion of conflict bears since the perimeter strategy was in general less effective for both attractant management and increased deterrence when tested on their own it follows that any bears that penetrate the managed perimeter would be free from either attractant management or increased deterrence measures the perimeter configuration performed poorly for each strategy independently and in combination it is surprising that one of the combinations of strategies most effective at reducing the proportion of conflict bears was perimeter applied attractant management in combination with randomly applied increased deterrence fig 8a this outcome is likely due to synergy between the configurations first foraging model bears are less likely to be attracted to the attractant managed border since food is not accessible on those cells compared to food readily available on nearby natural cells second any bears that do manage to penetrate the attractant managed border of urban areas have a high likelihood of being deterred even within the urban core since increased deterrence is applied randomly throughout a similar synergy is probably occurring in the case of the other most effective configuration combinations of clustered attractant management and random increased deterrence large clusters of urban area including segments of the border are unappealing to model bears due to attractant management any bears that move into a cluster without attractant management are likely to be deterred to the nearest natural cell due to the randomly configured increased deterrence 5 3 reactive deterrence we used response delay and persistence of that response as a proxy for real world reactive agents that respond to bear sightings and actively seek out the bear to deter it such as conservation officers park rangers or trained dog teams it appears that the key factor in the effectiveness of such a response is its rapidity for both the proportion of conflict bears generated and the proportion of steps that ended in an urban cell the persistence of the response had no bearing on the outcome table 5 a rapid reactive response was highly effective in reducing the proportion of conflict bears generated but the decay in effectiveness was swift for each additional hour of delay between a bear entering an urban area and the local increase in deterrence likelihood the proportion of conflict bears increased by 15 25 quick response times in the model are analogous to having sufficient personnel available to respond to bear sightings to effectively employ reactive deterrence in a real world scenario the delay between a bear sighting and the arrival of deterrence agents should be made as short as possible through the employment of enough trained staff to respond quickly to bear sightings alternatively this strategy would likely work well as a support to passive strategies like attractant management 5 4 comparison to previous model the major modifications in relation to the previously published model marley et al 2019 pertain to movement the movement model now incorporates multiple modes of movement foraging and travel for both turn angles and step lengths for the model bear the model bear now travels across the landscape in a functionally continuous way rather than ignoring potential barrier features like lakes glaciers etc and the model bear moves in an indirect path to simulate natural pathfinding through a landscape varied in perceived food value even with these modifications some of the key results are similar across both models for example both models indicate that preventative action such as limiting bear access to anthropogenic food sources is the most effective approach to reduce the number of conflict bears generated and that perimeter configurations of management strategies tend to be less effective than either random or clustered configuration this may indicate that in cases where time or resources are limited using a simpler movement model may give adequate or equivalent results as a more complex movement model in this paper we extended the prior analyses and incorporated examination of the interaction between spatial configurations and explored the additional management approach of reactive deterrence that would not have been suitably explored without continuous movement 5 5 future strategy exploration and model improvement bear movement in the model presented here is simplified the bears follow basic movement rules as they seek out potential target cells with sufficient food accordingly the evaluation of food values and the implementation of those values into the model landscape is critical the food values in this model are likely conservative they are based substantively on the assessment of vegetation inventories green 2004 and rely on expert opinion ideally food values in future models could be based on step selection functions thurfjell et al 2014 or other similar approaches and evaluate multiple landscape characteristics to better approximate the landscape as perceived by bears given sufficient collar location data such an approach could be used to determine urban and natural food values concurrently since urban food values are scaled relative to natural food values in this model it is possible that model bears are undervaluing urban food which is typically of a high caloric value model bears do not learn in a meaningful or impactful way and since memory is implemented on a cell by cell basis the likelihood that a model bear s prior actions will affect its later decisions is low additionally for some potential management strategies limited data are available that describe bear response to those strategies for example high resolution gps collar data or other tracking records for bear interactions with electric fencing are absent or limited in the literature for these reasons more complicated management strategies than those described in the results section or strategies that rely on more advanced artificial bear intelligence were not successfully implemented in this iteration of the whistler bear model a variety of large scale fencing strategies were attempted with mixed results see appendix d 4 3 7 for an implementation based on available movement data as expected implementing a complete barrier around any urban areas was 100 effective in reducing the probability of conflict bears as this approach completely excluded model bears from any anthropogenic food we tested more practical and nuanced approaches as well such as strategically placing linear or curved barrier fences across key movement corridors as determined from gps paths taken by real bears or placing fences at intervals around the entirety of the urban area none of these more specifically formulated fences reduced the likelihood of the generation of a conflict bear in some cases a specific fencing implementation actually increased the proportion of conflict bears generated in such cases the bears appeared to pass through a gap in the fencing and then would often bounce back if they attempted to leave the urban area these bears were essentially trapped in or near urban areas by the fencing intended to keep them out it seems likely that real bears would be able to navigate such obstacles more successfully whether by scent or memory thus conclusions from the fencing implementations were not expected to translate well to real bears we also explored management strategies that employed vegetation modification to alter bear behaviour as a proxy for techniques like supplemental feeding partridge et al 2001 robbins et al 2004 we tried a variety of modifications to the food landscape examples of which include the reduction of natural food values in a band encircling any urban areas the increase of natural food values in a band placed far from urban areas and point increases of the natural food value however due to the limited per step potential steps there was little likelihood that a model bear would be affected by these modifications only in extreme and unrealistic cases such as a 200 m wide band of enriched natural food was the model bear effectively diverted from urban areas these unsuccessful attempts to investigate an alternative management strategy highlight the need for behavioural models that accurately reflect the actions of intelligent animals that can learn and remember rather than simply following basic movement rules improved sensing and diffuse memory are two components that could be incorporated into this model to explore more complicated management strategies 6 conclusion the principal outcome of this study is a quantitative confirmation that the reduction of anthropogenic food available as forage is the single most important factor to consider in the management of black bears other approaches such as increasing the likelihood that a bear will be deterred from a site with human food do influence the probability of the generation of a conflict bear but the magnitude of this influence is relatively small compared to the effect of attractant management in management scenarios with limited resources the reduction of anthropogenic food sources should be prioritized above other strategies in most cases of course multiple management strategies would be employed in tandem no applied strategy will ever be 100 effective but multiple strategies implemented in the same system can shore up weaknesses in each other this was most evident in comparing effectiveness amongst model strategies combining perimeter configured attractant management on its own an ineffective configuration with randomly configured increased deterrence being one of the most effective possible combinations this case study provides an example of an agent based modelling approach to evaluating diverse management strategies in a cost effective fast and ethically sound manner the variety and number of approaches explored in a simulated environment would not be possible in an experiential learning context for example the real world time required to test even a small number of the replicates modelled above makes experimental testing unfeasible for comparing the effectiveness of one strategy over another additionally the model s replication of the natural and urban configurations allows for tailored management regimes the ability to simulate various strategy types and configurations multiple times in an identical landscape which would prove challenging with any long lived animal can generate management plans customized to specific communities although this model was configured for the whistler landscape the agent based modelling approach used here could easily be adapted for other communities using appropriate landscape data and either the current bear movement parameters or movement parameters derived from bears local to the community of interest once constructed such a model can be modified to simulate a variety of questions and scenarios specific to that community given appropriate gps collar data the model could also be modified to simulate movement and behaviour of other species as needed this approach using agent based modelling to test management strategies can thereby be generally applicable to any community seeking to explore solutions for reducing local human wildlife

24647,climate change is more pronounced in boreal forests than in other terrestrial ecosystems and thus aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests have already been altered by increasing temperature and precipitation there are substantial uncertainties in predicting aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests in response to climate change since the uncertainty in climate change predictions this makes it challenging to design forest management strategies for promoting boreal forests to adaption climate change in this study we designed a factorial experiment and a model coupling framework to quantify the sensitivity of aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests in response to climate change our results showed that the uncertainties in temperature and precipitation predictions caused the divergent responses of aboveground biomass and species composition to climate change in the boreal forests of northeastern china aboveground biomass of boreal forests is more sensitive to precipitation than temperature there are divergent responses of tree species to temperature and precipitation over the 21st century this suggests that it is necessary to quantify and reduce the uncertainty in climate change predictions through statistical analysis methods before applying the predictions from general circulation models gcms to study the effects of climate change on forest ecosystems graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords northeastern china boreal forests climate change sensitivity analysis landis pro model coupling 1 introduction the global annual average surface temperature and precipitation have increased at rates of 0 19 c and 2 04 mm per decade between 1901 and 2015 blunden and arndt 2016 climate change is more pronounced in boreal forests than in other terrestrial ecosystems with temperatures increasing twice as fast as other ecosystems field 2014 observations experiments and models have indicated that climate warming and redistribution of precipitation have altered the physiological process birth growth seed dispersal and mortality of trees and interspecific relationships of species bolte et al 2010 jamieson et al 2012 thus affecting the aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests boulanger et al 2017 chen et al 2016 changes in aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests would feedback to the global climate system by altering surface albedo carbon stocks and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere euskirchen et al 2016 rogers et al 2015 hence understanding the responses of aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests to climate change has important implications for developing effective strategies to adopt sustainable forest management strategies in response to climate change price et al 2013 there are substantial uncertainties in predicting boreal forest response to climate change due to the uncertainty in climate change predictions and differences in ecological models structure and mechanism according to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar5 annual surface average temperature and precipitation increased by 0 5 8 9 c and 2 5 76 2 respectively in the middle and high latitudes of northern hemisphere over the 21st century ipcc 2013 the responses of boreal forests to climate change may be quite different among a broad range of general circulation models gcms and alternative greenhouse gas emission scenarios park et al 2014 the differences in mechanisms and parameters among niche models species distribution models sdms ecological process based models and dynamic global vegetation models dgvms are also an important source of uncertainty in the prediction of boreal forest responses to climate change warszawski et al 2013 for instance cheaib et al evaluated the uncertainty in species distributions that are contributed by differences among model formulations in terms of tree species responses to climate change uncertainties in the species distribution originate from differences in the ecological model capacity to simulate the effects of co2 concentration cheaib et al 2012 many studies have evaluated the sensitivity of forest ecosystem responses to climate change by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses christina et al 2016 huntingford et al 2013 xu et al 2009 uncertainty analyses are usually conducted to evaluate the variability of simulation results among different models while sensitivity analyses are often employed to assess which model parameters are responsible for the variability of simulation results crosetto and tarantola 2001 tian and de wilde 2011 with regard to uncertainty analysis comparing the consistency of simulation results from a broad range of models has become a powerful tool for assessing the sensitivity of forest ecosystem responses to climate change cheaib et al 2012 ehrlen and morris 2015 however uncertainty analysis does not distinguish the source of variability in the simulation results because the mechanism structure and parameters are different among different models compared to uncertainty analyses sensitivity analyses commonly quantify the effects of model parameters on the simulation results through the monte carlo method wenger et al 2013 sensitivity analyses have the potential to quantify the sensitivity of the forest ecosystem response to climate change by setting temperature and precipitation gradients lexer et al 2002 shuman et al 2011 the boreal forests in northeastern china are mainly distributed in the great xing an mountains which represent approximately 29 9 of the natural china forests and account for one third of carbon stocks in china forest ecosystems wang et al 2001 prior studies have demonstrated that boreal forests in the great xing an mountains are sensitive to climate change li et al 2013 peng et al 2009 the net primary productivity of boreal forests increased by 10 37 with climate change chen 2019 peng et al 2009 the northward migration of temperate species i e quercus mongolica and acer mono maxim would alter the species composition of boreal forests and thus affect aboveground biomass of boreal forests in northeastern china xiao ying et al 2013 however recent studies have revealed that climate warming and precipitation redistribution would result in massive mortality across north american boreal forests which changes boreal forests from carbon sinks into carbon sources ma et al 2012 mekonnen et al 2017 peng et al 2011 hence quantifying the sensitivity of boreal forests in response to climate change is a prerequisite and basis of forest management strategies to enable china s boreal forests to adapt to climate change the objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of boreal forests in response to climate change to do this we designed a factorial experiment and a model coupling framework to simulate aboveground biomass and species composition under a broad range of gcms and alternative greenhouse gas emission scenarios then we applied a sensitivity analysis method to quantify the sensitivity of aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests in response to climate change specifically we 1 examined the dynamics of aboveground biomass and species composition as they changed in response to temperature and precipitation 2 quantified the sensitivity of aboveground biomass of boreal forests contributed by potential changes in temperature and precipitation and 3 assessed the sensitivity of species composition to temperature and precipitation in the boreal forests of northeastern china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located on the northern side of the great xing an mountains of northeastern china including the huzhong forestry bureau and huzhong national nature reserve fig 1 this region covers 9 37 106 ha which is primarily a hilly and mountainous area ranging from 406 to 1514 m in elevation our study area has a cool continental climate with long and severe winters a mean january temperature of 32 3 c and short mild summers a mean july temperature of 21 2 c the average annual precipitation is 429 9 mm and more than 73 of the precipitation occurs from may to august the vegetation of this region is characterized by cool temperate coniferous forests which is the southern boundary boreal forest of eurasia dahurian larch larix gmelinii rupr kuzen is the dominant coniferous species in this region which covers 70 of the forested area white birch betula platyphylla suk is a widely distributed deciduous species with a high colonization ability that usually coexists with dahurian larch scots pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica litvinov korean spruce picea koriensis nakai and aspen populus davidiana dole cover less than 20 of the forested area poplar populus suaveolens fisch and willow chosenia arbutifolia pall a skv primarily occur along rivers dwarf pine pinus pumila pall regel is often mixed with dahurian larch and mostly occurs at elevations over 800 m fire is the major natural disturbance in this region which is an important driver of forest succession xu 1998 a total of 129 fires occurred in the study area from 1967 2005 which burned 3 50 105 ha of forest since 1965 more than 40 of forest in this region has been harvested with clear cutting methods species composition and age structure of boreal forests have been dramatically altered by fires and timber harvesting chen et al 2015 many coniferous forests gradually degenerate into secondary deciduous forests with shade intolerant species such as aspen and white birch 2 2 model coupling framework the model coupling approach offers advantages over a single model such as a better response of the tree species to climate change which would affect the aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests in this study we developed a new model coupling framework that integrates a forest ecosystem model linkages dijak et al 2017 and a forest landscape model landis pro wang et al 2015a to quantify the sensitivity of aboveground biomass and species composition to climate change linkages was used to quantify the effects of climate change on resource availability measured as the maximum growing space mgso and species establishment ability measured as the species establishment probability sep both parameters derived from linkages were inputted into landis pro which simulated the effects of climate change on forest succession as changes in the number of seedlings established and resource availability then sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the temperature and precipitation s contribution to sensitivity in aboveground biomass and species composition fig 2 2 3 climatic data to assess the sensitivity of boreal forest responses to climate change we selected the current climate data and the predictions from six cmip5 global climate models gcms to represent the lowest to highest temperature and precipitation changes over the 21st century the current climate data were obtained from the china national meteorological center 1970 2016 http data cma gov cn climate change data were derived from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 the performances of cmip5 gcms have already been tested in northeastern china with effectively represented the warming tendency and interannual variation of precipitation in our study area chen and frauenfeld 2014 sun et al 2015 six gcms showed a warming trend across the study area with the hadgem2 ao model exhibiting the largest increase in temperature at the end of 21st century table 1 from 2006 2100 the projections from these six gcms suggested a relatively slight increase in the precipitation fig 3 2 4 experimental design to assess the sensitivity of boreal forest responses to climate change we designed a factorial experiment with two independent variables at ten levels temperature annual mean temperature increased by 0 5 8 c at the end of 21st century and precipitation annual precipitation increases by 0 76 from 2080 to 2100 table 1 a total of 10 scenarios were simulated from 2000 to 2200 at 5 year time steps each with five replicates of each scenario the model repetitions started with the same input parameters but used different random number seeds to account for stochasticity in seed dispersal and seedling establishment five repetitions were found to effectively capture the stochastic processes of landis model in the previous studies scheller et al 2011 wang et al 2018 2 5 linkages model and parameterization linkages 3 0 is a forest ecosystem model that simulates the dynamics of forest succession and soil nutrient cycling in response to environmental change dijak et al 2017 in linkages climate change affects stand dynamics and carbon nitrogen cycling through temperature and water limitations dale et al 2010 the growing degree days water availability and actual evapotranspiration are estimated from daily temperature precipitation soil field moisture capacity and wilting point soil nitrogen availability is calculated from soil organic matter and chemical properties actual evapotranspiration and the degree of canopy closure pastor and post 1986 regeneration of individual trees is determined by the growing degree days water and light availability soil nitrogen availability along with other environmental factors affects tree growth mortality and biomass accumulation the probability of tree mortality is determined by the slow growth rate an annual tree growth less than 10 of the maximum diameter increment and background rate of the inverse of longevity the study area was divided into six ecoregions based on topography elevation and land use type fig s1 each ecoregion has homogenous resource availability measured as mgso and species establishment ability measured as sep in this study linkages model was used to estimate sep and mgso under the alternative climate scenarios individual species biomass was used to calculate sep under current climate conditions in 2000 and various climate change scenarios from 2006 2100 besides we simulated eight tree species together starting from a bare plot to estimate mgso under the current and climate change scenarios wang et al 2015b the current climate and climate change data were used to parameterize linkages model species parameters were obtained from previous studies in northeastern china he et al 2005 liang et al 2014 table s1 the thickness of the soil layer percentages of clay sand and rock the fraction of the usable soil layer humus weight soil organic matter and total nitrogen contents were derived from the china national soil database http vdb3 soil csdb cn the soil field moisture capacity wilting point and psi function coefficient were estimated from the percentages of clay sand and rock stand parameters number of trees diameter at breast height and age were derived from china national forest inventory data 2 6 landis pro model and parameterization landis pro is a forest landscape model that simulates the effects of climate change natural e g fire wind insect and disease outbreaks and anthropogenic e g harvest and fuel management disturbances on species composition and aboveground biomass luo et al 2014 wang et al 2015a landis pro tracks the number of trees and age cohort of each species at the pixel level this information can be applied to estimate aboveground biomass based on stem volume and tree number in landis pro species scale processes are simulated regarding the birth growth and mortality of individual trees the birth growth and mortality of individual trees are mainly driven by species life history attributes and growing space appendix s1 the growing space usually reflects the stand available for nutrient water and light accumulation for tree growth and competition which is quantified by the growing space occupied gso the maximum growing space mgso is an indicator of the maximum potential resource availability for stand development and it varies by the ecoregion and can be used to represent the effects of climate change on species composition and stand structure the establishment of potential sprouting seedlings is also controlled by species establishment probability which varies spatially and temporally and is often employed to reflect the effects of climate change on the species distribution he et al 1999 in this study landis pro simulates the response of aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests to climate change by altering mgso and sep fig s2 and s3 we parameterized the longevity maturity shade tolerance seed dispersal distance maximum dbh and stand density index sdi of eight species based on previous studies in the great xing an mountains li et al 2013 luo et al 2014 table s2 the initial forest composition map contains species composition the number of trees and age cohorts of each species that was generated from a forest type map and china national forest inventory data the mgso and sep were estimated based on the simulation results from linkages model to avoid the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances we assumed that no fire and land use changes occurred in the study area during the entire simulation period 2 7 data analysis in this study simulated aboveground biomass and species composition from landis pro was used to quantify the sensitivity of boreal forests in response to temperature and precipitation in the sensitivity package of r statistical software the variability of model results is represented by specified probability distributions pujol et al 2015 each probability distribution is determined by a baseline estimate and bounded by a 95 confidence interval doubilet et al 1985 monte carlo simulation was conducted to sample model results from the parameter probability distribution new and hulme 2000 to compare the sensitivity of aboveground biomass to temperature and precipitation we used two way anova to quantify the variation in aboveground biomass explained by temperature and precipitation to calculate the variability of spatial distribution of species composition we applied the nonparametric smoothing method to calculate the average and 5 and 95 confidence intervals for the changes in spatial distribution of tree species across ten simulation scenarios hayfield and racine 2012 we also interpreted the changes in spatial distribution of tree species as decrease remain unchanged and colonization in the study area r statistical software v3 4 4 was used in the data analyses 2 7 model validation the china national forest inventory data were used to validate landis pro model we randomly selected 384 and 407 forest inventory plots to evaluate the simulation results from landis pro for 2000 and 2010 respectively specifically forest inventory data were used to estimate observed aboveground biomass fang et al 2001 subsequently we compared observed aboveground biomass to simulation results to assess the performances of landis pro model 3 results 3 1 model validation at the landscape scale simulated aboveground biomass was similar to the observed values obtained from forest inventory data fig 4 a significant correlation was observed between simulated and observed aboveground biomass r2 0 85 which showed that the simulation results of the landis pro model were close to the forest inventory data for 2000 there was a significant correlation between simulated and observed aboveground biomass for the year 2010 r2 0 86 3 2 the changes in aboveground biomass climate warming and increasing precipitation would increase the aboveground biomass of boreal forests in the 21st century except for the hadgem2 ao rcp 8 5 scenario aboveground biomass increased considerably over the 21st century recovering from historical harvest and fire disturbances fig 5 at the end of 21st century aboveground biomass increased by 133 9 73 0 t ha across ten simulation scenarios the largest increase in aboveground biomass 256 2 t ha occurred in the cnrm cm5 rcp 2 6 scenario whereas the smallest increase in aboveground biomass 12 0 t ha occurred in the hadgem2 ao rcp 8 5 scenario 3 3 sensitivity of aboveground biomass to temperature and precipitation there are differences in the sensitivity of aboveground biomass to temperature and precipitation with increasing temperature aboveground biomass of boreal forests first increases and then decreases fig 6 a aboveground biomass reached its maximum at a Î´t value of 1 49 c and then began to decline finally reaching its minimum at a Î´t value of 5 48 c in contrast aboveground biomass increased with increasing precipitation fig 6b a 6 1 increase in the aboveground biomass was observed for every 10 precipitation increase for the boreal forests in northeastern of china aboveground biomass had 58 4 of total variation explained by precipitation while only 41 6 of the total variation was explained from temperature in our study area fig 6c 3 4 the changes in spatial distribution of species composition the spatial distribution of eight tree species has divergent responses to climate change fig 7 and fig s4 the proportions of aspen and scots pine increased by 38 1589 and 12 169 over the 21st century not all tree species expanded their distributions in response to climate change fig 7 the proportion of white birch declined by 7 10 at the end of 21st century moreover the proportion of dahurian larch decreased first and then increased in this period fig 7a across ten simulation scenarios dahurian larch s spatial distribution remains unchanged in most of our study area throughout the 21st century fig 8 a in this period the area where the spatial distribution of dahurian larch remains unchanged is 167 270 and 87 887 ha 5 and 95 confidence intervals respectively dahurian larch will trend upward in elevation and decrease in the northeastern of our study area white birch decreases in most of our study area and colonizes the western of the study area fig 8c the region where white birch replaced by other species is 139 335 and 180 999 ha 5 and 95 confidence intervals respectively in the 21st century aspen shifts northward and upward in the study area whereas it decreases in the middle and northeastern of the study area 5 and 95 confidence interval fig 8d 3 5 sensitivity of tree species to temperature and precipitation there are differences in eight tree species sensitivity to temperature and precipitation fig 8 and fig s4 dahurian larch fluctuates with climate warming and initially increases and then remains stable with increasing precipitation fig 8a the proportion of white birch first increases and then decreases with climate warming while the changes in the proportion of white birch increase with increasing precipitation fig 8b the changes in aspen increase with climate warming while they vary with increasing precipitation fig 8c for every 1 c increase in temperature the proportion of aspen increases by 138 3 the scots pine changes are insensitive to the temperature whereas scots pine decreases with increasing precipitation fig 8d 4 discussion in this study we applied a sensitivity analysis method to quantify the sensitivity of boreal forest response to climate change our results showed that the uncertainties in temperature and precipitation predictions from different gcms and greenhouse gas emissions scenarios would lead to the divergent responses of aboveground biomass and species composition to climate change sensitivity analysis showed that aboveground biomass of boreal forests first increases and then decreases with climate warming while aboveground biomass increases with increasing precipitation there are significant differences in the sensitivity of species composition to temperature and precipitation our study suggests that it is necessary to quantify the sensitivity of forest ecosystem responses to climate change and reduce the uncertainty in climate change predictions through statistical analysis methods the sensitivity analysis indicated that aboveground biomass of boreal forests is more sensitive to precipitation than to temperature these results are generally consistent with previous studies suggesting that the response of aboveground biomass to climate change mainly depends on boreal forests water availability chen and luo 2015 ma et al 2012 climate warming will lead to greater vapor pressure deficits within individual trees and alter boreal forest water availability through transpiration peng et al 2011 the increasing temperature associated with precipitation pattern redistribution is likely to cause widespread tree mortality choat et al 2012 mcdowell and allen 2015 thereby reducing aboveground biomass of boreal forests barber et al 2000 huang and anderegg 2012 this study implies that climate induced drought might lead to a reduced carbon sink of boreal forests although climate change strongly favoured deciduous species i e aspen dahurian larch remains the dominant species in boreal forests over the 21st century our results are inconsistent with the simulation results from dgvms and sdms the predictions based on dgvms and sdms showed that deciduous species would rapidly replace coniferous species in the 21st century leng et al 2008 ni et al 2000 tao and zhang 2010 the differences between our results and dgvm or sdm predictions are associated with the speed of tree species response to climate change although climate change is conducive to the expansion of deciduous species and the northward shift of temperate species recent studies have shown that demographic processes i e seed dispersal growth species competition and mortality could dampen the tree species response to climate change hagedorn et al 2019 liang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 therefore the species composition response may lag behind climate change alexander et al 2018 bertrand et al 2011 sittaro et al 2017 demographic processes and individual species responses to climate change are not well represented in dgvms and sdms heikkinen et al 2006 purves and pacala 2008 which may cause higher uncertainty in the predictions from these models cheaib et al 2012 our results highlight the importance of understanding the role of demographic processes when studying the tree species response to climate change there are divergent responses of tree species to temperature and precipitation over the 21st century fig 8 and fig s4 the changes in aspen are more sensitive to temperature than precipitation whereas the changes in scots pine are more vulnerable and sensitive to precipitation these findings are consistent with previous studies showing that tree species sensitivity to climate change is mainly determined by plant traits hof et al 2011 maclean and beissinger 2017 plant traits contain information on many physiological processes and correlations regarding tree species adapt to climate change pacifici et al 2017 climate tolerance species can adapt to broad changes in temperature and precipitation theurillat and guisan 2001 while climate intolerance species are more vulnerable to climate change than other species lenoir et al 2008 chen et al 2011 compared to white birch aspen could better adapt to climate change through a higher growth rate and stronger reproductive capacity landhÃ¤usser et al 2019 with the increase in temperature and extreme drought events future climate would promote aspen expansion while white birch is more vulnerable to water stress gradel et al 2017 therefore aspen will gradually replace white birch to become the most widely distributed deciduous species in the boreal forests of northeastern china the response of boreal forests to climate change is a complex process at the different spatial and temporal scales soja et al 2007 climate change affects plant physiological processes through solar radiation and atmospheric co2 concentration thereby altering aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests girardin et al 2016 maaroufi et al 2015 the changes in temperature and precipitation would also increase the frequency and intensity of fire disturbances de groot et al 2013 seidl et al 2017 which indirectly alter aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests johnstone et al 2010 davis et al 2019 this study mainly considered the effects of temperature and precipitation on tree birth growth mortality seed dispersal and species competition the effects of solar radiation atmospheric co2 concentration and natural disturbances were not considered in our

24647,climate change is more pronounced in boreal forests than in other terrestrial ecosystems and thus aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests have already been altered by increasing temperature and precipitation there are substantial uncertainties in predicting aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests in response to climate change since the uncertainty in climate change predictions this makes it challenging to design forest management strategies for promoting boreal forests to adaption climate change in this study we designed a factorial experiment and a model coupling framework to quantify the sensitivity of aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests in response to climate change our results showed that the uncertainties in temperature and precipitation predictions caused the divergent responses of aboveground biomass and species composition to climate change in the boreal forests of northeastern china aboveground biomass of boreal forests is more sensitive to precipitation than temperature there are divergent responses of tree species to temperature and precipitation over the 21st century this suggests that it is necessary to quantify and reduce the uncertainty in climate change predictions through statistical analysis methods before applying the predictions from general circulation models

climate change is more pronounced in boreal forests than in other terrestrial ecosystems with temperatures increasing twice as fast as other ecosystems field 2014 observations experiments and models have indicated that climate warming and redistribution of precipitation have altered the physiological process birth growth seed dispersal and mortality of trees and interspecific relationships of species bolte et al 2010 jamieson et al 2012 thus affecting the aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests boulanger et al 2017 chen et al 2016 changes in aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests would feedback to the global climate system by altering surface albedo carbon stocks and energy fluxes between land and atmosphere euskirchen et al 2016 rogers et al 2015 hence understanding the responses of aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests to climate change has important implications for developing effective strategies to adopt sustainable forest management strategies in response to climate change price et al 2013 there are substantial uncertainties in predicting boreal forest response to climate change due to the uncertainty in climate change predictions and differences in ecological models structure and mechanism according to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar5 annual surface average temperature and precipitation increased by 0 5 8 9 c and 2 5 76 2 respectively in the middle and high latitudes of northern hemisphere over the 21st century ipcc 2013 the responses of boreal forests to climate change may be quite different among a broad range of general circulation models gcms and alternative greenhouse gas emission scenarios park et al 2014 the differences in mechanisms and parameters among niche models species distribution models sdms ecological process based models and dynamic global vegetation models dgvms are also an important source of uncertainty in the prediction of boreal forest responses to climate change warszawski et al 2013 for instance cheaib et al evaluated the uncertainty in species distributions that are contributed by differences among model formulations in terms of tree species responses to climate change uncertainties in the species distribution originate from differences in the ecological model capacity to simulate the effects of co2 concentration cheaib et al 2012 many studies have evaluated the sensitivity of forest ecosystem responses to climate change by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses christina et al 2016 huntingford et al 2013 xu et al 2009 uncertainty analyses are usually conducted to evaluate the variability of simulation results among different models while sensitivity analyses are often employed to assess which model parameters are responsible for the variability of simulation results crosetto and tarantola 2001 tian and de wilde 2011 with regard to uncertainty analysis comparing the consistency of simulation results from a broad range of models has become a powerful tool for assessing the sensitivity of forest ecosystem responses to climate change cheaib et al 2012 ehrlen and morris 2015 however uncertainty analysis does not distinguish the source of variability in the simulation results because the mechanism structure and parameters are different among different models compared to uncertainty analyses sensitivity analyses commonly quantify the effects of model parameters on the simulation results through the monte carlo method wenger et al 2013 sensitivity analyses have the potential to quantify the sensitivity of the forest ecosystem response to climate change by setting temperature and precipitation gradients lexer et al 2002 shuman et al 2011 the boreal forests in northeastern china are mainly distributed in the great xing an mountains which represent approximately 29 9 of the natural china forests and account for one third of carbon stocks in china forest ecosystems wang et al 2001 prior studies have demonstrated that boreal forests in the great xing an mountains are sensitive to climate change li et al 2013 peng et al 2009 the net primary productivity of boreal forests increased by 10 37 with climate change chen 2019 peng et al 2009 the northward migration of temperate species i e quercus mongolica and acer mono maxim would alter the species composition of boreal forests and thus affect aboveground biomass of boreal forests in northeastern china xiao ying et al 2013 however recent studies have revealed that climate warming and precipitation redistribution would result in massive mortality across north american boreal forests which changes boreal forests from carbon sinks into carbon sources ma et al 2012 mekonnen et al 2017 peng et al 2011 hence quantifying the sensitivity of boreal forests in response to climate change is a prerequisite and basis of forest management strategies to enable china s boreal forests to adapt to climate change the objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of boreal forests in response to climate change to do this we designed a factorial experiment and a model coupling framework to simulate aboveground biomass and species composition under a broad range of gcms and alternative greenhouse gas emission scenarios then we applied a sensitivity analysis method to quantify the sensitivity of aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests in response to climate change specifically we 1 examined the dynamics of aboveground biomass and species composition as they changed in response to temperature and precipitation 2 quantified the sensitivity of aboveground biomass of boreal forests contributed by potential changes in temperature and precipitation and 3 assessed the sensitivity of species composition to temperature and precipitation in the boreal forests of northeastern china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located on the northern side of the great xing an mountains of northeastern china including the huzhong forestry bureau and huzhong national nature reserve fig 1 this region covers 9 37 106 ha which is primarily a hilly and mountainous area ranging from 406 to 1514 m in elevation our study area has a cool continental climate with long and severe winters a mean january temperature of 32 3 c and short mild summers a mean july temperature of 21 2 c the average annual precipitation is 429 9 mm and more than 73 of the precipitation occurs from may to august the vegetation of this region is characterized by cool temperate coniferous forests which is the southern boundary boreal forest of eurasia dahurian larch larix gmelinii rupr kuzen is the dominant coniferous species in this region which covers 70 of the forested area white birch betula platyphylla suk is a widely distributed deciduous species with a high colonization ability that usually coexists with dahurian larch scots pine pinus sylvestris var mongolica litvinov korean spruce picea koriensis nakai and aspen populus davidiana dole cover less than 20 of the forested area poplar populus suaveolens fisch and willow chosenia arbutifolia pall a skv primarily occur along rivers dwarf pine pinus pumila pall regel is often mixed with dahurian larch and mostly occurs at elevations over 800 m fire is the major natural disturbance in this region which is an important driver of forest succession xu 1998 a total of 129 fires occurred in the study area from 1967 2005 which burned 3 50 105 ha of forest since 1965 more than 40 of forest in this region has been harvested with clear cutting methods species composition and age structure of boreal forests have been dramatically altered by fires and timber harvesting chen et al 2015 many coniferous forests gradually degenerate into secondary deciduous forests with shade intolerant species such as aspen and white birch 2 2 model coupling framework the model coupling approach offers advantages over a single model such as a better response of the tree species to climate change which would affect the aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests in this study we developed a new model coupling framework that integrates a forest ecosystem model linkages dijak et al 2017 and a forest landscape model landis pro wang et al 2015a to quantify the sensitivity of aboveground biomass and species composition to climate change linkages was used to quantify the effects of climate change on resource availability measured as the maximum growing space mgso and species establishment ability measured as the species establishment probability sep both parameters derived from linkages were inputted into landis pro which simulated the effects of climate change on forest succession as changes in the number of seedlings established and resource availability then sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the temperature and precipitation s contribution to sensitivity in aboveground biomass and species composition fig 2 2 3 climatic data to assess the sensitivity of boreal forest responses to climate change we selected the current climate data and the predictions from six cmip5 global climate models gcms to represent the lowest to highest temperature and precipitation changes over the 21st century the current climate data were obtained from the china national meteorological center 1970 2016 http data cma gov cn climate change data were derived from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 the performances of cmip5 gcms have already been tested in northeastern china with effectively represented the warming tendency and interannual variation of precipitation in our study area chen and frauenfeld 2014 sun et al 2015 six gcms showed a warming trend across the study area with the hadgem2 ao model exhibiting the largest increase in temperature at the end of 21st century table 1 from 2006 2100 the projections from these six gcms suggested a relatively slight increase in the precipitation fig 3 2 4 experimental design to assess the sensitivity of boreal forest responses to climate change we designed a factorial experiment with two independent variables at ten levels temperature annual mean temperature increased by 0 5 8 c at the end of 21st century and precipitation annual precipitation increases by 0 76 from 2080 to 2100 table 1 a total of 10 scenarios were simulated from 2000 to 2200 at 5 year time steps each with five replicates of each scenario the model repetitions started with the same input parameters but used different random number seeds to account for stochasticity in seed dispersal and seedling establishment five repetitions were found to effectively capture the stochastic processes of landis model in the previous studies scheller et al 2011 wang et al 2018 2 5 linkages model and parameterization linkages 3 0 is a forest ecosystem model that simulates the dynamics of forest succession and soil nutrient cycling in response to environmental change dijak et al 2017 in linkages climate change affects stand dynamics and carbon nitrogen cycling through temperature and water limitations dale et al 2010 the growing degree days water availability and actual evapotranspiration are estimated from daily temperature precipitation soil field moisture capacity and wilting point soil nitrogen availability is calculated from soil organic matter and chemical properties actual evapotranspiration and the degree of canopy closure pastor and post 1986 regeneration of individual trees is determined by the growing degree days water and light availability soil nitrogen availability along with other environmental factors affects tree growth mortality and biomass accumulation the probability of tree mortality is determined by the slow growth rate an annual tree growth less than 10 of the maximum diameter increment and background rate of the inverse of longevity the study area was divided into six ecoregions based on topography elevation and land use type fig s1 each ecoregion has homogenous resource availability measured as mgso and species establishment ability measured as sep in this study linkages model was used to estimate sep and mgso under the alternative climate scenarios individual species biomass was used to calculate sep under current climate conditions in 2000 and various climate change scenarios from 2006 2100 besides we simulated eight tree species together starting from a bare plot to estimate mgso under the current and climate change scenarios wang et al 2015b the current climate and climate change data were used to parameterize linkages model species parameters were obtained from previous studies in northeastern china he et al 2005 liang et al 2014 table s1 the thickness of the soil layer percentages of clay sand and rock the fraction of the usable soil layer humus weight soil organic matter and total nitrogen contents were derived from the china national soil database http vdb3 soil csdb cn the soil field moisture capacity wilting point and psi function coefficient were estimated from the percentages of clay sand and rock stand parameters number of trees diameter at breast height and age were derived from china national forest inventory data 2 6 landis pro model and parameterization landis pro is a forest landscape model that simulates the effects of climate change natural e g fire wind insect and disease outbreaks and anthropogenic e g harvest and fuel management disturbances on species composition and aboveground biomass luo et al 2014 wang et al 2015a landis pro tracks the number of trees and age cohort of each species at the pixel level this information can be applied to estimate aboveground biomass based on stem volume and tree number in landis pro species scale processes are simulated regarding the birth growth and mortality of individual trees the birth growth and mortality of individual trees are mainly driven by species life history attributes and growing space appendix s1 the growing space usually reflects the stand available for nutrient water and light accumulation for tree growth and competition which is quantified by the growing space occupied gso the maximum growing space mgso is an indicator of the maximum potential resource availability for stand development and it varies by the ecoregion and can be used to represent the effects of climate change on species composition and stand structure the establishment of potential sprouting seedlings is also controlled by species establishment probability which varies spatially and temporally and is often employed to reflect the effects of climate change on the species distribution he et al 1999 in this study landis pro simulates the response of aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests to climate change by altering mgso and sep fig s2 and s3 we parameterized the longevity maturity shade tolerance seed dispersal distance maximum dbh and stand density index sdi of eight species based on previous studies in the great xing an mountains li et al 2013 luo et al 2014 table s2 the initial forest composition map contains species composition the number of trees and age cohorts of each species that was generated from a forest type map and china national forest inventory data the mgso and sep were estimated based on the simulation results from linkages model to avoid the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances we assumed that no fire and land use changes occurred in the study area during the entire simulation period 2 7 data analysis in this study simulated aboveground biomass and species composition from landis pro was used to quantify the sensitivity of boreal forests in response to temperature and precipitation in the sensitivity package of r statistical software the variability of model results is represented by specified probability distributions pujol et al 2015 each probability distribution is determined by a baseline estimate and bounded by a 95 confidence interval doubilet et al 1985 monte carlo simulation was conducted to sample model results from the parameter probability distribution new and hulme 2000 to compare the sensitivity of aboveground biomass to temperature and precipitation we used two way anova to quantify the variation in aboveground biomass explained by temperature and precipitation to calculate the variability of spatial distribution of species composition we applied the nonparametric smoothing method to calculate the average and 5 and 95 confidence intervals for the changes in spatial distribution of tree species across ten simulation scenarios hayfield and racine 2012 we also interpreted the changes in spatial distribution of tree species as decrease remain unchanged and colonization in the study area r statistical software v3 4 4 was used in the data analyses 2 7 model validation the china national forest inventory data were used to validate landis pro model we randomly selected 384 and 407 forest inventory plots to evaluate the simulation results from landis pro for 2000 and 2010 respectively specifically forest inventory data were used to estimate observed aboveground biomass fang et al 2001 subsequently we compared observed aboveground biomass to simulation results to assess the performances of landis pro model 3 results 3 1 model validation at the landscape scale simulated aboveground biomass was similar to the observed values obtained from forest inventory data fig 4 a significant correlation was observed between simulated and observed aboveground biomass r2 0 85 which showed that the simulation results of the landis pro model were close to the forest inventory data for 2000 there was a significant correlation between simulated and observed aboveground biomass for the year 2010 r2 0 86 3 2 the changes in aboveground biomass climate warming and increasing precipitation would increase the aboveground biomass of boreal forests in the 21st century except for the hadgem2 ao rcp 8 5 scenario aboveground biomass increased considerably over the 21st century recovering from historical harvest and fire disturbances fig 5 at the end of 21st century aboveground biomass increased by 133 9 73 0 t ha across ten simulation scenarios the largest increase in aboveground biomass 256 2 t ha occurred in the cnrm cm5 rcp 2 6 scenario whereas the smallest increase in aboveground biomass 12 0 t ha occurred in the hadgem2 ao rcp 8 5 scenario 3 3 sensitivity of aboveground biomass to temperature and precipitation there are differences in the sensitivity of aboveground biomass to temperature and precipitation with increasing temperature aboveground biomass of boreal forests first increases and then decreases fig 6 a aboveground biomass reached its maximum at a Î´t value of 1 49 c and then began to decline finally reaching its minimum at a Î´t value of 5 48 c in contrast aboveground biomass increased with increasing precipitation fig 6b a 6 1 increase in the aboveground biomass was observed for every 10 precipitation increase for the boreal forests in northeastern of china aboveground biomass had 58 4 of total variation explained by precipitation while only 41 6 of the total variation was explained from temperature in our study area fig 6c 3 4 the changes in spatial distribution of species composition the spatial distribution of eight tree species has divergent responses to climate change fig 7 and fig s4 the proportions of aspen and scots pine increased by 38 1589 and 12 169 over the 21st century not all tree species expanded their distributions in response to climate change fig 7 the proportion of white birch declined by 7 10 at the end of 21st century moreover the proportion of dahurian larch decreased first and then increased in this period fig 7a across ten simulation scenarios dahurian larch s spatial distribution remains unchanged in most of our study area throughout the 21st century fig 8 a in this period the area where the spatial distribution of dahurian larch remains unchanged is 167 270 and 87 887 ha 5 and 95 confidence intervals respectively dahurian larch will trend upward in elevation and decrease in the northeastern of our study area white birch decreases in most of our study area and colonizes the western of the study area fig 8c the region where white birch replaced by other species is 139 335 and 180 999 ha 5 and 95 confidence intervals respectively in the 21st century aspen shifts northward and upward in the study area whereas it decreases in the middle and northeastern of the study area 5 and 95 confidence interval fig 8d 3 5 sensitivity of tree species to temperature and precipitation there are differences in eight tree species sensitivity to temperature and precipitation fig 8 and fig s4 dahurian larch fluctuates with climate warming and initially increases and then remains stable with increasing precipitation fig 8a the proportion of white birch first increases and then decreases with climate warming while the changes in the proportion of white birch increase with increasing precipitation fig 8b the changes in aspen increase with climate warming while they vary with increasing precipitation fig 8c for every 1 c increase in temperature the proportion of aspen increases by 138 3 the scots pine changes are insensitive to the temperature whereas scots pine decreases with increasing precipitation fig 8d 4 discussion in this study we applied a sensitivity analysis method to quantify the sensitivity of boreal forest response to climate change our results showed that the uncertainties in temperature and precipitation predictions from different gcms and greenhouse gas emissions scenarios would lead to the divergent responses of aboveground biomass and species composition to climate change sensitivity analysis showed that aboveground biomass of boreal forests first increases and then decreases with climate warming while aboveground biomass increases with increasing precipitation there are significant differences in the sensitivity of species composition to temperature and precipitation our study suggests that it is necessary to quantify the sensitivity of forest ecosystem responses to climate change and reduce the uncertainty in climate change predictions through statistical analysis methods the sensitivity analysis indicated that aboveground biomass of boreal forests is more sensitive to precipitation than to temperature these results are generally consistent with previous studies suggesting that the response of aboveground biomass to climate change mainly depends on boreal forests water availability chen and luo 2015 ma et al 2012 climate warming will lead to greater vapor pressure deficits within individual trees and alter boreal forest water availability through transpiration peng et al 2011 the increasing temperature associated with precipitation pattern redistribution is likely to cause widespread tree mortality choat et al 2012 mcdowell and allen 2015 thereby reducing aboveground biomass of boreal forests barber et al 2000 huang and anderegg 2012 this study implies that climate induced drought might lead to a reduced carbon sink of boreal forests although climate change strongly favoured deciduous species i e aspen dahurian larch remains the dominant species in boreal forests over the 21st century our results are inconsistent with the simulation results from dgvms and sdms the predictions based on dgvms and sdms showed that deciduous species would rapidly replace coniferous species in the 21st century leng et al 2008 ni et al 2000 tao and zhang 2010 the differences between our results and dgvm or sdm predictions are associated with the speed of tree species response to climate change although climate change is conducive to the expansion of deciduous species and the northward shift of temperate species recent studies have shown that demographic processes i e seed dispersal growth species competition and mortality could dampen the tree species response to climate change hagedorn et al 2019 liang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 therefore the species composition response may lag behind climate change alexander et al 2018 bertrand et al 2011 sittaro et al 2017 demographic processes and individual species responses to climate change are not well represented in dgvms and sdms heikkinen et al 2006 purves and pacala 2008 which may cause higher uncertainty in the predictions from these models cheaib et al 2012 our results highlight the importance of understanding the role of demographic processes when studying the tree species response to climate change there are divergent responses of tree species to temperature and precipitation over the 21st century fig 8 and fig s4 the changes in aspen are more sensitive to temperature than precipitation whereas the changes in scots pine are more vulnerable and sensitive to precipitation these findings are consistent with previous studies showing that tree species sensitivity to climate change is mainly determined by plant traits hof et al 2011 maclean and beissinger 2017 plant traits contain information on many physiological processes and correlations regarding tree species adapt to climate change pacifici et al 2017 climate tolerance species can adapt to broad changes in temperature and precipitation theurillat and guisan 2001 while climate intolerance species are more vulnerable to climate change than other species lenoir et al 2008 chen et al 2011 compared to white birch aspen could better adapt to climate change through a higher growth rate and stronger reproductive capacity landhÃ¤usser et al 2019 with the increase in temperature and extreme drought events future climate would promote aspen expansion while white birch is more vulnerable to water stress gradel et al 2017 therefore aspen will gradually replace white birch to become the most widely distributed deciduous species in the boreal forests of northeastern china the response of boreal forests to climate change is a complex process at the different spatial and temporal scales soja et al 2007 climate change affects plant physiological processes through solar radiation and atmospheric co2 concentration thereby altering aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests girardin et al 2016 maaroufi et al 2015 the changes in temperature and precipitation would also increase the frequency and intensity of fire disturbances de groot et al 2013 seidl et al 2017 which indirectly alter aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests johnstone et al 2010 davis et al 2019 this study mainly considered the effects of temperature and precipitation on tree birth growth mortality seed dispersal and species competition the effects of solar radiation atmospheric co2 concentration and natural disturbances were not considered in our model simulation which may cause some uncertainties in our simulation results however these limitations do not affect this study s principal conclusion because our goal was to evaluate the sensitivity of aboveground biomass and species composition of boreal forests to temperature and precipitation to accurately predict boreal forests response to climate change further studies should consider the effects of co2 fertilization species migration and natural disturbances 5 conclusion in this study we developed a new model coupling framework to quantify the sensitivity of boreal forests in response

uncertainties in the temperature and precipitation predictions aboveground biomass of boreal forests is more sensitive to precipitation than temperature there are divergent responses of tree species

24648,paddy rice is one of the main grain crops in the world accurate estimations of the gross primary production gpp of paddy rice are essential for assessing rice grain production and monitoring the carbon cycle in paddy fields with the aim of providing ideal conditions for crops throughout the growing season several studies have demonstrated the advantages of combining the eddy covariance technique with remotely sensed data to model gpp at co2 eddy flux tower sites as paddy rice continuously changes during its growth and development and important growth events frequently occur it is critical to observe the growing conditions at various stages of the process to better understand the variations in gpp at different growth stages two key parameters that drive the vegetation photosynthesis model vpm are analyzed and estimated at various phenological phases specifically general piecewise logistic functions are used to extract phenological transitions from data at four paddy rice flux tower sites the maximum light use efficiency lue and optimum temperature are estimated from these phenological transitions and these indicators are used to drive the vpm to simulate gpp over multiple years at the four sites the simulation results show that gpp based on our phenological transition based vpm gpppvpm agrees reasonably well with the variations of gpp estimated from co2 flux data gppec r2 0 9 in addition a comparison indicates that gpppvpm tracks the seasonal dynamics of gppec better than gpp estimated from the original vpm furthermore gpp based on the improved maximum lue is lower than gppec at most flux sites and gpp based on the improved optimum temperature is higher than gppec these comparisons imply that the maximum lue and optimum temperature estimated in the phenological transitions of paddy rice are beneficial to enhance the accuracy of gpp estimation the improved estimation of gpp provides phenological insights into the temporal dynamics of vegetation photosynthesis in paddy fields keywords maximum light use efficiency optimum temperature gross primary production vegetation photosynthesis model co2 fluxes paddy rice phenology 1 introduction paddy rice fields are among the major global agricultural ecosystems and were estimated to cover approximately 167 million hectares worldwide in 2017 faostat 2017 the majority of the world s paddy fields are in asia accounting for approximately 87 of the globally harvested rice area and 90 of global rice production faostat 2017 irrigated rice fields are also one of the major sources of methane ch4 as the inherent anaerobic soil conditions are conducive to methane production neue 1993 although several in situ studies have reported that paddy rice fields enable high levels of carbon sequestration and act as net sinks for carbon dioxide co2 bhattacharyya et al 2014 liu et al 2013 pan et al 2004 predictions of the carbon fluxes in paddy rice fields suffer from considerable uncertainties xin et al 2017 the exchange of co2 between agricultural ecosystems and the atmosphere plays an important role in the carbon cycle the amount of co2 fixed from radiant energy absorbed by the paddy rice field is strongly related to the physiological and phenological activities of croplands hanan et al 2002 therefore the measurement of co2 fluxes in paddy rice fields is crucial in clarifying the physiological responses of crops to environmental conditions furthermore a better understanding of this process will be beneficial for the prediction of grain production under climate change conditions the gross primary production gpp of paddy rice reflects the co2 flux fixed by crops through the process of photosynthesis and is the main variable determining crop yield the eddy covariance ec technique is one of the best micrometeorological methods for measuring the net exchange of co2 between the atmosphere and the surface of various ecosystems the observed net ecosystem exchange nee data can be partitioned into gpp and ecosystem respiration denoted as re baldocchi et al 2001 these nee data and the derived gpp and re data from flux sites have been widely used to support the development of gpp simulation models for satellite remote sensing and climate data at regional and global scales running et al 1999 stockli et al 2008 williams et al 2009 ec flux measurements from global flux networks provide valuable information for calibrating and validating the parameters of these models in an attempt to improve the gpp estimation capability facilitating numerous studies of carbon fluxes over paddy rice ecosystems alberto et al 2009 baldocchi et al 2001 choi et al 2018 hwang et al 2020 knox et al 2015 saito et al 2005 xin et al 2017 light use efficiency lue models have significant potential to address the spatial and temporal dynamics of gpp because they take advantage of extensive satellite observations yuan et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 these satellite based models assume that the gpp of a terrestrial ecosystem is directly related to the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar through lue monteith 1972 1977 and have been developed to estimate the gpp of terrestrial ecosystems through vegetation indices vis derived from remotely sensed optical images and meteorological data barton and north 2001 brogaard et al 2005 machwitz et al 2015 nichol et al 2000 potter et al 1993 yuan et al 2007 the gpp estimated from these models is the product of apar and the lue denoted as Îµg i e gpp apar Îµg earlier studies using lue

al 2014 as the fraction of par absorbed by chlorophyll fparchl contributes to vegetation photosynthesis it is more reasonable to use fparchl to estimate gpp par fparchl Îµg sims et al 2006 wu et al 2010 xiao et al 2004b zhang et al 2009 2006 the vegetation photosynthesis model vpm was the first lue based model to use fparchl to estimate gpp xiao et al 2004a previous research has shown the comprehensive ability of vpm to estimate gpp over a variety of co2 flux sites wu et al 2018 including forests xiao et al 2004a 2004b 2005a xiao et al 2005b savanna jin et al 2013 grassland wang et al 2010 yang et al 2019 and cropland ma et al 2020 wang et al 2010 recently vpm has been successfully applied to the estimation of gpp in paddy rice fields xin et al 2017 in vpm the actual lue Îµg may be less than its theoretical maximum because of environmental stresses such as extreme temperatures water shortages or flooding therefore Îµg is determined by the maximum lue Îµ0 and a water stress factor wscalar as well as a temperature stress factor tscalar i e Îµg Îµ0 tscalar wscalar in most research on paddy rice gpp estimation using vpm the ecosystem level Îµ0can be obtained from analysis of the nee of co2 and the incident par Î¼mol m2 s at co2 eddy flux sites either by using the hyperbolic light response function alberto et al 2009 inoue et al 2008 lindner et al 2016 saito et al 2005 yang et al 2018 or by taking a suitable value from the literature xin et al 2017 yan et al 2009 the Îµ0 estimates given by the former approach are based on analyses of half hourly nee and incident par data either by dividing the entire growing season into several growth periods saito et al 2005 or by considering the entire growing season at the flux sites alberto et al 2009 some photosynthesis research has demonstrated that within c3 species annual herbaceous plants e g paddy rice display weaker temperature homeostasis of photosynthesis than perennial herbaceous plants e g wheat yamori et al 2014 more importantly the growth and development of paddy rice plants involve continuous change which means that important growth events occur frequently therefore the overall daily or healthy growth stages of the plant are crucial to better understand the development of paddy rice and properly manage the rice crop it is essential to separate the entire growing season of paddy rice into individual growing seasons according to physiological and phenological characteristics for É0 estimation moreover the effect of temperature stress tscalar is an uncertain factor in lue models due to the relationship between temperature and photosynthesis few scholars have focused on the temperature stress factors in vpm tscalar is determined by two temperature factors tmin and tmax the basic hypothesis behind tmin and tmax is that vegetation growth acclimatizes to the optimum temperature topt which is defined as the mean temperature of the month when the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi reaches its maximum field et al 1995 potter et al 1993 or the average temperature of the growth season yan et al 2009 however this definition may not be comprehensive for the following reasons 1 in cropland ecosystems the growing seasons of crops span several physiological stages and the use of a uniform average temperature in the growing season either site specific or on a regional scale needs to be improved 2 due to extreme weather events or natural disasters the maximum ndvi or enhanced vegetation index evi values in some areas may not occur in july or august as typically expected and 3 abnormal maximum ndvi or evi values may occur for other reasons recent work has shown that improvements in phenology based research on optimum temperatures significantly enhances forest net primary production npp estimations using the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model pei et al 2018 however this approach has not yet been applied to estimations of the gpp of crop ecosystems to overcome uncertainties in the determination of the maximum lue É0 of paddy rice fields and the limitations of the definition of optimum temperature in the lue model this research first attempts to understand and estimate the model parameters É0 and optimum temperature at various phenological phases and then generates improved gpp estimations by running vpm with parameters that are appropriate for the individual phenological phases the results of this work are expected to make a significant contribution in terms of improving the accuracy of gpp estimation and promoting our long term monitoring capabilities in rice agriculture which feeds more than 50 of the global population 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites for this study we selected four paddy rice flux sites namely the mase paddy rice site in japan the haenam paddy rice site in south korea the twitchell island paddy rice site in california usa and the jingzhou paddy rice site in china table 1 for detailed descriptions of the four sites see the ameriflux http ameriflux lbl gov sites siteinfo us twt and asiaflux http asiaflux net websites or the report by su et al 2013 the flux footprint of the four sites has been analyzed by su et al 2013 and xin et al 2017 2 1 1 mase paddy rice site japan the mase mse paddy rice flux site 36 05 n 140 03 e is located in a rural area of tsukuba city in central

temperature is 16 5 c and the annual mean precipitation is 1095 mm paddy rice is usually transplanted in early june and harvested in september su et al 2013 2 2 eddy flux tower data the availability quality of measured nee data is very important for model simulation which may have a direct influence on gpp when nee is subsequently divided into gpp and re reichstein et al 2005 the availability of 30 min nee data in the growing season of paddy rice at the four sites were statistically analyzed table 2 and the data processing procedure was briefly summarized 2 2 1 mse flux site the co2 flux at the mse flux site was measured by an open path ec sensor the equipment model setting calibration and measurement of the flux tower have been described in previous studies saito et al 2005 ec flux data contain a large number of errors due to instrument malfunction atmospheric conditions inappropriate for ec measurements rainfall or human disturbances to eliminate these errors the ec data were subjected to quality control procedures as described by saito et al 2005 the gpp and re were also estimated in the same way as saito et al 2005 daily carbon flux data par data and air temperature data were averaged over an 8 day period consistent with modis 8 day composites daily and 8 day data from 2003 2005 within the plant growing season were used in this study 2 2 2 hfk flux site the co2 flux at hfk was measured by an open path ec sensor detailed information about the flux measurements data processing quality control and gap filling has previously been reported hong et al 2009 kwon et al 2010 the data processing method whereby nee was separated into gpp and re was the same as for the mse flux site the hfk site has no quantum sensor with which to directly measure the photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd or par so par was estimated to be 45 of the solar radiation meek et al 1984 and the units of par were converted from w m 2 to Î¼mol m 2 s 1 aber et al 1996 dye 2004 the daily gpp nee and climate data in 2008 were averaged over an 8 day period according to the modis 8 day composite images daily and 8 day data from the paddy rice growing season in 2008 were used in this study 2 2 3 twt flux tower site the co2 flux at twt was measured by an open path ec sensor the half hourly gpp data were downloaded from the ameriflux web site http ameriflux ornl gov the partitioning of nee flux into gpp and re and the gap filling of missing data were as described in previous studies baldocchi et al 2015 knox et al 2016 daily gpp nee and climate data from 2011 2012 were averaged over an 8 day period following the modis 8 day composites daily and 8 day data from the paddy rice growing season in 2011 2012 were used in this study 2 2 4 jz flux site the flux densities of co2 water vapor sensible heat latent heat and momentum as well as the friction velocities over the paddy rice field were measured by the ec method three dimensional wind speeds and temperature fluctuations were measured with a sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc usa an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa was used to measure the co2 flux and water vapor densities at the flux site both the csat3 and li 7500 were installed at a height of 2 m above the ground with a sensor separation of 20 cm the data from the sonic anemometer and analyzer were sampled at 10 hz using a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific inc usa the data logger is connected to the server through the direct communication method of network cable and the data logger program can collect data online through the server raw data acquired at 10 hz were processed using the post processing software eddypro including spike removal lag correction of h2o co2 relative to the vertical wind component sonic virtual temperature correction the performance of the planar fit coordinate rotation corrections for density fluctuation wpl correction frequency response correction etc similar to the test methods used in previous research alberto et al 2009 saito et al 2005 we conducted a stationarity test and integral turbulence characteristics test aubinet et al 2000 foken and wichura 1996 to check the data in addition to the above processing steps the half hourly flux data were screened according to the following criteria i data were rejected when the sensor was malfunctioning e g when there was a fault diagnostic signal ii data were rejected when precipitation occurred within 1 h before and after the collection iii incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing ratio was larger than 3 in the 30 min raw record and iv data were rejected at night when the friction velocity was below 0 1 m s 1 p and blanken 1998 liu et al 2011 the average annual rejection rates during the paddy rice growing season were 50 in 2010 56 in 2013 and 32 in 2018 in the subsequent analysis we only used the flux data that passed the above treatment 2 2 5 processing of the flux data ec systems directly measure nee rather than gpp thus the nee of co2 between the atmosphere and paddy rice fields was separated into gpp and re to partition nee into gpp and re a conventional method that estimates the nighttime re i e nee in nighttime hours as an exponential function of air temperature ta was adopted this function was applied to the daytime to estimate the daytime half hourly re falge et al 2001 the simple exponential function is 1 r e a e b t a where a and b are estimated model coefficients and ta is the air temperature b is related to a temperature coefficient q10 as b ln q10 10 and a denotes the value of re at 0 c another commonly used method was employed to gap fill the gpp values corresponding to the time points at which invalid nee data had been removed falge et al 2001 nee is generally expressed as a rectangular hyperbolic function the michaelis menten light response equation of incident par or incident ppfd q p which can be expressed as follows 2 n e e Î± q p g e e m a x Î± q p g e e m a x r e where g e e m a x gpp at saturating light and Î± initial slope of the function or ecosystem quantum yield are empirical constants that can be determined from a regression analysis of the nee and incident ppfd the daily nee re and meteorological variables were estimated by summing the averaged half hourly or hourly rate over 24 h the gpp was estimated as the sum of the nee and re the relationship among gpp nee and re can be expressed as 3 g p p n e e r e the 8 day gpp mean value was calculated from the daily data if more than two days of daily data within a given 8 day period were unavailable the 8 day value was indicated as missing in this study the paddy rice growing period was divided into four phenological transitions and the gpp of the respective transitions was estimated from the equations stated above 2 3 modis data the modis sensor on nasa s terra satellite was launched in december 1999 among the 36 spectral bands of modis seven are mainly designed for studying vegetation and land surface blue 459 479 nm green 545 565 nm red 620 670 nm near infrared 841 875 nm 1230 1250 nm and shortwave infrared 1628 1652 nm 2105 2155 nm the modis sensor has a spatial resolution of 250 m in the red and near infrared bands and 500 m in blue green and shortwave infrared bands in our study the 8 day land surface reflectance mod09a1 500 m spatial resolution datasets from nasa s earthdata search were employed based on the geolocation information latitude and longitude of the paddy rice flux sites the site specific time series of land surface reflectance and quality flags in the study period were extracted from one modis pixel centered on the flux tower poor quality observations were gap filled using a three step procedure jin et al 2013 evi and the land surface water index lswi were calculated using 8 day synthesized surface reflectance data from four spectral bands blue red near infrared 841 875 nm and shortwave infrared 1628 1652 nm evi huete et al 2002 1997 and lswi xiao et al 2004a were calculated as follows 4 e v i g Ï n i r Ï r e d Ï n i r c 1 Ï r e d c 2 Ï b l u e l 5 l s w i Ï n i r Ï s w i r Ï n i r Ï s w i r 2 4 vegetation photosynthesis model based on the concept that a vegetation canopy is composed of chlorophyll chl and non photosynthetic vegetation npv that includes materials at both the canopy level e g stem branch senescent leaves and leaf level e g cell walls vein and other pigments vpm was developed to estimate the gpp over the photosynthetically active period of vegetation as the product of the par absorbed by chlorophyll aparchl fparchl par and lue xiao et al 2004a thus vpm can be described as 6 g p p Îµ g f p a r c h l p a r where Îµ g is the lue for gpp Î¼mol co2 Î¼mol ppfd and par is in units of Î¼mol ppfd within the photosynthetically active period of vegetation fparchl is estimated as a linear function of evi and a coefficient Î± in this study Î± is set to 1 0 xiao et al 2004a 2004b zhang et al 2016 7 f p a r c h l Î± e v i the lue value Îµ g is affected by temperature and water and can be expressed as 8 Îµ g Îµ 0 t s c a l a r w s c a l a r where Îµ 0 is the apparent quantum yield or maximum lue Î¼mol co2 Î¼mol ppfd or g c mol ppfd in view of its variation with environmental conditions Îµ 0 was estimated from four major phenological transitions of paddy rice instead of being assigned a constant value see detailed description in section 2 5 tscalar and wscalar are scalars for the effects of temperature and water on the lue of vegetation respectively using the equation developed for the terrestrial ecosystem model the effect of temperature on photosynthesis tscalar was estimated at each time step as 9 t s c a l a r t t m i n t t m a x t t m i n t t m a x t t o p t 2 where tmin tmax topt denote the minimum maximum and optimal temperature for photosynthetic activity respectively in this study tmin and tmax were set to 0 c cold damage to plants and 48 c heat damage to plants respectively at all sites xin et al 2017 topt was set to the average temperature in each of the four major phenological transitions see detailed description in section 2 5 if the air temperature fell below tmin tscalar was set to zero the effect of water on plant photosynthesis wscalar was estimated from satellite derived lswi as 10 w s c a l a r 1 l s w i 1 l s w i m a x where lswimax is the maximum lswi during the growing season of paddy rice for each pixel based on an analysis of seasonal lswi dynamics derived from modis data the maximum lswi value within the paddy rice growing season was used as an approximation of lswimax 2 5 identification of phenological transitions of paddy rice paddy rice is grown in warm and waterlogged soil the paddy fields are flooded throughout the growing season providing ideal conditions for crops that release large amounts of co2 four major phenological transitions pts were derived from the annual modis evi time series data pt1 from the returning green stage after seedling establishment to tillering pt2 from tillering to the panicle initiation stage pt3 from the panicle initiation stage to heading and finally pt4 from heading to harvest before the pts were extracted the evi time series data from the four flux sites were chronologically combined and the quality of the evi observations in each pixel was examined for contamination by cloud and snow the very few poor quality evi observations were removed and the gaps were filled using a simple gap filling method xiao et al 2003 the savitzky golay filter was then used to smooth the evi observations so as to preserve peak moments among the data and reduce the biased low values caused by atmospheric effects chen et al 2004 savitzky and golay 1964 the two major parameters of this filter namely the half width of the smoothing window m and an integer specifying the degree of the smoothing polynomial d were empirically set to 4 and 2 respectively piecewise logistic functions were used to identify the pts of paddy rice through inflection point estimates within the vi time series from the four flux sites zhang et al 2003 the model can be expressed as follows 11 y t c 1 e a b t d where time t is measured in days y t is the evi value at time t d is the initial background evi value which is generally the minimum evi value in the time series c d is the maximum evi value a and b are fitting parameters the rate of change of the curvature of the fitted logistic model was used to identify the pt dates as these often coincide with the time when the rate of change of the curvature of the logistic function achieves a local minimum or maximum zhang et al 2003 the rate of change in curvature can be calculated as 12 k b 3 c z 3 z 1 z 1 z 3 2 1 z 3 b 2 c 2 z 1 z 4 b c z 2 5 2 1 z 2 1 2 z 5 z 2 1 z 4 b c z 2 3 2 where z ea bt and a b t are the same as in eq 11 we define the metrics es t and hd as the dates at which the intersect of the fitting curve and the rate of change of the curvature of the fitting curve reach their first maximum first minimum and second maximum in the first half of the year similarly the metrics he and ha are defined as the dates at which the intersect of the fitting curve and the rate of change of the curvature of the logistic function achieve their first and second minima of the second half of the year thus the length of the four major pts can be calculated from the gaps between these metrics with pt1 es t pt2 hd t pt3 he hd and pt4 ha he 2 6 simulation of vpm based on the four major pts of paddy rice the maximum lue was estimated using the michaelis menten light response equation the optimum temperatures were given by the 8 day mean temperatures of each pt if the start date of each pt was located in the first half of one 8 day period the 8 day mean temperature was used to estimate the optimum temperature in that pt if the end date of each pt was located in the second half of one 8 day period the 8 day mean temperature was used in the estimation of optimum temperature in that pt thus the gpp was simulated in all four pts based on the improved maximum lue and optimum temperatures this improved vpm is named phenology based vpm pvpm finally the proposed pvpm was applied to the four paddy rice flux sites to estimate the gpp with all other parameters the same as for conventional vpm the pts derived from the modis evi data at the four paddy rice flux sites were evaluated alongside other relevant research results the gpp estimated from pvpm were compared with estimations from conventional vpm and mod17a2h data as well as gpp derived from data at the flux sites the determination coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse were calculated to assess the accuracy of each approach 3 results 3 1 seasonal dynamics of climate vegetation indices and gppec fig 1 compares the air temperature and par across the four sites over several years the seasonal dynamics of par at the four sites are similar with comparatively high values in the summer the seasonal dynamics of air temperature at the four sites are also similar with the highest values observed in mid summer a comparison of gppec within the growing season among the four sites is shown in fig 2 at mse gppec increases after the paddy rice is transplanted in early may reaches its peak in late july early august 10 g c m 2 day 1 and drops sharply by early september at hfk paddy rice gppec starts to increase rapidly in mid june reaches its peak in mid august 10 g c m 2 day 1 and declines quickly from mid september into october at twt gppec starts to increase from late may to mid june about one month later in 2012 reaches its peak value of nearly 15 g c m 2 day 1 in august september in 2012 and decreases until it is harvested in late october mid november in 2012 at jz the farmers transplant rice from late may to early june and harvest it in mid september gppec starts to rise steadily in june reaches its peak value in late july or early august and gradually drops until it is harvested in mid september the 8 day maximum gppec among these four sites covering nine site years varies from 5 20 g c m 2 day 1 fig 2 fig 3 compares two vis evi and lswi at the four sites at mse evi starts to gradually increase in may and lswi increases steeply in late april both vis start to drop steeply in september at hfk evi and lswi increase steadily until mid june and decrease quickly in september at twt both evi and lswi rise gradually in june and start to decline in august 2011 or september 2012 at jz following the harvest of oilseed rape in late may the field is flooded and rice plants are transplanted evi rises rapidly in mid june corresponding to the rapid rise in gppec fig 4 by early or mid september evi and lswi reach 0 2 and 0 1 respectively corresponding to the harvest season of paddy rice 3 2 key pts of paddy rice the rates of change in the curvature of the fitted logistic models derived from flux tower evi based data are shown in fig 4 the evi dynamics at the four flux sites are similar with the highest value in mid summer and the lowest value at the beginning of the growing season or after the harvest the day of the year doy at the beginning and at the end of the four pts are summarized in table 3 the length of the plant growing season los is somewhat different at the four sites at mse the los varies from 109 125 days with an average los of 117 days from 2003 2005 at hfk the los is 115 in 2008 almost the same as the average los at mse the los at twt is greater than 135 days in both 2011 and 2012 at jz the los is less than 100 days in 2010 2013 and 2018 and the variations among the los are very small in terms of the start date of pt1 sdpt mse has a similar date in 2003 and 2004 doys of 142 and 143 whereas the sdpt in 2005 is about one week later the sdpt at hfk is 168 later than that of mse at twt the sdpt in 2012 is nearly one month later than that in 2011 at jz the sdpt is similar in 2010 2013 and 2018 doys of 158 155 and 152 respectively at mse twt and jz the sdpt is relatively close except twt in 2012 with regard to the end date of pt4 edpt mse and jz exhibit small variations whereas hfk and twt are similar in 2011 table 3 to validate the pts of paddy rice across the four sites as much information as possible was collected from the literature at mse in 2003 and 2004 rice seedlings were transplanted in early may and harvested in mid september inoue et al 2008 lee et al 2017 usually rice seedlings will turn or return green 7 35 days depending on rice variety meteorology of site location and local environmental factors after planting or transplanting saichuk et al 2009 from this perspective an sdpt in late may and an edpt in mid september are reasonable according to previous research rice planting and harvesting occurred in early june and early october at hfk in 2008 kwon et al 2010 the sdpt in mid june and the edpt in early october are in good agreement with this research at twt the general schedule calls for planting in mid late april and harvesting between late september and late october with the exception of 2012 when planting was delayed until mid may due to a late rainy season knox et al 2016 the planting time lag in 2012 and the sdpt in early june were detected in our research previous studies at jz show that the transplanting date is usually in early june and the turning green date lags by around one week with the harvest time typically in early mid september su et al 2013 this agrees well with our sdpt in early june and harvest date in mid september 3 3 estimation of maximum lue É0 and optimum temperature during pts based on the four pts extracted from the modis evi data the maximum lue and optimum temperature were estimated using the co2 flux data and climate data from the four flux sites in a previous study of gpp estimations for paddy rice the maximum lue É0 was set to 0 05 mol co2 mol ppfd 0 6 g c mol ppfd xin et al 2017 however this quantity varies considerably during the four pts over the four flux sites table 4 at mse from 2003 2005 the maximum É0 appears in pt2 and varies from 0 058 0 065 while the minimum appears in pt1 or pt4 and varies from 0 to 04 at hfk the maximum É0 is 0 047 in pt4 while the minimum É0 is 0 036 in pt1 at twt in 2011 and 2012 the maximum É0 changes from 0 038 to 0 04 and appears in pt3 while the minimum É0 is 0 02 in pt1 at jz in 2010 the maximum É0 is 0 05 in pt2 and the minimum É0 is 0 03 in pt3 and pt4 for the other years at this site 2013 and 2018 the maximum É0 is 0 045 in pt4 and the minimum É0 is 0 03 in pt2 2013 and pt1 2018 in a previous study on gpp estimations for paddy rice the relationship between the daily mean air temperature and the gpp from flux data was investigated as a means of defining the optimum temperature topt xin et al 2017 table 5 presents the improved optimum temperatures estimated from the pts at the four flux sites tpopt at mse from 2003 2005 tpopt varies from 19 31 27 06 c at hfk the maximum tpopt is 27 98 c in pt3 while the minimum tpopt is 23 24 c in pt1 at twt tpopt ranges from 16 66 20 83 c the maximum tpopt occurs in pt2 of 2011 whereas the minimum occurs in pt4 of 2012 at jz tpopt varies from 25 28 30 51 c over the three years considered in this study the maximum tpopt values occur in pt3 whereas the minimum values occur in pt1 generally there are substantial differences between the optimum temperatures in each pt tpopt and the optimum temperature over the growing season topt at all four flux sites 3 4 temporal dynamics of gpp as predicted by pvpm within growing seasons the temporal dynamics of gpp predicted by pvpm gpppvpm are plotted against the temporal dynamics of gppec derived from the individual flux sites nine site years in fig 5 at mse gpppvpm accurately tracks both the seasonal dynamics and inter annual variation of gppec from 2003 2005 except for some slight overestimation of the gppec peak period in 2005 at hfk gpppvpm rises sharply in july reaches a peak in august and drops rapidly in late september which clearly tracks the temporal dynamics of gppec at twt gpppvpm agrees well with gppec in 2011 in terms of the seasonal maximum the 8 day maximum gpppvpm value is slightly higher than gppec in 2012 fig 5 at jz gpppvpm tracks both the seasonal dynamics and inter annual variation of gppec well in 2010 2013 and 2018 there are some slight differences at the heading stage of paddy rice in 2018 overall the temporal dynamics of gpppvpm and gppec are in good agreement at all four sites scatterplots of gpppvpm and gppec over the paddy rice growing seasons exhibit strong linear correlations at all four paddy rice sites fig 6 the correlation between gpppvpm and gppec was also compared with that between gppvpm and gppec based on the same temporal data see detailed discussion in section 4 2 the coefficient of determination is greater than 0 9 at all four flux sites hfk has the highest r2 of 0 95 while twt has the largest rmse of 1 22 g c m 2 day 1 4 discussion 4 1 performance of gppec and daily air temperature vis in four pts of paddy rice fields the relationship between gppec and daily mean air temperature ta through the entire growing season has been described in previous research on paddy rice gpp estimation alberto et al 2009 saito et al 2005 xin et al 2017 generally gppec increases with ta until it becomes saturated at a certain temperature as pvpm is based on the phenology of paddy rice the relationship between gppec and ta during the pts is investigated through the correlation between these parameters in pt1 pt2 pt3 and pt4 the results are shown in fig 7 in pt1 gppec gradually increases as temperature rises except at twt in 2012 where gppec first decreases with increasing temperature before increasing as the temperature rises further at mse hfk and jz the variation in gppec ranges from 0 5 g c m 2 day 1 during pt1 the variation in gppec at twt has a broader range of 0 10 g c m 2 day 1 at mse in pt2 and pt3 gppec rises as ta increases and appears to saturate or plateau at 25 c this behavior is different from that reported in previous studies which suggested a plateau at 20 c xin et al 2017 at jz in pt2 and pt3 gppec increases as ta rises plateauing at 29 c at hfk in pt2 gppec climbs as ta increases and reaches a peak at 29 c however there is no significant trend in pt3 at this site this may be because only a single year of flux data was used in this research at twt in pt2 and pt3 gppec first increases as the temperature rises before reaching a peak and decreasing as ta increases further in pt4 the relationship between gppec and ta is broadly consistent at all four flux sites with gppec increasing as ta rises fig 8 illustrates the relationship between the 8 day evi and the corresponding gppec in the four pts across three sites hfk is neglected in this analysis because the 8 day gppec and evi data only covered a single year simple quadratic polynomial regression analyses show that gppec is strongly correlated with evi during all four pts at twt this conclusion is slightly inconsistent with previous results which indicated a strong linear relationships between gppec and evi over the full growing seasons at twt xin et al 2017 one potential reason for the lack of a linear correlation in the present study is that data from two years 2011 and 2012 were used in this research whereas xin et al 2017 used data from a six year period 2009 2014 at mse and jz gppec exhibits a strong relationship with evi in pt1 and pt4 however the relationship becomes weaker in pt3 at mse these results indicate that gppec rises as evi increases in the early growing season and declines as evi decreases at the end of the growth period in the peak growing season especially in pt3 evi remains in a relatively narrow range with small variations which is consistent with the idea that evi should be in a stable range with high values during the heading period of paddy rice 4 2 comparison among gppec gpppvpm gppvpm and gpp from the mod17a2h data product the estimation of gpp from pvpm is more accurate than the gpp determined from directly flux the sites fig 5 additionally comparisons of gpppvpm vs gppec and gppvpm vs gppec at the same site and within the same year are shown in fig 6 based on fixed values of É0 and the optimum temperature the vpm used in xin s study was employed to simulate the gpp of rice paddy plants at sites in japan south korea and the usa at jz fixed parameters were set to estimate gppvpm xin et al 2017 at all four sites the correlation between gpppvpm and gppec is stronger than that between gppvpm and gppec and the rmse of gpppvpm vs gppec is lower than that of gppvpm vs gppec mod17a2h is a widely used global gpp data product and has been applied in many studies of forests grasslands and crops fu et al 2017 tagesson et al 2017 wang et al 2017 recently it has been suggested that gpp from the mod17a2h product underestimates gppec gitelson et al 2014 he et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 fig 9 compares gppec gppvpm gpppvpm and gppmod17a2h at the four paddy rice sites gppmod17a2h is significantly lower than gppec gppvpm and gpppvpm at all four sites during the crop growing season thus the simulation accuracy of vpm is greater than that of gppmod17a2h however gppvpm is slightly higher than gppec at mse in 2004 during the peak growing season furthermore it yields moderate overestimates at hfk in the first half of the growing season in 2008 and produces similar overestimates in the peak of the growing season at twt in 2011 2012 and at jz in 2010 2013 and 2018 the substantial underestimation in gppmod17a2h relative to gppec gppvpm and gpppvpm can be attributed to the climate data and the maximum lue parameter used by xin et al 2017 the moderate overestimation in gppvpm relative to gppec and gpppvpm may be the result of the value of É0 used in the model the maximum lue is an essential parameter in lue models but suffers from significant uncertainty among different models and biome types in the mod17a2h data product the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer photosynthesis modis psn model uses 0 22 g c mol ppfd 1 004 g c mj as its É0 parameter for croplands see the daily gpp and annual npp mod17a2 a3 products nasa earth observing system modis land algorithm in a previous gpp estimation study É0 was set to 0 6 g c mol ppfd 0 05 mol co2 mol ppfd for vpm simulations of paddy rice xin et al 2017 compared with the É0 value used in the mod17a2h data product and the vpm estimation of paddy rice the value of É0 estimated from the four pts in pvpm may be more appropriate as this allows gpppvpm to capture seasonal variations in gppec among the four paddy rice sites 4 3 comparison between gppec gpppvpm gpppvpm lue and gpppvpm topt the optimum temperature topt is another key parameter in the lue model that often varies among models and biome types a review paper highlighted the temperature acclimation and adaptation of photosynthesis for c3 and c4 plants yamori et al 2014 recently a study on npp revealed that for forest gpp estimation from the casa model the optimum temperature defined in the peak of the growing season was more appropriate than that determined by the mean temperature of the month in which ndvi reaches its maximum pei et al 2018 from this viewpoint tpopt was averaged over the four pts defined in this study xin et al 2017 used values of 20 c 25 c and 18 c as their topt parameters for paddy rice in vpm to evaluate the performance of the improved optimum temperature and maximum lue the gpp values estimated from the improved topt gpppvpm tpopt from the improved maximum lue gpppvpm lue and from combining the improved topt and maximum lue gpppvpm were compared with gppec fig 10 shows the results there is a substantial overestimation in gpppvpm tpopt compared with gpppvpm and gppec during the peak growing season at hfk twt and jz this demonstrates the degree of uncertainty in gpp estimates of paddy rice when using only the 8 day mean temperature as the optimum temperature in the pts nevertheless using pts to estimate the optimum temperature is reasonable and satellite based vis make it possible to delineate accurate pts wang and wu 2019 wu et al 2017 yamori et al 2014 additional research should compare the tpopt values derived from various methods gpppvpm lue is slightly lower than gppec at twt in 2012 and slightly higher than gppec in the peak growing season at hfk and jz in 2018 a comparison of gpppvpm lue and gppec implies that the maximum lue estimation in the pts is helpful in approaching the observed gpp generally with regard to the improved maximum lue and optimum temperature gpppvpm tracks gppec more accurately than gpppvpm lue and gpppvpm tpopt at the four paddy rice sites this comparison suggests that both the maximum lue and tpopt estimated using the pts of paddy rice could be of great value for gpp estimation 4 4 sources of error and uncertainty in gpp estimation from pvpm in paddy rice cropland the results of this research demonstrate that the temporal dynamics of gpppvpm agree well with those of gppec figs 5 and 6 with some acceptable overestimation in the peak of the growing season at mse in 2005 and jz in 2018 pts were introduced into the gpp estimation of paddy rice many methods of deriving land surface phenology indicators from remotely sensed data or co2 ec measurements have been developed but there is no wholly appropriate method for extracting temporal information on paddy rice recently a rule based algorithm called phenorice was developed for the automatic extraction of phenology information on rice crops boschetti et al 2017 because the test sites used to develop phenorice italy india and philippines are totally different from the sites considered in this study there could be many uncertainties in terms of diverse genetics environmental conditions and management techniques thus a traditional and comprehensive method of deriving vegetation phenology zhang et al 2003 was employed and the good agreement between the pts of paddy rice and phenology information derived from the literature demonstrates the rationality of the method applied in this study as the benefits and limitations of the method have already been discussed verbesselt et al 2010 white et al 2014 zhang et al 2004 additional work should focus on using more paddy rice flux sites and data from additional years to provide a more comprehensive comparison of different phenology extraction methods maximum lue is one of the main parameters in the pvpm two previous in situ studies estimated the maximum lue in predicting rice yields in the philippines italy and the usa and found that this parameter varied in the range 0 08 0 20 mol co2 mol ppfd campbell et al 2001 kiniry et al 2001 in another case of rice gpp estimation the maximum lue was set to 0 1 mol co2 mol ppfd in the derivation of an lue model chen et al 2011 in a recent study of gpp estimation in paddy rice fields 0 05 mol co2 mol ppfd was applied at four sites in asia and the usa xin et al 2017 table 4 demonstrates that there is some discrepancy between the maximum lue over a complete growing season and during the pts which is consistent with expert knowledge that the maximum lue varies among the same ecosystem type over different regions xiao et al 2011 xue et al 2016 the good agreement between gpppvpm and gppec in our study implies that the maximum lue estimated in the pts reduces the uncertainty of this parameter and provides a substantial improvement in gpp estimations for paddy rice cropland another potential source of error is the uncertainty of climate datasets such as par cai et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 he et al 2014 and temperature remotely sensed data are rarely used in studies on the optimum temperature of paddy rice in gpp estimation although the improved optimum temperature has a limited impact in our study the trends in optimum temperature in the pts of paddy rice crops conform to the rhythms of rice growth and could be used to promote growth in future research the third main potential source of error concerns the estimation of site based gppec in this study different methods were used to calculate gppec at four sites which may have introduced extra uncertainty into the comparison between gpppvpm and gppec other sources of error such as the uncertainty of evi time series data derived from modis imagery and mismatches in the spatial relationship between the footprint of a co2 flux tower and a modis pixel were discussed by xin et al 2017 5 conclusions the integration of pts derived from time series of modis images and co2 flux measurements from eddy flux sites at four paddy rice sites has been used to obtain accurate gpp estimations the gppec data from the flux sites exhibit various trends with respect to daily mean air temperature during the pts rather than the single trends generalized from the entire growing season the observed co2 flux data also present diverse tendencies with respect to the evi time seris from modis during the pts in contrast to the single trends inferred from the full growing season for this reason the estimation of driving parameters in lue models according to the land surface phenology is an effective way of improving gpp estimation taking into account the uncertainty of the maximum lue and optimum temperature in vpm these parameters were estimated from the four major pts corresponding to the physiological features of paddy rice this is the first case study to use a phenology based strategy to optimize the maximum lue and optimum temperature in the gpp estimation of paddy rice croplands the results indicate that estimating the maximum lue and optimum temperature in pts is more appropriate in terms of capturing the temporal dynamics and inter annual variations of gpp at paddy rice sites than attempting to improve either the maximum lue or optimum temperature to complement and improve the global flux network further assessment of the phenology based lue model at other paddy rice sites with comparative co2 flux measurements would be of great value in determining universal parameter values across various regions the extrapolation of site scale flux measurements to the regional or national scale should be achievable in the near future using the presented methodology 6 funding this work was supported by the strategic priority research program a of the chinese academy of sciences grant number xda23100201

24648,paddy rice is one of the main grain crops in the world accurate estimations of the gross primary production gpp of paddy rice are essential for assessing rice grain production and monitoring the carbon cycle in paddy fields with the aim of providing ideal conditions for crops throughout the growing season several studies have demonstrated the advantages of combining the eddy covariance technique with remotely sensed data to model gpp at co2 eddy flux tower sites as paddy rice continuously changes during its growth and development and important growth events frequently occur it is critical to observe the growing conditions at various stages of the process to better understand the variations in gpp at different growth stages two key parameters that drive the vegetation photosynthesis model vpm are analyzed and estimated at various phenological phases specifically general piecewise logistic functions are used to extract phenological transitions from data at four paddy rice flux tower sites the maximum light use efficiency lue and optimum temperature are estimated from these phenological transitions and these indicators are used to drive the vpm to simulate gpp over multiple years at the four sites the simulation results show that gpp based on our phenological transition based vpm gpppvpm agrees reasonably well with the variations of gpp estimated from co2 flux data gppec r2 0 9 in addition a comparison indicates that gpppvpm tracks the seasonal dynamics of gppec better than gpp estimated from the original vpm furthermore gpp based on the improved maximum lue is lower than gppec at most flux sites and gpp based on the improved optimum temperature is higher than gppec these comparisons imply that the maximum lue and optimum temperature estimated in the phenological transitions of paddy rice are beneficial to enhance the accuracy of gpp estimation the improved estimation of gpp provides phenological insights into the temporal dynamics of vegetation photosynthesis in paddy fields keywords maximum light use efficiency optimum temperature gross primary production vegetation photosynthesis model co2 fluxes paddy rice phenology 1 introduction paddy rice fields are among the major global agricultural ecosystems and were estimated to cover approximately 167 million hectares worldwide in 2017 faostat 2017 the majority of the world s paddy fields are in asia accounting for approximately 87 of the globally harvested rice area and 90 of global rice production faostat 2017 irrigated rice fields are also one of the major sources of methane ch4 as the inherent anaerobic soil conditions are conducive to methane production neue 1993 although several in situ studies have reported that paddy rice fields enable high levels of carbon sequestration and act as net sinks for carbon dioxide co2 bhattacharyya et al 2014 liu et al 2013 pan et al 2004 predictions of the carbon fluxes in paddy rice fields suffer from considerable uncertainties xin et al 2017 the exchange of co2 between agricultural ecosystems and the atmosphere plays an important role in the carbon cycle the amount of co2 fixed from radiant energy absorbed by the paddy rice field is strongly related to the physiological and phenological activities of croplands hanan et al 2002 therefore the measurement of co2 fluxes in paddy rice fields is crucial in clarifying the physiological responses of crops to environmental conditions furthermore a better understanding of this process will be beneficial for the prediction of grain production under climate change conditions the gross primary production gpp of paddy rice reflects the co2 flux fixed by crops through the process of photosynthesis and is the main variable determining crop yield the eddy covariance ec technique is one of the best micrometeorological methods for measuring the net exchange of co2 between the atmosphere and the surface of various ecosystems the observed net ecosystem exchange nee data can be partitioned into gpp and ecosystem respiration denoted as re baldocchi et al 2001 these nee data and the derived gpp and re data from flux sites have been widely used to support the development of gpp simulation models for satellite remote sensing and climate data at regional and global scales running et al 1999 stockli et al 2008 williams et al 2009 ec flux measurements from global flux networks provide valuable information for calibrating and validating the parameters of these models in an attempt to improve the gpp estimation capability facilitating numerous studies of carbon fluxes over paddy rice ecosystems alberto et al 2009 baldocchi et al 2001 choi et al 2018 hwang et al 2020 knox et al 2015 saito et al 2005 xin et al 2017 light use efficiency lue models have significant potential to address the spatial and temporal dynamics of gpp because they take advantage of extensive satellite observations yuan et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 these satellite based models assume that the gpp of a terrestrial ecosystem is directly related to the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar through lue monteith 1972 1977 and have been developed to estimate the gpp of terrestrial ecosystems through vegetation indices vis derived from remotely sensed optical images and meteorological data barton and north 2001 brogaard et al 2005 machwitz et al 2015 nichol et al 2000 potter et al 1993 yuan et al 2007 the gpp estimated from these models is the product of apar and the lue denoted as Îµg i e gpp apar Îµg earlier studies using lue models employed the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation par absorbed by the vegetation canopy fparcanopy to estimate aparcanopy par fpar where fparcanopy was approximated using vis potter et al 1993 zhao et al 2005 for example the mod17 product employs mod15a2 fpar which is a canopy level fpar comprised of both photosynthetic and non photosynthetic components cheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 as the fraction of par absorbed by chlorophyll fparchl contributes to vegetation photosynthesis it is more reasonable to use fparchl to estimate gpp par fparchl Îµg sims et al 2006 wu et al 2010 xiao et al 2004b zhang et al 2009 2006 the vegetation photosynthesis model vpm was the first lue based model to use fparchl to estimate gpp xiao et al 2004a previous research has shown the comprehensive ability of vpm to estimate gpp over a variety of co2 flux sites wu et al 2018 including forests xiao et al 2004a 2004b 2005a xiao et al 2005b savanna jin et al 2013 grassland wang et al 2010 yang et al 2019 and cropland ma et al 2020 wang et al 2010 recently vpm has been successfully applied to the estimation of gpp in paddy rice fields xin et al 2017 in vpm the actual lue Îµg may be less than its theoretical maximum because of environmental stresses such as extreme temperatures water shortages or flooding therefore Îµg is determined by the maximum lue Îµ0 and a water stress factor wscalar as well as a temperature stress factor tscalar i e Îµg Îµ0 tscalar wscalar in most research on paddy rice gpp estimation using vpm the ecosystem level Îµ0can be obtained from analysis of the nee of co2 and the incident par Î¼mol m2 s at co2 eddy flux sites either by using the hyperbolic light response function alberto et al 2009 inoue et al 2008 lindner et al 2016 saito et al 2005 yang et al 2018 or by taking a suitable value from the literature xin et al 2017 yan et al 2009 the Îµ0 estimates given by the former approach are based on analyses of half hourly nee and incident par data either by dividing the entire growing season into several growth periods saito et al 2005 or by considering the entire growing season at the flux sites alberto et al 2009 some photosynthesis research has demonstrated that within c3 species annual herbaceous plants e g paddy rice display weaker temperature homeostasis of photosynthesis than perennial herbaceous plants e g wheat yamori et al 2014 more importantly the growth and development of paddy rice plants involve continuous change which means that important growth events occur frequently therefore the overall daily or healthy growth stages of the plant are crucial to better understand the development of paddy rice and properly manage the rice crop it is essential to separate the entire growing season of paddy rice into individual growing seasons according to physiological and phenological characteristics for É0 estimation moreover the effect of temperature stress tscalar is an uncertain factor in lue models due to the relationship between temperature and photosynthesis few scholars have focused on the temperature stress factors in vpm tscalar is determined by two temperature factors tmin and tmax the basic hypothesis behind tmin and tmax is that vegetation growth acclimatizes to the optimum temperature topt which is defined as the mean temperature of the month when the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi reaches its maximum field et al 1995 potter et al 1993 or the average temperature of the growth season yan et al 2009 however this definition may not be comprehensive for the following reasons 1 in cropland ecosystems the growing seasons of crops span several physiological stages and the use of a uniform average temperature in the growing season either site specific or on a regional scale needs to be improved 2 due to extreme weather events or natural disasters the maximum ndvi or enhanced vegetation index evi values in some areas may not occur in july or august as typically expected and 3 abnormal maximum ndvi or evi values may occur for other reasons recent work has shown that improvements in phenology based research on optimum temperatures significantly enhances forest net primary production npp estimations using the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model pei et al 2018 however this approach has not yet been applied to estimations of the gpp of crop ecosystems to overcome uncertainties in the determination of the maximum lue É0 of paddy rice fields and the limitations of the definition of optimum temperature in the lue model this research first attempts to understand and estimate the model parameters É0 and optimum temperature at various phenological phases and then generates improved gpp estimations by running vpm with parameters that are appropriate for the individual phenological phases the results of this work are expected to make a significant contribution in terms of improving the accuracy of gpp estimation and promoting our long term monitoring capabilities in rice agriculture which feeds more than 50 of the global population 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites for this study we selected four paddy rice flux sites namely the mase paddy rice site in japan the haenam paddy rice site in south korea the twitchell island paddy rice site in california usa and the jingzhou paddy rice site in china table 1 for detailed descriptions of the four sites see the ameriflux http ameriflux lbl gov sites siteinfo us twt and asiaflux http asiaflux net websites or the report by su et al 2013 the flux footprint of the four sites has been analyzed by su et al 2013 and xin et al 2017 2 1 1 mase paddy rice site japan the mase mse paddy rice flux site 36 05 n 140 03 e is located in a rural area of tsukuba city in central japan about 50 km northeast of tokyo saito et al 2005 the site is surrounded by artificially irrigated flat paddy rice fields measuring 1 5 km north to south by 1 km east to west the climate is warm and humid with a mean annual air temperature of 13 5 c and mean annual precipitation of 1236 mm the paddy rice fields around the tower are planted with single season rice representing the regional cropping practice and calendar the paddy rice fields are generally plowed fertilized and flooded in late april transplanted in early may begin to ear in late july and early august and are harvested in mid late september ono et al 2015 saito et al 2007 sasai et al 2012 2 1 2 haenam paddy rice site south korea the haenam hfk paddy rice site 34 55 n 126 57 e is located in haenam gun jeollanamdo south korea near the southwestern end of the korean peninsula which is characterized by heterogeneous land cover types consisting of rice paddies and different patches of various land use kwon et al 2010 the terrain around the flux tower is relatively flat with an elevation of 13 7 m above sea level the mean annual air temperature is 13 8 c and the mean annual precipitation is 1306 mm ryu et al 2008 the production model of this region is mainly two crop rotation other crops and paddy rice the paddy rice fields are generally transplanted in early july and harvested in late september early october kwon et al 2010 2 1 3 twitchell island paddy rice site usa the twitchell island twt paddy rice site 38 11 n 121 63 w is administered by the california department of water resources and is located on twitchell island in the sacramento san joaquin delta california usa about 100 km inland from the pacific ocean knox et al 2015 the region is dominated by a mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and cool and wet winters the mean annual air temperature is 15 1 c and the mean annual precipitation is 326 mm two varieties of rice are planted from mid april to may and harvested between late september and early november hatala et al 2012 knox et al 2016 2015 2 1 4 jingzhou paddy rice site china the jingzhou jz paddy rice site 30 34 n 112 12 w is administered by the agricultural meteorological experimental station in jingzhou city hubei province china the site is located on the relatively flat jianghan plain which has a north subtropical monsoon climate the annual mean air temperature is 16 5 c and the annual mean precipitation is 1095 mm paddy rice is usually transplanted in early june and harvested in september su et al 2013 2 2 eddy flux tower data the availability quality of measured nee data is very important for model simulation which may have a direct influence on gpp when nee is subsequently divided into gpp and re reichstein et al 2005 the availability of 30 min nee data in the growing season of paddy rice at the four sites were statistically analyzed table 2 and the data processing procedure was briefly summarized 2 2 1 mse flux site the co2 flux at the mse flux site was measured by an open path ec sensor the equipment model setting calibration and measurement of the flux tower have been described in previous studies saito et al 2005 ec flux data contain a large number of errors due to instrument malfunction atmospheric conditions inappropriate for ec measurements rainfall or human disturbances to eliminate these errors the ec data were subjected to quality control procedures as described by saito et al 2005 the gpp and re were also estimated in the same way as saito et al 2005 daily carbon flux data par data and air temperature data were averaged over an 8 day period consistent with modis 8 day composites daily and 8 day data from 2003 2005 within the plant growing season were used in this study 2 2 2 hfk flux site the co2 flux at hfk was measured by an open path ec sensor detailed information about the flux measurements data processing quality control and gap filling has previously been reported hong et al 2009 kwon et al 2010 the data processing method whereby nee was separated into gpp and re was the same as for the mse flux site the hfk site has no quantum sensor with which to directly measure the photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd or par so par was estimated to be 45 of the solar radiation meek et al 1984 and the units of par were converted from w m 2 to Î¼mol m 2 s 1 aber et al 1996 dye 2004 the daily gpp nee and climate data in 2008 were averaged over an 8 day period according to the modis 8 day composite images daily and 8 day data from the paddy rice growing season in 2008 were used in this study 2 2 3 twt flux tower site the co2 flux at twt was measured by an open path ec sensor the half hourly gpp data were downloaded from the ameriflux web site http ameriflux ornl gov the partitioning of nee flux into gpp and re and the gap filling of missing data were as described in previous studies baldocchi et al 2015 knox et al 2016 daily gpp nee and climate data from 2011 2012 were averaged over an 8 day period following the modis 8 day composites daily and 8 day data from the paddy rice growing season in 2011 2012 were used in this study 2 2 4 jz flux site the flux densities of co2 water vapor sensible heat latent heat and momentum as well as the friction velocities over the paddy rice field were measured by the ec method three dimensional wind speeds and temperature fluctuations were measured with a sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc usa an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa was used to measure the co2 flux and water vapor densities at the flux site both the csat3 and li 7500 were installed at a height of 2 m above the ground with a sensor separation of 20 cm the data from the sonic anemometer and analyzer were sampled at 10 hz using a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific inc usa the data logger is connected to the server through the direct communication method of network cable and the data logger program can collect data online through the server raw data acquired at 10 hz were processed using the post processing software eddypro including spike removal lag correction of h2o co2 relative to the vertical wind component sonic virtual temperature correction the performance of the planar fit coordinate rotation corrections for density fluctuation wpl correction frequency response correction etc similar to the test methods used in previous research alberto et al 2009 saito et al 2005 we conducted a stationarity test and integral turbulence characteristics test aubinet et al 2000 foken and wichura 1996 to check the data in addition to the above processing steps the half hourly flux data were screened according to the following criteria i data were rejected when the sensor was malfunctioning e g when there was a fault diagnostic signal ii data were rejected when precipitation occurred within 1 h before and after the collection iii incomplete 30 min data were rejected when the missing ratio was larger than 3 in the 30 min raw record and iv data were rejected at night when the friction velocity was below 0 1 m s 1 p and blanken 1998 liu et al 2011 the average annual rejection rates during the paddy rice growing season were 50 in 2010 56 in 2013 and 32 in 2018 in the subsequent analysis we only used the flux data that passed the above treatment 2 2 5 processing of the flux data ec systems directly measure nee rather than gpp thus the nee of co2 between the atmosphere and paddy rice fields was separated into gpp and re to partition nee into gpp and re a conventional method that estimates the nighttime re i e nee in nighttime hours as an exponential function of air temperature ta was adopted this function was applied to the daytime to estimate the daytime half hourly re falge et al 2001 the simple exponential function is 1 r e a e b t a where a and b are estimated model coefficients and ta is the air temperature b is related to a temperature coefficient q10 as b ln q10 10 and a denotes the value of re at 0 c another commonly used method was employed to gap fill the gpp values corresponding to the time points at which invalid nee data had been removed falge et al 2001 nee is generally expressed as a rectangular hyperbolic function the michaelis menten light response equation of incident par or incident ppfd q p which can be expressed as follows 2 n e e Î± q p g e e m a x Î± q p g e e m a x r e where g e e m a x gpp at saturating light and Î± initial slope of the function or ecosystem quantum yield are empirical constants that can be determined from a regression analysis of the nee and incident ppfd the daily nee re and meteorological variables were estimated by summing the averaged half hourly or hourly rate over 24 h the gpp was estimated as the sum of the nee and re the relationship among gpp nee and re can be expressed as 3 g p p n e e r e the 8 day gpp mean value was calculated from the daily data if more than two days of daily data within a given 8 day period were unavailable the 8 day value was indicated as missing in this study the paddy rice growing period was divided into four phenological transitions and the gpp of the respective transitions was estimated from the equations stated above 2 3 modis data the modis sensor on nasa s terra satellite was launched in december 1999 among the 36 spectral bands of modis seven are mainly designed for studying vegetation and land surface blue 459 479 nm green 545 565 nm red 620 670 nm near infrared 841 875 nm 1230 1250 nm and shortwave infrared 1628 1652 nm 2105 2155 nm the modis sensor has a spatial resolution of 250 m in the red and near infrared bands and 500 m in blue green and shortwave infrared bands in our study the 8 day land surface reflectance mod09a1 500 m spatial resolution datasets from nasa s earthdata search were employed based on the geolocation information latitude and longitude of the paddy rice flux sites the site specific time series of land surface reflectance and quality flags in the study period were extracted from one modis pixel centered on the flux tower poor quality observations were gap filled using a three step procedure jin et al 2013 evi and the land surface water index lswi were calculated using 8 day synthesized surface reflectance data from four spectral bands blue red near infrared 841 875 nm and shortwave infrared 1628 1652 nm evi huete et al 2002 1997 and lswi xiao et al 2004a were calculated as follows 4 e v i g Ï n i r Ï r e d Ï n i r c 1 Ï r e d c 2 Ï b l u e l 5 l s w i Ï n i r Ï

materials at both the canopy level e g stem branch senescent leaves and leaf level e g cell walls vein and other pigments vpm was developed to estimate the gpp over the photosynthetically active period of vegetation as the product of the par absorbed by chlorophyll aparchl fparchl par and lue xiao et al 2004a thus vpm can be described as 6 g p p Îµ g f p a r c h l p a r where Îµ g is the lue for gpp Î¼mol co2 Î¼mol ppfd and par is in units of Î¼mol ppfd within the photosynthetically active period of vegetation fparchl is estimated as a linear function of evi and a coefficient Î± in this study Î± is set to 1 0 xiao et al 2004a 2004b zhang et al 2016 7 f p a r c h l Î± e v i the lue value Îµ g is affected by temperature and water and can be expressed as 8 Îµ g Îµ 0 t s c a l a r w s c

phenological transitions of paddy rice instead of being assigned a constant value see detailed description in section 2 5 tscalar and wscalar are scalars for the effects of temperature and water on the lue of vegetation respectively using the equation developed for the terrestrial ecosystem model the effect of temperature on photosynthesis tscalar was estimated at each time step as 9 t s c a l a r t t m i n t t m a x t t m i n t t m a x t t o p t 2 where tmin tmax topt denote the minimum maximum and optimal temperature for photosynthetic activity respectively in this study tmin and tmax were set to 0 c cold damage to plants and 48 c heat damage to plants respectively at all sites xin et al 2017 topt was set to the average temperature in each of the four major phenological transitions see detailed description in section 2 5 if the air temperature fell below tmin tscalar was set to zero the effect of water on plant photosynthesis wscalar was estimated from satellite derived lswi as 10 w s c a l a r 1 l s w i 1 l s w i m a x where lswimax is the maximum lswi during the growing season of paddy rice for each pixel based on an analysis of seasonal lswi dynamics derived from modis data the maximum lswi value within the paddy rice growing season was used as an approximation of lswimax 2 5 identification of phenological transitions of paddy rice paddy rice is grown in warm and waterlogged soil the paddy fields are flooded throughout the growing season providing ideal conditions for crops that release large amounts of co2 four major phenological transitions pts were derived from the annual modis evi time series data pt1 from the returning green stage after seedling establishment to tillering pt2 from tillering to the panicle initiation stage pt3 from the panicle initiation stage to heading and finally pt4 from heading to harvest before the pts were extracted the evi time series data from the four flux sites were chronologically combined and the quality of the evi observations in each pixel was examined for contamination by cloud and snow the very few poor quality evi observations were removed and the gaps were filled using a simple gap filling method xiao et al 2003 the savitzky golay filter was then used to smooth the evi observations so as to preserve peak moments among the data and reduce the biased low values caused by atmospheric effects chen et al 2004 savitzky and golay 1964 the two major parameters of this filter namely the half width of the smoothing window m and an integer specifying the degree of the smoothing polynomial d were empirically set to 4 and 2 respectively piecewise logistic functions were used to identify the pts of paddy rice through inflection point estimates within the vi time series from the four flux sites zhang et al 2003 the model can be expressed as follows 11 y t c 1 e a b t d where time t is measured in days y t is the evi value at time t d is the initial background evi value which is generally the minimum evi value in the time series c d is the maximum evi value a and b are fitting parameters the rate of change of the curvature of the fitted logistic model was used to identify the pt dates as these often coincide with the time when the rate of change of the curvature of the logistic function achieves a local minimum or maximum zhang et al 2003 the rate of change in curvature can be calculated as 12 k b 3 c z 3 z 1 z 1 z 3 2 1 z 3 b 2 c 2 z 1 z 4 b c z 2 5 2 1 z 2 1 2 z 5 z 2 1 z 4 b c z 2 3 2 where z ea bt and a b t are the same as in eq 11 we define the metrics es t and hd as the dates at which the intersect of the fitting curve and the rate of change of the curvature of the fitting curve reach their first maximum first minimum and second maximum in the first half of the year similarly the metrics he and ha are defined as the dates at which the intersect of the fitting curve and the rate of change of the curvature of the logistic function achieve their first and second minima of the second half of the year thus the length of the four major pts can be calculated from the gaps between these metrics with pt1 es t pt2 hd t pt3 he hd and pt4 ha he 2 6 simulation of vpm based on the four major pts of paddy rice the maximum lue was estimated using the michaelis menten light response equation the optimum temperatures were given by the 8 day mean temperatures of each pt if the start date of each pt was located in the first half of one 8 day period the 8 day mean temperature was used to estimate the optimum temperature in that pt if the end date of each pt was located in the second half of one 8 day period the 8 day mean temperature was used in the estimation of optimum temperature in that pt thus the gpp was simulated in all four pts based on the improved maximum lue and optimum temperatures this improved vpm is named phenology based vpm pvpm finally the proposed pvpm was applied to the four paddy rice flux sites to estimate the gpp with all other parameters the same as for conventional vpm the pts derived from the modis evi data at the four paddy rice flux sites were evaluated alongside other relevant research results the gpp estimated from pvpm were compared with estimations from conventional vpm and mod17a2h data as well as gpp derived from data at the flux sites the determination coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse were calculated to assess the accuracy of each approach 3 results 3 1 seasonal dynamics of climate vegetation indices and gppec fig 1 compares the air temperature and par across the four sites over several years the seasonal dynamics of par at the four sites are similar with comparatively high values in the summer the seasonal dynamics of air temperature at the four sites are also similar with the highest values observed in mid summer a comparison of gppec within the growing season among the four sites is shown in fig 2 at mse gppec increases after the paddy rice is transplanted in early may reaches its peak in late july early august 10 g c m 2 day 1 and drops sharply by early september at hfk paddy rice gppec starts to increase rapidly in mid june reaches its peak in mid august 10 g c m 2 day 1 and declines quickly from mid september into october at twt gppec starts to increase from late may to mid june about one month later in 2012 reaches its peak value of nearly 15 g c m 2 day 1 in august september in 2012 and decreases until it is harvested in late october mid november in 2012 at jz the farmers transplant rice from late may to early june and harvest it in mid september gppec starts to rise steadily in june reaches its peak value in late july or early august and gradually drops until it is harvested in mid september the 8 day maximum gppec among these four sites covering nine site years varies from 5 20 g c m 2 day 1 fig 2 fig 3 compares two vis evi and lswi at the four sites at mse evi starts to gradually increase in may and lswi increases steeply in late april both vis start to drop steeply in september at hfk evi and lswi increase steadily until mid june and decrease quickly in september at twt both evi and lswi rise gradually in june and start to decline in august 2011 or september 2012 at jz following the harvest of oilseed rape in late may the field is flooded and rice plants are transplanted evi rises rapidly in mid june corresponding to the rapid rise in gppec fig 4 by early or mid september evi and lswi reach 0 2 and 0 1 respectively corresponding to the harvest season of paddy rice 3 2 key pts of paddy rice the rates of change in the curvature of the fitted logistic models derived from flux tower evi based data are shown in fig 4 the evi dynamics at the four flux sites are similar with the highest value in mid summer and the lowest value at the beginning of the growing season or after the harvest the day of the year doy at the beginning and at the end of the four pts are summarized in table 3 the length of the plant growing season los is somewhat different at the four sites at mse the los varies from 109 125 days with an average los of 117 days from 2003 2005 at hfk the los is 115 in 2008 almost the same as the average los at mse the los at twt is greater than 135 days in both 2011 and 2012 at jz the los is less than 100 days in 2010 2013 and 2018 and the variations among the los are very small in terms of the start date of pt1 sdpt mse has a similar date in 2003 and 2004 doys of 142 and 143 whereas the sdpt in 2005 is about one week later the sdpt at hfk is 168 later than that of mse at twt the sdpt in 2012 is nearly one month later than that in 2011 at jz the sdpt is similar in 2010 2013 and 2018 doys of 158 155 and 152 respectively at mse twt and jz the sdpt is relatively close except twt in 2012 with regard to the end date of pt4 edpt mse and jz exhibit small variations whereas hfk and twt are similar in 2011 table 3 to validate the pts of paddy rice across the four sites as much information as possible was collected from the literature at mse in 2003 and 2004 rice seedlings were transplanted in early may and harvested in mid september inoue et al 2008 lee et al 2017 usually rice seedlings will turn or return green 7 35 days depending on rice variety meteorology of site location and local environmental factors after planting or transplanting saichuk et al 2009 from this perspective an sdpt in late may and an edpt in mid september are reasonable according to previous research rice planting and harvesting occurred in early june and early october at hfk in 2008 kwon et al 2010 the sdpt in mid june and the edpt in early october are in good agreement with this research at twt the general schedule calls for planting in mid late april and harvesting between late september and late october with the exception of 2012 when planting was delayed until mid may due to a late rainy season knox et al 2016 the planting time lag in 2012 and the sdpt in early june were detected in our research previous studies at jz show that the transplanting date is usually in early june and the turning green date lags by around one week with the harvest time typically in early mid september su et al 2013 this agrees well with our sdpt in early june and harvest date in mid september 3 3 estimation of maximum lue É0 and optimum temperature during pts based on the four pts extracted from the modis evi data the maximum lue and optimum temperature were estimated using the co2 flux data and climate data from the four flux sites in a previous study of gpp estimations for paddy rice the maximum lue É0 was set to 0 05 mol co2 mol ppfd 0 6 g c mol ppfd xin et al 2017 however this quantity varies considerably during the four pts over the four flux sites table 4 at mse from 2003 2005 the maximum É0 appears in pt2 and varies from 0 058 0 065 while the minimum appears in pt1 or pt4 and varies from 0 to 04 at hfk the maximum É0 is 0 047 in pt4 while the minimum É0 is 0 036 in pt1 at twt in 2011 and 2012 the maximum É0 changes from 0 038 to 0 04 and appears in pt3 while the minimum É0 is 0 02 in pt1 at jz in 2010 the maximum É0 is 0 05 in pt2 and the minimum É0 is 0 03 in pt3 and pt4 for the other years at this site 2013 and 2018 the maximum É0 is 0 045 in pt4 and the minimum É0 is 0 03 in pt2 2013 and pt1 2018 in a previous study on gpp estimations for paddy rice the relationship between the daily mean air temperature and the gpp from flux data was investigated as a means of defining the optimum temperature topt xin et al 2017 table 5 presents the improved optimum temperatures estimated from the pts at the four flux sites tpopt at mse from 2003 2005 tpopt varies from 19 31 27 06 c at hfk the maximum tpopt is 27 98 c in pt3 while the minimum tpopt is 23 24 c in pt1 at twt tpopt ranges from 16 66 20 83 c the maximum tpopt occurs in pt2 of 2011 whereas the minimum occurs in pt4 of 2012 at jz tpopt varies from 25 28 30 51 c over the three years considered in this study the maximum tpopt values occur in pt3 whereas the minimum values occur in pt1 generally there are substantial differences between the optimum temperatures in each pt tpopt and the optimum temperature over the growing season topt at all four flux sites 3 4 temporal dynamics of gpp as predicted by pvpm within growing seasons the temporal dynamics of gpp predicted by pvpm gpppvpm are plotted against the temporal dynamics of gppec derived from the individual flux sites nine site years in fig 5 at mse gpppvpm accurately tracks both the seasonal dynamics and inter annual variation of gppec from 2003 2005 except for some slight overestimation of the gppec peak period in 2005 at hfk gpppvpm rises sharply in july reaches a peak in august and drops rapidly in late september which clearly tracks the temporal dynamics of gppec at twt gpppvpm agrees well with gppec in 2011 in terms of the seasonal maximum the 8 day maximum gpppvpm value is slightly higher than gppec in 2012 fig 5 at jz gpppvpm tracks both the seasonal dynamics and inter annual variation of gppec well in 2010 2013 and 2018 there are some slight differences at the heading stage of paddy rice in 2018 overall the temporal dynamics of gpppvpm and gppec are in good agreement at all four sites scatterplots of gpppvpm and gppec over the paddy rice growing seasons exhibit strong linear correlations at all four paddy rice sites fig 6 the correlation between gpppvpm and gppec was also compared with that between gppvpm and gppec based on the same temporal data see detailed discussion in section 4 2 the coefficient of determination is greater than 0 9 at all four flux sites hfk has the highest r2 of 0 95 while twt has the largest rmse of 1 22 g c m 2 day 1 4 discussion 4 1 performance of gppec and daily air temperature vis in four pts of paddy rice fields the relationship between gppec and daily mean air temperature ta through the entire growing season has been described in previous research on paddy rice gpp estimation alberto et al 2009 saito et al 2005 xin et al 2017 generally gppec increases with ta until it becomes saturated at a certain temperature as pvpm is based on the phenology of paddy rice the relationship between gppec and ta during the pts is investigated through the correlation between these parameters in pt1 pt2 pt3 and pt4 the results are shown in fig 7 in pt1 gppec gradually increases as temperature rises except at twt in 2012 where gppec first decreases with increasing temperature before increasing as the temperature rises further at mse hfk and jz the variation in gppec ranges from 0 5 g c m 2 day 1 during pt1 the variation in gppec at twt has a broader range of 0 10 g c m 2 day 1 at mse in pt2 and pt3 gppec rises as ta increases and appears to saturate or plateau at 25 c this behavior is different from that reported in previous studies which suggested a plateau at 20 c xin et al 2017 at jz in pt2 and pt3 gppec increases as ta rises plateauing at 29 c at hfk in pt2 gppec climbs as ta increases and reaches a peak at 29 c however there is no significant trend in pt3 at this site this may be because only a single year of flux data was used in this research at twt in pt2 and pt3 gppec first increases as the temperature rises before reaching a peak and decreasing as ta increases further in pt4 the relationship between gppec and ta is broadly consistent at all four flux sites with gppec increasing as ta rises fig 8 illustrates the relationship between the 8 day evi and the corresponding gppec in the four pts across three sites hfk is neglected in this analysis because the 8 day gppec and evi data only covered a single year simple quadratic polynomial regression analyses show that gppec is strongly correlated with evi during all four pts at twt this conclusion is slightly inconsistent with previous results which indicated a strong linear relationships between gppec and evi over the full growing seasons at twt xin et al 2017 one potential reason for the lack of a linear correlation in the present study is that data from two years 2011 and 2012 were used in this research whereas xin et al 2017 used data from a six year period 2009 2014 at mse and jz gppec exhibits a strong relationship with evi in pt1 and pt4 however the relationship becomes weaker in pt3 at mse these results indicate that gppec rises as evi increases in the early growing season and declines as evi decreases at the end of the growth period in the peak growing season especially in pt3 evi remains in a relatively narrow range with small variations which is consistent with the idea that evi should be in a stable range with high values during the heading period of paddy rice 4 2 comparison among gppec gpppvpm gppvpm and gpp from the mod17a2h data product the estimation of gpp from pvpm is more accurate than the gpp determined from directly flux the sites fig 5 additionally comparisons of gpppvpm vs gppec and gppvpm vs gppec at the same site and within the same year are shown in fig 6 based on fixed values of É0 and the optimum temperature the vpm used in xin s study was employed to simulate the gpp of rice paddy plants at sites in japan south korea and the usa at jz fixed parameters were set to estimate gppvpm xin et al 2017 at all four sites the correlation between gpppvpm and gppec is stronger than that between gppvpm and gppec and the rmse of gpppvpm vs gppec is lower than that of gppvpm vs gppec mod17a2h is a widely used global gpp data product and has been applied in many studies of forests grasslands and crops fu et al 2017 tagesson et al 2017 wang et al 2017 recently it has been suggested that gpp from the mod17a2h product underestimates gppec gitelson et al 2014 he et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 fig 9 compares gppec gppvpm gpppvpm and gppmod17a2h at the four paddy rice sites gppmod17a2h is significantly lower than gppec gppvpm and gpppvpm at all four sites during the crop growing season thus the simulation accuracy of vpm is greater than that of gppmod17a2h however gppvpm is slightly higher than gppec at mse in 2004 during the peak growing season furthermore it yields moderate overestimates at hfk in the first half of the growing season in 2008 and produces similar overestimates in the peak of the growing season at twt in 2011 2012 and at jz in 2010 2013 and 2018 the substantial underestimation in gppmod17a2h relative to gppec gppvpm and gpppvpm can be attributed to the climate data and the maximum lue parameter used by xin et al 2017 the moderate overestimation in gppvpm relative to gppec and gpppvpm may be the result of the value of É0 used in the model the maximum lue is an essential parameter in lue models but suffers from significant uncertainty among different models and biome types in the mod17a2h data product the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer photosynthesis modis psn model uses 0 22 g c mol ppfd 1 004 g c mj as its É0 parameter for croplands see the daily gpp and annual npp mod17a2 a3 products nasa earth observing system modis land algorithm in a previous gpp estimation study É0 was set to 0 6 g c mol ppfd 0 05 mol co2 mol ppfd for vpm simulations of paddy rice xin et al 2017 compared with the É0 value used in the mod17a2h data product and the vpm estimation of paddy rice the value of É0 estimated from the four pts in pvpm may be more appropriate as this allows gpppvpm to capture seasonal variations in gppec among the four paddy rice sites 4 3 comparison between gppec gpppvpm gpppvpm lue and gpppvpm topt the optimum temperature topt is another key parameter in the lue model that often varies among models and biome types a review paper highlighted the temperature acclimation and adaptation of photosynthesis for c3 and c4 plants yamori et al 2014 recently a study on npp revealed that for forest gpp estimation from the casa model the optimum temperature defined in the peak of the growing season was more appropriate than that determined by the mean temperature of the month in which ndvi reaches its maximum pei et al 2018 from this viewpoint tpopt was averaged over the four pts defined in this study xin et al 2017 used values of 20 c 25 c and 18 c as their topt parameters for paddy rice in vpm to evaluate the performance of the improved optimum temperature and maximum lue the gpp values estimated from the improved topt gpppvpm tpopt from the improved maximum lue gpppvpm lue and from combining the improved topt and maximum lue gpppvpm were compared with gppec fig 10 shows the results there is a substantial overestimation in gpppvpm tpopt compared with gpppvpm and gppec during the peak growing season at hfk twt and jz this demonstrates the degree of uncertainty in gpp estimates of paddy rice when using only the 8 day mean temperature as the optimum temperature in the pts nevertheless using pts to estimate the optimum temperature is reasonable and satellite based vis make it possible to delineate accurate pts wang and wu 2019 wu et al 2017 yamori et al 2014 additional research should compare the tpopt values derived from various methods gpppvpm lue is slightly lower than gppec at twt in 2012 and slightly higher than gppec in the peak growing season at hfk and jz in 2018 a comparison of gpppvpm lue and gppec implies that the maximum lue estimation in the pts is helpful in approaching the observed gpp generally with regard to the improved maximum lue and optimum temperature gpppvpm tracks gppec more accurately than gpppvpm lue and gpppvpm tpopt at the four paddy rice sites this comparison suggests that both the maximum lue and tpopt estimated using the pts of paddy rice could be of great value for gpp estimation 4 4 sources of error and uncertainty in gpp estimation from pvpm in paddy rice cropland the results of this research demonstrate that the temporal dynamics of gpppvpm agree well with those of gppec figs 5 and 6 with some acceptable overestimation in the peak of the growing season at mse in 2005 and jz in 2018 pts were introduced into the gpp estimation of paddy rice many methods of deriving land surface phenology indicators from remotely sensed data or co2 ec measurements have been developed but there is no wholly appropriate method for extracting temporal information on paddy rice recently a rule based algorithm called phenorice was developed for the automatic extraction of phenology information on rice crops boschetti et al 2017 because the test sites used to develop phenorice italy india and philippines are totally different from the sites considered in this study there could be many uncertainties in terms of diverse genetics environmental conditions and management techniques thus a traditional and comprehensive method of deriving vegetation phenology zhang et al 2003 was employed and the good agreement between the pts of paddy rice and phenology information derived from the literature demonstrates the rationality of the method applied in this study as the benefits and limitations of the method have already been discussed verbesselt et al 2010 white et al 2014 zhang et al 2004 additional work should focus on using more paddy rice flux sites and data from additional years to provide a more comprehensive comparison of different phenology extraction methods maximum lue is one of the main parameters in the pvpm two previous in situ studies estimated the maximum lue in predicting rice yields in the philippines italy and the usa and found that this parameter varied in the range 0 08 0 20 mol co2 mol ppfd campbell et al 2001 kiniry et al 2001 in another case of rice gpp estimation the maximum lue was set to 0 1 mol co2 mol ppfd in the derivation of an lue model chen et al 2011 in a recent study of gpp estimation in paddy rice fields 0 05 mol co2 mol ppfd was applied at four sites in asia and the usa xin et al 2017 table 4 demonstrates that there is some discrepancy between the maximum lue over a complete growing season and during the pts which is consistent with expert knowledge that the maximum lue varies among the same ecosystem type over different regions xiao et al 2011 xue et al 2016 the good agreement between gpppvpm and gppec in our study implies that the maximum lue estimated in the pts reduces the uncertainty of this parameter and provides a substantial improvement in gpp estimations for paddy rice cropland another potential source of error is the uncertainty of climate datasets such as par cai et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 he et al 2014 and temperature remotely sensed data are rarely used in studies on the optimum temperature of paddy rice in gpp estimation although the improved optimum temperature has a limited impact in our study the trends in optimum temperature in the pts of paddy rice crops conform to the rhythms of rice growth and could be used to promote growth in future research the third main potential source of error concerns the estimation of site based gppec in this study different methods were used to calculate gppec at four sites which may have introduced extra uncertainty into the comparison between gpppvpm and gppec other sources of error such as the uncertainty of evi time series data derived from modis imagery and mismatches in the spatial relationship between the footprint of a co2 flux tower and a modis pixel were discussed by xin et al 2017 5 conclusions the integration of pts derived from time series of modis images and co2 flux measurements from eddy flux sites at four paddy rice sites has been used to obtain accurate gpp estimations the gppec data from the flux sites exhibit various trends with respect to daily mean air temperature during the pts rather than the single trends generalized from the entire growing season the observed co2 flux data also present diverse tendencies with respect to the evi time seris from modis during the pts in contrast to the single trends inferred from the full growing season for this reason the estimation of driving parameters in lue models according to the land surface phenology is an effective way of improving gpp estimation taking into account the uncertainty of the maximum lue and optimum temperature in vpm these parameters were estimated from the four major pts corresponding to the physiological features of paddy rice this is the first case study to use a phenology based strategy to optimize the maximum lue and optimum temperature in the gpp estimation of paddy rice croplands the results indicate that estimating the maximum lue and optimum temperature in pts is more appropriate in terms of capturing the temporal dynamics and inter annual variations of gpp at paddy rice sites than attempting to improve either the maximum lue or optimum temperature to complement and improve the global flux network further assessment of the phenology based lue model at other paddy rice sites with comparative co2 flux measurements would be of great value in determining universal parameter values across various regions the extrapolation of site scale flux measurements to the regional or national scale should be achievable in the near future using the presented methodology 6 funding this work was supported by the strategic priority research program a of the chinese academy of sciences grant number xda23100201

24649,many freshwater ecosystems throughout the world support a high number of waterbirds nutrient from droppings of these waterbirds may serve as an important source of nutrients to those systems previous works suggest that excess nutrients from waterbirds may lead to eutrophication the excess nutrients also may induce nuisance growth of aquatic weeds in shallow lakes however the aquatic weeds serve as an important food for some avian species the main objective of this work is to study how the waterbirds affect the dynamics of the aquatic ecosystem through a process based modelling approach to understand this a lake with negligible anthropogenic nutrient influx and the high winter avian congregation is taken as study site a process based dynamic ecological model with six state variables has been developed phosphorus p is taken as model currency since it is the limiting nutrient in most shallow and present in high concentration in the dropping of waterbirds before the model calibration sensitivity analysis is performed with the data collected during the first year of study model is validated with the data collected during the second year of study as per the model p from the waterbird guano comprises 98 32 of p input to the lake parameters affecting the water sediment exchange of p are most sensitive p content in zooplankton is the most sensitive state variable nutrient budget analysis reveals that internal cycling of the nutrient is the main pathway to sustain productivity in the system so far no process based modelling has been done on the impact of dropping of waterbird on nutrient dynamics of the aquatic system this kind of model will be helpful to handle problems like eutrophication and macrophyte overgrowth due to eutrophication keywords guanotrophication process based modelling sensitivity analysis macrophyte automatic parameter calibration waterbirds 1 introduction in terms of ecosystem services the freshwater ecosystem is one of the important ecosystems in the world postel and carpenter 1997 eutrophication is one of the major concerns to freshwater lakes which is mostly enhanced by anthropogenic activities bennett et al 2001 jickells 2005 eutrophication a serious global concern causes poor water quality and leads to the crisis of drinking water decreased fish production biodiversity loss and also disease outbreak nutrient in the water body may come from 3 kinds of sources atmospheric rainfall anthropogenic garbage fertilizer wastewater and biogenic dead materials faecal materials excreta etc biogenic source is very important as many freshwater lakes in the world support huge winter avian congregations previous works suggest that high avian congregation in the waterbody may have some undesirable effects on water

metal concentration mathis and kevern 1975 water hardness chatterjee et al 2017 roy et al 2011 disease outbreaks in waterbirds wobeser 1997 etc the term guanotrophication means nutrient enrichment via bird guano leentvaar 1967 the study on guanotrophy begins with the work of copeman and dillman 1937 and since then numerous research articles were published on this topic both on freshwater and marine systems some of the previous research on freshwater ecosystem found that waterbird dropping may degrade water quality chaichana et al 2010 manny et al 1994 post et al 1998 rÃ¶nicke et al 2008 some other researchers found negligible contribution by waterbirds towards nutrient loading gremillion and malone 1986 marion et al 1994 scherer et al 1995 the results of the previous studies are mostly incomparable due to variability of estimation method varied human and environmental pressure a detailed literature review on the impact of guanotrophy on freshwater ecosystem can be found at adhurya et al 2020 despite these problems the waterbirds are an inherent part of the ecosystem and provide numerous ecosystem services green and elmberg 2014 waterbirds also sustain the productivity of nutrient poor ecosystem via guanotrophy michelutti et al 2009 van geest et al 2007 the motivation behind the present work came from the rapid degradation with nuisance growth of macrophyte of two shallow lakes in west bengal india which support high winter avian congregations first one is lake 1 of ballavpur wildlife sanctuary bwls of birbhum district which receives minimal anthropogenic nutrient load while the second one ambuja wetland aw of paschim bardhaman district is facing high anthropogenic influence in terms of nutrient loading adhurya et al 2019 in shallow lakes the consequences of eutrophication may results in nuisance macrophyte growth instead of algal bloom because littoral zone extends up to bottom sediment of the entire lake in this type of ecosystem wetzel 2001 restoration of these lakes requires costly management practices though high anthropogenic load may result in eutrophication in aw reasons behind the macrophyte overgrowth in lake 1 bwls remain unclear keeping in mind the fact of guanotrophy the prime research question came to our mind that if the waterbirds are only responsible for the collapse of these wetlands or not if so meanwhile the understanding of underlying mechanisms behind the impact of guanotrophy on the system dynamics becomes very important the process based model with the help of differential equations is a useful tool to understand the mechanism of different processes and their influence on the system dynamics these kinds of models already proved their usefulness to mitigate problem like eutrophication to develop better management strategies and to obtain an insight about different ecosystem process bÃ©jaoui et al 2017 janssen et al 2019 jÃ¸rgensen 1976 marois and mitsch 2016 ren et al 2010 solidoro and cossarini 2005 wang and mitsch 2000 oliver and legoviÄ 1988 studied the effect of wading bird guano at okefenokee marshland usa with the help of process based model however there is no previous process based model developed so far on guanotrophy incorporating all kinds of waterbirds from the aforesaid contexts the following objectives have been set for this particular study i development of a process based dynamic model of the lake ecosystem to understand relative contribution by waterbird derived nutrient p towards the lake productivity ii determination of the sensitive parameters for different state variables in order to understand the importance of different parameters on system dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and data collection for understanding the effect of waterbirds on a system a study site with negligible anthropogenic nutrient input and high avian congregation has needed for study considering the aforesaid factors accessibility for sampling and proximity of from the research institute second lake also known as lake 2 of bwls has been chosen as the study site to understand the impact of waterbirds on wetland dynamics bwls is located at birbhum district west bengal india was established in 1977 encompassing an area of 2 021 km2 this is well known for ex situ deer conservation and high winter avian congregations there are three lakes in bwls which support a large horde of migratory waterbirds but lake 2 is selected as study site as it supports one of the largest congregations of greylag goose anser anser in southern west bengal being the heaviest waterbird of bwls greylag goose has the potential to contribute most amount of nutrient as faecal matter to the lake on per bird basis ideas about important physicochemical conditions and avian diversity of bwls can be obtained from previously published articles maity et al 2010 sinha et al 2011 lake 2 is located between 23 41 24 5 n 23 41 16 7 n and 87 39 55 9 e 87 40 05 8 e the area of the lake is 2 1 ha with a minimum average depth of 0 72 m in summer and maximum average depth 2 42 m in monsoon as recorded during the study period the lake is connected with binuria canal at the north via a small channel at the north west corner of the lake water enters the lake through this channel during monsoon and also the water is outflowed from the lake to the canal when the height of the lake water table exceeds the height of the binuria canal water table three sampling sites as indicated in the map are located at northern banks due to availability of water throughout the season at this locations and accessibility for sampling these sites were chosen for sampling fig 1 data were collected bimonthly in 2018 and trimonthly in 2019 from the aforesaid sampling points between 20 and 25th of the month for all of the state variables and graphical functions which are considered in the model the data were collected between january 25 2018 and november 22 2019 different physical factors like water temperature sediment temperature inflow rate out flow rate solar irradiance and depth were estimated directly from the field monthly average precipitation data were taken from the sriniketan weather observatory centre located about 2 2 km from the study site day length data was taken from online weather websites water and sediment samples were collected from a depth of 1 m and 0 05 m respectively between 6 am to 10 am concentration of dissolved oxygen do soluble reactive phosphorous srp organic phosphorous op and sediment total phosphorous stp were estimated from the collected samples baird et al 2017 plumb jr 1981 macrophyte density was estimated using quadrat method and macrophyte cover of the lake phosphorus contents in phytoplankton were estimated indirectly from chlorophyll a content of water o connor et al 1973 zooplanktons were sampled using plankton net of 65 Âµm with a collection bottle at the bottom at early morning 5 6 am zooplanktons copepoda cladocera rotifera and ostracoda were counted with sedgwick rafter counting chamber baird et al 2017 birds were identified using a field guide by grimmett et al 2011 waterbirds were counted using the method suggested by ebird between 8 and 9 am bird counting 101 ebird 2020 details of the data collection can be obtained in supplementary material appendix a 2 2 the model description a model is the synthesis of reality which includes essential features of the real system regarding the problem to be solved ecosystem being a highly complex system selection of model complexity remains a big challenge to modellers increasing model complexity may make the model more realistic but after a certain level it adds more uncertainty due to lack of information regarding processes and parameters jÃ¸rgensen and fath 2011 paudel and jawitz 2012 process based models may have less predictive power due to its complexity but are very useful to understand the underlying mechanisms regarding different processes of the system robson 2014 since the primary goal of this work is to find out the underlying mechanism behind the guanotrophy in the lake by waterbirds the process based approach is followed a conceptual model with six state variables was constructed using stella high level visual simulation software fig 2 the model was converted to r file using stellar python application for further execution due to more power and flexibility of the programming language naimi and voinov 2012 r core team 2019 the model was integrated using the fourth order runge kutta method with a time step of 1 day the differential equations were solved in r using desolve package soetaert et al 2010 p was taken as model currency because it is present at relatively high concentration at bird faeces adhurya et al 2020 organic phosphorus in terms of phosphorus p in water p o r g soluble or dissolved reactive phosphorus in water in terms of p p s r p and total phosphorus in sediment active layer in terms of p p s e d were the abiotic state variables considered in this model the macrophytes as p p m a c phytoplankton as p p p h y and zooplankton as p p z o o are considered as the biotic state variables waterbird dropping was considered as a major forcing function data of the state variables collected on january 25 2018 were used as initial values and the aforesaid date was considered as the first day for model simulation table 1 all the equations used in the model are summarized in table 2 parameters and constants used in this model are shown in table

from the system via outflow canal o u d p r s u s p is considered a temperature dependant process eq 2 mandal et al 2015 wang and mitsch 2000 all of the temperature dependences are modelled in this article based on arrhenius equation based formula where temperature adjustment factor k t e e r t 0 t as used in our model bowie et al 1985 here e r t0 and t are activation energy of the reaction universal gas constant reference temperature at which rate was measured and temperature at which rate are desired respectively i n o p is calculated from the concentration of op c i n o p in the inflow water and the inflow rate i n f r eq 3 the non predatory death of phytoplankton p h y d e a t h is considered as a linear function of non predatory phytoplankton death rate n p r p h y d r eq 4 the egestion of zooplankton estimated by deducting assimilated p from total p uptake by zooplankton eq 5 the mortality of zooplankton is considered as a linear function of zooplankton death rate m z eq 5 macrophyte death is considered as a temperature dependant process eq 10 muhammetoÄlu and soyupak 2000 d c o m p is considered as a function of temperature and dissolved oxygen f d o m i n jÃ¸rgensen 1976 mukherjee et al 2013 eq 21 oxygen limitation is modelled according to michaelis menten formula where k d o m i n is the half saturation constant for d o utilisation in decomposition bowie et al 1985 chapelle 1995 mandal et al 2015 eq 22 s e t t is considered as a linear function of settling rate s e t t r eq 23 o u o p is modelled similarly as i n o p eq 24 2 2 2 sediment total phosphorous p s e d p s e d is contributed by adsorption of p s r p to sediment s r p a d s and s e t t p s e d is depleted by uptake of p by macrophyte from sediment s m p u p t the release of p s r p from sediment s r p r e l r s u s p and burial of p s e d s t p b u r to deep sediment eq 25 s r p a d s and s r p r e l are considered as the temperature dependant process huang et al 2011 spears et al 2007 wu et al 2014 zhang and huang 2011 eq 26 32 s t p b u r is assumed as a linear process eq 34 since the volume of the water column is greater than the sediment of a particular area because of its more height p is concentrated in the sediment during water sediment transfer and vice versa to denote this effect water to sediment concentration coefficient w t s c c is multiplied with all water sediment exchange processes eq 25 33 2 2 3 soluble reactive phosphorous p s r p d c o m p inflow via canal and precipitation i n s r p and s r p r e l are contributed to p s r p while it is depleted by outflow via canal o u s r p uptake of p s r p by autotrophs w m p u p t p p u p t and adsorption s r p a d s to sediment eq 35 the inflow of p s r p via canal s r p i f l and o u s r p via

the lake a eq 38 2 2 4 macrophytes as p p m a c as per eq 46 p m a c is increased with the uptake of p from sediment s m p u p t and water column w m p u p t while p m a c is decreased by grazing by waterbirds w b g r z and m d e a t h in this model s m p u p t eq 27 and w m p u p t eq 40 process are considered to be limited by temperature muhammetoÄlu and soyupak 2000 oliver and legoviÄ 1988 nutrient muhammetoÄlu and soyupak 2000 oliver and legoviÄ 1988 plus et al 2003 and density of macrophytes oliver and legoviÄ 1988 the nutrient limitation function for sediment uptake f p s m a c is modelled as michaelis menten function of bioavailable p in sediment a s t p and half saturation constant of p uptake by macrophyte from sediment k p m p r t eq 28 a s t p is considered a temperature dependant function of e x t r p because both desorption and decomposition are enhanced by temperature macrophyte density dependence s l m is modelled following the method of oliver and legoviÄ 1988 eq 30 31 nutrient limitation for the uptake of p from water column is modelled similarly as sediment eq 41 e h w b mainly feeds outside of the lake during the night and they use the lake chiefly as a roosting site hahn et al 2008 post et al 1998 as per our field observations these kinds of waterbirds also feed on wetland vegetation occasionally during their roosting period in this study it is assumed that e h w b and i h w b fulfil 25 and 100 of their diet from the lake vegetation respectively w b g r z is modelled following holling type ii functional response grazing rate on macrophyte h w b g r a z r and half saturation constant of macrophyte uptake k b by waterbirds have been estimated by considering the value measured for eurasian coot fulica atra as standard van altena et al 2016 for this reason the number of all herbivorous waterbirds are converted to an equivalent number of eurasian coot eq 47 2 2 5 phytoplankton as p p p h y p p h y is increased with the uptake of p from

nutrient limitation is modelled similarly as m p using michaelis menten kinetics where k s r p is the half saturation constant for p uptake by p p h y light limitation f i is incorporated in the model using steele 1962 function which depends on irradiance effect i and optimum surface solar irradiation for photosynthesis i o p t eq 43 i in turn depends on surface solar irradiance i r the extinction coefficient of water e c the self shading effect of phytoplankton e x t and d e p t h eq 44 eq 45 is estimated using the equation of radtke and straÅ¡kraba 1980 2 2 6 zooplankton as p p z o o p z o o growth is dependant on z p g r eq 6 z p d f eq 7 and self predation z p s p eq 8 amount of ingested p that is assimilated in p z o o depends on diet specific assimilation efficiency for phytoplankton a e p z detritus a e d z and zooplankton a e z z p z o o is decreased by z p l o s s and predatory mortality p r e d growth of zooplankton is estimated following the equations of stickney et al 2000 p uptake by zooplankton from different state variables depends on their preference on the different diet s p z for phytoplankton s d z for detritus and s z z for zooplankton p uptake by p z o o is considered as temperature chapelle et al 2000 and nutrient limited process chapelle et al 2000 stickney 2000 eq 9 in p r e d a macrophyte dependant refuge factor r e f is incorporated due to presence of high pearson s correlation between observed data of p m a c and p z o o p 0 1 and previous literature documentation wetzel 2001 eq 50 after the model construction the model is checked and verified for unit consistency in stella 2 3 estimation of waterbird derived nutrient estimation of bird derived p is a difficult job but it is important from the management perspective manny et al 1994 the main constrain in the study on guanotrophy is to quantify the amount of nutrient entering the lake via the faecal matter of waterbirds one of the most popular approaches followed by many articles is the estimation of bird derived nutrient from the allometric relationship with bird faeces production andersen et al 2003 comber et al 2018 gremillion and malone 1986 harris et al 1981 mallin et al 2016 manny et al 1994 marion et al 1994 olson et al 2005 portnoy 1990 scherer et al 1995 approaches with allometric relationship and bioenergetics help to get a more precise estimation hahn et al 2008 2007 post et al 1998 a detailed review of different approaches to estimate the nutrient loading by waterbirds is described by adhurya et al 2020 in this present study bioenergetics approach is used for the avian derived nutrient loading estimation hahn et al 2008 2007 the daily dropping production as dry mass of different avian species follows an allometric relationship adhurya et al 2020 hahn et al 2008 2007 for nutrient loading estimation of herbivorous waterbirds first the numbers of all individuals of different species are converted into the equivalent numbers of greylag goose a anser as per their body mass similarly for carnivorous waterbirds the numbers of all cormorants microcarbo niger darters anhinga melanogaster and grebes tachybaptus ruficollis are translated into the equivalent number of great cormorants phalacrocorax carbo due to their similar feeding habits alternatively the numbers of all herons bubulcus ibis ardeola grayii ardea purpurea ardea cinerea egretta garzetta ardea intermedia ardea alba storks anastomus oscitans ciconia episcopus ibises threskiornis melanocephalus and waterhens amaurornis phoenicurus are converted into the equivalent number of grey herons ardeola grayii body masses of different waterbird species for the conversion were taken from dunning 2008 since the p in the dropping of greylag goose great cormorant and grey heron were well documented the above conversion is made for the sake of calculation of nutrient loading from all birds some birds like waterhens grebes jacanas etc spend all the time in the lake for the herbivorous bird this kind of birds are considered in this model as i h w b while some for herbivorous bird this kind of birds are considered in this model as e h w b stay only in the day time f d l and some e g cormorants spend a specific portion of the day in the lake f d c o r to get the effective bird days manny et al 1994 f d l and f d c o r are multiplied with the number of appropriate waterbird groups eq 14 15 19 daily p loading by a single great cormorant g c n l p d and grey heron g h n l p d is estimated with the excretion model for the non breeding carnivorous bird of hahn et al 2007 eq 16 17 while daily p loading by a single greylag goose was estimated using dropping model of hahn et al 2008 eq 20 the nutrient loading by herbivorous h w b n l eq 18 and carnivorous c w b n l eq 13 waterbirds is obtained by multiplying the respective effective bird days with the daily nutrient loading of appropriate bird group total nutrient loading by waterbirds w b n l is the addition of c w b n l and h w b n l eq 12 2 4 sensitivity analysis it could never be feasible in a modelling study to directly estimate all needed parameters for an ecological problem which considers many processes and interactions in such cases values of those parameters are often taken from published works from similar systems therefore the difficulty is to understand which published value for a parameter should be used for better prediction so in practice a range of parameter values were chosen from published works and calibrated to obtain the best value for the parameter to get best prediction a sensitivity analysis before calibration is an important task for a modeller to handle an ecological model with a large number of parameters in the univariate local sensitivity analysis each parameter is varied to a certain extent accordingly changes in each state variable in response to slight changes in the parameter are measured in the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity functions are calculated and then summarized to understand the overall importance of different parameters sensitivity functions sij are calculated for each time steps with the following formula for the parameter pi and state variable xj jÃ¸rgensen and fath 2011 s i j x j x j p i p i sij is calculated separately for 10 and 10 variation of each parameter for each state variable then sij is summarized by taking the mean Î´mean and also by taking root mean square value of it Î´msqr over each time steps brun et al 2001 Î´ i j m e a n 1 n t 1 n s i j Î´ i j m s q r 1 n t 1 n s i j 2 where n is the number of time steps Î´ i j m s q r is useful to understand the overall importance of a parameter while Î´ i j m e a n gives information about the sign of averaged sensitivity brun et al 2001 Î´ for 10 and 10 is calculated separately and then averaged to yield the Î´ for 10 changes of parameters sensitivity analyses are performed in r following the codes given in soetaert and herman 2009 after slight modification the sensitivity of each parameter to the system s dynamics is measured by taking an average of Î´ i j m e a n for all j parameters Î´ i j m s q r is not used because in the system a parameter usually imposes a positive effect on some state variables and negative on others so the net effect can be understood only by taking either sum or average similar to parameters the sensitivity of state variable xj for 10 changes of all m number of parameters is calculated as below wang and mitsch 2000 Î´ x j 1 m i 1 m Î´ m e a n higher value of Î´ x j for a state variable indicates that it is more prone to change for the changes of all parameters 2 5 calibration and validation sensitive parameters are calibrated first for each state variables and then for the system through automatic parameter calibration procedure in r using the algorithm of price 1977 with ecolmod package soetaert and herman 2009 price algorithm finds the best fit between observed and simulated data by minimizing the model cost for a set of parameters values between a given ranges the model cost is calculated in this study as follows c o s t n i 1 t x n s i m x n o b s 2 x n o b s 2 where c o s t n is the model cost for the model calibration of the nth state variable x n s i m is the simulated value for nth state variable for a particular time step and x n o b s is the corresponding observed value of nth state variable for the same time step model cost calculation for the simultaneous calibration of more than one state variables is done with the following method c o s t m 1 n c o s t 1 c o s t 2 c o s t 3 c o s t n where c o s t m is model cost n is the number of state variables chosen to calibrate simultaneously after calibration the model is validated with the independent data collected during the second year additionally the relative error is also estimated as the second measure of model fitness marois and mitsch 2016 2 6 phosphorus budget analysis one of the important goals of ecological modelling is the quantitative representation of the whole ecosystem with the simulation results the annual phosphorus budget of the whole lake is estimated using the 669 days simulated data following the method of wang and mitsch 2000 and bÃ©jaoui et al 2017 values of the state variables are the annual averaged value of each state variable expressed in g m 3 inflows outflows and flows between state variables are calculated based on model results and expressed in g m 2 y 1 2 7 scenario analysis model is an essential tool to understand the probable impact on ecosystem in changing scenarios to fulfil the first objective the model is perturbed to 4 different scenarios to understand the changing probable dynamics of different state variables in response to changing bird number i if there are no waterbird in the ecosystem 0 ii if the number of waterbirds reduced to half of the studied scenario 50 iii if the number of waterbirds get increased to double of the studied scenario 200 iv if the number of waterbirds get increased to quadruple of the studied scenario 400 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation as seen in fig 3 mostly the model simulation matches the observed data reasonably well for p o r g the model can predict quite accurately the increase of organic matter in water in summer and monsoon though the model shows a similar trend as the observed data in winter it is slightly overestimated the p o r g value for p s e d the simulated curve shows a similar trend with the observed trend and it exists between the upper and lower limits of observed data however the model is unable to predict the low value of p s e d during monsoon and summer for p s r p the simulated curve resembles the observed pattern though it is mostly overestimated the p s r p especially in winter for p m a c the observed and simulated data are fitted most accurately throughout the season which is reflected by the lowest cost and re for it the lowest recorded value of macrophyte in november 2019 is 0 16 g m 3 due to periodic clearance of macrophyte by concerned authorities for this reason it is excluded in table 5 for p p h y and p z o o though all simulated data lie between the ranges of observed data the model is unable to obtain the observed picture for these two for zp the model cost and re are highest observed maximum and minimum predicted maximum and minimum model cost and re for all state variables are summarised in table 5 3 2 phosphorous budget the calculated phosphorus budget for the lake is presented in fig 4 waterbirds have contributed about 3 684 gp m 2 y 1 via excrement and uptaken 0 427 gp m 2 y 1 via grazing on macrophyte amongst waterbirds carnivorous and herbivorous waterbirds have contributed around 0 292 gp m 2 y 1 and 3 393 gp m 2 y 1 respectively the major flux to p o r g is resuspension from sediment 207 66 gp m 2 y 1 which is a prime autochthonous source while bird derived p is a prime allochthonous source to the same amongst the biogenic input from the state variables via death and loss m d e a t h is the prime flow to the p o r g 0 144 gp m 2 y 1 the main outflow from p o r g is s e t t 209 016 gp m 2 y 1 98 83 of the total input to p o r g is settled down to sediment and 1 14 remineralised to p s r p amongst the all other inflows to p s r p s r p r e l is contributed 97 5 amongst all outflows from p s r p 99 79 goes to sediment via adsorption considering settling resuspension of p o r g adsorption release of p s e d and uptake of p by p m a c net 3 620 gp m 2 is accumulated to sediment each year from the water column annually 6 088 gp m 2 is buried to deep sediment from the active sediment macrophyte uptake is around 60 91 of p from sediment macrophyte is mainly decreased through grazing by waterbirds p p h y is decreased mainly by mortality p z o o mainly depends upon detritus for its growth in summary the total input of p to the lake is 3 747 gp m 2 y 1 most of the organic matter like bird guano dead phytoplankton and dead macrophyte is particulate matter and settled quickly in sediment in other ways phosphorus pool in water is mainly replenished by internal loading via resuspension sediment decomposition and desorption macrophyte consumes about 0 481 gp m 2 y 1 which is 12 84 of the total input total output from the lake is 0 504 gp m 2 y 1 of which waterbirds accounts for 84 79 outflow of p a state variable and compartment wise summary is presented in table 6 3 3 scenario analysis result of scenario analysis shows that p m a c shows negative trends with the avian density while others state variables show positive trends abiotic state variables are more prone to change in response to changing waterbird number while biotic variables very less prone to change p o r g and p z o o are most prone to changes amongst the abiotic and biotic state variables respectively the results of the scenario analysis are summarized in table 7 3 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is an important step for choosing the parameter for calibration results of Î´ i j m e a n and Î´ i j m s q r are given in table 8 in the table values of sensitivity summarizing function exceeding 0 1 are marked as bold amongst the rate parameters for p o r g the most sensitive parameter is s e t t r followed by r e s u s p r though former is negatively sensitive amongst the non rate parameters k t r is the most sensitive parameters for p o r g for p s e d most negative sensitive rate parameter is b u r r other positive sensitive rate parameters for p s e d are d r m g l g and d r r g l g amongst the non rate parameters the most positively and negatively sensitive parameters are k t s a and k t r respectively for p s r p most positively and negatively sensitive rate parameter are s r t and s a r amongst the non rate parameters the most sensitive parameter is k t s a negatively sensitive followed by k t s r the net impact of k t r on p s r p is low but p s r p is shifted 2 and 10 at opposite direction for 10 increase and decrease of this parameter respectively no rate parameters are found too sensitive to p m a c Î´ i j m s q r 0 1 p c m p and k t m p are found to be most positively and negatively sensitive non rate parameter most negative and positive sensitive rate parameters for p p h y are n p r p h y d r and m a x g r p p respectively k t p is most sensitive parameter amongst all non rate parameters p r e d r is the most sensitive rate parameter to p z o o amongst the non rate parameters k t z is the most sensitive parameter for the overall system r e s u s p r and s e t t r are the most sensitive rate parameters other important rate parameters for the system are b u r r s a r and s r t for non rate parameters k t r and k t s a are the most sensitive parameters k t m p k t p k t s r k t z and p c m p are other important non rate parameters for the system for 10 change of all parameters p z o o is the most sensitive state variable Î´ x j 0 135 followed by p o r g Î´ x j 0 13 table 1 4 discussions 4 1 impact of waterfowls the community of waterbirds is mainly dominated by herbivorous birds it feeds in the waterbody mainly on macrophyte as indicated by the p budget model the waterbirds remove a high amount of p from the system by grazing on aquatic vegetations due to high gut passage rate of birds most of the p removed by grazing returns to the system by defecation hahn et al 2008 post et al 1998 for this reason increased bird density has negative impact on macrophyte according to scenario analysis most of the waterbirds mainly feed externally at another ecosystem and use the lake mainly as roosting site this can be a possible reason behind minimal impact on macrophyte in spite of increased waterbird density in scenario analysis again waterbirds are one of the important sources of allochthonous nutrient to this ecosystem for this reason changes in the number of waterbirds has a noticeable positive impact on the dynamics of other abiotic state variables the positive effect on abiotic variables can also be a result of some impact of waterbirds on the internal cycling via bioturbation and conversion of nutrient from one form to another mitchell and perrow 1998 a major portions of the waterbird derived guano are recalcitrant which are composed of undigested food materials and uric acid brandvold et al 1976 for bird guano the decomposition of the recalcitrant portion is a slow process started after 15 30 days liu et al 2014a the main input to p o r g is bird s guano and dead macrophyte both of these are particulate matters and readily settled down to sediments unckless and makarewicz 2007 high sensitivity to p o r g and high calibrated value of settling rate indicate importance of this process the high value of p s e d in winter may be due to the accumulation of highly insoluble bird guano in sediment the higher sensitivity of d r m g l g d r r g l g and p e x c r g l g to p s e d supports this fact though a high increase of inorganic nutrient observed in the ecosystem for the increase of bird number this does not to affect the density of autotrophs too much as per sensitivity analysis it may be due to density of macrophyte limited by area of the lake and half saturation constant for nutrient uptake a similar concept can also be applied to phytoplankton half saturation constant self shading effect and zooplankton grazing might limit their population although leaching of nutrient from the labile portion of the bird guano in winter might be a possible explanation behind observed winter spike of p p h y liu et al 2014b the hypothetical density of zooplankton only shows highest increase in scenario analysis amongst biotic state variables and this may be due to increase of its nutrient via both detritivory and herbivory krylov et al 2014 found that zooplankton community shifted to copepoda dominated state in the influence of bird guano our study also found a similar result of copepoda dominance during high bird density 4 2 impact of internal cycling it is evident in the nutrient budget analysis fig 4 that the dynamics of this ecosystem are mainly regulated by settling resuspension and adsorption release kinetics the p s r p in water is mainly regulated with internal loading from sediment however decomposition is also found to play a major role in p s r p dynamics as compared with the internal loading this ecosystem receives a negligible amount of nutrient from the outside this emphasizes the importance of internal cycling in an apparently closed shallow lake ecosystem the sediment water balance of p depends on several key factors physical settling resuspension chemical ph temperature nitrate dissolved oxygen and redox potential and biological bioturbation mineralisation microbial and macrophyte uptake boers et al 1998 jensen and andersen 1992 sondergaard et al 2001 the internal loading of p s r p is mainly driven by desorption of p in sediment and subsequent diffusion of it to the water column the sorption of p is a complex process and driven by several factors like ph redox potential mineral content iron aluminium and calcium organic matter p loading and ambient p concentration in soil reddy and delaune 2008 in acidic condition iron and aluminium play important roles in p adsorption while in basic condition calcium adsorbs p measured ph of our study site of both water and sediment ranges between 5 and 7 which is mildly acidic however ph of the water is prone to change with the photosynthetic activity of the autotrophs diurnally temperature functions such as k t s a and k t s r are also sensitive parameters to p p h y these functions control nutrient bioavailability in the water column and indicate dependence of water column productivity on internal loading like this lake internal loading of phosphorous also founds to play an important role in dynamics of some other shallow lake ecosystems like long lake of washington jacoby et al 1982 loch leven of scotland spears et al 2007 and constructed wetlands of illinois wang and mitsch 2000 temperature founds to play a crucial role in sediment water dynamics in our model the observed trend of p o r g and p s r p follows a similar trend with t s and t w while p s e d founds to be inversely related to the temperature again s r t s a r r s u s p and associated temperature functions are highly sensitive parameters this indicates the previously established fact that temperature enhances the resuspension and inorganic p release huang et al 2011 spears et al 2007 from sediment apart from resuspension settling also founds to play an important role in sediment water dynamics as per the sensitivity analysis accumulation of p o r g inflowed to the lake during monsoon and bird guano in winter to p s e d might be a reason behind increased sediment p during winter after all net influx of p to sediment and burial of a large amount of p to deep sediment suggest that the sediment acts as phosphorus sink of the system higher sensitivity of b u r r justifies the importance of this process 4 3 impact of macrophytes in shallow lakes macro vegetation generally dominates as the producer of organic matters assimilation of p is much higher in this life form than phytoplankton wetzel 2001 in the nutrient budget analysis it is evident that macrophyte uptakes a considerable amount of p from both sediment and water column though the uptake rate from the sediment is much higher christiansen et al 2016 wang and mitsch 2000 the high sensitivity of k t m p to macrophyte indicates that macrophytes uptake a higher amount of p from the system during summer high temperature promotes the decomposition of organic materials in sediment the desorption and diffusion of orthophosphate are also increased at high temperature huang et al 2011 reddy and delaune 2008 this ultimately increases the bioavailable p in sediment pore water and might be another probable reason for low summer p s e d macrophyte can uptake a very high amount of p from water and helps to maintain a clear water state by preventing algal bloom mitsch and gosselink 2007 srivastava et al 2008 the nutrient budget analysis supports this fact and low nutrient in water due to macrophyte consumption limits phytoplankton growth by exerting bottom up control moss et al 2013 stephen and brian 1998 a similar ecosystem east calcutta wetland india with less macrophyte cover shows high inorganic phosphate concentration 4 10 g m 3 in the water column and higher phytoplankton mandal et al 2015 while in our system s r p concentration always remains below 1 g m 3 which validates the above fact macrophyte can also limit the growth of phytoplankton by reducing light availability to water column due to their high surface area macrophyte provides refuge to zooplankton from fish predation which reduces the phytoplankton by top down control schriver et al 1995 timms and moss 1984 in addition phytoplankton growth is also restricted by allelopathy with the release of some organic chemicals by macrophyte hilt and gross 2008 rojo et al 2013 in macrophyte dominated shallow lakes zooplankton dynamics are not like the large lakes with greater depth macrophyte provides refuge to zooplankton from the fish predation schriver et al 1995 timms and moss 1984 dense macrophyte vegetation inhibits light penetration and promotes anoxia to bottom water this restricts small fishes in the depth where zooplankton take refuge wetzel 2001 high sensitivity of r e f in this study highlights the importance of refuge in this kind of system available literature suggests that with the increasing density of macrophyte numbers of cladocera increase in the water lauridsen et al 1996 schriver et al 1995 while in the low density of macrophyte copepods dominate the zooplankton community schriver et al 1995 our observed data are in accordance with the previous study 4 4 system dynamics the analysis of system dynamics is important to understand the emergent properties of the system due to the change of the parameters affecting its dynamics for sensitivity analysis of all state variables in the system it has been noticed that p z o o and p o r g are more prone to change with 10 changes in all parameters for the system sensitivity analysis of all parameters a similar picture is also observed parameters affecting settling resuspension sediment burial macrophyte p uptake and zooplankton grazing are more sensitive to the system it is noticeable that changes of parameters which ultimately lead to changes in the p o r g are mostly positively sensitive to the system consequently the increased values of these parameters enhance p o r g and finally p z o o this emphasizes the importance of detritivory in the system parameters which increase p s r p in the water column are positively sensitive to system and vice versa the increased amount of p s r p promotes the growth of p m a c and p p h y p m a c and p p h y are important for p z o o which provides shelter and food respectively the high overall sensitivity of parameters affects burial settling resuspension dynamics and sorption release dynamics pointing out the importance of internal cycling to sustain productivity in an apparently closed system and p retention by the wetland as already discussed in section 4 6 in response to different states of the system the community shift of zooplankton can be observed this might be the possible reason behind its higher sensitivity to the system 4 5 model unpredictability limitations and future scopes the complexity of the model increases the number of parameters to be calibrated which ultimately increase the model cost due to increased complexity our model unable to predict some observed scenario in winter the model is unable to predict the lower value of p this discrepancy between observed and simulated value may be due to sampling error because sampling station is retarded in monsoon towards periphery due to higher water volume and forwarded towards the centre during the dry season due to the presence of large trees at the bank the soil of the periphery may be rich in organic content for litterfall from these trees this may produce higher sediment and water nutrient content to predict this high value the model may neglect the low value of p in winter wind rainfall and aquatic animal induced resuspension may play a major role in sediment water p transfer gargallo et al 2017 like these two processes many other processes like bioturbation macrophyte inhibition of phytoplankton growth fish grazing the inflow of nutrient via litterfall nutrient uptake of macrophyte from deep sediments light limitation to phytoplankton by macrophyte turbidity fish grazing on phytoplankton etc are neglected due to paucity of data and make the model simple these factors may be affected the prediction of p s e d p p h y and p z o o again complex community structure and inclusion of detritivory self predation and refuge make the zooplankton equation more complex nowadays including the fish is a very essential practice in ecological modelling since fishing is strictly prohibited in bwls it was not possible to incorporate in this model besides the export of nutrient from the system by carnivorous waterbirds is also neglected in our model because of its low number and unavailability of fish data in our model most of the parameters are taken from literature and then calibrated if it is found to be sensitive values of these parameters are taken mostly from the temperate and polar system due to lack of data from the tropical region the model might be more realistic if it is possible to incorporate these parameters as graph time functions after measurement modelling is an iterative practice feedback from one model will help to develop its improved version increase the frequency of data collection over more than a year and their use in the model will help to understand the system dynamic better again the model is a tool to study the system properties in this study scenario analysis is only performed by changing the number of waterbirds in future it is also important to observe the model behaviour in other changing physico chemical and biological scenarios the scenario analysis is unable to find noticeable variation in macrophyte density due to changing number of waterbirds it is important to note that the density of macrophyte is already higher in this ecosystem so it is also important to observe the model behaviour with low initial macrophyte density possible remedies to control nuisance macrophyte growth due to eutrophication can also be understood by introducing biocontroller or chemical agent in the model 5 conclusion the model shows that waterbird derived nutrient is the most important source to the lake ecosystem and comprised about 98 32 of the total allochthonous p input this indicates the importance of waterbird as the nutrient source in the close ecosystem like our studied system in addition to an important nutrient importer to the system the water bird is also a major nutrient exporter of the system waterbirds export around 6 44 of nutrient from the system while the burial of the p to the deep sediment is the top exporter this emphasizes the importance of the wetland ecosystem as a p sink the model also shows the importance of internal cycling of this kind of shallow lakes which receives a minimum allochthonous nutrient load the higher sensitivity of most of the temperature coefficients indicates the temperature dependency of most of the processes this indicates that temperature variation due to global climate change may considerably change the dynamics of the system scenario analysis concludes that waterbirds regulate to some extent the dynamics of abiotic state variables but it has very less impact on productivity moreover this is the first process based model to study the influence of guanotrophy in shallow lakes similar models can be developed for other similar ecosystems which not only will give a better understanding of the ecosystem but also will play an important role in managing the habitats of waterbirds declaration of

24649,many freshwater ecosystems throughout the world support a high number of waterbirds nutrient from droppings of these waterbirds may serve as an important source of nutrients to those systems previous works suggest that excess nutrients from waterbirds may lead to eutrophication the excess nutrients also may induce nuisance growth of aquatic weeds in shallow lakes however the aquatic weeds serve as an important food for some avian species the main objective of this work is to study how the waterbirds affect the dynamics of the aquatic ecosystem through a process based modelling approach to understand this a lake with negligible anthropogenic nutrient influx and the high winter avian congregation is taken as study site a process based dynamic ecological model with six state variables has been developed phosphorus p is taken as model currency since it is the limiting nutrient in most shallow and present in high concentration in the dropping of waterbirds before the model calibration sensitivity analysis is performed with the data collected during the first year of study model is validated with the data collected during the second year of study as per the model p from the waterbird guano comprises 98 32 of p input to the lake parameters affecting the water sediment exchange of p are most sensitive p content in zooplankton is the most sensitive state variable nutrient budget analysis reveals that internal cycling of the nutrient is the main pathway to sustain productivity in the system so far no process based modelling has been done on the impact of dropping of waterbird on nutrient dynamics of the aquatic system this kind of model will be helpful to handle problems like eutrophication and macrophyte overgrowth due to eutrophication keywords guanotrophication process based modelling sensitivity analysis macrophyte automatic parameter calibration waterbirds 1 introduction in terms of ecosystem services the freshwater ecosystem is one of the important ecosystems in the world postel and carpenter 1997 eutrophication is one of the major concerns to freshwater lakes which is mostly enhanced by anthropogenic activities bennett et al 2001 jickells 2005 eutrophication a serious global concern causes poor water quality and leads to the crisis of drinking water decreased fish production biodiversity loss and also disease outbreak nutrient in the water body may come from 3 kinds of sources atmospheric rainfall anthropogenic garbage fertilizer wastewater and biogenic dead materials faecal materials excreta etc biogenic source is very important as many freshwater lakes in the world support huge winter avian congregations previous works suggest that high avian congregation in the waterbody may have some undesirable effects on water quality like eutrophication hahn et al 2008 manny et al 1994 destruction of wetland vegetation kerbes et al 1990 increase of coliform bacteria alderisio and deluca 1999 gould and fletcher 1978 heavy metal concentration mathis and kevern 1975 water hardness chatterjee et al 2017 roy et al 2011 disease outbreaks in waterbirds wobeser 1997 etc the term guanotrophication means nutrient enrichment via bird guano leentvaar 1967 the study on guanotrophy begins with the work of copeman and dillman 1937 and since then numerous research articles were published on this topic both on freshwater and marine systems some of the previous research on freshwater ecosystem found that waterbird dropping may degrade water quality chaichana et al 2010 manny et al 1994 post et al 1998 rÃ¶nicke et al 2008 some other researchers found negligible contribution by waterbirds towards nutrient loading gremillion and malone 1986 marion et al 1994 scherer et al 1995 the results of the previous studies are mostly incomparable due to variability of estimation method varied human and environmental pressure a detailed literature review on the impact of guanotrophy on freshwater ecosystem can be found at adhurya et al 2020 despite these problems the waterbirds are an inherent part of the ecosystem and provide numerous ecosystem services green and elmberg 2014 waterbirds also sustain the productivity of nutrient poor ecosystem via guanotrophy michelutti et al 2009 van geest et al 2007 the motivation behind the present work came from the rapid degradation with nuisance growth of macrophyte of two shallow lakes in west bengal india which support high winter avian congregations first one is lake 1 of ballavpur wildlife sanctuary bwls of birbhum district which receives minimal anthropogenic nutrient load while the second one ambuja wetland aw of paschim bardhaman district is facing high anthropogenic influence in terms of nutrient loading adhurya et al 2019 in shallow lakes the consequences of eutrophication may results in nuisance macrophyte growth instead of algal bloom because littoral zone extends up to bottom sediment of the entire lake in this type of ecosystem wetzel 2001 restoration of these lakes requires costly management practices though high anthropogenic load may result in eutrophication in aw reasons behind the macrophyte overgrowth in lake 1 bwls remain unclear keeping in mind the fact of guanotrophy the prime research question came to our mind that if the waterbirds are only responsible for the collapse of these wetlands or not if so meanwhile the understanding of underlying mechanisms behind the impact of guanotrophy on the system dynamics becomes very important the process based model with the help of differential equations is a useful tool to understand the mechanism of different processes and their influence on the system dynamics these kinds of models already proved their usefulness to mitigate problem like eutrophication to develop better management strategies and to obtain an insight about different ecosystem process bÃ©jaoui et al 2017 janssen et al 2019 jÃ¸rgensen 1976 marois and mitsch 2016 ren et al 2010 solidoro and cossarini 2005 wang and mitsch 2000 oliver and legoviÄ 1988 studied the effect of wading bird guano at okefenokee marshland usa with the help of process based model however there is no previous process based model developed so far on guanotrophy incorporating all kinds of waterbirds from the aforesaid contexts the following objectives have been set for this particular study i development of a process based dynamic model of the lake ecosystem to understand relative contribution by waterbird derived nutrient p towards the lake productivity ii determination of the sensitive parameters for different state variables in order to understand the importance of different parameters on system dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and data collection for understanding the effect of waterbirds on a system a study site with negligible anthropogenic nutrient input and high avian congregation has needed for study considering the aforesaid factors accessibility for sampling and proximity of from the research institute second lake also known as lake 2 of bwls has been chosen as the study site to understand the impact of waterbirds on wetland dynamics bwls is located at birbhum district west bengal india was established in 1977 encompassing an area of 2 021 km2 this is well known for ex situ deer conservation and high winter avian congregations there are three lakes in bwls which support a large horde of migratory waterbirds but lake 2 is selected as study site as it supports one of the largest congregations of greylag goose anser anser in southern west bengal being the heaviest waterbird of bwls greylag goose has the potential to contribute most amount of nutrient as faecal matter to the lake on per bird basis ideas about important physicochemical conditions and avian diversity of bwls can be obtained from previously published articles maity et al 2010 sinha et al 2011 lake 2 is located between 23 41 24 5 n 23 41 16 7 n and 87 39 55 9 e 87 40 05 8 e the area of the lake is 2 1 ha with a minimum average depth of 0 72 m in summer and maximum average depth 2 42 m in monsoon as recorded during the study period the lake is connected with binuria canal at the north via a small channel at the north west corner of the lake water enters the lake through this channel during monsoon and also the water is outflowed from the lake to the canal when the height of the lake water table exceeds the height of the binuria canal water table three sampling sites as indicated in the map are located at northern banks due to availability of water throughout the season at this locations and accessibility for sampling these sites were chosen for sampling fig 1 data were collected bimonthly in 2018 and trimonthly in 2019 from the aforesaid sampling points between 20 and 25th of the month for all of the state variables and graphical functions which are considered in the model the data were collected between january 25 2018 and november 22 2019 different physical factors like water temperature sediment temperature inflow rate out flow rate solar irradiance and depth were estimated directly from the field monthly average precipitation data were taken from the sriniketan weather observatory centre located about 2 2 km from the study site day length data was taken from online weather websites water and sediment samples were collected from a depth of 1 m and 0 05 m respectively between 6 am to 10 am concentration of dissolved oxygen do soluble reactive phosphorous srp organic phosphorous op and sediment total phosphorous stp were estimated from the collected samples baird et al 2017 plumb jr 1981 macrophyte density was estimated using quadrat method and macrophyte cover of the lake phosphorus contents in phytoplankton were estimated indirectly from chlorophyll a content of water o connor et al 1973 zooplanktons were sampled using plankton net of 65 Âµm with a collection bottle at the bottom at early morning 5 6 am zooplanktons copepoda cladocera rotifera and ostracoda were counted with sedgwick rafter counting chamber baird et al 2017 birds were identified using a field guide by grimmett et al 2011 waterbirds were counted using the method suggested by ebird between 8 and 9 am bird counting 101 ebird 2020 details of the data collection can be obtained in supplementary material appendix a 2 2 the model description a model is the synthesis of reality which includes essential features of the real system regarding the problem to be solved ecosystem being a highly complex system selection of model complexity remains a big challenge to modellers increasing model complexity may make the model more realistic but after a certain level it adds more uncertainty due to lack of information regarding processes and parameters jÃ¸rgensen and fath 2011 paudel and jawitz 2012 process based models may have less predictive power due to its complexity but are very useful to understand the underlying mechanisms regarding different processes of the system robson 2014 since the primary goal of this work is to find out the underlying mechanism behind the guanotrophy in the lake by waterbirds the process based approach is followed a conceptual model with six state variables was constructed using stella high level visual simulation software fig 2 the model was converted to r file using stellar python application for further execution due to more power and flexibility of the programming language naimi and voinov 2012 r core team 2019 the model was integrated using the fourth order runge kutta method with a time step of 1 day the differential equations were solved in r using desolve package soetaert et al 2010 p was taken as model currency because it is present at relatively high concentration at bird faeces adhurya et al 2020 organic phosphorus in terms of phosphorus p in water p o r g soluble or dissolved reactive phosphorus in water in terms of p p s r p and total phosphorus in sediment active layer in terms of p p s e d were the abiotic state variables considered in this model the macrophytes as p p m a c phytoplankton as p p p h y and zooplankton as p p z o o are considered as the biotic state variables waterbird dropping was considered as a major forcing function data of the state variables collected on january 25 2018 were used as initial values and the aforesaid date was considered as the first day for model simulation table 1 all the equations used in the model are summarized in table 2 parameters and constants used in this model are shown in table 3 graphical functions are presented in table 4 the processes considered in the model are described below in order of different state variables 2 2 1 organic phosphorous in water p o r g as formulated in eq 1 p o r g is contributed by resuspension from p s e d r s u s p the influx from inflow canal mainly during the rainy season i n o p and the influx of dead organic materials from the biotic state

from the system via outflow canal o u d p r s u s p is considered a temperature dependant process eq 2 mandal et al 2015 wang and mitsch 2000 all of the temperature dependences are modelled in this article based on arrhenius equation based formula where temperature adjustment factor k t e e r t 0 t as used in our model bowie et al 1985 here e r t0 and t are activation energy of the reaction universal gas constant reference temperature at which rate was measured and temperature at which rate are desired respectively i n o p is calculated from the concentration of op c i n o p in the inflow water and the inflow rate i n f r eq 3 the non predatory death of phytoplankton p h y d e a t h is considered as a linear function of non predatory phytoplankton death rate n p r p h y d r eq 4 the egestion of zooplankton estimated by deducting assimilated p from total p uptake by zooplankton eq 5 the mortality of zooplankton is considered as a linear function of zooplankton death rate m z

bowie et al 1985 chapelle 1995 mandal et al 2015 eq 22 s e t t is considered as a linear function of settling rate s e t t r eq 23 o u o p is modelled similarly as i n o p eq 24 2 2 2 sediment total phosphorous p s e d p s e d is contributed by adsorption of p s r p to sediment s r p a d s and s e t t p s e d is depleted by uptake of p by macrophyte from sediment s m p u p t the release of p s r

et al 2007 wu et al 2014 zhang and huang 2011 eq 26 32 s t p b u r is assumed as a linear process eq 34 since the volume of the water column is greater than the sediment of a particular area because of its more height p is concentrated in the sediment during water sediment transfer and vice versa to denote this effect water to sediment concentration coefficient w t s c c is multiplied with all water sediment exchange processes eq 25 33 2 2 3 soluble reactive phosphorous p s r p d c o m p inflow via canal and precipitation i n s r p and s r p r e l are contributed to p s r p while it is depleted by outflow via canal o u s r p uptake of p s r p by autotrophs w m p u p t p p u p t and adsorption s r p a d s to sediment eq 35 the inflow of p s r p via canal s r p i f l and o u s r p via

the lake a eq 38 2 2 4 macrophytes as p p m a c as per eq 46 p m a c is increased with the uptake of p from sediment s m p u p t and water column w m p u p t while p m a c is decreased by grazing by waterbirds w b g r z and m d e a t h in this model s m p u p t eq 27 and w m p u p t eq 40 process are considered to be limited by temperature muhammetoÄlu and soyupak 2000 oliver and legoviÄ 1988 nutrient muhammetoÄlu and soyupak 2000 oliver and legoviÄ 1988 plus et al 2003 and density of macrophytes oliver and legoviÄ 1988 the nutrient limitation function for sediment uptake f p s m a c is modelled as michaelis menten function of bioavailable p in sediment a s t p and half saturation constant of p uptake by macrophyte from sediment k p m p r t eq 28 a s t p is considered a temperature dependant function of e x t r p because both desorption and decomposition are enhanced by temperature macrophyte density dependence s l m is modelled following the method of oliver and legoviÄ 1988 eq 30 31 nutrient limitation for the uptake of p from water column is modelled similarly as sediment eq 41 e h w b mainly feeds outside of the lake during the night and they use the lake chiefly as a roosting site hahn et al 2008 post et al 1998 as per our field observations these kinds of waterbirds also feed on wetland vegetation occasionally during their roosting period in this study it is assumed that e h w b and i h w b fulfil 25 and 100 of their diet from the lake vegetation respectively w b g r z is modelled following holling type ii functional response grazing rate on macrophyte h w b g r a z r and half saturation constant of macrophyte uptake k b by waterbirds have been estimated by considering the value measured for eurasian coot fulica atra as standard van altena et al 2016 for this reason the number of all herbivorous waterbirds are converted to an equivalent number of eurasian coot eq 47 2 2 5 phytoplankton as p p p h y p p h y is increased with the uptake of p from water p p u p t while decreased with grazing by zooplankton z p g r and p h y d e a t h eq 48 temperature limitation light limitation and nutrient limitation are included in the process of p p u p t nutrient limitation is modelled similarly as m p using michaelis menten kinetics where k s r p is the half saturation constant for p uptake by p p h y light limitation f i is incorporated in the model using steele 1962 function which depends on irradiance effect i and optimum surface solar irradiation for photosynthesis i o p t eq 43 i in turn depends on surface solar irradiance i r the extinction coefficient of water e c the self shading effect of phytoplankton e x t and d e p t h eq 44 eq 45 is estimated using the equation of radtke and straÅ¡kraba 1980 2 2 6 zooplankton as p p z o o p z o o growth is dependant on z p g r eq 6 z p d f eq 7 and self predation z p s p eq 8 amount of ingested p that is assimilated in p z o o depends on diet specific assimilation efficiency for phytoplankton a e p z detritus a e d z and zooplankton a e z z p z o o is decreased by z p l o s s and predatory mortality p r e d growth of zooplankton is estimated following the equations of stickney et al 2000 p uptake by zooplankton from different state variables depends on their preference on the different diet s p z for phytoplankton s d z for detritus and s z z for zooplankton p uptake by p z o o is considered as temperature chapelle et al 2000 and nutrient limited process chapelle et al 2000 stickney 2000 eq 9 in p r e d a macrophyte dependant refuge factor r e f is incorporated due to presence of high pearson s correlation between observed data of p m a c and p z o o p 0 1 and previous literature documentation wetzel 2001 eq 50 after the model construction the model is checked and verified for unit consistency in stella 2 3 estimation of waterbird derived nutrient estimation of bird derived p is a difficult job but it is important from the management perspective manny et al 1994 the main constrain in the study on guanotrophy is to quantify the amount of nutrient entering the lake via the faecal matter of waterbirds one of the most popular approaches followed by many articles is the estimation of bird derived nutrient from the allometric relationship with bird faeces production andersen et al 2003 comber et al 2018 gremillion and malone 1986 harris et al 1981 mallin et al 2016 manny et al 1994 marion et al 1994 olson et al 2005 portnoy 1990 scherer et al 1995 approaches with allometric relationship and bioenergetics help to get a more precise estimation hahn et al 2008 2007 post et al 1998 a detailed review of different approaches to estimate the nutrient loading by waterbirds is described by adhurya et al 2020 in this present study bioenergetics approach is used for the avian derived nutrient loading estimation hahn et al 2008 2007 the daily dropping production as dry mass of different avian species follows an allometric relationship adhurya et al 2020 hahn et al 2008 2007 for nutrient loading estimation of herbivorous waterbirds first the numbers of all individuals of different species are converted into the equivalent numbers of greylag goose a anser as per their body mass similarly for carnivorous waterbirds the numbers of all cormorants microcarbo niger darters anhinga melanogaster and grebes tachybaptus ruficollis are translated into the equivalent number of great cormorants phalacrocorax carbo due to their similar feeding habits alternatively the numbers of all herons bubulcus ibis ardeola grayii ardea purpurea ardea cinerea egretta garzetta ardea intermedia ardea alba storks anastomus oscitans ciconia episcopus ibises threskiornis melanocephalus and waterhens amaurornis phoenicurus are converted into the equivalent number of grey herons ardeola grayii body masses of different waterbird species for the conversion were taken from dunning 2008 since the p in the dropping of greylag goose great cormorant and grey heron were well documented the above conversion is made for the sake of calculation of nutrient loading from all birds some birds like waterhens grebes jacanas etc spend all the time in the lake for the herbivorous bird this kind of birds are considered in this model as i h w b while some for herbivorous bird this kind of birds are considered in this model as e h w b stay only in the day time f d l and some e g cormorants spend a specific portion of the day in the lake f d c o r to get the effective bird days manny et al 1994 f d l and f d c o r are multiplied with the number of appropriate waterbird groups eq 14 15 19 daily p loading by a single great cormorant g c n l p d and grey heron g h n l p d is estimated with the excretion model for the non breeding carnivorous bird of hahn et al 2007 eq 16 17 while daily p loading by a single greylag goose was estimated using dropping model of hahn et al 2008 eq 20 the nutrient loading by herbivorous h w b n l eq 18 and carnivorous c w b n l eq 13 waterbirds is obtained by multiplying the respective effective bird days with the daily nutrient loading of appropriate bird group total nutrient loading by waterbirds w b n l is the addition of c w b n l and h w b n l eq 12 2 4 sensitivity analysis it could never be feasible in a modelling study to directly estimate all needed parameters for an ecological problem which considers many processes and interactions in such cases values of those parameters are often taken from published works from similar systems therefore the difficulty is to understand which published value for a parameter should be used for better prediction so in practice a range of parameter values were chosen from published works and calibrated to obtain the best value for the parameter to get best prediction a sensitivity analysis before calibration is an important task for a modeller to handle an ecological model with a large number of parameters in the univariate local sensitivity analysis each parameter is varied to a certain extent accordingly changes in each state variable in response to slight changes in the parameter are measured in the sensitivity analysis the sensitivity functions are calculated and then summarized to understand the overall importance of different parameters sensitivity functions sij are calculated for each time steps with the following formula for the parameter pi and state variable xj jÃ¸rgensen and fath 2011 s i j x j x j p i p i sij is calculated separately for 10 and 10 variation of each parameter for each state variable then sij is summarized by taking the mean Î´mean and also by taking root mean square value of it Î´msqr over each time steps brun et al 2001 Î´ i j m e a n 1 n t 1 n s i j Î´ i j m s q r 1 n t 1 n s i j 2 where n is the number of time steps Î´ i j m s q r is useful to understand the overall importance of a parameter while Î´ i j m e a n gives information about the sign of averaged sensitivity brun et al 2001 Î´ for 10 and 10 is calculated separately and then averaged to yield the Î´ for 10 changes of parameters sensitivity analyses are performed in r following the codes given in soetaert and herman 2009 after slight modification the sensitivity of each parameter to the system s dynamics is measured by taking an average of Î´ i j m e a n for all j parameters Î´ i j m s q r is not used because in the system a parameter usually imposes a positive effect on some state variables and negative on others so the net effect can be understood only by taking either sum or average similar to parameters the sensitivity of state variable xj for 10 changes of all m number of parameters is calculated as below wang and mitsch 2000 Î´ x j 1 m i 1 m Î´ m e a n higher value of Î´ x j for a state variable indicates that it is more prone to change for the changes of all parameters 2 5 calibration and validation sensitive parameters are calibrated first for each state variables and then for the system through automatic parameter calibration procedure in r using the algorithm of price 1977 with ecolmod package soetaert and herman 2009 price algorithm finds the best fit between observed and simulated data by minimizing the model cost for a set of parameters values between a given ranges the model cost is calculated in this study as follows c o s t n i 1 t x n s i m x n o b s 2 x n o b s 2 where c o s t n is the model cost for the model calibration of the nth state variable x n s i m is the simulated value for nth state variable for a particular time step and x n o b s is the corresponding observed value of nth state variable for the same time step model cost calculation for the simultaneous calibration of more than one state variables is done with the following method c o s t m 1 n c o s t 1 c o s t 2 c o s t 3 c o s t n where c o s t m is model cost n is the number of state variables chosen to calibrate simultaneously after calibration the model is validated with the independent data collected during the second year additionally the relative error is also estimated as the second measure of model fitness marois and mitsch 2016 2 6 phosphorus budget analysis one of the important goals of ecological modelling is the quantitative representation of the whole ecosystem with the simulation results the annual phosphorus budget of the whole lake is estimated using the 669 days simulated data following the method of wang and mitsch 2000 and bÃ©jaoui et al 2017 values of the state variables are the annual averaged value of each state variable expressed in g m 3 inflows outflows and flows between state variables are calculated based on model results and expressed in g m 2 y 1 2 7 scenario analysis model is an essential tool to understand the probable impact on ecosystem in changing scenarios to fulfil the first objective the model is perturbed to 4 different scenarios to understand the changing probable dynamics of different state variables in response to changing bird number i if there are no waterbird in the ecosystem 0 ii if the number of waterbirds reduced to half of the studied scenario 50 iii if the number of waterbirds get increased to double of the studied scenario 200 iv if the number of waterbirds get increased to quadruple of the studied scenario 400 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation as seen in fig 3 mostly the model simulation matches the observed data reasonably well for p o r g the model can predict quite accurately the increase of organic matter in water in summer and monsoon though the model shows a similar trend as the observed data in winter it is slightly overestimated the p o r g value for p s e d the simulated curve shows a similar trend with the observed trend and it exists between the upper and lower limits of observed data however the model is unable to predict the low value of p s e d during monsoon and summer for p s r p the simulated curve resembles the observed pattern though it is mostly overestimated the p s r p especially in winter for p m a c the observed and simulated data are fitted most accurately throughout the season which is reflected by the lowest cost and re for it the lowest recorded value of macrophyte in november 2019 is 0 16 g m 3 due to periodic clearance of macrophyte by concerned authorities for this reason it is excluded in table 5 for p p h y and p z o o though all simulated data lie between the ranges of observed data the model is unable to obtain the observed picture for these two for zp the model cost and re are highest observed maximum and minimum predicted maximum and minimum model cost and re for all state variables are summarised in table 5 3 2 phosphorous budget the calculated phosphorus budget for the lake is presented in fig 4 waterbirds have contributed about 3 684 gp m 2 y 1 via excrement and uptaken 0 427 gp m 2 y 1 via grazing on macrophyte amongst waterbirds carnivorous and herbivorous waterbirds have contributed around 0 292 gp m 2 y 1 and 3 393 gp m 2 y 1 respectively the major flux to p o r g is resuspension from sediment 207 66 gp m 2 y 1 which is a prime autochthonous source while bird derived p is a prime allochthonous source to the same amongst the biogenic input from the state variables via death and loss m d e a t h is the prime flow to the p o r g 0 144 gp m 2 y 1 the main outflow from p o r g is s e t t 209 016 gp m 2 y 1 98 83 of the total input to p o r g is settled down to sediment and 1 14 remineralised to p s r p amongst the all other inflows to p s r p s r p r e l is contributed 97 5 amongst all outflows from p s r p 99 79 goes to sediment via adsorption considering settling resuspension of p o r g adsorption release of p s e d and uptake of p by p m a c net 3 620 gp m 2 is accumulated to sediment each year from the water column annually 6 088 gp m 2 is buried to deep sediment from the active sediment macrophyte uptake is around 60 91 of p from sediment macrophyte is mainly decreased through grazing by waterbirds p p h y is decreased mainly by mortality p z o o mainly depends upon detritus for its growth in summary the total input of p to the lake is 3 747 gp m 2 y 1 most of the organic matter like bird guano dead phytoplankton and dead macrophyte is particulate matter and settled quickly in sediment in other ways phosphorus pool in water is mainly replenished by internal loading via resuspension sediment decomposition and desorption macrophyte consumes about 0 481 gp m 2 y 1 which is 12 84 of the total input total output from the lake is 0 504 gp m 2 y 1 of which waterbirds accounts for 84 79 outflow of p a state variable and compartment wise summary is presented in table 6 3 3 scenario analysis result of scenario analysis shows that p m a c shows negative trends with the avian density while others state variables show positive trends abiotic state variables are more prone to change in response to changing waterbird number while biotic variables very less prone to change p o r g and p z o o are most prone to changes amongst the abiotic and biotic state variables respectively the results of the scenario analysis are summarized in table 7 3 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is an important step for choosing the parameter for calibration results of Î´ i j m e a n and Î´ i j m s q r are given in table 8 in the table values of sensitivity summarizing function exceeding 0 1 are marked as bold amongst the rate parameters for p o r g the most sensitive parameter is s e t t r followed by r e s u s p r though former is negatively sensitive amongst the non rate parameters k t r is the most sensitive parameters for p o r g for p s e d most negative sensitive rate parameter is b u r r other positive sensitive rate parameters for p s e d are d r m g l g and d r r g l g amongst the non rate parameters the most positively and negatively sensitive parameters are k t s a and k t r respectively for p s r p most positively and negatively sensitive rate parameter are s r t and s a r amongst the non rate parameters the most sensitive parameter is k t s a negatively sensitive followed by k t s r the net impact of k t r on p s r p is low but p s r p is shifted 2 and 10 at opposite direction for 10 increase and decrease of this parameter respectively no rate parameters are found too sensitive to p m a c Î´ i j m s q r 0 1 p c m p and k t m p are found to be most positively and negatively sensitive non rate parameter most negative and positive sensitive rate parameters for p p h y are n p r p h y d r and m a x g r p p respectively k t p is most sensitive parameter amongst all non rate parameters p r e d r is the most sensitive rate parameter to p z o o amongst the non rate parameters k t z is the most sensitive parameter for the overall system r e s u s p r and s e t t r are the most sensitive rate parameters other important rate parameters for the system are b u r r s a r and s r t for non rate parameters k t r and k t s a are the most sensitive parameters k t m p k t p k t s r k t z and p c m p are other important non rate parameters for the system for 10 change of all parameters p z o o is the most sensitive state variable Î´ x j 0 135 followed by p o r g Î´ x j 0 13 table 1 4 discussions 4 1 impact of waterfowls the community of waterbirds is mainly dominated by herbivorous birds it feeds in the waterbody mainly on macrophyte as indicated by the p budget model the waterbirds remove a high amount of p from the system by grazing on aquatic vegetations due to high gut passage rate of birds most of the p removed by grazing returns to the system by defecation hahn et al 2008 post et al 1998 for this reason increased bird density has negative impact on macrophyte according to scenario analysis most of the waterbirds mainly feed externally at another ecosystem and use the lake mainly as roosting site this can be a possible reason behind minimal impact on macrophyte in spite of increased waterbird density in scenario analysis again waterbirds are one of the important sources of allochthonous nutrient to this ecosystem for this reason changes in the number of waterbirds has a noticeable positive impact on the dynamics of other abiotic state variables the positive effect on abiotic variables can also be a result of some impact of waterbirds on the internal cycling via bioturbation and conversion of nutrient from one form to another mitchell and perrow 1998 a major portions of the waterbird derived guano are recalcitrant which are composed of undigested food materials and uric acid brandvold et al 1976 for bird guano the decomposition of the recalcitrant portion is a slow process started after 15 30 days liu et al 2014a the main input to p o r g is bird s guano and dead macrophyte both of these are particulate matters and readily settled down to sediments unckless and makarewicz 2007 high sensitivity to p o r g and high calibrated value of settling rate indicate importance of this process the high value of p s e d in winter may be due to the accumulation of highly insoluble bird guano in sediment the higher sensitivity of d r m g l g d r r g l g and p e x c r g l g to p s e d supports this fact though a high increase of inorganic nutrient observed in the ecosystem for the increase of bird number this does not to affect the density of autotrophs too much as per sensitivity analysis it may be due to density of macrophyte limited by area of the lake and half saturation constant for nutrient uptake a similar concept can also be applied to phytoplankton half saturation constant self shading effect and zooplankton grazing might limit their population although leaching of nutrient from the labile portion of the bird guano in winter might be a possible explanation behind observed winter spike of p p h y liu et al 2014b the hypothetical density of zooplankton only shows highest increase in scenario analysis amongst biotic state variables and this may be due to increase of its nutrient via both detritivory and herbivory krylov et al 2014 found that zooplankton community shifted to copepoda dominated state in the influence of bird guano our study also found a similar result of copepoda dominance during high bird density 4 2 impact of internal cycling it is evident in the nutrient budget analysis fig 4 that the dynamics of this ecosystem are mainly regulated by settling resuspension and adsorption release kinetics the p s r p in water is mainly regulated with internal loading from sediment however decomposition is also found to play a major role in p s r p dynamics as compared with the internal loading this ecosystem receives a negligible amount of nutrient from the outside this emphasizes the importance of internal cycling in an apparently closed shallow lake ecosystem the sediment water balance of p depends on several key factors physical settling resuspension chemical ph temperature nitrate dissolved oxygen and redox potential and biological bioturbation mineralisation microbial and macrophyte uptake boers et al 1998 jensen and andersen 1992 sondergaard et al 2001 the internal loading of p s r p is mainly driven by desorption of p in sediment and subsequent diffusion of it to the water column the sorption of p is a complex process and driven by several factors like ph redox potential mineral content iron aluminium and calcium organic matter p loading and ambient p concentration in soil reddy and delaune 2008 in acidic condition iron and aluminium play important roles in p adsorption while in basic condition calcium adsorbs p measured ph of our study site of both water and sediment ranges between 5 and 7 which is mildly acidic however ph of the water is prone to change with the photosynthetic activity of the autotrophs diurnally temperature functions such as k t s a and k t s r are also sensitive parameters to p p h y these functions control nutrient bioavailability in the water column and indicate dependence of water column productivity on internal loading like this lake internal loading of phosphorous also founds to play an important role in dynamics of some other shallow lake ecosystems like long lake of washington jacoby et al 1982 loch leven of scotland spears et al 2007 and constructed wetlands of illinois wang and mitsch 2000 temperature founds to play a crucial role in sediment water dynamics in our model the observed trend of p o r g and p s r p follows a similar trend with t s and t w while p s e d founds to be inversely related to the temperature again s r t s a r r s u s p and associated temperature functions are highly sensitive parameters this indicates the previously established fact that temperature enhances the resuspension and inorganic p release huang et al 2011 spears et al 2007 from sediment apart from resuspension settling also founds to play an important role in sediment water dynamics as per the sensitivity analysis accumulation of p o r g inflowed to the lake during monsoon and bird guano in winter to p s e d might be a reason behind increased sediment p during winter after all net influx of p to sediment and burial of a large amount of p to deep sediment suggest that the sediment acts as phosphorus sink of the system higher sensitivity of b u r r justifies the importance of this process 4 3 impact of macrophytes in shallow lakes macro vegetation generally dominates as the producer of organic matters assimilation of p is much higher in this life form than phytoplankton wetzel 2001 in the nutrient budget analysis it is evident that macrophyte uptakes a considerable amount of p from both sediment and water column though the uptake rate from the sediment is much higher christiansen et al 2016 wang and mitsch 2000 the high sensitivity of k t m p to macrophyte indicates that macrophytes uptake a higher amount of p from the system during summer high temperature promotes the decomposition of organic materials in sediment the desorption and diffusion of orthophosphate are also increased at high temperature huang et al 2011 reddy and delaune 2008 this ultimately increases the bioavailable p in sediment pore water and might be another probable reason for low summer p s e d macrophyte can uptake a very high amount of p from water and helps to maintain a clear water state by preventing algal bloom mitsch and gosselink 2007 srivastava et al 2008 the nutrient budget analysis supports this fact and low nutrient in water due to macrophyte consumption limits phytoplankton growth by exerting bottom up control moss et al 2013 stephen and brian 1998 a similar ecosystem east calcutta wetland india with less macrophyte cover shows high inorganic phosphate concentration 4 10 g m 3 in the water column and higher phytoplankton mandal et al 2015 while in our system s r p concentration always remains below 1 g m 3 which validates the above fact macrophyte can also limit the growth of phytoplankton by reducing light availability to water column due to their high surface area macrophyte provides refuge to zooplankton from fish predation which reduces the phytoplankton by top down control schriver et al 1995 timms and moss 1984 in addition phytoplankton growth is also restricted by allelopathy with the release of some organic chemicals by macrophyte hilt and gross 2008 rojo et al 2013 in macrophyte dominated shallow lakes zooplankton dynamics are not like the large lakes with greater depth macrophyte provides refuge to zooplankton from the fish predation schriver et al 1995 timms and moss 1984 dense macrophyte vegetation inhibits light penetration and promotes anoxia to bottom water this restricts small fishes in the depth where zooplankton take refuge wetzel 2001 high sensitivity of r e f in this study highlights the importance of refuge in this kind of system available literature suggests that with the increasing density of macrophyte numbers of cladocera increase in the water lauridsen et al 1996 schriver et al 1995 while in the low density of macrophyte copepods dominate the zooplankton community schriver et al 1995 our observed data are in accordance with the previous study 4 4 system dynamics the analysis of system dynamics is important to understand the emergent properties of the system due to the change of the parameters affecting its dynamics for sensitivity analysis of all state variables in the system it has been noticed that p z o o and p o r g are more prone to change with 10 changes in all parameters for the system sensitivity analysis of all parameters a similar picture is also observed parameters affecting settling resuspension sediment burial macrophyte p uptake and zooplankton grazing are more sensitive to the system it is noticeable that changes of parameters which ultimately lead to changes in the p o r g are mostly positively sensitive to the system consequently the increased values of these parameters enhance p o r g and finally p z o o this emphasizes the importance of detritivory in the system parameters which increase p s r p in the water column are positively sensitive to system and vice versa the increased amount of p s r p promotes the growth of p m a c and p p h y p m a c and p p h y are important for p z o o which provides shelter and food respectively the high overall sensitivity of parameters affects burial settling resuspension dynamics and sorption release dynamics pointing out the importance of internal cycling to sustain productivity in an apparently closed system and p retention by the wetland as already discussed in section 4 6 in response to different states of the system the community shift of zooplankton can be observed this might be the possible reason behind its higher sensitivity to the system 4 5 model unpredictability limitations and future scopes the complexity of the model increases the number of parameters to be calibrated which ultimately increase the model cost due to increased complexity our model unable to predict some observed scenario in winter the model is unable to predict the lower value of p this discrepancy between observed and simulated value may be due to sampling error because sampling station is retarded in monsoon towards periphery due to higher water volume and forwarded towards the centre during the dry season due to the presence of large trees at the bank the soil of the periphery may be rich in organic content for litterfall from these trees this may produce higher sediment and water nutrient content to predict this high value the model may neglect the low value of p in winter wind rainfall and aquatic animal induced resuspension may play a major role in sediment water p transfer gargallo et al 2017 like these two processes many other processes like bioturbation macrophyte inhibition of phytoplankton growth fish grazing the inflow of nutrient via litterfall nutrient uptake of macrophyte from deep sediments light limitation to phytoplankton by macrophyte turbidity fish grazing on phytoplankton etc are neglected due to paucity of data and make the model simple these factors may be affected the prediction of p s e d p p h y and p z o o again complex community structure and inclusion of detritivory self predation and refuge make the zooplankton equation more complex nowadays including the fish is a very essential practice in ecological modelling since fishing is strictly prohibited in bwls it was not possible to incorporate in this model besides the export of nutrient from the system by carnivorous waterbirds is also neglected in our model because of its low number and unavailability of fish data in our model most of the parameters are taken from literature and then calibrated if it is found to be sensitive values of these parameters are taken mostly from the temperate and polar system due to lack of data from the tropical region the model might be more realistic if it is possible to incorporate these parameters as graph time functions after measurement modelling is an iterative practice feedback from one model will help to develop its improved version increase the frequency of data collection over more than a year and their use in the model will help to understand the system dynamic better again the model is a tool to study the system properties in this study scenario analysis is only performed by changing the number of waterbirds in future it is also important to observe the model behaviour in other changing physico chemical and biological scenarios the scenario analysis is unable to find noticeable variation in macrophyte density due to changing number of waterbirds it is important to note that the density of macrophyte is already higher in this ecosystem so it is also important to observe the model behaviour with low initial macrophyte density possible remedies to control nuisance macrophyte growth due to eutrophication can also be understood by introducing biocontroller or chemical agent in the model 5 conclusion the model shows that waterbird derived nutrient is the most important source to the lake ecosystem and comprised about 98 32 of the total allochthonous p input this indicates the importance of waterbird as the nutrient source in the close ecosystem like our studied system in addition to an important nutrient importer to the system the water bird is also a major nutrient exporter of the system waterbirds export around 6 44 of nutrient from the system while the burial of the p to the deep sediment is the top exporter this emphasizes the importance of the wetland ecosystem as a p sink the model also shows the importance of internal cycling of this kind of shallow lakes which receives a minimum allochthonous nutrient load the higher sensitivity of most of the temperature coefficients indicates the temperature dependency of most of the processes this indicates that temperature variation due to global climate change may considerably change the dynamics of the system scenario analysis concludes that waterbirds regulate to some extent the dynamics of abiotic state variables but it has very less impact on productivity moreover this is the first process based model to study the influence of guanotrophy in shallow lakes similar models can be developed for other similar ecosystems which not only will give a better understanding of the ecosystem but also will play an important role in managing the habitats of waterbirds declaration of
