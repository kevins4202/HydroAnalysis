16040,antidepressants are released into the aquatic environment because of their incomplete removal from wastewater treatment plants in the present work we investigated the photochemical degradation of a commonly prescribed antidepressant namely sertraline in aqueous matrices the molar absorption coefficient of sertraline at 254 nm and at various ph values in the range from 4 0 to 9 0 was 444 65 l mol 1 cm 1 while the quantum yield of its direct photolysis under uvc radiation λ 254 nm was 1 7 0 1 10 2 mol einstein 1 i e both values were relatively low next we investigated the photochemical degradation of sertraline under uvc radiation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 i e uvc h2o2 or persulfate ions s2o8 2 i e uvc ps several parameters were studied such as the initial concentrations of the oxidants solution ph and the composition of the aqueous matrix experiments were carried out in aqueous phosphate buffers in synthetic wastewater as well as in synthetic fresh and hydrolyzed human urine it was found that in all aqueous matrices the photochemical degradation of sertraline followed pseudo first order kinetics the values of the observed pseudo first order rate constants in the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes were from one to three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding value in the uvc process the uvc ps process was more efficient than the uvc h2o2 process either in aqueous phosphate buffer solutions or in synthetic wastewaters despite the comparable reactivity of sertraline towards hydroxyl and sulfate radicals however both processes resulted in partial mineralization of the compound after prolonged irradiation in the uvc h2o2 process there was an optimum h2o2 concentration which depended on the aqueous matrix while in the uvc ps process there was an almost linear increase in treatment efficiency as a function of ps concentration at least in the range of concentrations studied in the present work solution ph in the range from 6 0 to 9 0 had a relatively negligible effect on treatment performance for both processes in synthetic urine matrices despite the reduction in reaction rate the observed pseudo first order rate constants were reduced by approximately one to two orders of magnitude the photochemical degradation of sertraline proceeded to a relatively satisfactory degree finally the calculations of the electrical energy per order and the associated cost showed that the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes are cost efficient and suitable for full scale applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

in the aquatic environment antidepressants have attracted considerable attention mole and brooks 2019 castillo zacarías et al 2021 antidepressants are drugs that relieve the symptoms of major depressive disorder which is a common mental illness worldwide affecting more than 15 of the population at some point in the life span debattista 2021 o donnell et al 2018 in the past decade both the economic crisis and the recent covid 19 pandemic have increased the prevalence of mental health disorders including depression frasquilho et al 2016 castillo zacarías et al 2021 cénat et al 2021 consequently antidepressants are among the most heavily prescribed pharmaceuticals and their consumption has grown substantially over the past decades in many parts of the world oecd 2019 and is expected to increase in the forthcoming years selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris are the most widely prescribed antidepressants and they act by modulating the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin sertraline its chemical structure is shown in table 1 belongs to the class of ssris and is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressant debattista 2021 o donnell et al 2018 sertraline is administered orally and is mainly metabolized in the liver to n desmethylsertraline debattista 2021 both sertraline and n desmethylsertraline are excreted via urine to raw sewage however since sertraline exhibits high chemical stability johnson and chang 1996 lam et al 2004 it is insufficiently removed by conventional treatment methods usually employed in urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps thus discharged into the receiving aqueous bodies mole and brooks 2019 castillo zacarías et al 2021 during wastewater treatment the primary removal process of sertraline is sorption onto activated sludge followed by biodegradation albeit to a much lower extent gornik et al 2020 although the concentrations of ssris including sertraline in the aquatic environment are relatively low particular concern has been raised about their uptake and bioaccumulation in the biota silva et al 2015 mole and brooks 2019 and their possible adverse effects on non target organisms sehonova et al 2018 even at environmentally relevant concentrations ford and fong 2016 therefore it is rather imperative to find efficient treatment methods for their elimination from wwtps effluents over the past few decades several advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed to remove various pollutants including pharmaceuticals from aqueous matrices stefan 2018 aops have as a common feature the in situ generation of various reactive oxygen species in the oxidation mechanism leading to the degradation of the target pollutants to several transformation products tps stefan 2018 aops include among others ozonation heterogeneous photocatalysis fenton and photo fenton oxidation electrochemical oxidation sonochemical processes ultraviolet radiation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide sulfate radical anion based processes as well as various combinations thereof stefan 2018 table s1 in the supplementary material summarizes several recent studies conducted on the removal of sertraline from aqueous matrices employing various aops however to the best of our knowledge the photochemical degradation of sertraline under uvc radiation in the presence of h2o2 or s2o8 2 i e persulfate ions ps in aqueous matrices has not yet been studied based on the above the objective of the present work was to investigate the photochemical degradation of sertraline in aqueous matrices under uvc radiation λ 254 nm either alone i e direct photolysis or in the presence of hydrogen peroxide i e uvc h2o2 or persulfate ions i e uvc ps more specifically we studied the kinetics of the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation and we determined its quantum yield we also examined the photochemical degradation of sertraline under uvc radiation in the presence of various initial concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or persulfate ions additional parameters were studied such as solution ph and the composition of the aqueous matrix experiments were carried out in aqueous phosphate buffers in synthetic wastewater as well as in synthetic fresh and hydrolyzed human urine last but not least we calculated the electrical energy per order and the associated cost 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials sertraline in the form of hydrochloride salt cas number 79559 97 0 purity 98 0 was purchased from tokyo chemical industry tci europe belgium its chemical structure is depicted in table 1 along with some physicochemical properties all the other reagents and solvents are given in the supplementary material text s1 aqueous solutions of sertraline were prepared in five matrices namely i ultrapure water upw ii ultrapure water buffered at various ph values using 10 mm phosphate salts at various ph values thereafter denoted as pb followed by the corresponding ph value e g pb ph 7 0 iii synthetic wastewater effluent sww ph 7 5 iv synthetic fresh human urine sfu ph 6 0 and v synthetic hydrolyzed human urine shu ph 9 0 more details on the preparation of the aqueous matrices are given in the supplementary material text s2 aqueous stock solutions of sertraline at an initial concentration of approximately 10 μm were prepared daily by dissolving the appropriate amount of sertraline in 5 l of the corresponding aqueous matrix in addition in some cases aqueous solutions of sertraline were prepared at lower initial concentrations by diluting the above stock solution in all cases the exact initial concentrations of sertraline in the aqueous matrices were measured by hplc vide infra these initial concentrations although higher than those typically found in aqueous environmental matrices were chosen to allow i the assessment of process efficiency within a measurable timescale and ii the accurate determination of residual sertraline concentration with the analytical techniques employed in this work 2 2 uvc irradiation apparatus uvc radiation was provided by an 11 w low pressure mercury lamp philips tuv pl s g23 emitting predominately at 254 nm the experiments were carried out in a batch type photochemical reactor described in the supplementary material text s3 the incident photon flux on a chemical amount basis qn p divided by the volume of the photochemical reactor i e qn p v was 1 37 0 03 10 5 einstein l 1 s 1 while the effective path length of radiation l was 1 4 0 1 cm moreover the incident fluence rate was e o 9 05 0 19 mw cm 2 for each experimental run the incident uv fluence h o in j m 2 commonly called the uv dose was calculated by multiplying the incident fluence rate by the exposure time all the above measurements and calculations are described in the supplementary material text s5 2 3 photochemical degradation experiments the experiments for the direct photolysis of sertraline i e in the absence of oxidants were carried out as follows initially 500 ml of the aqueous solution of sertraline dissolved in the designated aqueous matrix and at the desired initial concentration were placed in the photochemical reactor then the uvc lamp which was switched on outside the reactor for approximately 15 min to stabilize its photon emission was placed inside the inner quartz sleeve of the reactor during irradiation the reaction mixture was continuously stirred with a magnetic stir bar and a magnetic stirrer unless otherwise stated the reaction mixture was exposed to ambient air and no further aeration took place the experiments for the photochemical degradation of sertraline in aqueous solutions under uvc radiation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or persulfate ions were conducted as described above with the addition of the appropriate amount of h2o2 or s2o8 2 in the reaction mixture more specifically a measured volume of a concentrated h2o2 solution 30 w w or the appropriate amount of solid na2s2o8 was added to the reaction mixture to achieve the desired initial concentration of the oxidants several control experiments were performed in the dark as described in the supplementary material text s6 which showed that sertraline was stable in the dark in the absence or in the presence of the oxidants in addition competition kinetics experiments were carried out to determine the second order rate constants of sertraline with hydroxyl and sulfate radicals i e k ho sertraline and k so4 sertraline respectively as described in the supplementary material text s7 to monitor the progress of the reaction periodically samples were drawn from the reactor and analyzed for the residual concentration of sertraline h2o2 s2o8 2 and total organic carbon toc as described in the supplementary material text s8 all the above experiments were replicated 2 to 4 times and the results are expressed as average value standard deviation while the error bars in the various figures correspond to the standard deviation of the replicate experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 molar absorption coefficient initially we measured the molar absorption coefficient of sertraline ε λ in l mol 1 cm 1 in the uv region of the electromagnetic spectrum in aqueous solutions and at various ph values in the range from 4 0 to 9 0 we found that the average value of the molar absorption coefficient at 254 nm was 444 65 l mol 1 cm 1 this value is relatively low since the order of magnitude of ε 254 nm for most organic pollutants has been reported to lie usually in the range from 101 to 104 l mol 1 cm 1 with an average order of magnitude at 103 l mol 1 cm 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 more details regarding the absorption spectra of sertraline are discussed in the supplementary material text s9 3 2 direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation then we studied the photochemical degradation of sertraline under uvc radiation at various initial concentrations in the range from 1 08 0 02 μm to 10 06 0 41 μm and the results are shown in fig 1 as can be seen the rate of the photochemical degradation of sertraline remained practically constant within the limits of experimental error these results indicate that at the experimental conditions employed in the present work the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation followed first order kinetics as explained in the supplementary material text s4 the rate of the photochemical degradation of sertraline at wavelength λ r λ in mol l 1 s 1 is given by the following equation zepp 1978 beltrán et al 1995 leifer 1988 1 r λ d c d t λ 2 303 q n p v l ε λ φ λ c where c is the concentration of sertraline in mol l 1 and φ λ is the quantum yield for its direct photolysis at wavelength λ dimensionless or mol einstein 1 if we set 2 k d λ 2 303 q n p v l ε λ φ λ then eq 1 can be written as 3 d c d t λ k d λ c which after integration at the boundary conditions gives the expression of the first order rate law 4 ln c c 0 k d λ t where c 0 is the initial concentration of sertraline in mol l 1 and k d λ is the first order rate constant for its direct photolysis in s 1 the inset of fig 1 shows the plot of ln c c0 as a function of time and uv fluence while table 2 shows the first order rate constants and the corresponding coefficients of determination r2 τhe quantum yield for the direct photolysis of sertraline was determined using eq 2 after solving for φ λ zepp 1978 5 φ λ k d λ 2 303 q n p v l ε λ by substituting we obtained the values given in table 2 as can be seen the quantum yield was in the range from 1 6 0 1 10 2 mol einstein 1 to 1 7 0 3 10 2 mol einstein 1 while the average value was 1 7 0 1 10 2 mol einstein 1 this value is relatively low to moderate since the quantum yields at 254 nm for most organic pollutants have been usually reported to vary between 1 3 10 5 and 1 25 mol einstein 1 with an average value of 0 129 mol einstein 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 these findings indicate that the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation was not a very efficient process for its degradation in aqueous solutions a more detailed discussion of the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation is given in the supplementary material text s10 3 3 photochemical degradation of sertraline in the uvc h2o2 and the uvc ps processes 3 3 1 uvc h2o2 versus uvc ps next we carried out additional experiments under uvc radiation in the presence of h2o2 or ps these experiments were performed in aqueous buffer solutions containing phosphate salts at a concentration of 10 mm and ph 7 0 pb ph 7 0 and at various initial h2o2 concentrations in the range from 0 10 mm to 15 mm i e the ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 was in the range from approximately 10 to 1500 or ps in the range from 0 050 mm to 1 0 mm i e the ratio ps 0 sertraline 0 was in the range from approximately 5 to 100 we chose this range of concentrations because the molar absorption coefficients of both oxidants at 254 nm are very low i e ε h2o2 18 5 l mol 1 cm 1 and ε s2o8 2 20 22 l mol 1 cm 1 stefan 2018 consequently to generate a sufficiently high concentration of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals the concentration of both oxidants should be relatively high usually in the order of mm stefan 2018 as shown in fig 2 a and b for both processes the photochemical degradation of sertraline was fast enough throughout the whole range of the oxidant concentrations for example at the lowest oxidant concentration i e 0 10 mm for h2o2 or 0 050 mm for ps the photochemical degradation of sertraline was over 90 i e degradation by one order of magnitude after 7 min irradiation on the other hand at the highest oxidant concentration i e 15 mm for h2o2 or 1 0 mm for ps the corresponding degradation of sertraline i e above 90 was achieved after 40 s or 20 s irradiation in the uvc h2o2 or the uvc ps process respectively the incident uv fluence i e uv dose required to achieve over 90 degradation at the lowest oxidant concentration was approximately 380 j m 2 for both processes and it was reduced to about 36 j m 2 or 18 j m 2 at the highest oxidant concentration in the uvc h2o2 or the uvc ps process respectively moreover as discussed in the supplementary material text s6 control experiments performed in the dark showed that sertraline was stable in the presence of h2o2 or ps in the whole range of the oxidant concentrations studied in the present work therefore we conclude that the degradation of sertraline observed in fig 2 a and b is attributed solely to photochemical reactions the photochemical degradation of sertraline in the uvc h2o2 and the uvc ps process was due to i the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation i e reaction r1 in table 3 albeit with relatively low quantum yield as discussed in section 3 2 and ii to the photochemical formation of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals according to reactions r2 and r3 in table 3 and their subsequent reaction with sertraline to form various tps according to reactions r4 and r5 in table 3 in the uvc ps process in alkaline media reaction r13 takes place however its contribution becomes significant at ph values higher than 9 stefan 2018 fig s18 a in the supplementary material shows the photochemical degradation of sertraline in both processes at the three common oxidant concentrations studied in the present work namely at 0 10 mm 0 50 mm and 1 0 mm as can be seen in all cases at a common oxidant dose the photochemical degradation of sertraline was more efficient in the uvc ps process than in the uvc h2o2 process as discussed in the supplementary material text s11 in the uvc h2o2 process after 90 min irradiation which corresponds to a uv dose of approximately 4900 j m 2 the toc concentration decreased by about 36 while the corresponding decrease in the uvc ps process was approximately 62 these results indicate that the photochemical degradation of sertraline in both processes leads to partial mineralization of the compound albeit after prolonged irradiation moreover it is further confirmed that the uvc ps process was more efficient than the uvc h2o2 process especially if we take into account that the initial concentration of the oxidant was lower in the uvc ps process furthermore we conclude that the mineralization of sertraline was much slower than its photochemical degradation and therefore some rather recalcitrant tps were intermediately formed in both processes 3 3 2 kinetic analysis as shown in fig 2 a and b for each experimental run in both processes the concentration of sertraline decreased exponentially over time in other words it appears that the photochemical degradation of sertraline follows pseudo first order kinetics figs s19 a s19 b and s20 in the supplementary material show the plots of ln c c0 as a function of time and uv fluence as can be seen each set of data points lay along a straight line the slopes of the straight lines give the observed pseudo first order rate constants at 254 nm k obs in s 1 and m2 j 1 which are shown in tables 4 and 5 along with the corresponding coefficients of determination r2 it should be noted that the coefficients of determination were in most cases higher than 0 98 or 0 99 thus confirming the relatively good fitting of the experimental data to the pseudo first order kinetic model the values of the k obs are from one to three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding value of the direct photolysis k d thus showing that the photochemical degradation of sertraline was significantly enhanced especially in the uvc ps process in order to compare the reactivity of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals towards sertraline we determined the second order rate constants by the competition kinetics methodology as described in the supplementary material text s7 as can be seen in table 3 the second order rate constants between sertraline and hydroxyl or sulfate radicals were k ho sertraline 5 5 0 6 109 l mol 1 s 1 or k so4 sertraline 4 9 0 3 109 l mol 1 s 1 respectively thus showing that sertraline has a rather comparable reactivity towards hydroxyl and sulfate radicals however the higher efficiency of the uvc ps process can be attributed to the following reasons i to the higher quantum yield for the photolysis of ps at 254 nm i e φs2o82 1 4 than the corresponding quantum yield for the photolysis of h2o2 at 254 nm i e φh2o2 1 0 stefan 2018 thus leading to higher production of sulfate radicals ii to the longer lifetime of sulfate radicals t1 2 30 40 μs compared to hydroxyl radicals t1 2 1 μs thus allowing better diffusion of sulfate radicals from the generation site to the bulk of the solution and its subsequent reaction with the target pollutants zhang et al 2016 oh et al 2016 and iii to the lower scavenging effect of so4 by s2o8 2 in the uvc ps process i e reaction r10 in table 3 vide infra compared to the corresponding scavenging effect of ho by h2o2 in the uvc h2o2 process i e reaction r6 in table 3 stefan 2018 all the above reasons contribute to making the uvc ps process more efficient than the uvc h2o2 process for the photochemical degradation of sertraline 3 3 3 effect of oxidant concentration in aqueous buffer solutions the observed pseudo first order rate constants were plotted as a function of the initial oxidant concentrations and the molar ratios oxidant 0 sertraline 0 αs can be seen in the insets of fig 3 a and b and in fig 4 a and b for both processes at relatively low oxidant concentrations i e lower than 1 0 mm or when the ratio oxidant 0 sertraline 0 was lower than approximately 100 the observed rate constants increased almost linearly as a function of the oxidant concentrations this happens because at low oxidant concentrations the increase of the oxidant concentration increased the concentration of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals thus improving the efficiency of both processes on the other hand as shown in fig 3 a and b for the uvc h2o2 process at relatively high h2o2 0 i e higher than 1 0 mm or when the ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 was higher than approximately 100 the values of the k obs as a function of h2o2 0 deviated from linearity when h2o2 0 increased from 1 0 mm to 5 0 mm i e when the ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 increased from approximately 100 to 500 the observed rate constants increased however further increase of h2o2 0 from 5 0 mm to 10 mm and then to 15 mm and consequently increase of the ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 from approximately 500 to 1000 and then to 1500 decreased the observed rate constants therefore there is an optimum h2o2 0 and hence an optimum ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 above which further increase of the concentration of h2o2 does not further improve the efficiency of the process several parameters have been reported to affect the optimum h2o2 concentration including lamp type and power reactor design and geometry pollutant reactivity towards hydroxyl radicals pollutant treatment level and aqueous matrix composition among others stefan 2018 the above results can be explained by taking into account reactions r6 r7 r8 r10 and r11 in table 3 at relatively high h2o2 concentrations the excess h2o2 consumes hydroxyl radicals thus acting as a hydroxyl radical scavenger as shown in reaction r6 while ho2 is less reactive than ho towards organic pollutants stefan 2018 there is some controversy regarding the rate constant of the reaction between so4 and s2o8 2 i e reaction r10 and several values have been reported in the order of 105 l mol 1 s 1 to 104 l mol 1 s 1 or even lower mcelroy and waygood 1990 jiang et al 1992 bao and barker 1996 buxton et al 1999 ivanov et al 2000 yu et al 2004 stefan 2018 this controversy might have arisen from the finding that the rate constant depends on solution ph among other factors yu et al 2004 however there is a consensus yu et al 2004 stefan 2018 that this rate constant is relatively low i e at least two orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding rate constant of the reaction between ho and h2o2 i e reaction r6 therefore the scavenging effect of so4 by s2o8 2 in the uvc ps process is less significant than the scavenging effect of ho by h2o2 in the uvc h2o2 process an additional factor that might contribute to the above behavior is that the self recombination reaction of hydroxyl radicals i e reaction r8 has a much higher rate constant than the corresponding self recombination reaction of sulfate radicals i e reaction r11 consequently in the uvc h2o2 process an optimum h2o2 concentration or an optimum ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 was observed above which process efficiency did not increase further on the other hand in the uvc ps process there was an almost linear increase in treatment efficiency as a function of ps concentration at least in the range of concentrations studied in the present work it should be noted that in the uvc ps process we were unable to carry out experiments at relatively high ps concentrations i e higher than 1 0 mm because the degradation of sertraline was completed in just a few seconds and therefore it was difficult to take samples from the reactor in such short contact times similar results have been found for the degradation of various organic pollutants including pharmaceuticals in the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes gao et al 2012 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 tan et al 2013 matzek and carter 2016 zhang et al 2016 ao and liu 2017 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 stefan 2018 moreover in the uvc ps process in some studies it has been found that at relatively high ps concentration the rate constants for the degradation of the target pollutants increased albeit non linearly or even reached a plateau hori et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 however we could not observe such behavior due to the relatively low ps concentrations employed in the present work 3 3 4 effect of oxidant concentration in sww then we carried out additional experiments in sww in the presence of various initial oxidant concentrations and the results are depicted in fig 5 a and b as can be seen for both processes the photochemical degradation of sertraline followed once again pseudo first order kinetics figs s21 a s21 b and s22 in the supplementary material show the plots of ln c c0 as a function of time and uv fluence while tables 6 and 7 show the observed pseudo first order rate constants along with the corresponding coefficients of determination r2 moreover figs 3 a b 4 a and b show the k obs as a function of the initial oxidant concentrations and the molar ratios oxidant 0 sertraline 0 as shown the photochemical degradation of sertraline was slower in sww than in aqueous phosphate buffers at ph 7 0 this is due to the various organic and inorganic components dissolved in sww which consumed part of the photogenerated hydroxyl and sulfate radicals thus decreasing reaction rate additionally as shown in fig s18 b in the supplementary material the uvc ps process was once again more efficient than the uvc h2o2 process furthermore as shown in the insets of fig 3 a and b and in fig 4 a and b in sww as shown previously for pb ph 7 0 for both processes at relatively low oxidant concentrations i e lower than 1 0 mm for ps or lower than 2 5 mm for h2o2 the observed rate constants increased almost linearly as a function of the oxidant concentration in the uvc h2o2 process the slope of the equation giving k obs as a function of the oxidant concentration decreased by approximately 4 2 times in sww compared to pb while the corresponding decrease of the slope in the uvc ps process was about 6 7 times these results indicate that sulfate radicals are more susceptible to scavenging from the various organic and inorganic components dissolved in sww than hydroxyl radicals in other words the uvc ps process is more sensitive towards the constituents of the aqueous matrix than the uv h2o2 process miklos et al 2018 we can hypothesize that this behavior can be explained by taking into account the reaction rate constants of the various scavenging species with hydroxyl and sulfate radicals however since we have not determined these rate constants our hypothesis was not tested further nevertheless in sww as in pb ph 7 the uvc ps process remained more efficient than the uvc h2o2 process moreover as shown in fig 5 a and b and table 6 in the uvc h2o2 process the observed rate constant increased when increasing h2o2 concentration from 2 5 mm to 10 mm while treatment efficiency reached a plateau when h2o2 concentration was further increased from 10 mm to 15 mm therefore it appears that the optimum h2o2 concentration in sww was approximately 10 mm this optimum h2o2 concentration in sww is higher than the corresponding optimum concentration in pb ph 7 since as mentioned in the previous section the optimum h2o2 concentration depends on the composition of the aqueous matrix among other factors stefan 2018 consequently all further experiments in the uvc h2o2 process were carried out at 10 mm h2o2 in the uvc ps process all subsequent experiments were conducted at 0 5 mm ps in order to be able to monitor the progress of the reaction at a reasonable time scale especially in those cases where the reaction is completed at relatively short contact times 3 3 5 effect of solution ph and aqueous matrix composition in further experiments we studied the effect of solution ph in both processes the experiments were carried out at various ph values ranging from 6 0 to 9 0 and the results are shown in fig 6 a and b moreover figs s23 and s24 in the supplementary material show the plots of ln c c0 as a function of time and uv fluence whereas tables 8 and 9 show the values of the observed pseudo first order rate constants and the corresponding coefficients of determination as shown in the uvc h2o2 process the k obs values slightly decreased at acidic and alkaline ph compared to the corresponding values at neutral ph in the uvc ps process higher k obs values were observed at acidic ph and slightly decreased as the solution ph increased to neutral and then to alkaline however for both processes the differences in the values of the k obs were relatively small and can therefore be considered practically negligible the effect of solution ph is discussed further in the supplementary material text s12 next in order to investigate the effect of the aqueous matrix composition we performed additional experiments in synthetic urine matrices i e sfu and shu human urine can be collected using no mix toilets i e urine diverting toilets or urinals and is a particularly interesting aqueous matrix that has been extensively studied in recent years for nutrient recovery and pharmaceutical degradation randall and naidoo 2018 boyer and saetta 2019 accordingly the photochemical degradation of sertraline was studied in sfu and shu for both processes and the results are shown in figs 6 a b s23 and s24 as well as in tables 8 and 9 as can be seen a significant reduction was observed in the efficiency of both processes more specifically in the uvc h2o2 process fig 6 a k obs was reduced by approximately 1 15 log and 1 77 log in sfu and shu respectively compared to the experiments carried out in pb at the same ph values in both matrices in the uvc ps process fig 6 b k obs was reduced by approximately 2 log i e reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude in sfu the reduction in the efficiency of both processes was probably due to the competing reactions of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals with citrate and urea which are the main organic components in this matrix table s3 in the supplementary material ιn shu bicarbonate and ammonia were probably the main chemical species responsible for scavenging hydroxyl and sulfate radicals in contrast the corresponding radicals formed in the reactions between hydroxyl and sulfate radicals with bicarbonate and ammonia i e carbonate radicals and various reactive nitrogen species such as nh2 no2 and no among others were generally less reactive towards organic pollutants zhang et al 2015 however despite the reduction in reaction rate in all synthetic aqueous matrices the photochemical degradation of sertraline proceeded to a relatively satisfactory degree 3 4 electrical energy per order and economic evaluation in the last part of our work we compared the techniques employed in the present work based on their energy efficiency and the associated cost therefore we calculated the electrical energy per order e eo which is a figure of merit frequently used to compare and evaluate various aops bolton et al 2001 miklos et al 2018 e eo is the electric energy in kilowatt hours kwh required to degrade the target pollutant by one order of magnitude i e degradation by 90 in a unit volume of contaminated water i e 1 m3 for a batch operation e eo is defined according to the following equation bolton et

final concentrations of the target pollutant after 90 degradation respectively in mol l 1 the equation is multiplied by 1000 to convert l 1 to m 3 the electrical energy per order was calculated as described in text s13 in the supplementary material while the obtained values are given in tables 2 and s9 for the uvc process and in tables 4 9 for the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes moreover fig 7 a and b shows the plot of e eo as a function of the oxidant dose in the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes in pb ph 7 0 and sww in addition we calculated the total cost per order cost o total in m 3 order 1 which is defined as the total cost required to degrade the target pollutant by one order of magnitude in 1 m3 of polluted water cost o total was calculated using the following equations khan et al

the total electricity cost as maintenance cost for a real application of a uv system khan et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 and cost o ox in m 3 order 1 is the oxidants cost calculated as shown in eq 9 by multiplying the concentration of the oxidant oxidant in mol l 1 with the commercial price of the oxidant in mol 1 the term log ci cf in the denominator of eq 9 was introduced for dimensional consistency in order to express the units of cost o ox as euros per cubic meter per order of magnitude i e m 3 order 1 more details regarding the electricity cost and the commercial prices of the oxidants are given in the supplementary material text s13 the costs calculated using the above procedure for the uvc process are given in tables 2 and s9 while tables 4 9 show the costs for the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes moreover table 10 gives the costs of the above processes calculated at a common oxidant concentration while fig 8 a d give the various costs as a function of the oxidant concentration as can be seen in figs 7 a b and 8 a d the electrical energy and the corresponding cost for the uvc process were very high i e in the range from approximately 27 kwh m 3 order 1 to 77 kwh m 3 order 1 and from about 4 5 m 3 order 1 to 14 m 3 order 1 respectively depending on the aqueous matrix however the addition of h2o2 or ps at various initial concentrations in the uvc h2o2 or uvc ps processes significantly decreased e eo and cost o total in all aqueous matrices studied in the present work for example as shown in table 10 in pb ph 7 0 the total cost per order was reduced from 7 72 m 3 order 1 in the uvc process to 0 134 m 3 order 1 or 0 115 m 3 order 1 in the uvc h2o2 or uvc ps process respectively at a relatively low oxidant concentration i e 0 5 mm in other words the total cost per order was reduced by approximately 58 or 67 times respectively in sww the corresponding decrease was 11 times and 21 times respectively moreover at a common oxidant concentration although the price of ps is higher than the price of h2o2 the uvc ps process was more cost efficient than the uvc h2o2 process because of the lower cost of the electrical energy in the former than in the latter process as shown in fig 8 a d at relatively low oxidant concentrations the cost o uv was higher than the cost o ox while at higher oxidant concentrations the cost o ox prevailed especially in the case of the uvc h2o2 process where higher oxidant concentrations were used according to eq 6 the e eo is inversely proportional to the rate constant k either k d or k obs as a result the change of e eo as a function of the oxidant concentration follows the opposite trend compared to the rate constant k i e the minimum value of the e eo corresponds to the maximum value of the rate constant k therefore in the uvc h2o2 process in pb ph 7 0 the minimum value of the e eo and consequently of the cost o uv corresponds at 5 0 mm h2o2 while in sww the minimum values of e eo and cost o uv can be found at 10 mm h2o2 however the cost o ox increased linearly as a function of the oxidant concentration the overall result is that in the uvc h2o2 process the total cost per order showed a minimum at 1 0 mm h2o2 in pb ph 7 0 table 4 and fig 8 a while in sww the minimum cost o total was at 2 5 mm h2o2 table 6 and fig 8 b in the uvc ps process the minimum values of the cost o total in pb ph 7 0 were at about 0 25 mm to 0 50 mm ps table 5 and fig 8 c and in sww they were at about 0 75 mm to 1 0 mm ps table 7 and fig 8 d it should be noted that for the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes the electrical energies per order found in the present work are within the range of values reported in the literature miklos et al 2018 moreover based on their energy consumption and the associated cost both processes can be characterized as cost efficient for full scale applications miklos et al 2018 however it should be noted that in an interesting recent study performed by pesqueira et al 2022 it was found that the uvc ps process has a higher environmental impact than the uvc h2o2 process mainly associated with the production of persulfate salts 4 conclusions and outlook the conclusions drawn from the present study can be summarized as follows the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation λ 254 nm was not very efficient for its degradation in aqueous solutions because of two reasons i the relatively low value of the molar absorption coefficient and ii the relatively low quantum yield consequently the electrical energy per order and the corresponding cost for the uvc process were prohibitively high the photochemical degradation of sertraline in the uvc h2o2 or uvc ps processes was significantly enhanced compared to the uvc process its degradation was exclusively due to photochemical reactions mainly between sertraline and the photo generated hydroxyl and sulfate radicals without achieving complete mineralization although sertraline had a relatively comparable reactivity towards hydroxyl and sulfate radicals the efficiency of the uvc ps process was higher than the uvc h2o2 process either in aqueous phosphate buffer solutions or in synthetic wastewaters for the uvc h2o2 process there was an optimum h2o2 concentration that depends on the aqueous matrix while for the uvc ps process the observed rate constants increased almost linearly as a function of ps concentration at least in the range of concentrations studied in the present work in the range from 6 0 to 9 0 solution ph had a relatively negligible effect on treatment performance for both processes in synthetic urine matrices although treatment efficiency decreased both processes were capable of decomposing sertraline at relatively reasonable contact times given the complexity of the synthetic aqueous matrices the uvc ps process was more cost efficient than the uvc h2o2 process according to the calculations carried out for their energy consumption and the associated cost both processes can be characterized as cost efficient for full scale applications despite the higher environmental impact of the uvc ps process the mineralization of sertraline was much slower than its photochemical degradation and consequently some rather recalcitrant tps were intermediately formed in both processes therefore further work is underway to determine the chemical structure of some tps and assess their toxicity and the results will be published elsewhere declaration of competing interest none supplementary materials supplementary material associated with this article can be found in

16040,antidepressants are released into the aquatic environment because of their incomplete removal from wastewater treatment plants in the present work we investigated the photochemical degradation of a commonly prescribed antidepressant namely sertraline in aqueous matrices the molar absorption coefficient of sertraline at 254 nm and at various ph values in the range from 4 0 to 9 0 was 444 65 l mol 1 cm 1 while the quantum yield of its direct photolysis under uvc radiation λ 254 nm was 1 7 0 1 10 2 mol einstein 1 i e both values were relatively low next we investigated the photochemical degradation of sertraline under uvc radiation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 i e uvc h2o2 or persulfate ions s2o8 2 i e uvc ps several parameters were studied such as the initial concentrations of the oxidants solution ph and the composition of the aqueous matrix experiments were carried out in aqueous phosphate buffers in synthetic wastewater as well as in synthetic fresh and hydrolyzed human urine it was found that in all aqueous matrices the photochemical degradation of sertraline followed pseudo first order kinetics the values of the observed pseudo first order rate constants in the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes were from one to three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding value in the uvc process the uvc ps process was more efficient than the uvc h2o2 process either in aqueous phosphate buffer solutions or in synthetic wastewaters despite the comparable reactivity of sertraline towards hydroxyl and sulfate radicals however both processes resulted in partial mineralization of the compound after prolonged irradiation in the uvc h2o2 process there was an optimum h2o2 concentration which depended on the aqueous matrix while in the uvc ps process there was an almost linear increase in treatment efficiency as a function of ps concentration at least in the range of concentrations studied in the present work solution ph in the range from 6 0 to 9 0 had a relatively negligible effect on treatment performance for both processes in synthetic urine matrices despite the reduction in reaction rate the observed pseudo first order rate constants were reduced by approximately one to two orders of magnitude the photochemical degradation of sertraline proceeded to a relatively satisfactory degree finally the calculations of the electrical energy per order and the associated cost showed that the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes are cost efficient and suitable for full scale applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

in the aquatic environment antidepressants have attracted considerable attention mole and brooks 2019 castillo zacarías et al 2021 antidepressants are drugs that relieve the symptoms of major depressive disorder which is a common mental illness worldwide affecting more than 15 of the population at some point in the life span debattista 2021 o donnell et al 2018 in the past decade both the economic crisis and the recent covid 19 pandemic have increased the prevalence of mental health disorders including depression frasquilho et al 2016 castillo zacarías et al 2021 cénat et al 2021 consequently antidepressants are among the most heavily prescribed pharmaceuticals and their consumption has grown substantially over the past decades in many parts of the world oecd 2019 and is expected to increase in the forthcoming years selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris are the most widely prescribed antidepressants and they act by modulating the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin sertraline its chemical structure is shown in table 1 belongs to the class of ssris and is one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressant debattista 2021 o donnell et al 2018 sertraline is administered orally and is mainly metabolized in the liver to n desmethylsertraline debattista 2021 both sertraline and n desmethylsertraline are excreted via urine to raw sewage however since sertraline exhibits high chemical stability johnson and chang 1996 lam et al 2004 it is insufficiently removed by conventional treatment methods usually employed in urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps thus discharged into the receiving aqueous bodies mole and brooks 2019 castillo zacarías et al 2021 during wastewater treatment the primary removal process of sertraline is sorption onto activated sludge followed by biodegradation albeit to a much lower extent gornik et al 2020 although the concentrations of ssris including sertraline in the aquatic environment are relatively low particular concern has been raised about their uptake and bioaccumulation in the biota silva et al 2015 mole and brooks 2019 and their possible adverse effects on non target organisms sehonova et al 2018 even at environmentally relevant concentrations ford and fong 2016 therefore it is rather imperative to find efficient treatment methods for their elimination from wwtps effluents over the past few decades several advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed to remove various pollutants including pharmaceuticals from aqueous matrices stefan 2018 aops have as a common feature the in situ generation of various reactive oxygen species in the oxidation mechanism leading to the degradation of the target pollutants to several transformation products tps stefan 2018 aops include among others ozonation heterogeneous photocatalysis fenton and photo fenton oxidation electrochemical oxidation sonochemical processes ultraviolet radiation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide sulfate radical anion based processes as well as various combinations thereof stefan 2018 table s1 in the supplementary material summarizes several recent studies conducted on the removal of sertraline from aqueous matrices employing various aops however to the best of our knowledge the photochemical degradation of sertraline under uvc radiation in the presence of h2o2 or s2o8 2 i e persulfate ions ps in aqueous matrices has not yet been studied based on the above the objective of the present work was to investigate the photochemical degradation of sertraline in aqueous matrices under uvc radiation λ 254 nm either alone i e direct photolysis or in the presence of hydrogen peroxide i e uvc h2o2 or persulfate ions i e uvc ps more specifically we studied the kinetics of the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation and we determined its quantum yield we also examined the photochemical degradation of sertraline under uvc radiation in the presence of various initial concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or persulfate ions additional parameters were studied such as solution ph and the composition of the aqueous matrix experiments were carried out in aqueous phosphate buffers in synthetic wastewater as well as in synthetic fresh and hydrolyzed human urine last but not least we calculated the electrical energy per order and the associated cost 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials sertraline in the form of hydrochloride salt cas number 79559 97 0 purity 98 0 was purchased from tokyo chemical industry tci europe belgium its chemical structure is depicted in table 1 along with some physicochemical properties all the other reagents and solvents are given in the supplementary material text s1 aqueous solutions of sertraline were prepared in five matrices namely i ultrapure water upw ii ultrapure water buffered at various ph values using 10 mm phosphate salts at various ph values thereafter denoted as pb followed by the corresponding ph value e g pb ph 7 0 iii synthetic wastewater effluent sww ph 7 5 iv synthetic fresh human urine sfu ph 6 0 and v synthetic hydrolyzed human urine shu ph 9 0 more details on the preparation of the aqueous matrices are given in the supplementary material text s2 aqueous stock solutions of sertraline at an initial concentration of approximately 10 μm were prepared daily by dissolving the appropriate amount of sertraline in 5 l of the corresponding aqueous matrix in addition in some cases aqueous solutions of sertraline were prepared at lower initial concentrations by diluting the above stock solution in all cases the exact initial concentrations of sertraline in the aqueous matrices were measured by hplc vide infra these initial concentrations although higher than those typically found in aqueous environmental matrices were chosen to allow i the assessment of process efficiency within a measurable timescale and ii the accurate determination of residual sertraline concentration with the analytical techniques employed in this work 2 2 uvc irradiation apparatus uvc radiation was provided by an 11 w low pressure mercury lamp philips tuv pl s g23 emitting predominately at 254 nm the experiments were carried out in a batch type photochemical reactor described in the supplementary material text s3 the incident photon flux on a chemical amount basis qn p divided by the volume of the photochemical reactor i e qn p v was 1 37 0 03 10 5 einstein l 1 s 1 while the effective path length of radiation l was 1 4 0 1 cm moreover the incident fluence rate was e o 9 05 0 19 mw cm 2 for each experimental run the incident uv fluence h o in j m 2 commonly called the uv dose was calculated by multiplying the incident fluence rate by the exposure time all the above measurements and calculations are described in the supplementary material text s5 2 3 photochemical degradation experiments the experiments for the direct photolysis of sertraline i e in the absence of oxidants were carried out as follows initially 500 ml of the aqueous solution of sertraline dissolved in the designated aqueous matrix and at the desired initial concentration were placed in the photochemical reactor then the uvc lamp which was switched on outside the reactor for approximately 15 min to stabilize its photon emission was placed inside the inner quartz sleeve of the reactor during irradiation the reaction mixture was continuously stirred with a magnetic stir bar and a magnetic stirrer unless otherwise stated the reaction mixture was exposed to ambient air and no further aeration took place the experiments for the photochemical degradation of sertraline in aqueous solutions under uvc radiation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or persulfate ions were conducted as described above with the addition of the appropriate amount of h2o2 or s2o8 2 in the reaction mixture more specifically a measured volume of a concentrated h2o2 solution 30 w w or the appropriate amount of solid na2s2o8 was added to the reaction mixture to achieve the desired initial concentration of the oxidants several control experiments were performed in the dark as described in the supplementary material text s6 which showed that sertraline was stable in the dark in the absence or in the presence of the oxidants in addition competition kinetics experiments were carried out to determine the second order rate constants of sertraline with hydroxyl and sulfate radicals i e k ho sertraline and k so4 sertraline respectively as described in the supplementary material text s7 to monitor the progress of the reaction periodically samples were drawn from the reactor and analyzed for the residual concentration of sertraline h2o2 s2o8 2 and total organic carbon toc as described in the supplementary material text s8 all the above experiments were replicated 2 to 4 times and the results are expressed as average value standard deviation while the error bars in the various figures correspond to the standard deviation of the replicate experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 molar absorption coefficient initially we measured the molar absorption coefficient of sertraline ε λ in l mol 1 cm 1 in the uv region of the electromagnetic spectrum in aqueous solutions and at various ph values in the range from 4 0 to 9 0 we found that the average value of the molar absorption coefficient at 254 nm was 444 65 l mol 1 cm 1 this value is relatively low since the order of magnitude of ε 254 nm for most organic pollutants has been reported to lie usually in the range from 101 to 104 l mol 1 cm 1 with an average order of magnitude at 103 l mol 1 cm 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 more details regarding the absorption spectra of sertraline are discussed in the supplementary material text s9 3 2 direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation then we studied the photochemical degradation of sertraline under uvc radiation at various initial concentrations in the range from 1 08 0 02 μm to 10 06 0 41 μm and the results are shown in fig 1 as can be seen the rate of the photochemical degradation of sertraline remained practically constant within the limits of experimental error these results indicate that at the experimental conditions employed in the present work the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation followed first order kinetics as explained in the supplementary material text s4 the rate of the photochemical degradation of sertraline at wavelength λ r λ in mol l 1 s 1 is given by the following equation zepp 1978 beltrán et al 1995 leifer 1988 1 r λ d c d t λ 2 303 q n p v l ε λ φ λ c where c is the concentration of sertraline in mol l 1 and φ λ is the quantum yield for its direct photolysis at wavelength λ dimensionless or mol einstein 1 if we set 2 k d λ 2 303 q n p v l ε λ φ λ then eq 1 can be written as 3 d c d t λ k d λ c which after integration at the boundary conditions gives the expression of the first order rate law 4 ln c c 0 k d λ t where c 0 is the initial concentration of sertraline in mol l 1 and k d λ is the first order rate constant for its direct photolysis in s 1 the inset of fig 1 shows the plot of ln c c0 as a function of time and uv fluence while table 2 shows the first order rate constants and the corresponding coefficients of determination r2 τhe quantum yield for the direct photolysis of sertraline was determined using eq 2 after solving for φ λ zepp 1978 5 φ λ k d λ 2 303 q n p v l ε λ by substituting we obtained the values given in table 2 as can be seen the quantum yield was in the range from 1 6 0 1 10 2 mol einstein 1 to 1 7 0 3 10 2 mol einstein 1 while the average value was 1 7 0 1 10 2 mol einstein 1 this value is relatively low to moderate since the quantum yields at 254 nm for most organic pollutants have been usually reported to vary between 1 3 10 5 and 1 25 mol einstein 1 with an average value of 0 129 mol einstein 1 wols and hofman caris 2012 these findings indicate that the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation was not a very efficient process for its degradation in aqueous solutions a more detailed discussion of the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation is given in the supplementary material text s10 3 3 photochemical degradation of sertraline in the uvc h2o2 and the uvc ps processes 3 3 1 uvc h2o2 versus uvc ps next we carried out additional experiments under uvc radiation in the presence of h2o2 or ps these experiments were performed in aqueous buffer solutions containing phosphate salts at a concentration of 10 mm and ph 7 0 pb ph 7 0 and at various initial h2o2 concentrations in the range from 0 10 mm to 15 mm i e the ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 was in the range from approximately 10 to 1500 or ps in the range from 0 050 mm to 1 0 mm i e the ratio ps 0 sertraline 0 was in the range from approximately 5 to 100 we chose this range of concentrations because the molar absorption coefficients of both oxidants at 254 nm are very low i e ε h2o2 18 5 l mol 1 cm 1 and ε s2o8 2 20 22 l mol 1 cm 1 stefan 2018 consequently to generate a sufficiently high concentration of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals the concentration of both oxidants should be relatively high usually in the order of mm stefan 2018 as shown in fig 2 a and b for both processes the photochemical degradation of sertraline was fast enough throughout the whole range of the oxidant concentrations for example at the lowest oxidant concentration i e 0 10 mm for h2o2 or 0 050 mm for ps the photochemical degradation of sertraline was over 90 i e degradation by one order of magnitude after 7 min irradiation on the other hand at the highest oxidant concentration i e 15 mm for h2o2 or 1 0 mm for ps the corresponding degradation of sertraline i e above 90 was achieved after 40 s or 20 s irradiation in the uvc h2o2 or the uvc ps process respectively the incident uv fluence i e uv dose required to achieve over 90 degradation at the lowest oxidant concentration was approximately 380 j m 2 for both processes and it was reduced to about 36 j m 2 or 18 j m 2 at the highest oxidant concentration in the uvc h2o2 or the uvc ps process respectively moreover as discussed in the supplementary material text s6 control experiments performed in the dark showed that sertraline was stable in the presence of h2o2 or ps in the whole range of the oxidant concentrations studied in the present work therefore we conclude that the degradation of sertraline observed in fig 2 a and b is attributed solely to photochemical reactions the photochemical degradation of sertraline in the uvc h2o2 and the uvc ps process was due to i the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation i e reaction r1 in table 3 albeit with relatively low quantum yield as discussed in section 3 2 and ii to the photochemical formation of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals according to reactions r2 and r3 in table 3 and their subsequent reaction with sertraline to form various tps according to reactions r4 and r5 in table 3 in the uvc ps process in alkaline media reaction r13 takes place however its contribution becomes significant at ph values higher than 9 stefan 2018 fig s18 a in the supplementary material shows the photochemical degradation of sertraline in both processes at the three common oxidant concentrations studied in the present work namely at 0 10 mm 0 50 mm and 1 0 mm as can be seen in all cases at a common oxidant dose the photochemical degradation of sertraline was more efficient in the uvc ps process than in the uvc h2o2 process as discussed in the supplementary material text s11 in the uvc h2o2 process after 90 min irradiation which corresponds to a uv dose of approximately 4900 j m 2 the toc concentration decreased by about 36 while the corresponding decrease in the uvc ps process was approximately 62 these results indicate that the photochemical degradation of sertraline in both processes leads to partial mineralization of the compound albeit after prolonged irradiation moreover it is further confirmed that the uvc ps process was more efficient than the uvc h2o2 process especially if we take into account that the initial concentration of the oxidant was lower in the uvc ps process furthermore we conclude that the mineralization of sertraline was much slower than its photochemical degradation and therefore some rather recalcitrant tps were intermediately formed in both processes 3 3 2 kinetic analysis as shown in fig 2 a and b for each experimental run in both processes the concentration of sertraline decreased exponentially over time in other words it appears that the photochemical degradation of sertraline follows pseudo first order kinetics figs s19 a s19 b and s20 in the supplementary material show the plots of ln c c0 as a function of time and uv fluence as can be seen each set of data points lay along a straight line the slopes of the straight lines give the observed pseudo first order rate constants at 254 nm k obs in s 1 and m2 j 1 which are shown in tables 4 and 5 along with the corresponding coefficients of determination r2 it should be noted that the coefficients of determination were in most cases higher than 0 98 or 0 99 thus confirming the relatively good fitting of the experimental data to the pseudo first order kinetic model the values of the k obs are from one to three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding value of the direct photolysis k d thus showing that the photochemical degradation of sertraline was significantly enhanced especially in the uvc ps process in order to compare the reactivity of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals towards sertraline we determined the second order rate constants by the competition kinetics methodology as described in the supplementary material text s7 as can be seen in table 3 the second order rate constants between sertraline and hydroxyl or sulfate radicals were k ho sertraline 5 5 0 6 109 l mol 1 s 1 or k so4 sertraline 4 9 0 3 109 l mol 1 s 1 respectively thus showing that sertraline has a rather comparable reactivity towards hydroxyl and sulfate radicals however the higher efficiency of the uvc ps process can be attributed to the following reasons i to the higher quantum yield for the photolysis of ps at 254 nm i e φs2o82 1 4 than the corresponding quantum yield for the photolysis of h2o2 at 254 nm i e φh2o2 1 0 stefan 2018 thus leading to higher production of sulfate radicals ii to the longer lifetime of sulfate radicals t1 2 30 40 μs compared to hydroxyl radicals t1 2 1 μs thus allowing better diffusion of sulfate radicals from the generation site to the bulk of the solution and its subsequent reaction with the target pollutants zhang et al 2016 oh et al 2016 and iii to the lower scavenging effect of so4 by s2o8 2 in the uvc ps process i e reaction r10 in table 3 vide infra compared to the corresponding scavenging effect of ho by h2o2 in the uvc h2o2 process i e reaction r6 in table 3 stefan 2018 all the above reasons contribute to making the uvc ps process more efficient than the uvc h2o2 process for the photochemical degradation of sertraline 3 3 3 effect of oxidant concentration in aqueous buffer solutions the observed pseudo first order rate constants were plotted as a function of the initial oxidant concentrations and the molar ratios oxidant 0 sertraline 0 αs can be seen in the insets of fig 3 a and b and in fig 4 a and b for both processes at relatively low oxidant concentrations i e lower than 1 0 mm or when the ratio oxidant 0 sertraline 0 was lower than approximately 100 the observed rate constants increased almost linearly as a function of the oxidant concentrations this happens because at low oxidant concentrations the increase of the oxidant concentration increased the concentration of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals thus improving the efficiency of both processes on the other hand as shown in fig 3 a and b for the uvc h2o2 process at relatively high h2o2 0 i e higher than 1 0 mm or when the ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 was higher than approximately 100 the values of the k obs as a function of h2o2 0 deviated from linearity when h2o2 0 increased from 1 0 mm to 5 0 mm i e when the ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 increased from approximately 100 to 500 the observed rate constants increased however further increase of h2o2 0 from 5 0 mm to 10 mm and then to 15 mm and consequently increase of the ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 from approximately 500 to 1000 and then to 1500 decreased the observed rate constants therefore there is an optimum h2o2 0 and hence an optimum ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 above which further increase of the concentration of h2o2 does not further improve the efficiency of the process several parameters have been reported to affect the optimum h2o2 concentration including lamp type and power reactor design and geometry pollutant reactivity towards hydroxyl radicals pollutant treatment level and aqueous matrix composition among others stefan 2018 the above results can be explained by taking into account reactions r6 r7 r8 r10 and r11 in table 3 at relatively high h2o2 concentrations the excess h2o2 consumes hydroxyl radicals thus acting as a hydroxyl radical scavenger as shown in reaction r6 while ho2 is less reactive than ho towards organic pollutants stefan 2018 there is some controversy regarding the rate constant of the reaction between so4 and s2o8 2 i e reaction r10 and several values have been reported in the order of 105 l mol 1 s 1 to 104 l mol 1 s 1 or even lower mcelroy and waygood 1990 jiang et al 1992 bao and barker 1996 buxton et al 1999 ivanov et al 2000 yu et al 2004 stefan 2018 this controversy might have arisen from the finding that the rate constant depends on solution ph among other factors yu et al 2004 however there is a consensus yu et al 2004 stefan 2018 that this rate constant is relatively low i e at least two orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding rate constant of the reaction between ho and h2o2 i e reaction r6 therefore the scavenging effect of so4 by s2o8 2 in the uvc ps process is less significant than the scavenging effect of ho by h2o2 in the uvc h2o2 process an additional factor that might contribute to the above behavior is that the self recombination reaction of hydroxyl radicals i e reaction r8 has a much higher rate constant than the corresponding self recombination reaction of sulfate radicals i e reaction r11 consequently in the uvc h2o2 process an optimum h2o2 concentration or an optimum ratio h2o2 0 sertraline 0 was observed above which process efficiency did not increase further on the other hand in the uvc ps process there was an almost linear increase in treatment efficiency as a function of ps concentration at least in the range of concentrations studied in the present work it should be noted that in the uvc ps process we were unable to carry out experiments at relatively high ps concentrations i e higher than 1 0 mm because the degradation of sertraline was completed in just a few seconds and therefore it was difficult to take samples from the reactor in such short contact times similar results have been found for the degradation of various organic pollutants including pharmaceuticals in the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes gao et al 2012 olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 tan et al 2013 matzek and carter 2016 zhang et al 2016 ao and liu 2017 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 stefan 2018 moreover in the uvc ps process in some studies it has been found that at relatively high ps concentration the rate constants for the degradation of the target pollutants increased albeit non linearly or even reached a plateau hori et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 however we could not observe such behavior due to the relatively low ps concentrations employed in the present work 3 3 4 effect of oxidant concentration in sww then we carried out additional experiments in sww in the presence of various initial oxidant concentrations and the results are depicted in fig 5 a and b as can be seen for both processes the photochemical degradation of sertraline followed once again pseudo first order kinetics figs s21 a s21 b and s22 in the supplementary material show the plots of ln c c0 as a function of time and uv fluence while tables 6 and 7 show the observed pseudo first order rate constants along with the corresponding coefficients of determination r2 moreover figs 3 a b 4 a and b show the k obs as a function of the initial oxidant concentrations and the molar ratios oxidant 0 sertraline 0 as shown the photochemical degradation of sertraline was slower in sww than in aqueous phosphate buffers at ph 7 0 this is due to the various organic and inorganic components dissolved in sww which consumed part of the photogenerated hydroxyl and sulfate radicals thus decreasing reaction rate additionally as shown in fig s18 b in the supplementary material the uvc ps process was once again more efficient than the uvc h2o2 process furthermore as shown in the insets of fig 3 a and b and in fig 4 a and b in sww as shown previously for pb ph 7 0 for both processes at relatively low oxidant concentrations i e lower than 1 0 mm for ps or lower than 2 5 mm for h2o2 the observed rate constants increased almost linearly as a function of the oxidant concentration in the uvc h2o2 process the slope of the equation giving k obs as a function of the oxidant concentration decreased by approximately 4 2 times in sww compared to pb while the corresponding decrease of the slope in the uvc ps process was about 6 7 times these results indicate that sulfate radicals are more susceptible to scavenging from the various organic and inorganic components dissolved in sww than hydroxyl radicals in other words the uvc ps process is more sensitive towards the constituents of the aqueous matrix than the uv h2o2 process miklos et al 2018 we can hypothesize that this behavior can be explained by taking into account the reaction rate constants of the various scavenging species with hydroxyl and sulfate radicals however since we have not determined these rate constants our hypothesis was not tested further nevertheless in sww as in pb ph 7 the uvc ps process remained more efficient than the uvc h2o2 process moreover as shown in fig 5 a and b and table 6 in the uvc h2o2 process the observed rate constant increased when increasing h2o2 concentration from 2 5 mm to 10 mm while treatment efficiency reached a plateau when h2o2 concentration was further increased from 10 mm to 15 mm therefore it appears that the optimum h2o2 concentration in sww was approximately 10 mm this optimum h2o2 concentration in sww is higher than the corresponding optimum concentration in pb ph 7 since as mentioned in the previous section the optimum h2o2 concentration depends on the composition of the aqueous matrix among other factors stefan 2018 consequently all further experiments in the uvc h2o2 process were carried out at 10 mm h2o2 in the uvc ps process all subsequent experiments were conducted at 0 5 mm ps in order to be able to monitor the progress of the reaction at a reasonable time scale especially in those cases where the reaction is completed at relatively short contact times 3 3 5 effect of solution ph and aqueous matrix composition in further experiments we studied the effect of solution ph in both processes the experiments were carried out at various ph values ranging from 6 0 to 9 0 and the results are shown in fig 6 a and b moreover figs s23 and s24 in the supplementary material show the plots of ln c c0 as a function of time and uv fluence whereas tables 8 and 9 show the values of the observed pseudo first order rate constants and the corresponding coefficients of determination as shown in the uvc h2o2 process the k obs values slightly decreased at acidic and alkaline ph compared to the corresponding values at neutral ph in the uvc ps process higher k obs values were observed at acidic ph and slightly decreased as the solution ph increased to neutral and then to alkaline however for both processes the differences in the values of the k obs were relatively small and can therefore be considered practically negligible the effect of solution ph is discussed further in the supplementary material text s12 next in order to investigate the effect of the aqueous matrix composition we performed additional experiments in synthetic urine matrices i e sfu and shu human urine can be collected using no mix toilets i e urine diverting toilets or urinals and is a particularly interesting aqueous matrix that has been extensively studied in recent years for nutrient recovery and pharmaceutical degradation randall and naidoo 2018 boyer and saetta 2019 accordingly the photochemical degradation of sertraline was studied in sfu and shu for both processes and the results are shown in figs 6 a b s23 and s24 as well as in tables 8 and 9 as can be seen a significant reduction was observed in the efficiency of both processes more specifically in the uvc h2o2 process fig 6 a k obs was reduced by approximately 1 15 log and 1 77 log in sfu and shu respectively compared to the experiments carried out in pb at the same ph values in both matrices in the uvc ps process fig 6 b k obs was reduced by approximately 2 log i e reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude in sfu the reduction in the efficiency of both processes was probably due to the competing reactions of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals with citrate and urea which are the main organic components in this matrix table s3 in the supplementary material ιn shu bicarbonate and ammonia were probably the main chemical species responsible for scavenging hydroxyl and sulfate radicals in contrast the corresponding radicals formed in the reactions between hydroxyl and sulfate radicals with bicarbonate and ammonia i e carbonate radicals and various reactive nitrogen species such as nh2 no2 and no among others were generally less reactive towards organic pollutants zhang et al 2015 however despite the reduction in reaction rate in all synthetic aqueous matrices the photochemical degradation of sertraline proceeded to a relatively satisfactory degree 3 4 electrical energy per order and economic evaluation in the last part of our work we compared the techniques employed in the present work based on their energy efficiency and the associated cost therefore we calculated the electrical energy per order e eo which is a figure of merit frequently used to compare and evaluate various aops bolton et al 2001 miklos et al 2018 e eo is the electric energy in kilowatt hours kwh required to degrade the target pollutant by one order of magnitude i e degradation by 90 in a unit volume of contaminated water i e 1 m3 for a batch operation e eo is defined according to the following equation bolton et al 2001 6 e eo 1000 p t v log c i c f where p is the output power of the uvc lamp in kw v is the volume of the photochemical reactor in l t is treatment time in h while ci and cf are the initial and final concentrations of the target pollutant after 90 degradation respectively in mol l 1 the equation is multiplied by 1000 to convert l 1 to m 3 the electrical energy per order was calculated as described in text s13 in the supplementary material while the obtained values are given in tables 2 and s9 for the uvc process and in tables 4 9 for the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes moreover fig 7 a and b shows the plot of e eo as a function of the oxidant dose in the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes in pb ph 7 0 and sww in addition we calculated the total cost per order cost o total in m 3 order 1 which is defined as the total cost required to degrade the target pollutant by one order of magnitude in 1 m3 of polluted water cost o total was calculated using the following equations khan et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 7 c o s t o t o t a l c o s t o u v c o s t o o x 8 c o s t o u v 1 45 e e o e l e c t r i c i t y c o s t 9 cos t o ox 1000 oxidant price log c i c f where cost o uv in m 3 order 1 is the electrical energy per order cost calculated as shown in eq 8 by multiplying the electrical energy per order with the electricity cost and taking into account an additional cost of 45 of the total electricity cost as maintenance cost for a real application of a uv system khan et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 and cost o ox in m 3 order 1 is the oxidants cost calculated as shown in eq 9 by multiplying the concentration of the oxidant oxidant in mol l 1 with the commercial price of the oxidant in mol 1 the term log ci cf in the denominator of eq 9 was introduced for dimensional consistency in order to express the units of cost o ox as euros per cubic meter per order of magnitude i e m 3 order 1 more details regarding the electricity cost and the commercial prices of the oxidants are given in the supplementary material text s13 the costs calculated using the above procedure for the uvc process are given in tables 2 and s9 while tables 4 9 show the costs for the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes moreover table 10 gives the costs of the above processes calculated at a common oxidant concentration while fig 8 a d give the various costs as a function of the oxidant concentration as can be seen in figs 7 a b and 8 a d the electrical energy and the corresponding cost for the uvc process were very high i e in the range from approximately 27 kwh m 3 order 1 to 77 kwh m 3 order 1 and from about 4 5 m 3 order 1 to 14 m 3 order 1 respectively depending on the aqueous matrix however the addition of h2o2 or ps at various initial concentrations in the uvc h2o2 or uvc ps processes significantly decreased e eo and cost o total in all aqueous matrices studied in the present work for example as shown in table 10 in pb ph 7 0 the total cost per order was reduced from 7 72 m 3 order 1 in the uvc process to 0 134 m 3 order 1 or 0 115 m 3 order 1 in the uvc h2o2 or uvc ps process respectively at a relatively low oxidant concentration i e 0 5 mm in other words the total cost per order was reduced by approximately 58 or 67 times respectively in sww the corresponding decrease was 11 times and 21 times respectively moreover at a common oxidant concentration although the price of ps is higher than the price of h2o2 the uvc ps process was more cost efficient than the uvc h2o2 process because of the lower cost of the electrical energy in the former than in the latter process as shown in fig 8 a d at relatively low oxidant concentrations the cost o uv was higher than the cost o ox while at higher oxidant concentrations the cost o ox prevailed especially in the case of the uvc h2o2 process where higher oxidant concentrations were used according to eq 6 the e eo is inversely proportional to the rate constant k either k d or k obs as a result the change of e eo as a function of the oxidant concentration follows the opposite trend compared to the rate constant k i e the minimum value of the e eo corresponds to the maximum value of the rate constant k therefore in the uvc h2o2 process in pb ph 7 0 the minimum value of the e eo and consequently of the cost o uv corresponds at 5 0 mm h2o2 while in sww the minimum values of e eo and cost o uv can be found at 10 mm h2o2 however the cost o ox increased linearly as a function of the oxidant concentration the overall result is that in the uvc h2o2 process the total cost per order showed a minimum at 1 0 mm h2o2 in pb ph 7 0 table 4 and fig 8 a while in sww the minimum cost o total was at 2 5 mm h2o2 table 6 and fig 8 b in the uvc ps process the minimum values of the cost o total in pb ph 7 0 were at about 0 25 mm to 0 50 mm ps table 5 and fig 8 c and in sww they were at about 0 75 mm to 1 0 mm ps table 7 and fig 8 d it should be noted that for the uvc h2o2 and uvc ps processes the electrical energies per order found in the present work are within the range of values reported in the literature miklos et al 2018 moreover based on their energy consumption and the associated cost both processes can be characterized as cost efficient for full scale applications miklos et al 2018 however it should be noted that in an interesting recent study performed by pesqueira et al 2022 it was found that the uvc ps process has a higher environmental impact than the uvc h2o2 process mainly associated with the production of persulfate salts 4 conclusions and outlook the conclusions drawn from the present study can be summarized as follows the direct photolysis of sertraline under uvc radiation λ 254 nm was not very efficient for its degradation in aqueous solutions because of two reasons i the relatively low value of the molar absorption coefficient and ii the relatively low quantum yield consequently the electrical energy per order and the corresponding cost for the uvc process were prohibitively high the photochemical degradation of sertraline in the uvc h2o2 or uvc ps processes was significantly enhanced compared to the uvc process its degradation was exclusively due to photochemical reactions mainly between sertraline and the photo generated hydroxyl and sulfate radicals without achieving complete mineralization although sertraline had a relatively comparable reactivity towards hydroxyl and sulfate radicals the efficiency of the uvc ps process was higher than the uvc h2o2 process either in aqueous phosphate buffer solutions or in synthetic wastewaters for the uvc h2o2 process there was an optimum h2o2 concentration that depends on the aqueous matrix while for the uvc ps process the observed rate constants increased almost linearly as a function of ps concentration at least in the range of concentrations studied in the present work in the range from 6 0 to 9 0 solution ph had a relatively negligible effect on treatment performance for both processes in synthetic urine matrices although treatment efficiency decreased both processes were capable of decomposing sertraline at relatively reasonable contact times given the complexity of the synthetic aqueous matrices the uvc ps process was more cost efficient than the uvc h2o2 process according to the calculations carried out for their energy consumption and the associated cost both processes can be characterized as cost efficient for full scale applications despite the higher environmental impact of the uvc ps process the mineralization of sertraline was much slower than its photochemical degradation and consequently some rather recalcitrant tps were intermediately formed in both processes therefore further work is underway to determine the chemical structure of some tps and assess their toxicity and the results will be published elsewhere declaration of competing interest none supplementary materials supplementary material associated with this article can be found in

16041,microplastic fibers mfs as the most frequently detected microplastic shape in sewage sludge have posed emerging concern for sludge treatment and disposal however the effect of mfs on antibiotic resistance genes args especially extracellular args eargs during sludge treatment remains far from explicit therefore this study investigated the potential impact of mfs on eargs during sludge anaerobic digestion ad a commonly used sludge treatment method through long term operation the qpcr results showed that both absolute and relative abundances of eargs increased with the mfs exposure during sludge ad the average absolute and relative abundances of eight tested eargs in the ad reactor with the highest mfs dosage 170 items gts were 1 70 and 2 15 times higher than those in the control ad reactor the metagenomics results further comfirmed the increase of eargs abundance during sludge anaerobic digestion after mfs exposure and the enhancement did not show significant selectivity the identification of the potential hosts of eargs suggested the host numbers of eargs also increased with mfs exposure which may suggest enhanced horizonal transformation as a result of increased eargs further exploring the mechansims showed that the genes involved in type iv secretion system was upregulated after mfs exposure suggesting the active release of eargs was enhanced with mfs exposure in contrast the mfs may not affect the passive release of eargs as its impact on cell membrance damage was insignificant the enhanced eargs in sludge ad process may further accelerate the transport of args in environment which should be considered during sludge treatment and disposal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic fibers polyethylene terephthalate antibiotic resistance genes sludge anaerobic digestion type iv secretion system 1 introduction microplastics is an emerging contaminant as it may pose adverse impacts on microorganisms plants animals and human health prata et al 2020 sun et al 2021 the wastewater treatment plant wwtp collecting and treating wastewater generated from daily life and industries is considered as an important pathway for microplastics being discharged to the environment and has received great concern recently liu et al 2019 ni et al 2020b zhang and chen 2020 among different microplastics in wwtp the microplastic fibers mfs is the most frequently detected shape sun et al 2019 mfs in wastewater were mainly originated from wearing of clothing and textile during the laundry events hartline et al 2016 de falco et al 2018 estimated that mfs released from a typical 5 kg wash load of polyester fabrics could be over 6 106 items additionally wastewater discharged from textile industries also contained considerable amount of mfs with the concentration as high as 5 4 104 items l zhou et al 2020 as a result the ratio of mfs in the wwtp influent was reported to be 52 7 in average sun et al 2019 and could even reach over 80 in some cases lares et al 2018 xu et al 2019 however after a series of treatment processes in wwtps most of the mfs were retained in sewage sludge among which polyethylene terephthalate pet mfs was usually dominant he et al 2021 li et al 2018 petroody et al 2021 for instance lares et al 2018 found that the average concentration of mfs in sewage sludge could varied between 21 7 4 6 and 161 0 25 5 items g total solid ts among which the proportion of pet was over 80 thus attentions should be paid to the effect of mfs especially pet mfs on sludge treatment and final disposal in aspect to the final disposal of sewage sludge land application is regarded as one of the widely used methods with the advantages of organic and inorganic nutrients reuse sharma et al 2017 however due to the overuse and improper disposal of antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes args could be accumulated in the sewage sludge naquin et al 2015 the accumulated args may cause the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb which leads to the ineffectiveness of antibiotics and finally poses a risk to public health like pathogenic bacterial infections bin zaman et al 2017 ezugworie et al 2021 therefore investigations on the args variation during the sludge treatment processes before land application arose syafiuddin and boopathy 2021 the anaerobic digestion ad is a frequently used sludge treatment method which could achieve energy recovery together with sludge reduction and stabilization abelleira pereira et al 2015 liu et al 2021 thus with the accumulation of mfs in sewage sludge the impact of mfs on the dissemination of args during ad process is worthy to explore the args in the environment could be classified into two types i e intracellular args iargs and extracellular args eargs the iargs may promote antibiotic resistant bacteria dissemination via cell to cell contact while eargs could be assimilated by the competent bacteria via natural transformation leading to the elevated abundance of arb finally causing new antibiotic resistant infections and health problems dong et al 2019 sivalingam et al 2020 for example the elevated abundance of arb could accelerate the transmission of the environmental resistome to humans and more than 700 000 people die from arb infections worldwide every year o neill 2015 the long persistence and low decay rate of eargs were also found zhang et al 2018 indicating the non negligible importance of eargs for now most of the research on effect of microplastics on args in ad focus on iargs or total args zhang et al 2021 from the best of our knowledge the influence of mfs on eargs in ad process has never been reported before since pet mfs are the main microplastics in sewage sludge it is of great significance to reveal and control its effects on eargs during ad of sewage sludge it is generally accepted that eargs are encoded in extracellular dna edna and the source of edna can be mainly divided into passive release and active release from the perspective of secretion mechanism pietramellara et al 2009 passive release of edna occurs as a result of cell death caused by environmental factors such as antimicrobial agents ibanez de aldecoa et al 2017 in addition microorganisms are able to produce edna actively through the type iv secretion system t4ss ibanez de aldecoa et al 2017 for example n gonorrhoeae could secret chromosomal dna to the extracellular environment by t4ss hamilton et al 2005 salgado pabon et al 2007 besides edna could also be active released with the help of vesicles in specific microorganisms grande et al 2015 it has been reported that edna could be actively released via membrane vesicles in streptococcus mutans liao et al 2014 microplastics may cause cell lysis and may also change the metabolic pathway and community structure of microorganisms seeley et al 2020 which may affect the release of eargs therefore scientifically it is important to clarify the release mechanism of eargs with mfs exposure this study aimed to reveal the changes in eargs caused by mfs in sewage sludge during ad process and the associated mechanisms with such changes in view of this three objectives were pursued 1 the abundance and variation of eargs in ad process with the existence of pet mfs 2 the identification of potential hosts of eargs in ad sludges and the possible variation according to pet mfs exposure 3 the mechanisms responsible for the influence of pet mfs on the release of eargs in ad process this work will help us to expand the theoretical understanding of pet mfs on eargs variance during ad process and guide the control and management of eargs in practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of sludge and pet mfs four ad reactors were set up to investigate the influence of pet mfs on eargs and the specific operation paraments were shown in section 2 2 two kinds of sludges were used in ad reactors named as feeding sludge and inoculated sludge the feeding sludge as the substrate of the ad system was the sewage sludge collected from the secondary sedimentation tank at a municipal wwtp in shanghai china the main characteristics of feeding sludge were as follows ph 6 7 0 1 total solids ts 30 7 0 1 g l volatile solids vs 16 9 0 1 g l total organic carbon toc 91 1 3 2 mg l the feeding sludge was stored at 4 c before experiments to reduce the biotransformation the inoculated sludge for ad reactors was obtained from a semi continuous anaerobic digester with the sludge retention time srt of 20 days in the same wwtp as mentioned above the main characteristics of the inoculated sludge were as follows ph 6 9 0 1 ts 33 1 0 1 g l vs 14 6 0 1 g l toc 36 2 1 8 mg l the inoculated sludge was used within 24 h after been collected from the anaerobic digester the feeding and inoculated sludge used in this study were filtered by a stainless screen with the mesh size of 300 μm before ad experiments the pet mfs used in this study were purchased from a fiber factory in hunan china and were cut into approximately 3 mm in length by scalpel 2 2 anaerobic digestion reactor setup and sampling serum bottles with a total volume of 1100 ml were used as ad rectors and according to lares et al 2018 the pet mfs levels of the sewage sludge were set at 0 20 70 and 170 items gts named as r0 ra rb and rc respectively at the beginning 600 ml inoculum and 100 ml sewage sludge with the corresponding numbers of pet mfs were added into the bottles leaving 400 ml headspace then the headspace of all serum bottles was flushed with nitrogen for 5 min to remove oxygen finally the bottles were capped with rubber stoppers with aluminum crimp caps and placed in a shaker of 150 rpm at 35 1 c the ad reactors were operated semi continously every three days the contents of methane yielded in each reactor were detected and then 100 ml of mixed sludge were discharged followed by another 100 ml of sewage sludge with corresponding pet mfs concentration were added into the corresponding reactors respectively to keep the working volume consistent in 700 ml and the srt stable at 21 days finally the reactors were flushed with nitrogen resealed and placed in shaker again the whole experiments were lasted for three srts and the mixed sludge in the reactors were sampled for later dna extraction at day 63 while the other experiments were also carried out around day 63 2 3 extraction of edna and intracellular dna idna dna extraction was based on previous studies with minor modification dong et al 2019 mao et al 2014 for edna extraction 12 0 ml of 0 12 mol l sodium phosphate buffer ph 8 0 and 0 8 g polyvinyl polypyrrolidone pvpp were added into 4 0 g wet weight sludge samples and shaken at 250 rpm for 10 min at 25 c then the mixture was centrifuged 10 000 rpm 4 c 10 min and the supernatant was filtered through a sterile membrane another 12 0 ml 0 12 mol l sodium phosphate buffer ph 8 0 was add into the pellets for washing followed by the same mixing centrifugation and filtration procedure the washing procedure were repeated for two times all the filtrated supernatant fractions were collected combined and stored on ice until subsequent edna extraction and the pellets were also collected and stored for idna extraction the edna in the filtrates was collected with precipitation method eichmiller et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 briefly 20 00 ml of absolute ethanol and 0 91 ml of 3 mol l sodium acetate were added to 9 09 ml of filtrate sample and the mixed solution was stored at 20 c overnight the precipitates were obtained by centrifuging at 10000 g at 4 c for 10 min and further discarding supernatants for idna extraction the pellets after centrifuging and supernatants removal were collected and were dried by freezer dryer sciznte china along with the edna precipitates mentioned above dna samples from edna and idna pellets were extracted using a tiannamp soil dna kit tiangen china according to the manufacturer s instruction the same dna extraction process in each reactor were repeated three times to get enough dna samples for later analysis the purity concentration and integrity of dna extractions were detected by nano drop 2000 and gel electrophoresis analysis the dna samples were stored at 80 c before quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr detection high throughput sequencing analysis and metagenomics analysis 2 4 qpcr analysis of args in order to figure out the influence of pet mfs on eargs in ad process eight frequently detected eargs i e suli sulii tetg erea ermf mexf tetm and tets in r0 ra rb rc were quantified via qpcr besides 16s rrna gene of bacteria and archaea in every reactor were also detected by qpcr for the calculation of relative 16s rrna gene abundance primers of args and 16s rrna gene used in this study were listed in support information si table s1 the qpcr reactions were performed via a steponeplus qpcr system wcgene biotech inc shanghai china in triplicate briefly the reaction mixture 10 μl contained 5 μl tb green premix ex taq ii 2 takara japan 3 μl ddh2o 1 μl dna sample 0 4 μl primer f 0 4 μl primer r and 0 2 μl rox reference dye 50 amplification was performed as follows 30 s at 95 c and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 5 s then annealing at 60 c for 30 s a final melt curve was then generated with temperature ranging from 60 c to 95 c to determine the specific amplification the qpcr amplification efficiencies were in the range of 85 to 105 with the correlation co efficiency over 0 99 the absolute abundances of the targeted genes were presented as gene copy numbers per gram sludge of dry weight and the relative abundance of the targeted genes were presented as gene copy numbers per 16s rrna gene 2 5 metagenomics analysis for the purpose to evaluate the change of eargs and functional genes associated with dna secretion and other process metagenomics analysis were implied among both edna and idna of the control group r0 and the highest mfs dosing group rc after edna and idna were extracted using the method described in section 2 3 illumina shotgun dna library and sequencing were constructed on illumina hiseq6000 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china low quality reads length 50 bp or with a quality value 20 or were potential duplicated reads from amplification artefacts were removed by sickle http github com najoshi sickle the final clean reads in edna and idna of r0 and rc were 51 335 192 49 399 362 49 399 362 and 53 937 288 respectively after quality filtering the cleaned reads were assembled into contigs and the genes were predicted then the non redundant gene sets were construction and taxonomic and functional annotation were conducted the details about metagenomic data processing were summarized in text s1 si sequence data associated with these samples have been deposited in the ncbi short read archive database accession number prjna757556 reads per kilo base pairs per million reads rpkm was calculated for each gene abundance 2 6 live dead detection ros measurement and ldh analysis because the passive release of edna was the results of cell lysis or death therefore the viability of bacterial cells in r0 and rc was determined using the live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 to reveal the effects of pet mfs on passive release the viability kit involves two nucleic acid stains namely green fluorescent syto 9 and red fluorescent propidium iodide pi the syto 9 could label all cells while pi could only penetrate cells with damaged membrane and resulted in a reduction in the syto 9 stain fluorescence yan et al 2020 as a result the viable cells are stained green whereas the dead cells are stained red the staining of cells was conducted based on protocols provided by the manufacturer and detailed procedures were shown in si text s2 except for live dead staining reactive oxygen species ros could be generated under anaerobic conditions with the existence of microplastics which would result in the loss of cell viability and cause cell death bhattacharya et al 2010 as pet mfs is the common microplastics in ad process the intracellular reactive oxygen species ros production in r0 and rc was measured according to limbach et al 2007 briefly anaerobic sludge was suspended in phosphate buffer with 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate h2dcfda molecular probes eugene usa which can be oxidized to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein dcf by ros fluorescence of dcf would be detected by a fluorescence spectroscopy thermo electron vantaa finland and the value of fluorescence strength is positively correlated with the ros concentration the detailed ros detection were shown in si text s3 besides lactate dehydrogenase ldh can be released into the extracellular matrix while the cell membrane is severely damaged as a result the abundance of extracellular ldh could be used to estimate the integrity of cell membranes zheng et al 2017 because the integrity of cell membrane could be used to indicate the viability of cells the relative abundance of extracellular ldh in r0 and rc were measured simultaneously by ldh assay kit beyotime biotechnology c0016 according to the protocol 2 7 pma qpcr and high throughput sequencing analysis pma qpcr analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of pet mfs on the abundance of viable microorganisms in r0 and rc as pma can selectively enter dead cells and inhibit the dna amplification during subsequent qpcr as a result only abundance of genes in living cells will be quantified ni et al 2020a pma qpcr treatment and the detection of 16s rrna gene among living cells were introduced in si text s4 the high throughput sequencing analysis was conducted on the pma treated sludges in r0 and rc respectively the aim is to evaluate the changes in microbial communities in viable microorganisms as well as identify the dominant microorganisms at the same time the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using primer 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 by thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa caporaso et al 2011 the qpcr operations of high throughput sequencing analysis were shown in si text s5 and the qpcr products was pooled in equimolar and paired end sequenced 2 300 on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa operated by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 2 8 other analytical methods and statistic analysis ts vs toc were analyzed according to standard methods apha 2012 methane was detected by a gas chromatograph gc sp6890 shandong lunan ruihong chemical instrument co ltd china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd the predicted genes by metagenomics were simultaneously searched against ncbi nr databases and the card database to get the eargs and their potential hosts and the network visualization was conducted on the platform of gephi v 0 9 2 one way analysis of variance anova and the p value 0 05 was considered to be significantly different in triplicate experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of eargs abundance with mfs exposure revealed by qpcr before the args analysis the four ad reactors i e r0 ra mfs 20 items gts rb mfs 70 items gts rc mfs 170 items gts were operated for 3 srts to ensure that a pseudo steady state were reached and the methane production were monitored during the operation fig s1 presented the average methane productions of the four reactors in each operational cycle as well as the specific methane productions during the third srt operation overall the methane production in each reactor was stable despite of some slight fluctuations in addition the similar average methane production in four reactors 5 25 0 39 mmol gvs in r0 5 43 0 37 mmol gvs in ra 5 24 0 39 mmol gvs in rb and 5 31 0 41 mmol gvs in rc respectively suggested that the methane production from sewage sludge anaerobic digestion would not interfered by the addition of mfs in long term operation fig 1 a compared the absolute abundances of eight tested eargs in four ad reactors at the pseudo steady state as detected by qpcr in general the absolute abundances of eargs were increased with mfs dosing rate increased on average the absolute abundance of eargs increased by 26 with the mfs dosing rate of 17 items gts and the absolute abundance increased by 70 when the mfs dosing rate was 170 items gts the largest enhancement was observed in the gene of suli which increased by 2 05 times with the highest mfs addition however some exceptions could be observed such as erea in ra and rb and sulii in rc as their concentrations were lower than the concentrations of the corresponding args in r0 without mfs addition the relative abundance the ratio of eargs absolute abundance to the total abundance of 16s rrna gene in bacteria and archaea takes the bacteria and archaea concentration variations in different samples into consideration which is better for comparison among different samples thus relative abundances of tested eargs in four reactors were also calculated fig s2 and the ratios of relative abundances of eargs in ra rb and rc to those in r0 were compared in fig 1b the results showed that the almost all the eargs abundances in the reactors with mfs addition were higher than those in the control reactor expect for a slight decrease for erea in ra the average increases in relative eargs abundances caused by mfs addition was 1 49 times 1 78 times and 2 15 times compared to r0 for the case of ra rb and rc respectively the increase of both absolute and relative abundances of eargs with mfs addition suggested that pet mfs stimulated args releasing into extracellular environment during sludge anaerobic conditions however for some args such as sulii mexf and tets the abundance increasing extent is not consistent with the increase of mfs dosing rate in other words the highest abundance increases were observed in ra or rb but not in rc with the highest mfs addition this indicated that impact pattern of mfs on different arg release might be varied according to different args 3 2 changes of eargs abundance with mfs exposure revealed by metagenomics as the metagenomics could detect all dnas in environmental samples without selective amplification it is also applied to samples taken from r0 and rc to provide more comprehensive information on the effect of mfs on eargs during sludge anaerobic digestion the quality filtered reads were aligned against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card to identify the potential eargs in the samples the results showed that the total abundance of eargs was increased by 50 after mfs exposure and meanwhile the total number of eargs types was also increased from 265 in r0 to 298 in rc specifically fig 2 compared the top 50 eargs in the r0 and rc which accounted for 81 2 84 1 of the total eargs abundances in the sample among these 50 eargs 45 eargs had a higher abundance in rc than r0 for instance the abundance of extracellular tets in rc is approximately 1 4 times higher than that in r0 27 7 rpkm vs 19 7 rpkm which is in accordance with qpcr results as shown in fig 1 the highest two eargs increase were observed in iles and rphb with their abundance increased by 3 4 and 3 3 times after mfs addition in addition the abundances of 7 of eargs i e tetw evga arlr tett pmrf arls and baca increased by 2 times and the abundances of 14 eargs increased more than 100 besides in terms of total eargs abundance the rpkm value of rc was 4371 3 which is 0 55 times higher than that of r0 rpkm value was 2812 9 according to the targeting antibiotics types the top 50 eargs could be classified into 14 classes according to the targeting antibiotics types fig 2b showed the total abundance of the 13 classes of eargs increased with the mfs addition except for the resistant to fluoroquinolone which showed a decrease of 23 6 among the increased eargs the abundances of 7 classes i e aminocoumarin fosfomycin multidrug mupirocin peptide rifamycin tetracycline enhanced for more than 2 times 2 1 2 6 times after mfs exposure moreover according to the resistance mechanisms the eargs could be also categorized into 5 groups fig 2c showed that despite of the slight decrease 16 of total abundance of eargs in the antibiotic inactivation group the remaining five resistance mechanism group increased by 0 6 1 2 times after mfs addition the main mechanisms of antibiotic inactivation involved degradation of antibiotics or transfer of a chemical group to antibiotics reygaert 2018 however the reason for decreased inactivation group in earg after mf exposure is unclear which required further investigation overall the metagenomics results further confirmed that the pet mfs exposure enhanced eargs spread during sewage sludge anaerobic digestion 3 3 potential hosts of eargs and its variation in anaerobically digested sludge to predict the potential hosts of the top 50 eargs the predicted genes were simultaneously searched against ncbi nr databases and the card database and microorganisms that carry arg sequence were counted as the potential hosts of eargs guo et al 2017 the correlation network of eargs and their potential hosts in r0 and rc were illustrated in fig 3 a and fig 3b respectively the potential hosts were presented by the most refined level above species as identified by metagenomic analysis the results showed the potential hosts in r0 and rc had a high degree of overlap as both reactors contained 35 common potential hosts with the only exception of genus paraburkholderia which was identified as the arg host in rc only in both reactors candidatus woesebacteria candidatus berkelbacteria and candidatus levybacteria are top three potential hosts which linked the most eargs as each type of microorganisms was linked to over 17 different eargs these microorganisms were commonly known as candidate phyla radiation cpr bacteria which were defined on the basis of sequence information but lack any isolated representative brown et al 2015 the crp bacteria were widely distributed in freshwater terrestrial ecosystems and animal microbiomes especially in oxygen limited or anaerobic conditions and represent substantial fraction of the bacterial domain castelle et al 2018 in addition nine potential hosts could be assigned to genus level including streptomyces pseudomonas and etc these genera were also been reported as the potential eargs hosts in some environmental samples such as food waste and landfill leachate kanger et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 based on fig 3a and fig 3b the number of potential hosts for each eargs could also be identified macb mtra and teta were turned out to be the most widely spread eargs as all of them could be identified in more than 10 hosts in both reactors moreover the number of hosts for some eargs increased with the mfs dosing as suggested by a larger node size in fig 3b than fig 3a to further evaluate the variation of eargs hosts in two reactors the changes of host number for each eargs were compared in fig 3c the results showed that the host number of 23 eargs increased by 6 25 100 with the mfs dosing while the host number of only 8 eargs decreased these results suggested that mfs exposure enhanced arg spread among different species during sludge anaerobic digestion this may be related to enhance of eargs abundance in the sludge after mfs addition as mentioned in above sections which consequently improve args horizonal transfer by uptake released eargs thus to further explore the reason responsible for the enhanced eargs release after mfs exposure the impact of mfs on both passive and active released of args were investigated and discussed in the following sections 3 4 the impact of mfs on passive release of eargs during sludge anaerobic digestion since args were encoded in dna the passive release of edna as a result of cell membrane damage and cell lysis was thought as one of the main origins of eargs in the environment ibanez de aldecoa et al 2017 pietramellara et al 2009 therefore in this study whether the addition of pet mfs could enhance cell membrane damage and cell lysis and consequently leading to improve earg passive release were evaluated through four different ways including intracellular ros level determination ldh release analysis live dead staining and pma qpcr quantification ros was commonly generated during cell metabolism and the generation can be stimulated under environmental stress bhattacharya et al 2010 the excessive ros production may result in cell membrane damage via lipid peroxidation and consequently lead to passive release of edna farmer and mueller 2013 ibanez de aldecoa et al 2017 fig 4 a showed that the ros with mfs in rc mfs 170 items gts was increased by 5 7 compared with that in r0 without mfs dosing to verify whether the increase of ros caused by mfs exposure could resulted in cell membrane damage the ldh release in rc and r0 were also compared ldh as a kind of intracellular enzyme can be released into the extracellular matrix while the cell membrane is severely damaged zheng et al 2017 however our results showed the ldh level in extracellular matrix has no significant difference p 0 71 0 05 in rc and r0 fig 4a thus it suggested that the slight increase of ros in sludge with mfs exposure would not cause measurable cell membrane damage the unaffected cell membrane integrality with the increased intracellular ros level was also reported in other studies for example zheng et al 2011 reported no increased cell leakage in sewage sludge caused by zno nanoparticle even the cell ros production increased by 35 which is about 6 1 times higher than the increase observed in our study in fact the cells have many different mechanisms to maintain protection against different ros based on either catabolism of ros or repair of ros mediated damage temple et al 2005 thus it is reasonable the increased ros level did not necessarily result in increased cell membrane damage due to enhanced protection system live dead staining and pma qpcr analysis were also applied to directly quantify the effect of mfs exposure on cell membrane damage during sludge anaerobic digestion as shown in fig 4b the proportion of viable cells in rc showed no significant differences compared to that in r0 as revealed by both live dead difference 1 2 p 0 44 0 05 and pma qpcr difference 2 1 p 0 85 0 05 these results further confirmed that mfs exposure would not enhance the overall cell membrane damage during sewage sludge anaerobic digestion thus it has low possibility that the enhanced eargs abundance with mfs exposure was due to the generally increase of edna passive release in addition the possible selectivity impact of mfs addition on microbial cell lysis was further evaluation by comparing the microbial community structures in r0 and rc this aimed to figure out if the passive release of edna from certain microorganisms such as args hosts was selectively enhanced by mfs addition however the results showed that microbial community structures were resembling in r0 and rc as indicated by similar rpkm abundances at phylum level fig 4c moreover the abundance of potential args hosts also did not significantly changed after mfs exposure fig 4d the variation of the most hosts were less than 10 in their rpkm abundances with only 3 hosts i e spirochaetes candidatus berkelbacteria candidatus aminicenantes changed about 18 to 20 as a result the overall abundance of the potential arg hosts increased by only 1 after mfs exposure it has been reported microplastics may affect the microbial community structures in some environment systems such as sediment and soil however the microplastics concentrations reported that posing significant impact were high for example seeley et al 2020 observed microplastics affect sedimentary microbial communities with the a microplastic concentration of 0 5 w w based on weight of sediment gao et al 2021 also reported that bacterial communities in vegetable growing soil formed an obvious cluster in the high microplastic addition treatments 3 18 w w in comparison the highest microplastics concentration applied in our study is about 1 5 10 4 g gts which 0 01 w w based on the dry weigh of sludge and only 0 0005 w w based on the total weigh of the sludge thus such low dosage of pet mfs may not be able to pose significant impact on microbial community structures during sludge anaerobic digestion the similar microbial community structures and hosts abundance indicated that mfs did not have a selectivity impact on microbial cell lysis thus it is also unlikely the enhanced eargs after mfs exposure was caused by enhanced passive release of edna from potential arg hosts 3 5 mfs enhanced the active release of eargs during sludge anaerobic digestion it has been reported that the dna could also be actively released to extracellular environment through type iv secretion system t4ss hamilton et al 2005 salgado pabon et al 2007 stingl et al 2010 and thus resulted in the spread of eargs the schematic diagram of t4ss was illustrated in fig 5 a showing that the system comprises 12 proteins virb1 11 and vird4 and forms a large macromolecular complex that spans the cell envelope of the bacteria darbari and waksman 2015 according to the metagenomics results of intracellular groups the abundances of genes encoded eight t4ss protein were improved after mfs exposure fig 5b the highest improvement was observed in the virb1 gene which increased 54 after mfs exposure virb1 is a periplasmic protein which is postulated to carry transglycosylase motif and to punch holes in the peptidoglycan to facilitate t4ss assembly thanassi et al 1998 it has also been reported that the virb1 related transglycosylases are important for assembly some t4ss mediating dna release into the milieu dillard and seifert 2001 which may also contribute to the enhanced eargs abundance in this study in addition the abundance of the vird4 gene also showed a significant improvement of 22 after mfs exposure vird4 is one of the atpases comprising the cytoplasmic energy center situated at the base of the translocation channel fig 5a it serves as the coupling protein which both dna and protein substrates were banded to before entering into the translocation channel alvarez rodriguez et al 2020 thus the increased vird4 gene abundance after mfs exposure may improve the possibility of arg encoded dna banding on receptor and then translocated through the secretion channel among the 12 proteins virb7 gene was not identified in the sample which probably due to the abundance of virb7 is too low to be quantified in fact virb7 subunits are small lipoproteins found in only a subset of gram negative systems many gram negative t4ss encode lipoproteins with little sequence similarity to the virb7 gene that could also supply a virb7 like function alvarez martinez and christie 2009 moreover some species also do not require virb7 for the formation of a functional secretion system den hartigh et al 2008 in accordance with our study the undetectable virb7 gene abundance with metagenomic analysis was also reported in other wastewater sludge samples zhao et al 2021 according to different functions the 12 proteins in t4ss could be divided into five modules including atpase virb4 virb11 vird4 inner membrane protein virb3 virb6 virb8 virb10 periplasmic protein virb1 outer membrane protein virb7 virb9 and surface pilus protein virb2 virb5 costa et al 2015 fig 5c showed that the total abundances of genes encoding four modules had the evident raise by 8 2 54 4 except for genes encoding surface pilus protein the surface pilus protein was related to the assembly of pilus and further influencing the host cell recognition darbari and waksman 2015 thus the reduction of the related gene abundance with mfs exposure may not affect the release of dna into extracellular environment overall the total abundance of t4ss genes was increased by 14 after mfs exposure fig 5c the increase of most t4ss modules and the total t4ss genes also supported that the active released of dna to extracellular environment by t4ss could be enhanced to further verify the enhancement of t4ss during sludge anaerobic digestions after mfs exposure the genomic function of the live cells in the sludge were predicted using picrust2 based on high throughput sequencing results of the pma treated samples the variation in individual t4ss related genes and genes encoding different modules in sludge samples with and without mfs exposure were compared in fig 5d and 5e the results showed that abundances of genes encoding nine t4ss proteins were increased after mfs exposure moreover the cumulative abundance of genes of all five module were also increased by 13 29 and the total t4ss abundance were increased by 17 the enhancement of t4ss related genes as revealed by both metagenomics and picrust2 prediction further confirmed the enhancement of t4ss function of microorganisms after mfs exposure which could contribute to the enhanced eargs abundance in the anaerobically digested sludge t4ss has been reported to play an important role in biofilm formation by secretion edna which were relevant for the initial adhesion of cells to the surface as well as the acts as an electrostatic net that tethers cells together ren et al 2020 rice et al 2007 zweig et al 2014 meanwhile plastics surfaces are always colonized by biofilm due to their hydrophobic nature thus the increased t4ss gene abundance after mfs exposure may be a result of the attempt of microorganisms to form biofilm on the mfs apart from exporting dna or proteins to the milieu the t4ss was also well known as the conjugation machine which translocate dna protein or other macromolecules to receipt cells and it could also import exogenous dna to cells thus the extended spread of args among the microorganisms after mps exposure as suggested by the enhanced host number for most individual arg fig 3c further confirmed that function of t4ss were improved after mfs exposure besides t4ss vesicle transport was also recognized as an activated pathway to release dna and args into extracellular environment liao et al 2014 however we compared the metagenomic results with the vesicle transport associated ko kegg database and found no vesicle transport associated genes could be annotated in both experimental or control group thus vesicle transport may be not important for the dna active release during sludge anaerobic digestion 3 6 implication of this study this study revealed that the pet mfs exposure would increase both absolute and relative abundances of eargs during sewage sludge anaerobic digestion and the enhancement did not show significant selectivity meanwhile pet mfs could also resulted in the increased types of eargs potential host probably due to increased horizonal transfer by uptaking the released eargs besides to the best of our knowledge this is the first study investigating the impact of microplastics on eargs release in sewage sludge anaerobic digestion process while a few studies have investigated impact of microplastics on eargs in wastewater treatment system cheng et al 2022 wang et al 2021 however these studies were mainly focused on the particulate microplastics and aerobic treatment process with the microplastics concentration applied being much higher than our study considering impact of mfs on sludge anaerobic digestion may further accelerate the transport of args in environment it is worthy to control or eliminate such impact and here are two ways we thought feasible in practice the first one is to decrease the concentration of mfs in sewage sludge as the mfs in wwtp are mainly sourced from daily household laundry different devices could be applied to prevent mfs releasing to the laundry effluent for example it has been reported that the xfiltra devices was 78 efficient at reducing microfibre loss to wastewater and lint luv r captured an average of 87 of microfibers by count mcilwraith et al 2019 napper et al 2020 in addition the releasing of mfs from laundry event could also be controlled by changing the washing condition such as reducing the washing duration water temperature and mechanical strength or using softener dalla fontana et al 2020 de falco et al 2018 besides the ultrafine screen 0 2 2 mm presented as the pretreatment equipment in wwtps can also help to intercept mfs and further decrease the concentration of mfs in sludge in addition to preventing microplastics from entering the sludge the ad process can also be adjusted by changing operating paraments like temperature to improve the removal of eargs a study presented by zou et al 2020 pointed that improving temperature in ad process from mesophilic conditions 35 c to thermophilic conditions 55 c effectively benefited the removal of eargs further exploring the reason for enhanced eargs with mfs exposure suggested that it could be a result of increased active release of edna as the t4ss the system mainly responsible for active dna secretion was upregulated with mfs addition however it should be noted that the increased eargs abundance suggested by metagenomics implied that the t4ss may have a higher selectivity to secret eargs encoded dna than normal dna in fact the selection of t4ss has also been reported in the past agrobacterium tumefaciens t4ss for instance was found to translocate a restricted set of substrates that includes the cognate plasmid or oncogenic t dna and a few mobilizable plasmids and proteins pansegrau and lanka 1996 it was proposed that the coupling protein vird4 selected dna substrates by virtue of interactions with the relaxase and other relaxosomal subunits bound at origin of transfer orit sequence christie 2004 also the enhanced secretion of eargs by t4ss may be related to the improved sos response with mfs exposure beaber et al 2004 found that sos response promotes horizontal dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes through conjugation while the t4ss is exactly the conjugation system given the adverse impact of eargs and the importance of t4ss in arg dissemination the in depth mechanism of possible selectivity of t4ss for eargs secretion is worthy to be further investigated moreover as mfs were ubiquitous in the environment the result of our study also shed a light on the release of eargs in system where anaerobic microbial processes occurred such as in the lake sediments and sewer pipe future studies was worthy to be dedicated to different microbial systems to fully understand the interaction of mfs with different microorganism in terms of arg dissemination also pure culture study was worthy to be conducted for providing more fundamental knowledge on how mfs interact with specific microorangnisms in terms of eargs release 4 conclusions this study investigated impact of mfs as the most frequently detected microplastic shape on the release of eargsduring sewage sludge anaerobic digestion the results suggested that mfs exposure could enhance both absolute and relative abundances of eargs in the anaerobically digested sludge and the enhancement showed no significant selectivity in addition the potential hosts of the eargs increased with the mfs exposure which may suggested the horizonal transfer of args were also increased as a result of enhanced avaibility of eargs the mechansims investigation suggested the increased eargs release with mfs exposure could be attributed to the enhanced active release of eargs through type iv secretion system on the other hand the passive release of eargs seems not affected by mfs as indicated by the insignificant variations in cell membrance damage with and without mfs exposure the enhanced eargs release during anaerobic digestion may further accelerate the transport of args in environment which should be considered during sludge handling as well as other anaerobic environmental processes declaration of competing interest the authors

16041,microplastic fibers mfs as the most frequently detected microplastic shape in sewage sludge have posed emerging concern for sludge treatment and disposal however the effect of mfs on antibiotic resistance genes args especially extracellular args eargs during sludge treatment remains far from explicit therefore this study investigated the potential impact of mfs on eargs during sludge anaerobic digestion ad a commonly used sludge treatment method through long term operation the qpcr results showed that both absolute and relative abundances of eargs increased with the mfs exposure during sludge ad the average absolute and relative abundances of eight tested eargs in the ad reactor with the highest mfs dosage 170 items gts were 1 70 and 2 15 times higher than those in the control ad reactor the metagenomics results further comfirmed the increase of eargs abundance during sludge anaerobic digestion after mfs exposure and the enhancement did not show significant selectivity the identification of the potential hosts of eargs suggested the host numbers of eargs also increased with mfs exposure which may suggest enhanced horizonal transformation as a result of increased eargs further exploring the mechansims showed that the genes involved in type iv secretion system was upregulated after mfs exposure suggesting the active release of eargs was enhanced with mfs exposure in contrast the mfs may not affect the passive release of eargs as its impact on cell membrance damage was insignificant the enhanced eargs in sludge ad process may further accelerate the transport of args in environment which should be considered during sludge treatment and disposal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastic fibers polyethylene terephthalate antibiotic resistance genes sludge anaerobic digestion type iv secretion system 1 introduction microplastics is an emerging contaminant as it may pose adverse impacts on microorganisms plants animals and human health prata et al 2020 sun et al 2021 the wastewater treatment plant wwtp collecting and treating wastewater generated from daily life and industries is considered as an important pathway for microplastics being discharged to the environment and has received great concern recently liu et al 2019 ni et al 2020b zhang and chen 2020 among different microplastics in wwtp the microplastic fibers mfs is the most frequently detected shape sun et al 2019 mfs in wastewater were mainly originated from wearing of clothing and textile during the laundry events hartline et al 2016 de falco et al 2018 estimated that mfs released from a typical 5 kg wash load of polyester fabrics could be over 6 106 items additionally wastewater discharged from textile industries also contained considerable amount of mfs with the concentration as high as 5 4 104 items l zhou et al 2020 as a result the ratio of mfs in the wwtp influent was reported to be 52 7 in average sun et al 2019 and could even reach over 80 in some cases lares et al 2018 xu et al 2019 however after a series of treatment processes in wwtps most of the mfs were retained in sewage sludge among which polyethylene terephthalate pet mfs was usually dominant he et al 2021 li et al 2018 petroody et al 2021 for instance lares et al 2018 found that the average concentration of mfs in sewage sludge could varied between 21 7 4 6 and 161 0 25 5 items g total solid ts among which the proportion of pet was over 80 thus attentions should be paid to the effect of mfs especially pet mfs on sludge treatment and final disposal in aspect to the final disposal of sewage sludge land application is regarded as one of the widely used methods with the advantages of organic and inorganic nutrients reuse sharma et al 2017 however due to the overuse and improper disposal of antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes args could be accumulated in the sewage sludge naquin et al 2015 the accumulated args may cause the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb which leads to the ineffectiveness of antibiotics and finally poses a risk to public health like pathogenic bacterial infections bin zaman et al 2017 ezugworie et al 2021 therefore investigations on the args variation during the sludge treatment processes before land application arose syafiuddin and boopathy 2021 the anaerobic digestion ad is a frequently used sludge treatment method which could achieve energy recovery together with sludge reduction and stabilization abelleira pereira et al 2015 liu et al 2021 thus with the accumulation of mfs in sewage sludge the impact of mfs on the dissemination of args during ad process is worthy to explore the args in the environment could be classified into two types i e intracellular args iargs and extracellular args eargs the iargs may promote antibiotic resistant bacteria dissemination via cell to cell contact while eargs could be assimilated by the competent bacteria via natural transformation leading to the elevated abundance of arb finally causing new antibiotic resistant infections and health problems dong et al 2019 sivalingam et al 2020 for example the elevated abundance of arb could accelerate the transmission of the environmental resistome to humans and more than 700 000 people die from arb infections worldwide every year o neill 2015 the long persistence and low decay rate of eargs were also found zhang et al 2018 indicating the non negligible importance of eargs for now most of the research on effect of microplastics on args in ad focus on iargs or total args zhang et al 2021 from the best of our knowledge the influence of mfs on eargs in ad process has never been reported before since pet mfs are the main microplastics in sewage sludge it is of great significance to reveal and control its effects on eargs during ad of sewage sludge it is generally accepted that eargs are encoded in extracellular dna edna and the source of edna can be mainly divided into passive release and active release from the perspective of secretion mechanism pietramellara et al 2009 passive release of edna occurs as a result of cell death caused by environmental factors such as antimicrobial agents ibanez de aldecoa et al 2017 in addition microorganisms are able to produce edna actively through the type iv secretion system t4ss ibanez de aldecoa et al 2017 for example n gonorrhoeae could secret chromosomal dna to the extracellular environment by t4ss hamilton et al 2005 salgado pabon et al 2007 besides edna could also be active released with the help of vesicles in specific microorganisms grande et al 2015 it has been reported that edna could be actively released via membrane vesicles in streptococcus mutans liao et al 2014 microplastics may cause cell lysis and may also change the metabolic pathway and community structure of microorganisms seeley et al 2020 which may affect the release of eargs therefore scientifically it is important to clarify the release mechanism of eargs with mfs exposure this study aimed to reveal the changes in eargs caused by mfs in sewage sludge during ad process and the associated mechanisms with such changes in view of this three objectives were pursued 1 the abundance and variation of eargs in ad process with the existence of pet mfs 2 the identification of potential hosts of eargs in ad sludges and the possible variation according to pet mfs exposure 3 the mechanisms responsible for the influence of pet mfs on the release of eargs in ad process this work will help us to expand the theoretical understanding of pet mfs on eargs variance during ad process and guide the control and management of eargs in practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of sludge and pet mfs four ad reactors were set up to investigate the influence of pet mfs on eargs and the specific operation paraments were shown in section 2 2 two kinds of sludges were used in ad reactors named as feeding sludge and inoculated sludge the feeding sludge as the substrate of the ad system was the sewage sludge collected from the secondary sedimentation tank at a municipal wwtp in shanghai china the main characteristics of feeding sludge were as follows ph 6 7 0 1 total solids ts 30 7 0 1 g l volatile solids vs 16 9 0 1 g l total organic carbon toc 91 1 3 2 mg l the feeding sludge was stored at 4 c before experiments to reduce the biotransformation the inoculated sludge for ad reactors was obtained from a semi continuous anaerobic digester with the sludge retention time srt of 20 days in the same wwtp as mentioned above the main characteristics of the inoculated sludge were as follows ph 6 9 0 1 ts 33 1 0 1 g l vs 14 6 0 1 g l toc 36 2 1 8 mg l the inoculated sludge was used within 24 h after been collected from the anaerobic digester the feeding and inoculated sludge used in this study were filtered by a stainless screen with the mesh size of 300 μm before ad experiments the pet mfs used in this study were purchased from a fiber factory in hunan china and were cut into approximately 3 mm in length by scalpel 2 2 anaerobic digestion reactor setup and sampling serum bottles with a total volume of 1100 ml were used as ad rectors and according to lares et al 2018 the pet mfs levels of the sewage sludge were set at 0 20 70 and 170 items gts named as r0 ra rb and rc respectively at the beginning 600 ml inoculum and 100 ml sewage sludge with the corresponding numbers of pet mfs were added into the bottles leaving 400 ml headspace then the headspace of all serum bottles was flushed with nitrogen for 5 min to remove oxygen finally the bottles were capped with rubber stoppers with aluminum crimp caps and placed in a shaker of 150 rpm at 35 1 c the ad reactors were operated semi continously every three days the contents of methane yielded in each reactor were detected and then 100 ml of mixed sludge were discharged followed by another 100 ml of sewage sludge with corresponding pet mfs concentration were added into the corresponding reactors respectively to keep the working volume consistent in 700 ml and the srt stable at 21 days finally the reactors were flushed with nitrogen resealed and placed in shaker again the whole experiments were lasted for three srts and the mixed sludge in the reactors were sampled for later dna extraction at day 63 while the other experiments were also carried out around day 63 2 3 extraction of edna and intracellular dna idna dna extraction was based on previous studies with minor modification dong et al 2019 mao et al 2014 for edna extraction 12 0 ml of 0 12 mol l sodium phosphate buffer ph 8 0 and 0 8 g polyvinyl polypyrrolidone pvpp were added into 4 0 g wet weight sludge samples and shaken at 250 rpm for 10 min at 25 c then the mixture was centrifuged 10 000 rpm 4 c 10 min and the supernatant was filtered through a sterile membrane another 12 0 ml 0 12 mol l sodium phosphate buffer ph 8 0 was add into the pellets for washing followed by the same mixing centrifugation and filtration procedure the washing procedure were repeated for two times all the filtrated supernatant fractions were collected combined and stored on ice until subsequent edna extraction and the pellets were also collected and stored for idna extraction the edna in the filtrates was collected with precipitation method eichmiller et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 briefly 20 00 ml of absolute ethanol and 0 91 ml of 3 mol l sodium acetate were added to 9 09 ml of filtrate sample and the mixed solution was stored at 20 c overnight the precipitates were obtained by centrifuging at 10000 g at 4 c for 10 min and further discarding supernatants for idna extraction the pellets after centrifuging and supernatants removal were collected and were dried by freezer dryer sciznte china along with the edna precipitates mentioned above dna samples from edna and idna pellets were extracted using a tiannamp soil dna kit tiangen china according to the manufacturer s instruction the same dna extraction process in each reactor were repeated three times to get enough dna samples for later analysis the purity concentration and integrity of dna extractions were detected by nano drop 2000 and gel electrophoresis analysis the dna samples were stored at 80 c before quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr detection high throughput sequencing analysis and metagenomics analysis 2 4 qpcr analysis of args in order to figure out the influence of pet mfs on eargs in ad process eight frequently detected eargs i e suli sulii tetg erea ermf mexf tetm and tets in r0 ra rb rc were quantified via qpcr besides 16s rrna gene of bacteria and archaea in every reactor were also detected by qpcr for the calculation of relative 16s rrna gene abundance primers of args and 16s rrna gene used in this study were listed in support information si table s1 the qpcr reactions were performed via a steponeplus qpcr system wcgene biotech inc shanghai china in triplicate briefly the reaction mixture 10 μl contained 5 μl tb green premix ex taq ii 2 takara japan 3 μl ddh2o 1 μl dna sample 0 4 μl primer f 0 4 μl primer r and 0 2 μl rox reference dye 50 amplification was performed as follows 30 s at 95 c and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 5 s then annealing at 60 c for 30 s a final melt curve was then generated with temperature ranging from 60 c to 95 c to determine the specific amplification the qpcr amplification efficiencies were in the range of 85 to 105 with the correlation co efficiency over 0 99 the absolute abundances of the targeted genes were presented as gene copy numbers per gram sludge of dry weight and the relative abundance of the targeted genes were presented as gene copy numbers per 16s rrna gene 2 5 metagenomics analysis for the purpose to evaluate the change of eargs and functional genes associated with dna secretion and other process metagenomics analysis were implied among both edna and idna of the control group r0 and the highest mfs dosing group rc after edna and idna were extracted using the method described in section 2 3 illumina shotgun dna library and sequencing were constructed on illumina hiseq6000 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china low quality reads length 50 bp or with a quality value 20 or were potential duplicated reads from amplification artefacts were removed by sickle http github com najoshi sickle the final clean reads in edna and idna of r0 and rc were 51 335 192 49 399 362 49 399 362 and 53 937 288 respectively after quality filtering the cleaned reads were assembled into contigs and the genes were predicted then the non redundant gene sets were construction and taxonomic and functional annotation were conducted the details about metagenomic data processing were summarized in text s1 si sequence data associated with these samples have been deposited in the ncbi short read archive database accession number prjna757556 reads per kilo base pairs per million reads rpkm was calculated for each gene abundance 2 6 live dead detection ros measurement and ldh analysis because the passive release of edna was the results of cell lysis or death therefore the viability of bacterial cells in r0 and rc was determined using the live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 to reveal the effects of pet mfs on passive release the viability kit involves two nucleic acid stains namely green fluorescent syto 9 and red fluorescent propidium iodide pi the syto 9 could label all cells while pi could only penetrate cells with damaged membrane and resulted in a reduction in the syto 9 stain fluorescence yan et al 2020 as a result the viable cells are stained green whereas the dead cells are stained red the staining of cells was conducted based on protocols provided by the manufacturer and detailed procedures were shown in si text s2 except for live dead staining reactive oxygen species ros could be generated under anaerobic conditions with the existence of microplastics which would result in the loss of cell viability and cause cell death bhattacharya et al 2010 as pet mfs is the common microplastics in ad process the intracellular reactive oxygen species ros production in r0 and rc was measured according to limbach et al 2007 briefly anaerobic sludge was suspended in phosphate buffer with 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate h2dcfda molecular probes eugene usa which can be oxidized to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein dcf by ros fluorescence of dcf would be detected by a fluorescence spectroscopy thermo electron vantaa finland and the value of fluorescence strength is positively correlated with the ros concentration the detailed ros detection were shown in si text s3 besides lactate dehydrogenase ldh can be released into the extracellular matrix while the cell membrane is severely damaged as a result the abundance of extracellular ldh could be used to estimate the integrity of cell membranes zheng et al 2017 because the integrity of cell membrane could be used to indicate the viability of cells the relative abundance of extracellular ldh in r0 and rc were measured simultaneously by ldh assay kit beyotime biotechnology c0016 according to the protocol 2 7 pma qpcr and high throughput sequencing analysis pma qpcr analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of pet mfs on the abundance of viable microorganisms in r0 and rc as pma can selectively enter dead cells and inhibit the dna amplification during subsequent qpcr as a result only abundance of genes in living cells will be quantified ni et al 2020a pma qpcr treatment and the detection of 16s rrna gene among living cells were introduced in si text s4 the high throughput sequencing analysis was conducted on the pma treated sludges in r0 and rc respectively the aim is to evaluate the changes in microbial communities in viable microorganisms as well as identify the dominant microorganisms at the same time the v4 v5 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using primer 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806rmodr 5 ggactacnvgggtwtctaat 3 by thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa caporaso et al 2011 the qpcr operations of high throughput sequencing analysis were shown in si text s5 and the qpcr products was pooled in equimolar and paired end sequenced 2 300 on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa operated by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 2 8 other analytical methods and statistic analysis ts vs toc were analyzed according to standard methods apha 2012 methane was detected by a gas chromatograph gc sp6890 shandong lunan ruihong chemical instrument co ltd china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd the predicted genes by metagenomics were simultaneously searched against ncbi nr databases and the card database to get the eargs and their potential hosts and the network visualization was conducted on the platform of gephi v 0 9 2 one way analysis of variance anova and the p value 0 05 was considered to be significantly different in triplicate experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of eargs abundance with mfs exposure revealed by qpcr before the args analysis the four ad reactors i e r0 ra mfs 20 items gts rb mfs 70 items gts rc mfs 170 items gts were operated for 3 srts to ensure that a pseudo steady state were reached and the methane production were monitored during the operation fig s1 presented the average methane productions of the four reactors in each operational cycle as well as the specific methane productions during the third srt operation overall the methane production in each reactor was stable despite of some slight fluctuations in addition the similar average methane production in four reactors 5 25 0 39 mmol gvs in r0 5 43 0 37 mmol gvs in ra 5 24 0 39 mmol gvs in rb and 5 31 0 41 mmol gvs in rc respectively suggested that the methane production from sewage sludge anaerobic digestion would not interfered by the addition of mfs in long term operation fig 1 a compared the absolute abundances of eight tested eargs in four ad reactors at the pseudo steady state as detected by qpcr in general the absolute abundances of eargs were increased with mfs dosing rate increased on average the absolute abundance of eargs increased by 26 with the mfs dosing rate of 17 items gts and the absolute abundance increased by 70 when the mfs dosing rate was 170 items gts the largest enhancement was observed in the gene of suli which increased by 2 05 times with the highest mfs addition however some exceptions could be observed such as erea in ra and rb and sulii in rc as their concentrations were lower than the concentrations of the corresponding args in r0 without mfs addition the relative abundance the ratio of eargs absolute abundance to the total abundance of 16s rrna gene in bacteria and archaea takes the bacteria and archaea concentration variations in different samples into consideration which is better for comparison among different samples thus relative abundances of tested eargs in four reactors were also calculated fig s2 and the ratios of relative abundances of eargs in ra rb and rc to those in r0 were compared in fig 1b the results showed that the almost all the eargs abundances in the reactors with mfs addition were higher than those in the control reactor expect for a slight decrease for erea in ra the average increases in relative eargs abundances caused by mfs addition was 1 49 times 1 78 times and 2 15 times compared to r0 for the case of ra rb and rc respectively the increase of both absolute and relative abundances of eargs with mfs addition suggested that pet mfs stimulated args releasing into extracellular environment during sludge anaerobic conditions however for some args such as sulii mexf and tets the abundance increasing extent is not consistent with the increase of mfs dosing rate in other words the highest abundance increases were observed in ra or rb but not in rc with the highest mfs addition this indicated that impact pattern of mfs on different arg release might be varied according to different args 3 2 changes of eargs abundance with mfs exposure revealed by metagenomics as the metagenomics could detect all dnas in environmental samples without selective amplification it is also applied to samples taken from r0 and rc to provide more comprehensive information on the effect of mfs on eargs during sludge anaerobic digestion the quality filtered reads were aligned against the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card to identify the potential eargs in the samples the results showed that the total abundance of eargs was increased by 50 after mfs exposure and meanwhile the total number of eargs types was also increased from 265 in r0 to 298 in rc specifically fig 2 compared the top 50 eargs in the r0 and rc which accounted for 81 2 84 1 of the total eargs abundances in the sample among these 50 eargs 45 eargs had a higher abundance in rc than r0 for instance the abundance of extracellular tets in rc is approximately 1 4 times higher than that in r0 27 7 rpkm vs 19 7 rpkm which is in accordance with qpcr results as shown in fig 1 the highest two eargs increase were observed in iles and rphb with their abundance increased by 3 4 and 3 3 times after mfs addition in addition the abundances of 7 of eargs i e tetw evga arlr tett pmrf arls and baca increased by 2 times and the abundances of 14 eargs increased more than 100 besides in terms of total eargs abundance the rpkm value of rc was 4371 3 which is 0 55 times higher than that of r0 rpkm value was 2812 9 according to the targeting antibiotics types the top 50 eargs could be classified into 14 classes according to the targeting antibiotics types fig 2b showed the total abundance of the 13 classes of eargs increased with the mfs addition except for the resistant to fluoroquinolone which showed a decrease of 23 6 among the increased eargs the abundances of 7 classes i e aminocoumarin fosfomycin multidrug mupirocin peptide rifamycin tetracycline enhanced for more than 2 times 2 1 2 6 times after mfs exposure moreover according to the resistance mechanisms the eargs could be also categorized into 5 groups fig 2c showed that despite of the slight decrease 16 of total abundance of eargs in the antibiotic inactivation group the remaining five resistance mechanism group increased by 0 6 1 2 times after mfs addition the main mechanisms of antibiotic inactivation involved degradation of antibiotics or transfer of a chemical group to antibiotics reygaert 2018 however the reason for decreased inactivation group in earg after mf exposure is unclear which required further investigation overall the metagenomics results further confirmed that the pet mfs exposure enhanced eargs spread during sewage sludge anaerobic digestion 3 3 potential hosts of eargs and its variation in anaerobically digested sludge to predict the potential hosts of the top 50 eargs the predicted genes were simultaneously searched against ncbi nr databases and the card database and microorganisms that carry arg sequence were counted as the potential hosts of eargs guo et al 2017 the correlation network of eargs and their potential hosts in r0 and rc were illustrated in fig 3 a and fig 3b respectively the potential hosts were presented by the most refined level above species as identified by metagenomic analysis the results showed the potential hosts in r0 and rc had a high degree of overlap as both reactors contained 35 common potential hosts with the only exception of genus paraburkholderia which was identified as the arg host in rc only in both reactors candidatus woesebacteria candidatus berkelbacteria and candidatus levybacteria are top three potential hosts which linked the most eargs as each type of microorganisms was linked to over 17 different eargs these microorganisms were commonly known as candidate phyla radiation cpr bacteria which were defined on the basis of sequence information but lack any isolated representative brown et al 2015 the crp bacteria were widely distributed in freshwater terrestrial ecosystems and animal microbiomes especially in oxygen limited or anaerobic conditions and represent substantial fraction of the bacterial domain castelle et al 2018 in addition nine potential hosts could be assigned to genus level including streptomyces pseudomonas and etc these genera were also been reported as the potential eargs hosts in some environmental samples such as food waste and landfill leachate kanger et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 based on fig 3a and fig 3b the number of potential hosts for each eargs could also be identified macb mtra and teta were turned out to be the most widely spread eargs as all of them could be identified in more than 10 hosts in both reactors moreover the number of hosts for some eargs increased with the mfs dosing as suggested by a larger node size in fig 3b than fig 3a to further evaluate the variation of eargs hosts in two reactors the changes of host number for each eargs were compared in fig 3c the results showed that the host number of 23 eargs increased by 6 25 100 with the mfs dosing while the host number of only 8 eargs decreased these results suggested that mfs exposure enhanced arg spread among different species during sludge anaerobic digestion this may be related to enhance of eargs abundance in the sludge after mfs addition as mentioned in above sections which consequently improve args horizonal transfer by uptake released eargs thus to further explore the reason responsible for the enhanced eargs release after mfs exposure the impact of mfs on both passive and active released of args were investigated and discussed in the following sections 3 4 the impact of mfs on passive release of eargs during sludge anaerobic digestion since args were encoded in dna the passive release of edna as a result of cell membrane damage and cell lysis was thought as one of the main origins of eargs in the environment ibanez de aldecoa et al 2017 pietramellara et al 2009 therefore in this study whether the addition of pet mfs could enhance cell membrane damage and cell lysis and consequently leading to improve earg passive release were evaluated through four different ways including intracellular ros level determination ldh release analysis live dead staining and pma qpcr quantification ros was commonly generated during cell metabolism and the generation can be stimulated under environmental stress bhattacharya et al 2010 the excessive ros production may result in cell membrane damage via lipid peroxidation and consequently lead to passive release of edna farmer and mueller 2013 ibanez de aldecoa et al 2017 fig 4 a showed that the ros with mfs in rc mfs 170 items gts was increased by 5 7 compared with that in r0 without mfs dosing to verify whether the increase of ros caused by mfs exposure could resulted in cell membrane damage the ldh release in rc and r0 were also compared ldh as a kind of intracellular enzyme can be released into the extracellular matrix while the cell membrane is severely damaged zheng et al 2017 however our results showed the ldh level in extracellular matrix has no significant difference p 0 71 0 05 in rc and r0 fig 4a thus it suggested that the slight increase of ros in sludge with mfs exposure would not cause measurable cell membrane damage the unaffected cell membrane integrality with the increased intracellular ros level was also reported in other studies for example zheng et al 2011 reported no increased cell leakage in sewage sludge caused by zno nanoparticle even the cell ros production increased by 35 which is about 6 1 times higher than the increase observed in our study in fact the cells have many different mechanisms to maintain protection against different ros based on either catabolism of ros or repair of ros mediated damage temple et al 2005 thus it is reasonable the increased ros level did not necessarily result in increased cell membrane damage due to enhanced protection system live dead staining and pma qpcr analysis were also applied to directly quantify the effect of mfs exposure on cell membrane damage during sludge anaerobic digestion as shown in fig 4b the proportion of viable cells in rc showed no significant differences compared to that in r0 as revealed by both live dead difference 1 2 p 0 44 0 05 and pma qpcr difference 2 1 p 0 85 0 05 these results further confirmed that mfs exposure would not enhance the overall cell membrane damage during sewage sludge anaerobic digestion thus it has low possibility that the enhanced eargs abundance with mfs exposure was due to the generally increase of edna passive release in addition the possible selectivity impact of mfs addition on microbial cell lysis was further evaluation by comparing the microbial community structures in r0 and rc this aimed to figure out if the passive release of edna from certain microorganisms such as args hosts was selectively enhanced by mfs addition however the results showed that microbial community structures were resembling in r0 and rc as indicated by similar rpkm abundances at phylum level fig 4c moreover the abundance of potential args hosts also did not significantly changed after mfs exposure fig 4d the variation of the most hosts were less than 10 in their rpkm abundances with only 3 hosts i e spirochaetes candidatus berkelbacteria candidatus aminicenantes changed about 18 to 20 as a result the overall abundance of the potential arg hosts increased by only 1 after mfs exposure it has been reported microplastics may affect the microbial community structures in some environment systems such as sediment and soil however the microplastics concentrations reported that posing significant impact were high for example seeley et al 2020 observed microplastics affect sedimentary microbial communities with the a microplastic concentration of 0 5 w w based on weight of sediment gao et al 2021 also reported that bacterial communities in vegetable growing soil formed an obvious cluster in the high microplastic addition treatments 3 18 w w in comparison the highest microplastics concentration applied in our study is about 1 5 10 4 g gts which 0 01 w w based on the dry weigh of sludge and only 0 0005 w w based on the total weigh of the sludge thus such low dosage of pet mfs may not be able to pose significant impact on microbial community structures during sludge anaerobic digestion the similar microbial community structures and hosts abundance indicated that mfs did not have a selectivity impact on microbial cell lysis thus it is also unlikely the enhanced eargs after mfs exposure was caused by enhanced passive release of edna from potential arg hosts 3 5 mfs enhanced the active release of eargs during sludge anaerobic digestion it has been reported that the dna could also be actively released to extracellular environment through type iv secretion system t4ss hamilton et al 2005 salgado pabon et al 2007 stingl et al 2010 and thus resulted in the spread of eargs the schematic diagram of t4ss was illustrated in fig 5 a showing that the system comprises 12 proteins virb1 11 and vird4 and forms a large macromolecular complex that spans the cell envelope of the bacteria darbari and waksman 2015 according to the metagenomics results of intracellular groups the abundances of genes encoded eight t4ss protein were improved after mfs exposure fig 5b the highest improvement was observed in the virb1 gene which increased 54 after mfs exposure virb1 is a periplasmic protein which is postulated to carry transglycosylase motif and to punch holes in the peptidoglycan to facilitate t4ss assembly thanassi et al 1998 it has also been reported that the virb1 related transglycosylases are important for assembly some t4ss mediating dna release into the milieu dillard and seifert 2001 which may also contribute to the enhanced eargs abundance in this study in addition the abundance of the vird4 gene also showed a significant improvement of 22 after mfs exposure vird4 is one of the atpases comprising the cytoplasmic energy center situated at the base of the translocation channel fig 5a it serves as the coupling protein which both dna and protein substrates were banded to before entering into the translocation channel alvarez rodriguez et al 2020 thus the increased vird4 gene abundance after mfs exposure may improve the possibility of arg encoded dna banding on receptor and then translocated through the secretion channel among the 12 proteins virb7 gene was not identified in the sample which probably due to the abundance of virb7 is too low to be quantified in fact virb7 subunits are small lipoproteins found in only a subset of gram negative systems many gram negative t4ss encode lipoproteins with little sequence similarity to the virb7 gene that could also supply a virb7 like function alvarez martinez and christie 2009 moreover some species also do not require virb7 for the formation of a functional secretion system den hartigh et al 2008 in accordance with our study the undetectable virb7 gene abundance with metagenomic analysis was also reported in other wastewater sludge samples zhao et al 2021 according to different functions the 12 proteins in t4ss could be divided into five modules including atpase virb4 virb11 vird4 inner membrane protein virb3 virb6 virb8 virb10 periplasmic protein virb1 outer membrane protein virb7 virb9 and surface pilus protein virb2 virb5 costa et al 2015 fig 5c showed that the total abundances of genes encoding four modules had the evident raise by 8 2 54 4 except for genes encoding surface pilus protein the surface pilus protein was related to the assembly of pilus and further influencing the host cell recognition darbari and waksman 2015 thus the reduction of the related gene abundance with mfs exposure may not affect the release of dna into extracellular environment overall the total abundance of t4ss genes was increased by 14 after mfs exposure fig 5c the increase of most t4ss modules and the total t4ss genes also supported that the active released of dna to extracellular environment by t4ss could be enhanced to further verify the enhancement of t4ss during sludge anaerobic digestions after mfs exposure the genomic function of the live cells in the sludge were predicted using picrust2 based on high throughput sequencing results of the pma treated samples the variation in individual t4ss related genes and genes encoding different modules in sludge samples with and without mfs exposure were compared in fig 5d and 5e the results showed that abundances of genes encoding nine t4ss proteins were increased after mfs exposure moreover the cumulative abundance of genes of all five module were also increased by 13 29 and the total t4ss abundance were increased by 17 the enhancement of t4ss related genes as revealed by both metagenomics and picrust2 prediction further confirmed the enhancement of t4ss function of microorganisms after mfs exposure which could contribute to the enhanced eargs abundance in the anaerobically digested sludge t4ss has been reported to play an important role in biofilm formation by secretion edna which were relevant for the initial adhesion of cells to the surface as well as the acts as an electrostatic net that tethers cells together ren et al 2020 rice et al 2007 zweig et al 2014 meanwhile plastics surfaces are always colonized by biofilm due to their hydrophobic nature thus the increased t4ss gene abundance after mfs exposure may be a result of the attempt of microorganisms to form biofilm on the mfs apart from exporting dna or proteins to the milieu the t4ss was also well known as the conjugation machine which translocate dna protein or other macromolecules to receipt cells and it could also import exogenous dna to cells thus the extended spread of args among the microorganisms after mps exposure as suggested by the enhanced host number for most individual arg fig 3c further confirmed that function of t4ss were improved after mfs exposure besides t4ss vesicle transport was also recognized as an activated pathway to release dna and args into extracellular environment liao et al 2014 however we compared the metagenomic results with the vesicle transport associated ko kegg database and found no vesicle transport associated genes could be annotated in both experimental or control group thus vesicle transport may be not important for the dna active release during sludge anaerobic digestion 3 6 implication of this study this study revealed that the pet mfs exposure would increase both absolute and relative abundances of eargs during sewage sludge anaerobic digestion and the enhancement did not show significant selectivity meanwhile pet mfs could also resulted in the increased types of eargs potential host probably due to increased horizonal transfer by uptaking the released eargs besides to the best of our knowledge this is the first study investigating the impact of microplastics on eargs release in sewage sludge anaerobic digestion process while a few studies have investigated impact of microplastics on eargs in wastewater treatment system cheng et al 2022 wang et al 2021 however these studies were mainly focused on the particulate microplastics and aerobic treatment process with the microplastics concentration applied being much higher than our study considering impact of mfs on sludge anaerobic digestion may further accelerate the transport of args in environment it is worthy to control or eliminate such impact and here are two ways we thought feasible in practice the first one is to decrease the concentration of mfs in sewage sludge as the mfs in wwtp are mainly sourced from daily household laundry different devices could be applied to prevent mfs releasing to the laundry effluent for example it has been reported that the xfiltra devices was 78 efficient at reducing microfibre loss to wastewater and lint luv r captured an average of 87 of microfibers by count mcilwraith et al 2019 napper et al 2020 in addition the releasing of mfs from laundry event could also be controlled by changing the washing condition such as reducing the washing duration water temperature and mechanical strength or using softener dalla fontana et al 2020 de falco et al 2018 besides the ultrafine screen 0 2 2 mm presented as the pretreatment equipment in wwtps can also help to intercept mfs and further decrease the concentration of mfs in sludge in addition to preventing microplastics from entering the sludge the ad process can also be adjusted by changing operating paraments like temperature to improve the removal of eargs a study presented by zou et al 2020 pointed that improving temperature in ad process from mesophilic conditions 35 c to thermophilic conditions 55 c effectively benefited the removal of eargs further exploring the reason for enhanced eargs with mfs exposure suggested that it could be a result of increased active release of edna as the t4ss the system mainly responsible for active dna secretion was upregulated with mfs addition however it should be noted that the increased eargs abundance suggested by metagenomics implied that the t4ss may have a higher selectivity to secret eargs encoded dna than normal dna in fact the selection of t4ss has also been reported in the past agrobacterium tumefaciens t4ss for instance was found to translocate a restricted set of substrates that includes the cognate plasmid or oncogenic t dna and a few mobilizable plasmids and proteins pansegrau and lanka 1996 it was proposed that the coupling protein vird4 selected dna substrates by virtue of interactions with the relaxase and other relaxosomal subunits bound at origin of transfer orit sequence christie 2004 also the enhanced secretion of eargs by t4ss may be related to the improved sos response with mfs exposure beaber et al 2004 found that sos response promotes horizontal dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes through conjugation while the t4ss is exactly the conjugation system given the adverse impact of eargs and the importance of t4ss in arg dissemination the in depth mechanism of possible selectivity of t4ss for eargs secretion is worthy to be further investigated moreover as mfs were ubiquitous in the environment the result of our study also shed a light on the release of eargs in system where anaerobic microbial processes occurred such as in the lake sediments and sewer pipe future studies was worthy to be dedicated to different microbial systems to fully understand the interaction of mfs with different microorganism in terms of arg dissemination also pure culture study was worthy to be conducted for providing more fundamental knowledge on how mfs interact with specific microorangnisms in terms of eargs release 4 conclusions this study investigated impact of mfs as the most frequently detected microplastic shape on the release of eargsduring sewage sludge anaerobic digestion the results suggested that mfs exposure could enhance both absolute and relative abundances of eargs in the anaerobically digested sludge and the enhancement showed no significant selectivity in addition the potential hosts of the eargs increased with the mfs exposure which may suggested the horizonal transfer of args were also increased as a result of enhanced avaibility of eargs the mechansims investigation suggested the increased eargs release with mfs exposure could be attributed to the enhanced active release of eargs through type iv secretion system on the other hand the passive release of eargs seems not affected by mfs as indicated by the insignificant variations in cell membrance damage with and without mfs exposure the enhanced eargs release during anaerobic digestion may further accelerate the transport of args in environment which should be considered during sludge handling as well as other anaerobic environmental processes declaration of competing interest the authors

16042,dissolved organic matter dom is an abundant and mobile part of the aquatic environment and plays important roles in aquatic biogeochemical cycles and the global carbon cycle recently eutrophication has become an important environmental issue in global lakes but how eutrophication drives changes in the molecular composition of dom along trophic gradients remains poorly understood we thus characterized 67 dom isolates from 11 lakes along a trophic gradient in china by using a combined approach including absorption spectroscopy excitation emission matrix fluorescence and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms our results indicated that dissolved organic carbon and absorption coefficients at 350 nm increased with increasing trophic status index the ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm and fluorescence intensity of all fluorescent components were higher in eutrophic lakes than in oligotrophic lakes dom in high trophic state lakes tended to be dominated by higher molecular weight unsaturation degree greater abundance of s containing compounds and condensed or polycyclic aromatic compounds than oligotrophic lakes additionally autochthonous dom characterized by more aliphatic compounds increased with the increasing trophic state we concluded that nutrient input along with allochthonous dom favors the lake eutrophication and subsequently increases the release and accumulation of autochthonous dom consequently eutrophication modifies the structure of the organic matter into more complex materials with increased input of allochthonous dom and increased release of autochthonous dom which could accelerate global carbon cycle processes our results here have potential to contribute significantly to future studies of dom dynamics in eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter trophic state optical properties fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry chinese lakes 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom within aquatic systems is a heterogeneous mixture of organic molecules of various origin and composition including sugars fatty acids and alkanes and complex polymeric molecules liu et al 2020a nebbioso and piccolo 2013 it is an abundant and mobile part of the aquatic carbon pool and serves as a fundamental link between terrestrial freshwater and oceanic carbon cycles cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 hence aquatic dom plays important roles in aquatic biogeochemical cycle and the global carbon cycle the quantity and quality of dom varies greatly in terms of the spatial and temporal scales of lakes and can be influenced by various human activities liu et al 2020a thus human induced changes in the quantity and composition of dom in lakes may have strong impacts on carbon cycles and must be better understood aquatic dom includes autochthonous and allochthonous sources mcintyre and guéguen 2013 autochthonous dom mainly originates from phytoplankton macrophytes or microbes due to either extracellular metabolic excretion or intracellular autolysis of cells upon death allochthonous dom is typically derived from soil organic matter and decaying terrestrial plants mcintyre and guéguen 2013 anthropogenic disturbance can affect the dominant dom composition biogeochemical processes and thus the carbon budget in freshwater ecosystems butman and raymond 2011 for example human induced eutrophication one of the most serious environmental issues in global lakes always accompanied with excess levels of nutrients high phytoplankton biomass reduced macrophyte biomass low oxygen availability and deteriorating water quality excess nutrients in eutrophic lakes have been shown to favor the dominance of cyanobacteria kosten et al 2012 paerl and huisman 2008 and result in the accumulation of algal biomass in freshwaters rosemond et al 2015 which in turn may increase the release and contribution of autochthonous dom in lake ecosystems furthermore major biogeochemical processes including photochemical and microbial degradation could be altered since autochthonous dom is more bio labile and less photoreactive while allochthonous dom is less bio labile and more photo labile benner and kaiser 2011 which thereby influence the carbon cycling in lakes in addition the eutrophication could strongly influence microbial community changes and mineralization of dom due to the hypoxia environment induced by nutrient loading increase and algal biomass and thus alter the cycling and transformation of carbon xenopoulos et al 2021 in conclusion lake eutrophication could thus alter the dom composition and transformation and potentially carbon cycling and budget in lake ecosystems however how eutrophication drives changes of dom remains poorly understood integrative studies of the fate and compositional dynamics of dom in distinct trophic status are therefore needed research has increasingly suggested that land use climate hydrology and nutrients influence the optical composition of dom kellerman et al 2014 williams et al 2016 to date however published results have primarily focused on the bulk property dynamics of dom while relationships between the molecular composition of dom and trophic status remain poorly studied recently high resolution mass spectrometry techniques such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms have shown great effectiveness for the analysis of dom at the molecular level gonsior et al 2011 waska et al 2015 because such analysis can determine the molecular formulas of dom components it is capable of providing more information on variations of the dom composition among distinct trophic state lakes the objective of this study was therefore to elucidate the influence of eutrophication on the optical properties and molecular composition of dom in lakes our previous study has found that the phytoplankton derived dom was remarkably distinct with terrestrial derived dom which is respectively characterized by aromatic and aliphatic liu et al 2020b the trophic state could increase autochthonous proportion of dom by promoting phytoplankton growth wei et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 we therefore hypothesized that eutrophication alters the dom composition by increasing autochthonous dom due to large quantities of algae biomass if so this alteration should be evident as a shift in dom from aromatic large sized to aliphatic characteristics with increasing trophic levels in this study we described the doc concentrations optical properties and molecular composition of dom in water samples obtained from 67 sites in 11 inland lakes the relationship between dom composition and trophic status was then assessed finally we discussed the implications for the biogeochemical processes of dom and global carbon budget estimations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study lakes and water sampling a total of 11 typical lakes lake taihu chaohu hongze poyang luoma datong daihai hulun yamdrok tso fuxian and dongting were selected across china to characterize dom fig 1 four to nine sampling points were set according to the area of each lake and in total of 67 sites were sampled during may 25 to september 13 2019 which was labeled as lake 1 lake 2 and so on fig 1 several water quality parameters were measured in situ including the water temperature ph alkalinity and conductivity using ysi 600 xlm sondes secchi disk depth sdd was measured with a secchi disk water samples were collected from a 0 1 0 m depth in 2 l acid cleaned plastic bottles and transported back to the laboratory within 4 hours in the laboratory most of the water samples were immediately filtered with precombusted 0 7 μm gf f glass fiber filter

statistical analysis statistical analyses including the mean values and linear and non linear fitting were performed using origin 2015 regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between the water chemistry parameters optical properties and ft icr ms data the significance levels are reported as not significant p 0 05 or significant p 0 05 the differences in the parameters between different trophic levels were assessed using independent sample t tests p 0 05 the principal component analysis pca of all parameters and patterns of molecular associations with tn tp codmn and chla were tested using spearman s rank correlation coefficient in r studio 3 4 3 software the spearman correlation was calculated between water chemistry parameters and the sum normalized intensity of peaks where the formulas could be unambiguously assigned and present in at least three samples the spearman correlations were then plotted in a van krevelen space for each water quality parameter in r studio 3 4 3 distribution maps of the lakes and sampling sites were made using arcgis 10 2 3 results 3 1 water chemistry and trophic state the sampled lakes and sampling sites covered a wide range of nutrient concentrations phytoplankton biomasses transparencies and trophic states table s1and s2 the tn tp codmn chla and sdd values respectively were in the ranges of 0 27 13 79 mg l 1 0 02 9 94 mg l 1 1 99 25 14 mg l 1 0 001 1731 09 mg m 3 and 0 02 5 40 m tsi ranged from 11 100 which covered a wide range of trophic states from oligotrophic to highly eutrophic for the 67 sampling sites the percentages of oligotrophic mesotrophic light eutrophic middle eutrophic and highly eutrophic sites were 5 40 29 22 and 5 respectively tsi chla was positively correlated with tsi tn r 0 37 p 0 01 and tsi tp r 0 49 p 0 001 fig 2 tsi chla showed a positive relationship with tsi sdd r 0 45 p 0 001 the relationships between nutrient concentrations chla and sdd revealed that the increase of nutrients input might accelerate phytoplankton production and cause a subsequent decrease in water transparency the δ13c doc values of the lakes ranged from 38 6 to 23 0 with a mean of 27 0 the δ15n doc values ranged from 10 5 to 5 7 with a mean of 2 8 table s1 the highest δ13c and δ15n values were observed in daihai with an average value of 24 5 0 1 and 5 1 0 4 respectively table s3 the δ2h and δ18o values of the lakes was 43 5 25 and 4 4 3 6 respectively table s1 the highest δ2h and δ18o values were also observed in daihai with an average value of 0 6 2 5 and 4 1 0 1 respectively table s3 however those stable isotope values did not show significant difference among different trophic state lakes fig s1 3 2 dom optical properties in distinct trophic state lakes the concentrations of doc in sampled lakes varied widely ranging from 1 31 to 52 20 mg l 1 with a mean of 11 12 mg l 1 table s1 fig s2 much higher doc values were found in lake daihai and hulun in inner mongolia table s2 fig s2 a 350 is generally used to represent the cdom concentration and ranged from 0 25 to 11 26 m 1 with a mean of 3 50 m 1 table s1 a positive linear correlation was found between a 350 and doc r 0 53 p 0 001 fig 3 a excluding the outliers of lake daihai and hulun which revealed that the concentrations of cdom could predict dom in most of the lakes additionally there was a positive linear relationship between tsi and doc when excluding the sites in lake daihai and hulun r 0 56 p 0 001 fig 3b tsi also showed a significant relationship with a 350 by fitting all sampling sites r 0 75 p 0 001 fig 3c the parallel increase between cdom absorption coefficient and tsi suggested that the trophic state of lakes can be predicted from cdom in this study the average cdom doc ratios were greater in eutrophic lakes than oligotrophic lakes but the difference was not significant fig 3d which simply indicated that the relative proportion of chromophores in bulk doc are not only affected by tsi across the investigated lakes interestingly enough much lower cdom doc ratios and greater doc and cdom concentrations were observed in lake daihai and hulun fig s2 table s4 suggesting their high contents of both dom and cdom but lower proportion of colored dom in addition much lower suva254 and greater m values a 250 a 365 were observed in these two lakes fig s3 table s4 further provide evidence for their low chromophore in distinct trophic state lakes notable differences were seen in dom absorption parameters suva254 the indicator of aromaticity was significantly higher in eutrophic lakes than that in oligotrophic lakes p 0 05 fig 3d however s275 295 and m value both of which indicate relative molecular size showed no significant difference between trophic levels in this study fig 3e five fluorescent components were identified by eem parafac modeling fig 4 c1 showed an excitation emission ex em maximum at 250 280 378 nm representing microbial humic like compounds murphy et al 2011 c2 showed ex em maximum at 250 330 422 nm similar to agricultural humic like substances or terrestrial derived reprocessed materials osburn et al 2012 c3 showed spectral characteristics similar to terrestrial humic like materials with ex em maximum at 265 370 466 nm murphy et al 2011 c4 280 326 nm showed spectral shapes similar to tryptophan like materials murphy et al 2013 c5 275 294 nm displayed spectral shapes similar to tyrosine like materials graeber et al 2012 all cdom fluorescent components significantly increased with increasing trophic levels fig s4 which revealed that both the contents of humic like allochthonous and protein like autochthonous dom increased in eutrophic lakes however the relative abundance of fluorescent components showed no significant difference among different trophic state lakes fig 3f the ratio of c2 c3 c4 c5 increased from oligotrophic state from light eutrophic state but decreased from light eutrophic state to hyper eutrophic state fig s4 3 3 molecular properties in dom in distinct trophic state lakes a total of 338 846 formulas and 19 886 unique formulas were detected in the ft icr ms database of lake samples fig s5 in lakes less impacted by human activity such as daihai yamdrok tso and hulun in inner mongolia and tibet the peaks detected were generally normally distributed in contrast several abnormally high abundance peaks of o3s classes were detected at m z 311 2 325 2 and 339 2 in lakes with strong interference from human activities three possible anions were c17h27o3s c18h29o3s and c19h31o3s the major components of alkylbenzene sulfonates las most widely used surfactants in domestic detergents mopper et al 2007 suggesting lakes in the lower reaches of the yangtze river are suffering from the discharge of domestic sewage higher molecular weights m zw double bond equivalents dbew and abundances of heteroatom atoms nw and sw were observed in lakes that were greatly influenced by human activities such as lake poyang hongze and luoma fig s6 alternatively the molecular parameters that indicated highly oxidized molecules such as the numbers of o atoms ow oxygen to carbon ratio o cw and nominal oxidation state of carbon noscw were greater in lakes less affected by human activities such as daihai hulun and yamdrok tso fig s6 the assigned molecular formulas consisted primarily of c h and o cho followed by formulas with additional n chon and s chos table s5 fig s6 highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds were most abundant followed by aliphatic polyphenolic and condensed or polycyclic aromatic compounds table s5 the mean weighted average composition of dom significantly differed across different trophic state lakes the unsaturated degree indicated by h cw and dbew increased first from oligotrophic to light eutrophic and then decreased from light eutrophic to hyper eutrophic fig 5 a and 5b and molecular weight m zw also showed a similar trend from oligotrophic to hyper eutrophic fig 5c however not all trophic state groups showed significant differences probably due to the limitations of our sample quantity additionally the number of s atom r 0 32 p 0 01 proportion of chons compounds r 0 55 p 0 01 and condensed or polycyclic aromatic compounds r 0 30 p 0 01 positively correlated with tsi fig 5d e and f in addition sum normalized compound intensities were correlated spearman s rank to trophic indicators of tn tp codmn and chla in general the relative abundance of polyphenols and lignin like compounds positively correlated to tn tp codmn and chla fig 6 the strong association between polyphenols and lignin like compounds suggested their similar source from terrestrial plants and their positive relationship with trophic indicators might indicate that increased input of allochthonous dom augmented the nutrient levels and phytoplankton biomass of the lakes we also observed an increased abundance of aliphatic compounds with increasing tp tn and codmn fig 6a c and d this revealed that substantial accumulation of autochthonous dom might be caused by the rapid release of aquatic macrophyte and algae in the lakes with high nutrient levels in conclusion both allochthonous and autochthonous dom in lakes with high trophic levels accumulated with the increase of nutrients in lakes 3 4 pca and correlation analyses in the pca analysis of the dom component characterized by uv vis eem and ft icr ms the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 30 7 and 16 5 of the variability of all indices which is closely related to dom source and unsaturation degree respectively fig 7 a the autochthonous fluorescent indicator including fi bix and fluorescent component c5 the molecular parameters including h cw aiw sw nw and relative abundance of compounds of chon chos chons and polyphenolic polycyclic aromatic aliphatic and protein like substances all showed positive pc1 loadings fig 7a this implies that the positive pc1 was characterized by high degree of saturation aromaticity and high relative abundance of heteroatom containing benzene ring containing substances and autochthonous substances of aliphatic and protein like which suggested that pc1 positively related to the concentrations of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom in contrast a 350 humic like fluorescent components c1 c3 molecular weight s275 295 m value m z oxidation degree o cw ow noscw stable isotope δ13c doc δ15n doc δ2h and δ18o and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds all showed obvious negative pc1 loadings illustrating that the negative pc1 axis was positively related to allochthonous dom relatively high pc1 scores were recorded in those lakes of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and yungui plateau fig 7b specially lake hulun daihai and yamdrok tso showed relatively large negative pc1 scores possibly indicating that these less human impacted lakes in inner mongolia and tibet were primarily subjected to allochthonous dom whereas those eutrophic lakes more influenced by human activity were accessible to both allochthonous and autochthonous dom chla and tsi which indicate the lake nutrient level and cyanobacterial bloom were also associated with pc1 scores fig 7b and c it should be noted that the indicator of tsi could not well distinguish the source of dom whether it is autochthonous or allochthonous since its no regular distribution on pc1 axis fig 7c in contrast concentrations of chla were strongly related to the pc1 scores since majority of sampling sites with high and low chla concentrations was mainly separated by pc1 axis fig 7b this indicated that the concentration of chla overrode tsi determines the release of autochthonous dom in lakes moreover the relative abundance of aliphatic compounds significantly increased with the pc1 score fig 7d p 0 001 further suggesting that autochthonous dom releases more aliphatic compounds in eutrophic lakes 4 discussions 4 1 molecular level changes in dom composition in distinct trophic state lakes numerous studies have used optical properties to investigate the transformation and fate of dom in freshwater lakes bittar et al 2015 derrien et al 2017 however these optical characterization methods can only measure the dynamics of cdom but not colorless components the burgeoning use of ft icr ms can provide detailed structural information about individual compounds and greatly advance molecular level understanding of dom dynamics seitzinger et al 2005 stubbins et al 2010 this study subsequently applied the combination of optical spectroscopy and ft icr ms to fully characterize dom in lakes with different trophic levels past studies relating optical parameters such as absorption coefficient and humification index to trophic status have been reported in lakes zhang et al 2018 and reservoirs shang et al 2019 however few studies have focused on the relationship between dom molecular composition and tsi through synchronously determination of optical and ft icr ms for lakes to the best of our knowledge our study is perhaps constituted the first comprehensive investigation of dom optical and molecular composition through over a large range of trophic gradients in china indeed as has been reported for lakes our results have shown strong relationships between tsi and dom both for its optical and molecular characteristics the positive correlation between tsi and a 350 fig 3c suggesting that the trophic state of lakes could be predicted from cdom absorption which is also consistent with previous studies in lakes zhang et al 2018 and reservoirs shang et al 2019 moreover the abundance of all fluorescence components from c1 c6 increased with the increasing trophic states fig s4 whereas the relative proportion of each components showed no significant difference in different trophic levels fig 3f previous studies suggested that cdom with lower hix indicate cdom with potentially more important autochthonous characteristics huguet et al 2009 and higher fi was used to assess more relative inputs from microbially derived autochthonous dom cory and mcknight 2005 since the negative correlation of fi with c2 c3 and hix with c4 c5 table s6 the ratio of c2 c3 c4 c5 was further used to analyze the variation of dom source the ratio increases firstly and then decreases from oligotrophic to hyper trophic lakes fig s4 it was thus proposed that more input of nutrients accompanied by increasing input of allochthonous dom result enhanced trophic level of lake whereas high trophic level potentially benefits for the growth of macrophytes and algae blooms and thus further increased the release of autochthonous dom this could be confirmed by the positive relationship between tn or tp and chla concentrations fig 2a and b in addition indicators including s275 295 and m value all revealed molecular weight increased firstly and then decreased from oligotrophic to hyper trophic lakes fig 3e further confirmed the conclusion we proposed moreover the significantly higher unsaturation degree indicated by h cw and dbew in light eutrophic lakes than in oligotrophic lakes but lower than in hyper trophic lakes revealed allochthonous dom characteristics were weakened by increasing release of autochthonous dom in hyper trophic lakes fig 5a and b the change trend of δ13c doc and δ15n doc from oligotrophic to hyper trophic lakes further revealed the dynamics of dom source predominated from allochthonous to the co exist of dom characterized by allochthonous and autochthonous fig s1 in terms of compounds more relative abundance of aliphatic protein like polyphenolic and polycyclic aromatic compounds in lakes with high nutrient levels also revealed that eutrophic lakes are characterized by greater contents of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom hood et al 2009 fig 7a and d additionally greater abundance of s containing compounds was observed in high trophic state lakes fig 5d and e which could be attributed to the increase input of human activities this was confirmed by the abnormally high abundance of alkylbenzene sulfonates especially in lakes in the lower reaches of the yangtze river with strong interference from human activities similar findings were also reported in coastal rivers and reservoirs of china he et al 2019 wang et al 2019 some previous studies have reported increase of humic like allochthonous dom with higher trophic state in aquatic ecosystems shang et al 2019 zhang et al 2009 while others proposed that autochthonous protein like components or microbial humic like substances increased notably with eutrophication zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 in fact we found both allochthonous and autochthonous dom all increased with increasing trophic state in our study the response of dom composition to global change and anthropogenic disturbance has been widely explored in recent years aparicio et al 2016 creed et al 2018 williams et al 2016 in our study we revealed that human induced eutrophication could be attributed to the increasing input of allochthonous dom and accompanying nutrients to receiving waters both excessive nutrients and dom input result in the accumulation of algal biomass in lake waters which may increase the accumulation of subsequently released autochthonous dom thus greater quantities of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom were detected in lake areas under intense anthropogenic influence and eutrophic lakes eutrophication has thus modified the structure of dom into more complex materials in particular we found strong associations between chla and the molecular components of dom fig 7b which further provided evidence for the accumulation of autochthonous dom from algal biomass in eutrophic lakes with respect to lake management our results suggest that the extensive problem of eutrophication and nuisance algae blooms in lakes can be most effectively controlled by external loading reduction 4 2 dom as a potential predictor of lake eutrophication cdom the major component of dom is an important optically active substance in aquatic ecosystems and affects the attenuation of ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation it has thus been widely used for the in situ monitoring of dom or lake trophic states in freshwater ecosystems toming et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 our study also found significant associations between doc and a 350 tsi and doc and tsi and a 350 fig 3a b and c respectively which indicated that cdom can serve as a surrogate for doc and cdom and dom can be generally used as indicators of lake eutrophic states however it should be noted that lake hulun and daihai were outliers when the linear fittings of cdom dom and dom tsi were conducted fig 3a and b interestingly both lakes have greater doc and cdom concentrations than other lakes with doc average concentrations of 51 mg l 1 and 30 mg l 1 respectively fig s2 cdom largely derived from leachate of decayed terrestrial and aquatic vegetation and autochthonous production of dom by phytoplankton is an important source in waters with low cdom levels griffin et al 2018 it has been reported that cdom often correlates strongly with bulk doc in highly colored lakes while there are weaker cdom doc relationships in low color lakes griffin et al 2018 thus the low chromophore of lake daihai and hulun reflected by their much lower cdom doc fig s2 smaller molecular weights lower aromatic degrees fig s3 could better explain their weaker relationship of cdom dom and dom tsi than others the most unique characteristics in daihai and hulun were their abnormal doc and codmn values which could be classified as eutrophic lakes if assessed by using of tsi these lakes contained high concentrations of dom but low chla concentrations and cdom doc ratio table s2 and s4 therefore some errors would likely occur if the proposed trophic state classification was applied to these kinds of lakes in north america and europe many such lakes have large amounts of humic dom but low nutrient concentrations due to overgrown coniferous forests and peat covered catchment areas jiang et al 2020 thus caution should be taken when performing tsi assessments using dom for these types of lakes as they have an abnormal relationship between tsi and doc the methods for evaluating eutrophication and water quality in lakes with high dom and low nutrient concentration also warrant further study which would be great significant for differentiated management of lakes in the whole country the large range of trophic states exhibited in our study provided a unique opportunity to explore the general trends in dom composition variability in relation to the trophic gradient of lakes however it is important to recognize the limitations of the data we presented firstly due to the financial constraints the number of sampled lakes was limited and it was not large enough to guarantee the significant difference of dom characteristics between different trophic levels secondly factors such as hydrology land use seasonal variability exert great influence on the quantity and quality of dom xenopoulos et al 2021 which could complicate the study issues thirdly some uncertainties during the measurement of ft icr ms such as spe recovery rate before ft icr ms and restricted analytical window with respect to the molecular weight range may also affect the accuracy of dom to some extent thus future studies should consider these limitations and try to obtain more sampling data to build a more definite correlation between dom and tsi 4 3 implications for dom biogeochemistry and the global carbon cycle dom is an abundant and mobile part of the aquatic carbon pool that includes molecules with a wide range of biogeochemical reactivities in aquatic ecosystems benner 2003 jaffé et al 2008 it is considered the largest pool of organic matter in natural waters accounting for 90 of the total organic matter coble 2007 para et al 2010 the source of the dom and the nature of its biogeochemical processes that shape the quantity and quality of dom play an important role in global carbon cycles xenopoulos et al 2021 in our study both the quantity and quality of dom were all re built by eutrophic process firstly the increased doc concentrations with increasing trophic levels fig 3b revealed that more organic matters are involved in the circulation process in eutrophic lakes secondly both allochthonous and autochthonous dom increased in high nutritional lakes fig 7a indicating eutrophication have accelerated terrestrial sourced dom loading into aquatic ecosystems and in turn improved the release of autochthonous dom this could accelerate the transportation and transformation of carbon among terrestrial water biological media thirdly more complex transformation such as photochemical and microbial decomposition process would occur and have drastically different effects on carbon budgets since more complex dom composition present in eutrophic lakes previous studies have reported that autochthonous dom including aliphatic materials and protein like peptide and amino acid compounds is generally bio labile and photo resistant whereas allochthonous dom including humic rich and aromatic compounds and polyphenols is broadly considered to be biologically recalcitrant and photoreactive kellerman et al 2014 kellerman et al 2018 on the one hand increasing input of allochthonous dom in eutrophic lakes we observed would undergo rapid photochemical reactions and the rebuilt dom after photochemical reactions makes them more susceptible to microbial degradation maberly et al 2013 on the other hand more autochthonous dom accumulated in eutrophic lakes is likely to be more bio labile which could accelerate the mineralization process of dom and probably leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions borges et al 2015 davidson et al 2015 maberly et al 2013 in conclusion under the background of human induced lake eutrophication the migration and transformation of organic matter from terrestrial to freshwater ecosystems before entering the atmosphere may be greatly enhanced and subsequently accelerate global carbon cycle processes conclusions the optical properties and molecular composition of dom in chinese lakes over a large range of trophic gradients were explored using uv vis eem parafac and ft icr ms analyses to comprehensively evaluate the association between dom composition and lake trophic status this study elucidated that the levels of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom increased in higher trophic level lakes lakes with high nutrient levels accumulated substantial quantities of allochthonous dom characterized by higher a 350 suva254 fluorescent component molecular weight unsaturation degree s containing compound and condensed or polycyclic aromatic compound values higher abundances of autochthonous dom characterized by increases in lipids and protein like compounds were also observed this study revealed that the increased inputs of nutrients and allochthonous dom to the receiving waters favors the dominance of algae and the accumulation of algal biomass in lake waters which in turn increases the accumulation of autochthonous dom released from this biomass these results imply that eutrophication and nuisance algae blooms in lakes can be controlled most effectively by external loading reduction moreover the complex dom components in lakes with increased human activities were more susceptible to photodegradation and biodegradation and thus may greatly enhance and subsequently accelerate global carbon cycle processes this possibility indicates important

16042,dissolved organic matter dom is an abundant and mobile part of the aquatic environment and plays important roles in aquatic biogeochemical cycles and the global carbon cycle recently eutrophication has become an important environmental issue in global lakes but how eutrophication drives changes in the molecular composition of dom along trophic gradients remains poorly understood we thus characterized 67 dom isolates from 11 lakes along a trophic gradient in china by using a combined approach including absorption spectroscopy excitation emission matrix fluorescence and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms our results indicated that dissolved organic carbon and absorption coefficients at 350 nm increased with increasing trophic status index the ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm and fluorescence intensity of all fluorescent components were higher in eutrophic lakes than in oligotrophic lakes dom in high trophic state lakes tended to be dominated by higher molecular weight unsaturation degree greater abundance of s containing compounds and condensed or polycyclic aromatic compounds than oligotrophic lakes additionally autochthonous dom characterized by more aliphatic compounds increased with the increasing trophic state we concluded that nutrient input along with allochthonous dom favors the lake eutrophication and subsequently increases the release and accumulation of autochthonous dom consequently eutrophication modifies the structure of the organic matter into more complex materials with increased input of allochthonous dom and increased release of autochthonous dom which could accelerate global carbon cycle processes our results here have potential to contribute significantly to future studies of dom dynamics in eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter trophic state optical properties fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry chinese lakes 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom within aquatic systems is a heterogeneous mixture of organic molecules of various origin and composition including sugars fatty acids and alkanes and complex polymeric molecules liu et al 2020a nebbioso and piccolo 2013 it is an abundant and mobile part of the aquatic carbon pool and serves as a fundamental link between terrestrial freshwater and oceanic carbon cycles cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 hence aquatic dom plays important roles in aquatic biogeochemical cycle and the global carbon cycle the quantity and quality of dom varies greatly in terms of the spatial and temporal scales of lakes and can be influenced by various human activities liu et al 2020a thus human induced changes in the quantity and composition of dom in lakes may have strong impacts on carbon cycles and must be better understood aquatic dom includes autochthonous and allochthonous sources mcintyre and guéguen 2013 autochthonous dom mainly originates from phytoplankton macrophytes or microbes due to either extracellular metabolic excretion or intracellular autolysis of cells upon death allochthonous dom is typically derived from soil organic matter and decaying terrestrial plants mcintyre and guéguen 2013 anthropogenic disturbance can affect the dominant dom composition biogeochemical processes and thus the carbon budget in freshwater ecosystems butman and raymond 2011 for example human induced eutrophication one of the most serious environmental issues in global lakes always accompanied with excess levels of nutrients high phytoplankton biomass reduced macrophyte biomass low oxygen availability and deteriorating water quality excess nutrients in eutrophic lakes have been shown to favor the dominance of cyanobacteria kosten et al 2012 paerl and huisman 2008 and result in the accumulation of algal biomass in freshwaters rosemond et al 2015 which in turn may increase the release and contribution of autochthonous dom in lake ecosystems furthermore major biogeochemical processes including photochemical and microbial degradation could be altered since autochthonous dom is more bio labile and less photoreactive while allochthonous dom is less bio labile and more photo labile benner and kaiser 2011 which thereby influence the carbon cycling in lakes in addition the eutrophication could strongly influence microbial community changes and mineralization of dom due to the hypoxia environment induced by nutrient loading increase and algal biomass and thus alter the cycling and transformation of carbon xenopoulos et al 2021 in conclusion lake eutrophication could thus alter the dom composition and transformation and potentially carbon cycling and budget in lake ecosystems however how eutrophication drives changes of dom remains poorly understood integrative studies of the fate and compositional dynamics of dom in distinct trophic status are therefore needed research has increasingly suggested that land use climate hydrology and nutrients influence the optical composition of dom kellerman et al 2014 williams et al 2016 to date however published results have primarily focused on the bulk property dynamics of dom while relationships between the molecular composition of dom and trophic status remain poorly studied recently high resolution mass spectrometry techniques such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms have shown great effectiveness for the analysis of dom at the molecular level gonsior et al 2011 waska et al 2015 because such analysis can determine the molecular formulas of dom components it is capable of providing more information on variations of the dom composition among distinct trophic state lakes the objective of this study was therefore to elucidate the influence of eutrophication on the optical properties and molecular composition of dom in lakes our previous study has found that the phytoplankton derived dom was remarkably distinct with terrestrial derived dom which is respectively characterized by aromatic and aliphatic liu et al 2020b the trophic state could increase autochthonous proportion of dom by promoting phytoplankton growth wei et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 we therefore hypothesized that eutrophication alters the dom composition by increasing autochthonous dom due to large quantities of algae biomass if so this alteration should be evident as a shift in dom from aromatic large sized to aliphatic characteristics with increasing trophic levels in this study we described the doc concentrations optical properties and molecular composition of dom in water samples obtained from 67 sites in 11 inland lakes the relationship between dom composition and trophic status was then assessed finally we discussed the implications for the biogeochemical processes of dom and global carbon budget estimations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study lakes and water sampling a total of 11 typical lakes lake taihu chaohu hongze poyang luoma datong daihai hulun yamdrok tso fuxian and dongting were selected across china to characterize dom fig 1 four to nine sampling points were set according to the area of

statistical analysis statistical analyses including the mean values and linear and non linear fitting were performed using origin 2015 regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between the water chemistry parameters optical properties and ft icr ms data the significance levels are reported as not significant p 0 05 or significant p 0 05 the differences in the parameters between different trophic levels were assessed using independent sample t tests p 0 05 the principal component analysis pca of all parameters and patterns of molecular associations with tn tp codmn and chla were tested using spearman s rank correlation coefficient in r studio 3 4 3 software the spearman correlation was calculated between water chemistry parameters and the sum normalized intensity of peaks where the formulas could be unambiguously assigned and present in at least three samples the spearman correlations were then plotted in a van krevelen space for each water quality parameter in r studio 3 4 3 distribution maps of the lakes and sampling sites were made using arcgis 10 2 3 results 3 1 water chemistry and trophic state the sampled lakes and sampling sites covered a wide range of nutrient concentrations phytoplankton biomasses transparencies and trophic states table s1and s2 the tn tp codmn chla and sdd values respectively were in the ranges of 0 27 13 79 mg l 1 0 02 9 94 mg l 1 1 99 25 14 mg l 1 0 001 1731 09 mg m 3 and 0 02 5 40 m tsi ranged from 11 100 which covered a wide range of trophic states from oligotrophic to highly eutrophic for the 67 sampling sites the percentages of oligotrophic mesotrophic light eutrophic middle eutrophic and highly eutrophic sites were 5 40 29 22 and 5 respectively tsi chla was positively correlated with tsi tn r 0 37 p 0 01 and tsi tp r 0 49 p 0 001 fig 2 tsi chla showed a positive relationship with tsi sdd r 0 45 p 0 001 the relationships between nutrient concentrations chla and sdd revealed that the increase of nutrients input might accelerate phytoplankton production and cause a subsequent decrease in water transparency the δ13c doc values of the lakes ranged from 38 6 to 23 0 with a mean of 27 0 the δ15n doc values ranged from 10 5 to 5 7 with a mean of 2 8 table s1 the highest δ13c and δ15n values were observed in daihai with an average value of 24 5 0 1 and 5 1 0 4 respectively table s3 the δ2h and δ18o values of the lakes was 43 5 25 and 4 4 3 6 respectively table s1 the highest δ2h and δ18o values were also observed in daihai with an average value of 0 6 2 5 and 4 1 0 1 respectively table s3 however those stable isotope values did not show significant difference among different trophic state lakes fig s1 3 2 dom optical properties in distinct trophic state lakes the concentrations of doc in sampled lakes varied widely ranging from 1 31 to 52 20 mg l 1 with a mean of 11 12 mg l 1 table s1 fig s2 much higher doc values were found in lake daihai and hulun in inner mongolia table s2 fig s2 a 350 is generally used to represent the cdom concentration and ranged from 0 25 to 11 26 m 1 with a mean of 3 50 m 1 table s1 a positive linear correlation was found between a 350 and doc r 0 53 p 0 001 fig 3 a excluding the outliers of lake daihai and hulun which revealed that the concentrations of cdom could predict dom in most of the lakes additionally there was a positive linear relationship between tsi and doc when excluding the sites in lake daihai and hulun r 0 56 p 0 001 fig 3b tsi also showed a significant relationship with a 350 by fitting all sampling sites r 0 75 p 0 001 fig 3c the parallel increase between cdom absorption coefficient and tsi suggested that the trophic state of lakes can be predicted from cdom in this study the average cdom doc ratios were greater in eutrophic lakes than oligotrophic lakes but the difference was not significant fig 3d which simply indicated that the relative proportion of chromophores in bulk doc are not only affected by tsi across the investigated lakes interestingly enough much lower cdom doc ratios and greater doc and cdom concentrations were observed in lake daihai and hulun fig s2 table s4 suggesting their high contents of both dom and cdom but lower proportion of colored dom in addition much lower suva254 and greater m values a 250 a 365 were observed in these two lakes fig s3 table s4 further provide evidence for their low chromophore in distinct trophic state lakes notable differences were seen in dom absorption parameters suva254 the indicator of aromaticity was significantly higher in eutrophic lakes than that in oligotrophic lakes p 0 05 fig 3d however s275 295 and m value both of which indicate relative molecular size showed no significant difference between trophic levels in this study fig 3e five fluorescent components were identified by eem parafac modeling fig 4 c1 showed an excitation emission ex em maximum at 250 280 378 nm representing microbial humic like compounds murphy et al 2011 c2 showed ex em maximum at 250 330 422 nm similar to agricultural humic like substances or terrestrial derived reprocessed materials osburn et al 2012 c3 showed spectral characteristics similar to terrestrial humic like materials with ex em maximum at 265 370 466 nm murphy et al 2011 c4 280 326 nm showed spectral shapes similar to tryptophan like materials murphy et al 2013 c5 275 294 nm displayed spectral shapes similar to tyrosine like materials graeber et al 2012 all cdom fluorescent components significantly increased with increasing trophic levels fig s4 which revealed that both the contents of humic like allochthonous and protein like autochthonous dom increased in eutrophic lakes however the relative abundance of fluorescent components showed no significant difference among different trophic state lakes fig 3f the ratio of c2 c3 c4 c5 increased from oligotrophic state from light eutrophic state but decreased from light eutrophic state to hyper eutrophic state fig s4 3 3 molecular properties in dom in distinct trophic state lakes a total of 338 846 formulas and 19 886 unique formulas were detected in the ft icr ms database of lake samples fig s5 in lakes less impacted by human activity such as daihai yamdrok tso and hulun in inner mongolia and tibet the peaks detected were generally normally distributed in contrast several abnormally high abundance peaks of o3s classes were detected at m z 311 2 325 2 and 339 2 in lakes with strong interference from human activities three possible anions were c17h27o3s c18h29o3s and c19h31o3s the major components of alkylbenzene sulfonates las most widely used surfactants in domestic detergents mopper et al 2007 suggesting lakes in the lower reaches of the yangtze river are suffering from the discharge of domestic sewage higher molecular weights m zw double bond equivalents dbew and abundances of heteroatom atoms nw and sw were observed in lakes that were greatly influenced by human activities such as lake poyang hongze and luoma fig s6 alternatively the molecular parameters that indicated highly oxidized molecules such as the numbers of o atoms ow oxygen to carbon ratio o cw and nominal oxidation state of carbon noscw were greater in lakes less affected by human activities such as daihai hulun and yamdrok tso fig s6 the assigned molecular formulas consisted primarily of c h and o cho followed by formulas with additional n chon and s chos table s5 fig s6 highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds were most abundant followed by aliphatic polyphenolic and condensed or polycyclic aromatic compounds table s5 the mean weighted average composition of dom significantly differed across different trophic state lakes the unsaturated degree indicated by h cw and dbew increased first from oligotrophic to light eutrophic and then decreased from light eutrophic to hyper eutrophic fig 5 a and 5b and molecular weight m zw also showed a similar trend from oligotrophic to hyper eutrophic fig 5c however not all trophic state groups showed significant differences probably due to the limitations of our sample quantity additionally the number of s atom r 0 32 p 0 01 proportion of chons compounds r 0 55 p 0 01 and condensed or polycyclic aromatic compounds r 0 30 p 0 01 positively correlated with tsi fig 5d e and f in addition sum normalized compound intensities were correlated spearman s rank to trophic indicators of tn tp codmn and chla in general the relative abundance of polyphenols and lignin like compounds positively correlated to tn tp codmn and chla fig 6 the strong association between polyphenols and lignin like compounds suggested their similar source from terrestrial plants and their positive relationship with trophic indicators might indicate that increased input of allochthonous dom augmented the nutrient levels and phytoplankton biomass of the lakes we also observed an increased abundance of aliphatic compounds with increasing tp tn and codmn fig 6a c and d this revealed that substantial accumulation of autochthonous dom might be caused by the rapid release of aquatic macrophyte and algae in the lakes with high nutrient levels in conclusion both allochthonous and autochthonous dom in lakes with high trophic levels accumulated with the increase of nutrients in lakes 3 4 pca and correlation analyses in the pca analysis of the dom component characterized by uv vis eem and ft icr ms the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 30 7 and 16 5 of the variability of all indices which is closely related to dom source and unsaturation degree respectively fig 7 a the autochthonous fluorescent indicator including fi bix and fluorescent component c5 the molecular parameters including h cw aiw sw nw and relative abundance of compounds of chon chos chons and polyphenolic polycyclic aromatic aliphatic and protein like substances all showed positive pc1 loadings fig 7a this implies that the positive pc1 was characterized by high degree of saturation aromaticity and high relative abundance of heteroatom containing benzene ring containing substances and autochthonous substances of aliphatic and protein like which suggested that pc1 positively related to the concentrations of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom in contrast a 350 humic like fluorescent components c1 c3 molecular weight s275 295 m value m z oxidation degree o cw ow noscw stable isotope δ13c doc δ15n doc δ2h and δ18o and highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds all showed obvious negative pc1 loadings illustrating that the negative pc1 axis was positively related to allochthonous dom relatively high pc1 scores were recorded in those lakes of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and yungui plateau fig 7b specially lake hulun daihai and yamdrok tso showed relatively large negative pc1 scores possibly indicating that these less human impacted lakes in inner mongolia and tibet were primarily subjected to allochthonous dom whereas those eutrophic lakes more influenced by human activity were accessible to both allochthonous and autochthonous dom chla and tsi which indicate the lake nutrient level and cyanobacterial bloom were also associated with pc1 scores fig 7b and c it should be noted that the indicator of tsi could not well distinguish the source of dom whether it is autochthonous or allochthonous since its no regular distribution on pc1 axis fig 7c in contrast concentrations of chla were strongly related to the pc1 scores since majority of sampling sites with high and low chla concentrations was mainly separated by pc1 axis fig 7b this indicated that the concentration of chla overrode tsi determines the release of autochthonous dom in lakes moreover the relative abundance of aliphatic compounds significantly increased with the pc1 score fig 7d p 0 001 further suggesting that autochthonous dom releases more aliphatic compounds in eutrophic lakes 4 discussions 4 1 molecular level changes in dom composition in distinct trophic state lakes numerous studies have used optical properties to investigate the transformation and fate of dom in freshwater lakes bittar et al 2015 derrien et al 2017 however these optical characterization methods can only measure the dynamics of cdom but not colorless components the burgeoning use of ft icr ms can provide detailed structural information about individual compounds and greatly advance molecular level understanding of dom dynamics seitzinger et al 2005 stubbins et al 2010 this study subsequently applied the combination of optical spectroscopy and ft icr ms to fully characterize dom in lakes with different trophic levels past studies relating optical parameters such as absorption coefficient and humification index to trophic status have been reported in lakes zhang et al 2018 and reservoirs shang et al 2019 however few studies have focused on the relationship between dom molecular composition and tsi through synchronously determination of optical and ft icr ms for lakes to the best of our knowledge our study is perhaps constituted the first comprehensive investigation of dom optical and molecular composition through over a large range of trophic gradients in china indeed as has been reported for lakes our results have shown strong relationships between tsi and dom both for its optical and molecular characteristics the positive correlation between tsi and a 350 fig 3c suggesting that the trophic state of lakes could be predicted from cdom absorption which is also consistent with previous studies in lakes zhang et al 2018 and reservoirs shang et al 2019 moreover the abundance of all fluorescence components from c1 c6 increased with the increasing trophic states fig s4 whereas the relative proportion of each components showed no significant difference in different trophic levels fig 3f previous studies suggested that cdom with lower hix indicate cdom with potentially more important autochthonous characteristics huguet et al 2009 and higher fi was used to assess more relative inputs from microbially derived autochthonous dom cory and mcknight 2005 since the negative correlation of fi with c2 c3 and hix with c4 c5 table s6 the ratio of c2 c3 c4 c5 was further used to analyze the variation of dom source the ratio increases firstly and then decreases from oligotrophic to hyper trophic lakes fig s4 it was thus proposed that more input of nutrients accompanied by increasing input of allochthonous dom result enhanced trophic level of lake whereas high trophic level potentially benefits for the growth of macrophytes and algae blooms and thus further increased the release of autochthonous dom this could be confirmed by the positive relationship between tn or tp and chla concentrations fig 2a and b in addition indicators including s275 295 and m value all revealed molecular weight increased firstly and then decreased from oligotrophic to hyper trophic lakes fig 3e further confirmed the conclusion we proposed moreover the significantly higher unsaturation degree indicated by h cw and dbew in light eutrophic lakes than in oligotrophic lakes but lower than in hyper trophic lakes revealed allochthonous dom characteristics were weakened by increasing release of autochthonous dom in hyper trophic lakes fig 5a and b the change trend of δ13c doc and δ15n doc from oligotrophic to hyper trophic lakes further revealed the dynamics of dom source predominated from allochthonous to the co exist of dom characterized by allochthonous and autochthonous fig s1 in terms of compounds more relative abundance of aliphatic protein like polyphenolic and polycyclic aromatic compounds in lakes with high nutrient levels also revealed that eutrophic lakes are characterized by greater contents of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom hood et al 2009 fig 7a and d additionally greater abundance of s containing compounds was observed in high trophic state lakes fig 5d and e which could be attributed to the increase input of human activities this was confirmed by the abnormally high abundance of alkylbenzene sulfonates especially in lakes in the lower reaches of the yangtze river with strong interference from human activities similar findings were also reported in coastal rivers and reservoirs of china he et al 2019 wang et al 2019 some previous studies have reported increase of humic like allochthonous dom with higher trophic state in aquatic ecosystems shang et al 2019 zhang et al 2009 while others proposed that autochthonous protein like components or microbial humic like substances increased notably with eutrophication zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 in fact we found both allochthonous and autochthonous dom all increased with increasing trophic state in our study the response of dom composition to global change and anthropogenic disturbance has been widely explored in recent years aparicio et al 2016 creed et al 2018 williams et al 2016 in our study we revealed that human induced eutrophication could be attributed to the increasing input of allochthonous dom and accompanying nutrients to receiving waters both excessive nutrients and dom input result in the accumulation of algal biomass in lake waters which may increase the accumulation of subsequently released autochthonous dom thus greater quantities of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom were detected in lake areas under intense anthropogenic influence and eutrophic lakes eutrophication has thus modified the structure of dom into more complex materials in particular we found strong associations between chla and the molecular components of dom fig 7b which further provided evidence for the accumulation of autochthonous dom from algal biomass in eutrophic lakes with respect to lake management our results suggest that the extensive problem of eutrophication and nuisance algae blooms in lakes can be most effectively controlled by external loading reduction 4 2 dom as a potential predictor of lake eutrophication cdom the major component of dom is an important optically active substance in aquatic ecosystems and affects the attenuation of ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation it has thus been widely used for the in situ monitoring of dom or lake trophic states in freshwater ecosystems toming et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 our study also found significant associations between doc and a 350 tsi and doc and tsi and a 350 fig 3a b and c respectively which indicated that cdom can serve as a surrogate for doc and cdom and dom can be generally used as indicators of lake eutrophic states however it should be noted that lake hulun and daihai were outliers when the linear fittings of cdom dom and dom tsi were conducted fig 3a and b interestingly both lakes have greater doc and cdom concentrations than other lakes with doc average concentrations of 51 mg l 1 and 30 mg l 1 respectively fig s2 cdom largely derived from leachate of decayed terrestrial and aquatic vegetation and autochthonous production of dom by phytoplankton is an important source in waters with low cdom levels griffin et al 2018 it has been reported that cdom often correlates strongly with bulk doc in highly colored lakes while there are weaker cdom doc relationships in low color lakes griffin et al 2018 thus the low chromophore of lake daihai and hulun reflected by their much lower cdom doc fig s2 smaller molecular weights lower aromatic degrees fig s3 could better explain their weaker relationship of cdom dom and dom tsi than others the most unique characteristics in daihai and hulun were their abnormal doc and codmn values which could be classified as eutrophic lakes if assessed by using of tsi these lakes contained high concentrations of dom but low chla concentrations and cdom doc ratio table s2 and s4 therefore some errors would likely occur if the proposed trophic state classification was applied to these kinds of lakes in north america and europe many such lakes have large amounts of humic dom but low nutrient concentrations due to overgrown coniferous forests and peat covered catchment areas jiang et al 2020 thus caution should be taken when performing tsi assessments using dom for these types of lakes as they have an abnormal relationship between tsi and doc the methods for evaluating eutrophication and water quality in lakes with high dom and low nutrient concentration also warrant further study which would be great significant for differentiated management of lakes in the whole country the large range of trophic states exhibited in our study provided a unique opportunity to explore the general trends in dom composition variability in relation to the trophic gradient of lakes however it is important to recognize the limitations of the data we presented firstly due to the financial constraints the number of sampled lakes was limited and it was not large enough to guarantee the significant difference of dom characteristics between different trophic levels secondly factors such as hydrology land use seasonal variability exert great influence on the quantity and quality of dom xenopoulos et al 2021 which could complicate the study issues thirdly some uncertainties during the measurement of ft icr ms such as spe recovery rate before ft icr ms and restricted analytical window with respect to the molecular weight range may also affect the accuracy of dom to some extent thus future studies should consider these limitations and try to obtain more sampling data to build a more definite correlation between dom and tsi 4 3 implications for dom biogeochemistry and the global carbon cycle dom is an abundant and mobile part of the aquatic carbon pool that includes molecules with a wide range of biogeochemical reactivities in aquatic ecosystems benner 2003 jaffé et al 2008 it is considered the largest pool of organic matter in natural waters accounting for 90 of the total organic matter coble 2007 para et al 2010 the source of the dom and the nature of its biogeochemical processes that shape the quantity and quality of dom play an important role in global carbon cycles xenopoulos et al 2021 in our study both the quantity and quality of dom were all re built by eutrophic process firstly the increased doc concentrations with increasing trophic levels fig 3b revealed that more organic matters are involved in the circulation process in eutrophic lakes secondly both allochthonous and autochthonous dom increased in high nutritional lakes fig 7a indicating eutrophication have accelerated terrestrial sourced dom loading into aquatic ecosystems and in turn improved the release of autochthonous dom this could accelerate the transportation and transformation of carbon among terrestrial water biological media thirdly more complex transformation such as photochemical and microbial decomposition process would occur and have drastically different effects on carbon budgets since more complex dom composition present in eutrophic lakes previous studies have reported that autochthonous dom including aliphatic materials and protein like peptide and amino acid compounds is generally bio labile and photo resistant whereas allochthonous dom including humic rich and aromatic compounds and polyphenols is broadly considered to be biologically recalcitrant and photoreactive kellerman et al 2014 kellerman et al 2018 on the one hand increasing input of allochthonous dom in eutrophic lakes we observed would undergo rapid photochemical reactions and the rebuilt dom after photochemical reactions makes them more susceptible to microbial degradation maberly et al 2013 on the other hand more autochthonous dom accumulated in eutrophic lakes is likely to be more bio labile which could accelerate the mineralization process of dom and probably leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions borges et al 2015 davidson et al 2015 maberly et al 2013 in conclusion under the background of human induced lake eutrophication the migration and transformation of organic matter from terrestrial to freshwater ecosystems before entering the atmosphere may be greatly enhanced and subsequently accelerate global carbon cycle processes conclusions the optical properties and molecular composition of dom in chinese lakes over a large range of trophic gradients were explored using uv vis eem parafac and ft icr ms analyses to comprehensively evaluate the association between dom composition and lake trophic status this study elucidated that the levels of both allochthonous and autochthonous dom increased in higher trophic level lakes lakes with high nutrient levels accumulated substantial quantities of allochthonous dom characterized by higher a 350 suva254 fluorescent component molecular weight unsaturation degree s containing compound and condensed or polycyclic aromatic compound values higher abundances of autochthonous dom characterized by increases in lipids and protein like compounds were also observed this study revealed that the increased inputs of nutrients and allochthonous dom to the receiving waters favors the dominance of algae and the accumulation of algal biomass in lake waters which in turn increases the accumulation of autochthonous dom released from this biomass these results imply that eutrophication and nuisance algae blooms in lakes can be controlled most effectively by external loading reduction moreover the complex dom components in lakes with increased human activities were more susceptible to photodegradation and biodegradation and thus may greatly enhance and subsequently accelerate global carbon cycle processes this possibility indicates important

16043,antibiotic resistance genes args have become an important public health concern particularly although several args have been identified in wastewater treatment plants wwtps very few studies have characterized their impacts on reactor performance therefore our study sought to investigate the effect of a representative conjugative transfer plasmid rp4 encoding multidrug resistance genes on ammonia oxidation to achieve this we established sequencing batch reactors sbrs and a conjugation model with e coli donor strains carrying the rp4 plasmid and a typical ammonia oxidating aob bacterial strain nitrosomonas europaea atcc 25978 as a recipient to investigate the effect of conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 on aob our findings demonstrated that the rp4 plasmid carried by the donor strains could be transferred to aob in the sbr and to nitrosomonas europaea atcc 25978 in sbr treated with donor strains carrying the rp4 plasmid ammonia removal efficiency continuously decreased to 71 once the rp4 plasmid entered n europaea atcc 25978 in the conjugation model ammonia removal was significantly inhibited and nitrite generation was decreased furthermore the expression of several functional genes related to ammonia oxidation in aob was suppressed following the transfer of the rp4 plasmid including amoa amoc hao nirk and norb in contrast the cytl gene encoding cytochrome p460 was upregulated these results demonstrated the ecological risk of args in wwtps and therefore measures must be taken to avoid their transfer graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

strains with the rp4 plasmid can affect the nitrogen removal efficiency in a membrane bioreactor mbr yang et al 2013 and a granular sequencing batch reactor gsbr zou et al 2016 these results indicated that args in biological wastewater treatment system are likely to continually affect the growth and metabolism of functional bacteria via horizontal gene transfer nevertheless the mechanisms by which args affect pollutant removal efficiency in bioreactors remain unclear and no definite evidence of arg transfer to functional bacteria has been identified horizontal transfer a key source of genetic diversity in bacteria is an important mechanism through which bacteria obtain plasmids ochman et al 2000 however these plasmids can also cause genetic conflict in hosts baltrus 2013 host genome components are often directly involved in determining plasmid encoded fitness cost as well as different fitness effects in different host backgrounds humphrey et al 2012 for instance the host genome can be disrupted by foreign dna integration canchaya et al 2004 and affected by the received plasmid koraimann and wagner 2014 more importantly the interaction between the proteins encoded by the newly acquired genes and the host may disturb the metabolic network of the host gonçalves et al 2012 pál et al 2005 san millan et al 2015 previous studies have reported that plasmids preferentially alter the expression of metabolic genes in pseudomonas aeruginosa niu et al 2015 san millan et al 2018 therefore args as extracellular genes that are carried by plasmids would likely affect the metabolism of their hosts nevertheless very few studies have evaluated the effects of arg plasmid transfer on sludge activity and pollutant removal efficiency in wwtps nitrogen removal is one of the most important purposes of wwtps for two step nitrification process ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa play important roles in reactors by removing ammonia from biological wastewater treatment systems the ammonia oxidation process nh4 no2 carried out by aob and aoa is the first and rate limiting step of nitrification kuypers et al 2018 lehtovirta morley et al 2014 and is therefore considered the most critical process the ammonia oxidation process can be further divided into two more steps with hydroxylamine nh2oh as an intermediate ammonia monooxygenase amo is the rate limiting enzyme that converts ammonia to hydroxylamine which is then converted to nitrite by hydroxylamine oxidase hao rahimi et al 2020 the regulation of amoa and hao which encode these enzymes is therefore crucial and largely determines wastewater treatment performance both aob and aoa contributed to n2o generation through abiotic reaction while nitrification denitrification process was only carried out by aob stieglmeier et al 2014 if aob acquire args via horizontal transfer the aob extracellular electron transport related to ammonia oxidation is likely to be influenced by proteins encoded by args particularly membrane proteins furthermore the expression of these newly acquired genes would likely lead to abnormal metabolism through the disruption of key physiological genes such as amoa and hao to verify the effect of the rp4 plasmid on the ammonia oxidation metabolism of aob four lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs were constructed and operated in parallel conjugation between the rp4 plasmid and activated sludge was observed using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish furthermore the conjugation between aob and donor strains carrying rp4 plasmid was demonstrated by crossing heterotrophs and autotrophs ammonia nitrogen removal was inhibited after rp4 plasmid inoculation both in sbrs and in pure aob quantitative pcr q pcr was used to quantify the abundance of the rp4 plasmid and the expression of ammonia oxidation genes taken together our findings provided evidence of adverse effects caused by arg exposure in biological sewage treatment systems and revealed the potential mechanisms of these effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and culture conditions all strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in table

bsw japan furthermore the e coli k12 rif rp4 strain sludge samples without the rp4 plasmid and a pure culture of an aob nitrosomonas europaea atcc 25 978 were used as controls 2 5 conjugation experiment e coli hb101 with the rp4 plasmid was used as the source of donor cells n europaea atcc 25 978 was used as the source of recipient cells donor strains were cultivated to 108 cfu ml whereas recipient strains were cultured to 106 cfu ml donor and recipient cells were mixed by vortexing after centrifugation the precipitates were added to 100 ml of a mixed medium consisting of 50 ml 2 liquid medium 50 ml 2 lb and antibiotics the mixture was incubated at 26 c in the dark with constant shaking at 100 rpm transconjugants were counted at 2 4 6 and 8 h the conjugative transfer rate was calculated using the following formula f n o t n o r where no t represents the number of transconjugants and no r is the number of recipients 2 6 n europaea atcc 25978 and n europaea atcc 25978 rp4 ammonia oxidation rate evaluation after conjugating for 4 h the mixture was centrifuged and transferred to 250 ml of liquid medium with antibiotics using pcr the transconjugant was identified as n europaea atcc 25 978 carrying the rp4 plasmid the pcr primers are summarized in table s1 transconjugant number was estimated based on the conjugative transfer rate the same number of aob was transferred to 250 ml of liquid medium without antibiotics as a control thus the same number of n europaea atcc 25 978 and n europaea atcc 25 978 rp4 were obtained after cultivating for 27 d the strains were transferred to fresh liquid medium without antibiotics and incubated for 12 h ammonia nitrogen and nitrite concentrations were monitored every 2 h via the nesslers reagent spectrophotometry method and ion chromatography respectively 2 7 detection of mrna expression in the ammonia oxidation rate evaluation experiment the total rna of n europaea atcc 25978 and n europaea atcc 25 978 rp4 was extracted using the trizol reagent thermo fisher scientific usa 5 μg rna was reverse transcribed as cdna with a reverse transcription kit tiangen fastking china real time pcr was carried out using sybr green thermo fisher scientific usa the absolute quantification method was used to quantify the functional genes related to nitrogen metabolism n europaea atcc 25 978 16s rrna was used as an internal control the relative abundance of the donor strain was determined based on the ratio between the absolute abundances of the donor strain and the total bacteria the same procedure was used to determine the relative abundance of the rp4 plasmid the primer sequences are summarized in table s1 these primers were synthesized by sangon shanghai sangon biological engineering technology china the reaction conditions used for the two step pcr procedure were the following an initial denaturation step at 95 c for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 5 s and 60 c for 31 s the signal was collected at 31 s and a dissociation stage at 95 c for 15 s 60 c for 1 min and 95 c for 15 sc real time pcr was conducted using a bio rad iq5 real time pcr system 2 8 statistics all statistical analyses were performed using the spaw statistics 18 software spss inc usa the data with homogeneity of variance was tested by analysis of variance anova whereas heterogeneous data was tested using a non parametric test such as the friedman test a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 3 results 3 1 sbr operation and effects of donor strain four sbrs were constructed using the same inoculated sludge from the stable operation sbr maintained in our lab microbial aggregates in reactors were mainly flocculent sludge and the mlss of the total sludge was 1200 1500 mg l synthetic wastewater was used as influent with an initial chemical oxygen demand cod of 100 mg l total nh4 n of 25 mg l and an nh4 n efficiency 90 min of 99 the mlss in the effluent was 24 95 0 91 mg ml repeated measures anova indicated that the differences between the four sbrs were not statistically significant p 0 05 fig s1 illustrates the variation in nh4 n no2 n no3 n and nh4 n removal efficiency in a typical cycle nh4 n was undetected after 90 min and the removal efficiency was almost 100 no2 n was detected during the first 120 min and peaked at 3 mg l no3 n was accumulated throughout the cycle and increased from 18 mg l to almost 42 mg l once the sbrs were stable e coli k12 rif e coli k12 rif rp4 and rp4 plasmids were added to the sbrs labeled a b and c respectively sbr d was untreated the cod removal efficiency in the four sbrs were not significantly different during the 28 days of operation as shown in fig 1c d although the ammonia removal efficiencies in sbr a c and d were essentially unchanged during the early stages a significant decrease was observed in sbr b after inoculation the efficiency of sbr b decreased below 90 on day 12 and this lower efficiency lasted for 10 days and decreased further to 71 on day 20 but recovered to 94 on day 23 9 days after ceasing inoculation upon analyzing typical cycles on days 1 10 and 20 fig s2 it was obvious that the nh4 n removal efficiency decreased in sbr b and no2 n and no3 n generation rates also decreased the peak no2 n levels of sbr b were lower than those of the other three sbrs and the reduced generation of no2 n balanced the total nitrogen content due to the slow increase in no3 n furthermore the mlss of total sludge in the sbr b decreased to 700 mg l at the end of the operation and the mlss in effluent fig s3 increased to an average of 29 mg l after the first inoculation but decreased to an average of 25 mg ml during the final seven days anova revealed that the differences before and after inoculation in sbr b were statistically significant p 0 05 in the other three sbrs the mlss in the effluent was maintained between 20 mg l and 30 mg l and no significant differences were observed before and after inoculation p 0 05 3 2 retention of rp4 plasmid in sbr fig 2 a illustrates the variations in the ratio of the donor strain and the rp4 plasmid to total bacteria in the sbr b the relative abundance of the donor strain and the rp4 plasmid all reached a peak beyond 10 4 during inoculation but declined differently as soon as inoculation stopped on day 28 the final relative abundance of the donor strain and the rp4 plasmid were 3 6 10 7 and 3 5 10 5 respectively to quantify the differences between the downtrend of the donor stain and the rp4 plasmid linear fitting was employed after log transforming the relative abundance 8 28 d and the differences between the slopes of the two fitting lines was tested by statistical analysis the fitting results indicated that the decline slope of the donor stain 0 48 was significantly lower p 0 05 than that of the rp4 plasmid 0 13 to further explore whether the rp4 plasmid remained in the aob the rp4 plasmid and aob were detected by fish fig 2b shows the total bacteria aob and rp4 plasmid in blue green and red respectively the areas marked by arrows appeared white as a consequence of the co localization of blue green and red dyes indicating that the rp4 plasmid was transferred from the donor strains to the aob furthermore no co localization of the three fluorescein dyes was observed in the control groups 3 3 conjugative transfer of rp4 plasmid between donor strains and n europaea atcc25978 n europaea atcc25978 was used as a model strain in the following experiments after 30 days of culture the total amount of n europaea reached up to 107cfu ml with a 103cfu ml initial inoculum fig s4a the bacterial density increased rapidly from days 2 to 10 entering the platform period after 16 days of culture typical colonies could be observed as white colonies fig s4c ammoxidation rate reached 8 4 mg l d at 8 d fig s4d and the average ammoxidation rate was 1 6 mg l d because the donor strains died gradually in the liquid medium with antibiotics until complete death 17 days later fig s5 the bacteria that survived were considered transconjugant n europaea atcc25978 rp4 the color of the transconjugant colony screened on agar plates was red fig 3 a which was different from that of normal n europaea atcc25978 fig 3b the transconjugant was further identified as n europaea atcc25978 with the rp4 plasmid via pcr fig 3c d as shown in fig 3e the conjugational transfer frequency reached a maximum of 6 28 10 3 at 2 h as horizontal transfer progressed the conjugational transfer frequency decreased gradually reaching 6 41 10 4 at 8 h therefore our findings demonstrated that n europaea atcc25978 was able to obtain the rp4 plasmid from the donor strains via conjugative transfer 3 4 ammonia oxidation differences between n europaea atcc25978 and n europaea atcc25978 rp4 n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was obtained via the conjugation experiment described above n europaea atcc25978 rp4 growth and ammonia oxidation ability were compared with n europaea atcc25978 as shown in fig 4 a the growth curves of n europaea atcc25978 and n europaea atcc25978 rp4 were essentially identical under the same culture conditions the maximum bacterial density reached 6 106 cfu ml for both n europaea atcc25978 rp4 and n europaea atcc25978 this suggests that n europaea atcc25978 maintained consistent growth characteristics after rp4 plasmid obtained regarding the metabolic rate of the tested bacterial strains n europaea atcc25978 exhibited higher ammonia oxidation rates than n europaea atcc25978 rp4 with an initial ammonia nitrogen concentration of 64 mg l the average ammonia oxidation rate of n europaea atcc25978 was 22 67 whereas that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was only 7 53 fig 4b the maximum ammonia oxidation rate of n europaea atcc25978 reached 40 09 whereas that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was only 13 97 the largest ammonia oxidation rate difference between these two strains was 32 38 after 16 days of culture on day 8 the ammonia nitrogen utilization rate of n europaea atcc25978 was 79 56 whereas that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was 30 54 on day 17 the ammonia nitrogen utilization rates of n europaea atcc25978 and n europaea atcc25978 rp4 were 96 04 and 61 93 respectively taken together our findings demonstrated that n europaea atcc25978 rp4 had a significantly lower ammonia nitrogen utilization rates than n europaea atcc25978 regarding ammonia reduction 60 79 mg l no2 n was generated by n europaea atcc25978 at the end of culture whereas n europaea atcc25978 rp4 produced almost no no2 n fig 4d which was inconsistent with their ammonia nitrogen consumption rates to verify the low ammonia nitrogen utilization rate of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 liquid medium with different initial ammonia nitrogen concentrations 50 30 20 mg l was used to evaluate metabolic ability in order to eliminate the influence of assimilation on of bacterial growth two strains were transferred to fresh medium after being cultured for 18 d and nh4 n and no2 n were monitored every 2 h for 12 h when the initial ammonia concentration was 50 mg l the ammonia consumption of n europaea atcc25978 was significantly higher than that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 at every monitoring point fig 5 a the total ammonia consumption of n europaea atcc25978 was 20 mg l whereas that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was 10 mg l similarly the ammonia consumption rates of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 were significantly lower than those of n europaea atcc25978 after 6 h when the initial ammonia concentrations were 20 and 30 mg l fig 5b and fig 5c there was also a significant difference in no2 n generation between n europaea atcc25978 and n europaea atcc25978 rp4 regardless of the initial ammonia concentration fig 7d f at 12 h of culture n europaea atcc25978 generated 6 57 8 33 mg l no2 n in contrast the no2 n generation rate of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was only 0 016 0 48 mg l which was far lower than its ammonia consumption rates 3 5 mrna expression of nitrogen metabolism related genes n europaea could convert ammonia to nitrite independently with potential nitrogenous products such as n2o and no therefore our study analyzed the expression of functional genes related to the ammonia oxidation processes the mrna expression levels of the amoa amoc hao nirk and norb genes of n europaea atcc25978 was higher than that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 in the whole experiment fig 6 which was consistent with the higher ammonia consumption rates of n europaea atcc25978 in contrast the cytl expression of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was significantly higher than the atcc25978 strain at every point the function of the cytl gene will be further discussed in the next section 4 discussion 4 1 horizontal transfer of the rp4 plasmid reduced the ammonia nitrogen removal capacity of the sbr previous studies have demonstrated that the rp4 plasmid can affect the performance of different reactors yang et al 2013 zou et al 2016 here more precise experiments were conducted to explore this phenomenon in sbrs all experiments were repeated four times with similar results synthetic wastewater with less cod and more nh4 n was used to accumulate aob in the sbrs during operation to explore the influence of the rp4 plasmid or horizontal transfer on nitrogen removal four sbrs were compared continuously addition strategy last 7 days simulated the situation that a large number of args carried by hosts entered wwtps abruptly during a period the sbr ammonia oxidation capacity changes were evaluated during args shock loading and ammonia oxidation recoveries were further evaluated after args shock loading sbr b exhibited a decrease in nh4 n removal efficiency after inoculation fig 1 these findings suggested that the rp4 plasmid might affect this process in sbrs which was consistent with previous findings in mbrs yang et al 2013 and gsbrs zou et al 2016 as shown in fig s3 the conversion of ammonia to nitrite was inhibited by inoculation whereas the conversion of nitrite to nitrate remained essentially unaffected no2 n peaked at a level lower than that in sbr d indicating that the conversion of nitrite to nitrate was not inhibited this suggests that the ability of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nobu et al 2014 to catalyze nitrite oxidation was not significantly affected after inoculation therefore nh4 n removal efficiency was likely decreased by aob due to the influence of the rp4 plasmid and high nh4 n concentrations in the effluent may lead to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems similar with aob aoa and commomax are able to complete ammonia oxidation kuypers et al 2018 wang et al 2021 while nitrosomonas was observed as the most abundant ammonia oxidizing microorganism in sbr by metagenomic data thus aob was chosen to build conjugation model as a recipient strain the args influence on aoa and comammox would be further investigated in the next step 4 2 conjugation between the rp4 plasmid and aob the conjugation between the rp4 plasmid and aob has been previously reported geisenberger et al 1999 here fish was used to investigate this phenomenon in sbrs fig 2 aerobic bacteria including aob were mainly found on the surface of aggregates due to limitations in mass transfer and conjugation was abundant in this region furthermore as shown in fig 2 the donor strain exhibited a more significant decrease in number compared with the strain with the rp4 plasmid this further confirmed that conjugation took place between the donor strains and potential recipients furthermore once the rp4 plasmid was transferred it could maintain in the sbr for a long time additionally the potential recipients in the sbr dosed with the naked rp4 plasmid were not competent and transformation was inefficient horizontal gene transfer of the rp4 plasmid in this sbr was predictably lower than in the sbr with the e coli k12 rif rp4 strain as a donor the aob in the activated sludge were then isolated and purified after which they were identified as n europaea atcc25978 the rp4 plasmid is a typical incp α type multidrug resistance plasmid with kanamycin tetracycline and ampicillin resistance and a wide potential host range pansegrau et al 1994 it was reported that the rp4 plasmid could be transferred from pseudomonas putida kt2440 to activated sludge on a microfluidic chip with an average transfer frequency of 2 5 10 3 qiu et al 2018 to further evaluate the conjugation between the rp4 plasmid and aob n europaea atcc25978 a model aob strain was used as a recipient strain for horizontal transfer the conjugational transfer frequency between the donor strains and n europaea atcc25978 reached 6 28 10 3 at 2 h this conjugational transfer frequency was much higher than that of many kinds of recipient strains especially non e coli strains when e coli nk5449 was used as the recipient strain the rp4 plasmid transfer frequency was 10 5 jiao et al 2017 however the rp4 conjugation transfer frequency from e coli to salmonella was 2 06 10 6 whereas that from e coli to enterococcus was only 1 3 10 7 thomas and nielsen 2005 these findings indicated that cross species rp4 plasmid transfer was relatively infrequent however our study identified a high rp4 plasmid conjugation transfer frequency between e coli i e a heterotroph and n europaea i e an autotroph on one hand n europaea atcc 25 978 did not grow during conjugation due to its low growth rate on the other hand the high ratio of donor and recipient cells was more favorable to transconjugant generation mølbak et al 2007 due to the susceptibility of aob lehtovirta morley et al 2014 the ammonia oxidation capacity of these bacteria would be greatly affected by rp4 plasmid horizontal transfer in turn excessive n levels in wastewater would not be removed via wwtps as expected leading to water eutrophication teikari et al 2018 4 3 mechanisms by which the rp4 plasmid inhibits aob ammoxidation given that the transferred rp4 plasmid might lower the nh4 n removal efficiency of aob studies were conducted to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon to achieve this the expression of genes related to nitrogen metabolism was analyzed there were two key functional enzymes involved in nitritation lehtovirta morley et al 2014 ammonia monooxygenase amo and hydroxylamine oxidase hao amo catalyzes nh4 nh2oh whereas hao catalyzes nh2oh no2 furthermore hao could also oxidize nh4 no in n europaea atcc 25 978 rp4 amo and hao mrna expression was significantly upregulated which was the main reason for the low ammonia nitrogen removal rates in contrast the expression of cytl was significantly higher in n europaea atcc 25 978 rp4 and was accompanied by almost no nitrite generation a previous study reported that cytl was strongly upregulated under anoxic conditions and contributed to n2o production yu et al 2018 the cytl gene encodes cytochrome p460 and was previously thought to oxidize nh2oh and no to no2 coleman and lancaster 2020 however cytl can also produce n2o instead of no2 as an alternative pathway in nh2oh detoxification under hypoxic conditions caranto et al 2016 these results indicated cytl activity was closely related to oxygen content but dissolved oxygen was not monitored in n europaea culture based on these observations fig 7 illustrates the possible mechanisms through which the rp4 plasmid diminishes ammonia nitrogen removal notably the aob colonies turned red after rp4 plasmid entered considering the correlation between cytl over expression and oxygen uptake it seemed that the colonies color change indicated the oxygen uptake capacity change of aob rp4 the high expression of cytl was compatible with the oxygen uptake decrease furthermore the mlss in effluent in the sbr dosed with e coli k12 rif rp4 increased significantly during inoculation and decreased gradually after inoculation fig s3 which suggested that the dissociation of aggregates and the deterioration of the sludge settling properties might be caused by the transferred rp4 plasmid regarding the pure aob culture the aob carrying the rp4 plasmid generated more extracellular polymers eps especially extracellular dna fig s6 which was consistent with the sludge sedimentation performance changes in the sbr this increase in the levels of eps which are known capping agents appears to affect the surface charge of the cells leading aob rp4 to generate n2o instead of no2 jain et al 2015 further the n2o production was observed in n europaea atcc25978 rp4 culture fig s7 this would also explain the observed nitrogen imbalances however gaseous nitrogen oxides were not monitored every point here including no and n2o further evidence on oxygen uptake and surface charge is still required conclusions our study demonstrated that the rp4 plasmid was transferred to aob autotrophic bacteria from the heterotrophic bacterium e coli both in sbrs and in vitro via horizontal transfer the ammonia nitrogen removal of the sbr treated with the donor strains decreased continuously and recovered slowly furthermore the ammonia oxidation capacities of the aobs significantly decreased once the rp4 plasmid was transferred additionally aob rp4 generated almost no nitrite in short term experiments with different initial ammonia concentrations aob carrying rp4 also exhibited a downregulation of functional genes related to ammonia oxidation except cytl compared with normal aob the high expression of cytl could explain the low nitrite generation rates observed in this study however additional studies are required to identify the mechanisms by which rp4 affects gene expression in aob funding this

16043,antibiotic resistance genes args have become an important public health concern particularly although several args have been identified in wastewater treatment plants wwtps very few studies have characterized their impacts on reactor performance therefore our study sought to investigate the effect of a representative conjugative transfer plasmid rp4 encoding multidrug resistance genes on ammonia oxidation to achieve this we established sequencing batch reactors sbrs and a conjugation model with e coli donor strains carrying the rp4 plasmid and a typical ammonia oxidating aob bacterial strain nitrosomonas europaea atcc 25978 as a recipient to investigate the effect of conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 on aob our findings demonstrated that the rp4 plasmid carried by the donor strains could be transferred to aob in the sbr and to nitrosomonas europaea atcc 25978 in sbr treated with donor strains carrying the rp4 plasmid ammonia removal efficiency continuously decreased to 71 once the rp4 plasmid entered n europaea atcc 25978 in the conjugation model ammonia removal was significantly inhibited and nitrite generation was decreased furthermore the expression of several functional genes related to ammonia oxidation in aob was suppressed following the transfer of the rp4 plasmid including amoa amoc hao nirk and norb in contrast the cytl gene encoding cytochrome p460 was upregulated these results demonstrated the ecological risk of args in wwtps and therefore measures must be taken to avoid their transfer graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

and inappropriate use of antibiotics increases the likelihood of gene mutation and selection pressure resulting in the rapid propagation of antibiotic resistance genes args liu et al 2019 qiao et al 2018 furthermore args can be transferred between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer leading to their widespread dissemination in the environment arias and murray 2009 therefore args have been recently recognized as emerging environmental pollutants pruden et al 2006 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the primary point sources of environmental antibiotic resistant bacteria and args pak et al 2016 biological wastewater treatment is an extensively used process and it provides an opportunity for high density args in wastewater to propagate via horizontal gene transfer among bacteria from different taxonomic and ecological groups that inhabit the sewage sludge a great number of studies have concentrated on arg detection and monitoring in wwtps pazda et al 2019 sabri et al 2020 syranidou and kalogerakis 2022 wei et al 2018 nevertheless very few studies have characterized the impacts of args in wwtps particularly the evolutionary dynamics and fates of plasmid carrying bacteria in wwtps zhang et al 2021 wwtps aim to remove pollutants such as cod chemical oxygen demand and nitrogen to avoid water eutrophication nitrogen removal efficiency is an important indicator to measure the operational performance of wwtps moreover arg expression is closely linked to nitrogen cycling bacteria in wwtps yuan et al 2021 a previous study reported that the inoculation of donor strains with the rp4 plasmid can affect the nitrogen removal efficiency in a membrane bioreactor mbr yang et al 2013 and a granular sequencing batch reactor gsbr zou et al 2016 these results indicated that args in biological wastewater treatment system are likely to continually affect the growth and metabolism of functional bacteria via horizontal gene transfer nevertheless the mechanisms by which args affect pollutant removal efficiency in bioreactors remain unclear and no definite evidence of arg transfer to functional bacteria has been identified horizontal transfer a key source of genetic diversity in bacteria is an important mechanism through which bacteria obtain plasmids ochman et al 2000 however these plasmids can also cause genetic conflict in hosts baltrus 2013 host genome components are often directly involved in determining plasmid encoded fitness cost as well as different fitness effects in different host backgrounds humphrey et al 2012 for instance the host genome can be disrupted by foreign dna integration canchaya et al 2004 and affected by the received plasmid koraimann and wagner 2014 more importantly the interaction between the proteins encoded by the newly acquired genes and the host may disturb the metabolic network of the host gonçalves et al 2012 pál et al 2005 san millan et al 2015 previous studies have reported that plasmids preferentially alter the expression of metabolic genes in pseudomonas aeruginosa niu et al 2015 san millan et al 2018 therefore args as extracellular genes that are carried by plasmids would likely affect the metabolism of their hosts nevertheless very few studies have evaluated the effects of arg plasmid transfer on sludge activity and pollutant removal efficiency in wwtps nitrogen removal is one of the most important purposes of wwtps for two step nitrification process ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa play important roles in reactors by removing ammonia from biological wastewater treatment systems the ammonia oxidation process nh4 no2 carried out by aob and aoa is the first and rate limiting step of nitrification kuypers et al 2018 lehtovirta morley et al 2014 and is therefore considered the most critical process the ammonia oxidation process can be further divided into two more steps with hydroxylamine nh2oh as an intermediate ammonia monooxygenase amo is the rate limiting enzyme that converts ammonia to hydroxylamine which is then converted to nitrite by hydroxylamine oxidase hao rahimi et al 2020 the regulation of amoa and hao which encode these enzymes is therefore crucial and largely determines wastewater treatment performance both aob and aoa contributed to n2o generation through abiotic reaction while nitrification denitrification process was only carried out by aob stieglmeier et al 2014 if aob acquire args via horizontal transfer the aob extracellular electron transport related to ammonia oxidation is likely to be influenced by proteins encoded by args particularly membrane proteins furthermore the expression of these newly acquired genes would likely lead to abnormal metabolism through the disruption of key physiological genes such as amoa and hao to verify the effect of the rp4 plasmid on the ammonia oxidation metabolism of aob four lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs were constructed and operated in parallel conjugation between the rp4 plasmid and activated sludge was observed using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish furthermore the conjugation between aob and donor strains carrying rp4 plasmid was demonstrated by crossing heterotrophs and autotrophs ammonia nitrogen removal was inhibited after rp4 plasmid inoculation both in sbrs and in pure aob quantitative pcr q pcr was used to quantify the abundance of the rp4 plasmid and the expression of ammonia oxidation genes taken together our findings provided evidence of adverse effects caused by arg exposure in biological sewage treatment systems and revealed the potential mechanisms of these effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and culture conditions all strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in table

bsw japan furthermore the e coli k12 rif rp4 strain sludge samples without the rp4 plasmid and a pure culture of an aob nitrosomonas europaea atcc 25 978 were used as controls 2 5 conjugation experiment e coli hb101 with the rp4 plasmid was used as the source of donor cells n europaea atcc 25 978 was used as the source of recipient cells donor strains were cultivated to 108 cfu ml whereas recipient strains were cultured to 106 cfu ml donor and recipient cells were mixed by vortexing after centrifugation the precipitates were added to 100 ml of a mixed medium consisting of 50 ml 2 liquid medium 50 ml 2 lb and antibiotics the mixture was incubated at 26 c in the dark with constant shaking at 100 rpm transconjugants were counted at 2 4 6 and 8 h the conjugative transfer rate was calculated using the following formula f n o t n o r where no t represents the number of transconjugants and no r is the number of recipients 2 6 n europaea atcc 25978 and n europaea atcc 25978 rp4 ammonia oxidation rate evaluation after conjugating for 4 h the mixture was centrifuged and transferred to 250 ml of liquid medium with antibiotics using pcr the transconjugant was identified as n europaea atcc 25 978 carrying the rp4 plasmid the pcr primers are summarized in table s1 transconjugant number was estimated based on the conjugative transfer rate the same number of aob was transferred to 250 ml of liquid medium without antibiotics as a control thus the same number of n europaea atcc 25 978 and n europaea atcc 25 978 rp4 were obtained after cultivating for 27 d the strains were transferred to fresh liquid medium without antibiotics and incubated for 12 h ammonia nitrogen and nitrite concentrations were monitored every 2 h via the nesslers reagent spectrophotometry method and ion chromatography respectively 2 7 detection of mrna expression in the ammonia oxidation rate evaluation experiment the total rna of n europaea atcc 25978 and n europaea atcc 25 978 rp4 was extracted using the trizol reagent thermo fisher scientific usa 5 μg rna was reverse transcribed as cdna with a reverse transcription kit tiangen fastking china real time pcr was carried out using sybr green thermo fisher scientific usa the absolute quantification method was used to quantify the functional genes related to nitrogen metabolism n europaea atcc 25 978 16s rrna was used as an internal control the relative abundance of the donor strain was determined based on the ratio between the absolute abundances of the donor strain and the total bacteria the same procedure was used to determine the relative abundance of the rp4 plasmid the primer sequences are summarized in table s1 these primers were synthesized by sangon shanghai sangon biological engineering technology china the reaction conditions used for the two step pcr procedure were the following an initial denaturation step at 95 c for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 5 s and 60 c for 31 s the signal was collected at 31 s and a dissociation stage at 95 c for 15 s 60 c for 1 min and 95 c for 15 sc real time pcr was conducted using a bio rad iq5 real time pcr system 2 8 statistics all statistical analyses were performed using the spaw statistics 18 software spss inc usa the data with homogeneity of variance was tested by analysis of variance anova whereas heterogeneous data was tested using a non parametric test such as the friedman test a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 3 results 3 1 sbr operation and effects of donor strain four sbrs were constructed using the same inoculated sludge from the stable operation sbr maintained in our lab microbial aggregates in reactors were mainly flocculent sludge and the mlss of the total sludge was 1200 1500 mg l synthetic wastewater was used as influent with an initial chemical oxygen demand cod of 100 mg l total nh4 n of 25 mg l and an nh4 n efficiency 90 min of 99 the mlss in the effluent was 24 95 0 91 mg ml repeated measures anova indicated that the differences between the four sbrs were not statistically significant p 0 05 fig s1 illustrates the variation in nh4 n no2 n no3 n and nh4 n removal efficiency in a typical cycle nh4 n was undetected after 90 min and the removal efficiency was almost 100 no2 n was detected during the first 120 min and peaked at 3 mg l no3 n was accumulated throughout the cycle and increased from 18 mg l to almost 42 mg l once the sbrs were stable e coli k12 rif e coli k12 rif rp4 and rp4 plasmids were added to the sbrs labeled a b and c respectively sbr d was untreated the cod removal efficiency in the four sbrs were not significantly different during the 28 days of operation as shown in fig 1c d although the ammonia removal efficiencies in sbr a c and d were essentially unchanged during the early stages a significant decrease was observed in sbr b after inoculation the efficiency of sbr b decreased below 90 on day 12 and this lower efficiency lasted for 10 days and decreased further to 71 on day 20 but recovered to 94 on day 23 9 days after ceasing inoculation upon analyzing typical cycles on days 1 10 and 20 fig s2 it was obvious that the nh4 n removal efficiency decreased in sbr b and no2 n and no3 n generation rates also decreased the peak no2 n levels of sbr b were lower than those of the other three sbrs and the reduced generation of no2 n balanced the total nitrogen content due to the slow increase in no3 n furthermore the mlss of total sludge in the sbr b decreased to 700 mg l at the end of the operation and the mlss in effluent fig s3 increased to an average of 29 mg l after the first inoculation but decreased to an average of 25 mg ml during the final seven days anova revealed that the differences before and after inoculation in sbr b were statistically significant p 0 05 in the other three sbrs the mlss in the effluent was maintained between 20 mg l and 30 mg l and no significant differences were observed before and after inoculation p 0 05 3 2 retention of rp4 plasmid in sbr fig 2 a illustrates the variations in the ratio of the donor strain and the rp4 plasmid to total bacteria in the sbr b the relative abundance of the donor strain and the rp4 plasmid all reached a peak beyond 10 4 during inoculation but declined differently as soon as inoculation stopped on day 28 the final relative abundance of the donor strain and the rp4 plasmid were 3 6 10 7 and 3 5 10 5 respectively to quantify the differences between the downtrend of the donor stain and the rp4 plasmid linear fitting was employed after log transforming the relative abundance 8 28 d and the differences between the slopes of the two fitting lines was tested by statistical analysis the fitting results indicated that the decline slope of the donor stain 0 48 was significantly lower p 0 05 than that of the rp4 plasmid 0 13 to further explore whether the rp4 plasmid remained in the aob the rp4 plasmid and aob were detected by fish fig 2b shows the total bacteria aob and rp4 plasmid in blue green and red respectively the areas marked by arrows appeared white as a consequence of the co localization of blue green and red dyes indicating that the rp4 plasmid was transferred from the donor strains to the aob furthermore no co localization of the three fluorescein dyes was observed in the control groups 3 3 conjugative transfer of rp4 plasmid between donor strains and n europaea atcc25978 n europaea atcc25978 was used as a model strain in the following experiments after 30 days of culture the total amount of n europaea reached up to 107cfu ml with a 103cfu ml initial inoculum fig s4a the bacterial density increased rapidly from days 2 to 10 entering the platform period after 16 days of culture typical colonies could be observed as white colonies fig s4c ammoxidation rate reached 8 4 mg l d at 8 d fig s4d and the average ammoxidation rate was 1 6 mg l d because the donor strains died gradually in the liquid medium with antibiotics until complete death 17 days later fig s5 the bacteria that survived were considered transconjugant n europaea atcc25978 rp4 the color of the transconjugant colony screened on agar plates was red fig 3 a which was different from that of normal n europaea atcc25978 fig 3b the transconjugant was further identified as n europaea atcc25978 with the rp4 plasmid via pcr fig 3c d as shown in fig 3e the conjugational transfer frequency reached a maximum of 6 28 10 3 at 2 h as horizontal transfer progressed the conjugational transfer frequency decreased gradually reaching 6 41 10 4 at 8 h therefore our findings demonstrated that n europaea atcc25978 was able to obtain the rp4 plasmid from the donor strains via conjugative transfer 3 4 ammonia oxidation differences between n europaea atcc25978 and n europaea atcc25978 rp4 n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was obtained via the conjugation experiment described above n europaea atcc25978 rp4 growth and ammonia oxidation ability were compared with n europaea atcc25978 as shown in fig 4 a the growth curves of n europaea atcc25978 and n europaea atcc25978 rp4 were essentially identical under the same culture conditions the maximum bacterial density reached 6 106 cfu ml for both n europaea atcc25978 rp4 and n europaea atcc25978 this suggests that n europaea atcc25978 maintained consistent growth characteristics after rp4 plasmid obtained regarding the metabolic rate of the tested bacterial strains n europaea atcc25978 exhibited higher ammonia oxidation rates than n europaea atcc25978 rp4 with an initial ammonia nitrogen concentration of 64 mg l the average ammonia oxidation rate of n europaea atcc25978 was 22 67 whereas that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was only 7 53 fig 4b the maximum ammonia oxidation rate of n europaea atcc25978 reached 40 09 whereas that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was only 13 97 the largest ammonia oxidation rate difference between these two strains was 32 38 after 16 days of culture on day 8 the ammonia nitrogen utilization rate of n europaea atcc25978 was 79 56 whereas that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was 30 54 on day 17 the ammonia nitrogen utilization rates of n europaea atcc25978 and n europaea atcc25978 rp4 were 96 04 and 61 93 respectively taken together our findings demonstrated that n europaea atcc25978 rp4 had a significantly lower ammonia nitrogen utilization rates than n europaea atcc25978 regarding ammonia reduction 60 79 mg l no2 n was generated by n europaea atcc25978 at the end of culture whereas n europaea atcc25978 rp4 produced almost no no2 n fig 4d which was inconsistent with their ammonia nitrogen consumption rates to verify the low ammonia nitrogen utilization rate of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 liquid medium with different initial ammonia nitrogen concentrations 50 30 20 mg l was used to evaluate metabolic ability in order to eliminate the influence of assimilation on of bacterial growth two strains were transferred to fresh medium after being cultured for 18 d and nh4 n and no2 n were monitored every 2 h for 12 h when the initial ammonia concentration was 50 mg l the ammonia consumption of n europaea atcc25978 was significantly higher than that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 at every monitoring point fig 5 a the total ammonia consumption of n europaea atcc25978 was 20 mg l whereas that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was 10 mg l similarly the ammonia consumption rates of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 were significantly lower than those of n europaea atcc25978 after 6 h when the initial ammonia concentrations were 20 and 30 mg l fig 5b and fig 5c there was also a significant difference in no2 n generation between n europaea atcc25978 and n europaea atcc25978 rp4 regardless of the initial ammonia concentration fig 7d f at 12 h of culture n europaea atcc25978 generated 6 57 8 33 mg l no2 n in contrast the no2 n generation rate of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was only 0 016 0 48 mg l which was far lower than its ammonia consumption rates 3 5 mrna expression of nitrogen metabolism related genes n europaea could convert ammonia to nitrite independently with potential nitrogenous products such as n2o and no therefore our study analyzed the expression of functional genes related to the ammonia oxidation processes the mrna expression levels of the amoa amoc hao nirk and norb genes of n europaea atcc25978 was higher than that of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 in the whole experiment fig 6 which was consistent with the higher ammonia consumption rates of n europaea atcc25978 in contrast the cytl expression of n europaea atcc25978 rp4 was significantly higher than the atcc25978 strain at every point the function of the cytl gene will be further discussed in the next section 4 discussion 4 1 horizontal transfer of the rp4 plasmid reduced the ammonia nitrogen removal capacity of the sbr previous studies have demonstrated that the rp4 plasmid can affect the performance of different reactors yang et al 2013 zou et al 2016 here more precise experiments were conducted to explore this phenomenon in sbrs all experiments were repeated four times with similar results synthetic wastewater with less cod and more nh4 n was used to accumulate aob in the sbrs during operation to explore the influence of the rp4 plasmid or horizontal transfer on nitrogen removal four sbrs were compared continuously addition strategy last 7 days simulated the situation that a large number of args carried by hosts entered wwtps abruptly during a period the sbr ammonia oxidation capacity changes were evaluated during args shock loading and ammonia oxidation recoveries were further evaluated after args shock loading sbr b exhibited a decrease in nh4 n removal efficiency after inoculation fig 1 these findings suggested that the rp4 plasmid might affect this process in sbrs which was consistent with previous findings in mbrs yang et al 2013 and gsbrs zou et al 2016 as shown in fig s3 the conversion of ammonia to nitrite was inhibited by inoculation whereas the conversion of nitrite to nitrate remained essentially unaffected no2 n peaked at a level lower than that in sbr d indicating that the conversion of nitrite to nitrate was not inhibited this suggests that the ability of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nobu et al 2014 to catalyze nitrite oxidation was not significantly affected after inoculation therefore nh4 n removal efficiency was likely decreased by aob due to the influence of the rp4 plasmid and high nh4 n concentrations in the effluent may lead to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems similar with aob aoa and commomax are able to complete ammonia oxidation kuypers et al 2018 wang et al 2021 while nitrosomonas was observed as the most abundant ammonia oxidizing microorganism in sbr by metagenomic data thus aob was chosen to build conjugation model as a recipient strain the args influence on aoa and comammox would be further investigated in the next step 4 2 conjugation between the rp4 plasmid and aob the conjugation between the rp4 plasmid and aob has been previously reported geisenberger et al 1999 here fish was used to investigate this phenomenon in sbrs fig 2 aerobic bacteria including aob were mainly found on the surface of aggregates due to limitations in mass transfer and conjugation was abundant in this region furthermore as shown in fig 2 the donor strain exhibited a more significant decrease in number compared with the strain with the rp4 plasmid this further confirmed that conjugation took place between the donor strains and potential recipients furthermore once the rp4 plasmid was transferred it could maintain in the sbr for a long time additionally the potential recipients in the sbr dosed with the naked rp4 plasmid were not competent and transformation was inefficient horizontal gene transfer of the rp4 plasmid in this sbr was predictably lower than in the sbr with the e coli k12 rif rp4 strain as a donor the aob in the activated sludge were then isolated and purified after which they were identified as n europaea atcc25978 the rp4 plasmid is a typical incp α type multidrug resistance plasmid with kanamycin tetracycline and ampicillin resistance and a wide potential host range pansegrau et al 1994 it was reported that the rp4 plasmid could be transferred from pseudomonas putida kt2440 to activated sludge on a microfluidic chip with an average transfer frequency of 2 5 10 3 qiu et al 2018 to further evaluate the conjugation between the rp4 plasmid and aob n europaea atcc25978 a model aob strain was used as a recipient strain for horizontal transfer the conjugational transfer frequency between the donor strains and n europaea atcc25978 reached 6 28 10 3 at 2 h this conjugational transfer frequency was much higher than that of many kinds of recipient strains especially non e coli strains when e coli nk5449 was used as the recipient strain the rp4 plasmid transfer frequency was 10 5 jiao et al 2017 however the rp4 conjugation transfer frequency from e coli to salmonella was 2 06 10 6 whereas that from e coli to enterococcus was only 1 3 10 7 thomas and nielsen 2005 these findings indicated that cross species rp4 plasmid transfer was relatively infrequent however our study identified a high rp4 plasmid conjugation transfer frequency between e coli i e a heterotroph and n europaea i e an autotroph on one hand n europaea atcc 25 978 did not grow during conjugation due to its low growth rate on the other hand the high ratio of donor and recipient cells was more favorable to transconjugant generation mølbak et al 2007 due to the susceptibility of aob lehtovirta morley et al 2014 the ammonia oxidation capacity of these bacteria would be greatly affected by rp4 plasmid horizontal transfer in turn excessive n levels in wastewater would not be removed via wwtps as expected leading to water eutrophication teikari et al 2018 4 3 mechanisms by which the rp4 plasmid inhibits aob ammoxidation given that the transferred rp4 plasmid might lower the nh4 n removal efficiency of aob studies were conducted to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon to achieve this the expression of genes related to nitrogen metabolism was analyzed there were two key functional enzymes involved in nitritation lehtovirta morley et al 2014 ammonia monooxygenase amo and hydroxylamine oxidase hao amo catalyzes nh4 nh2oh whereas hao catalyzes nh2oh no2 furthermore hao could also oxidize nh4 no in n europaea atcc 25 978 rp4 amo and hao mrna expression was significantly upregulated which was the main reason for the low ammonia nitrogen removal rates in contrast the expression of cytl was significantly higher in n europaea atcc 25 978 rp4 and was accompanied by almost no nitrite generation a previous study reported that cytl was strongly upregulated under anoxic conditions and contributed to n2o production yu et al 2018 the cytl gene encodes cytochrome p460 and was previously thought to oxidize nh2oh and no to no2 coleman and lancaster 2020 however cytl can also produce n2o instead of no2 as an alternative pathway in nh2oh detoxification under hypoxic conditions caranto et al 2016 these results indicated cytl activity was closely related to oxygen content but dissolved oxygen was not monitored in n europaea culture based on these observations fig 7 illustrates the possible mechanisms through which the rp4 plasmid diminishes ammonia nitrogen removal notably the aob colonies turned red after rp4 plasmid entered considering the correlation between cytl over expression and oxygen uptake it seemed that the colonies color change indicated the oxygen uptake capacity change of aob rp4 the high expression of cytl was compatible with the oxygen uptake decrease furthermore the mlss in effluent in the sbr dosed with e coli k12 rif rp4 increased significantly during inoculation and decreased gradually after inoculation fig s3 which suggested that the dissociation of aggregates and the deterioration of the sludge settling properties might be caused by the transferred rp4 plasmid regarding the pure aob culture the aob carrying the rp4 plasmid generated more extracellular polymers eps especially extracellular dna fig s6 which was consistent with the sludge sedimentation performance changes in the sbr this increase in the levels of eps which are known capping agents appears to affect the surface charge of the cells leading aob rp4 to generate n2o instead of no2 jain et al 2015 further the n2o production was observed in n europaea atcc25978 rp4 culture fig s7 this would also explain the observed nitrogen imbalances however gaseous nitrogen oxides were not monitored every point here including no and n2o further evidence on oxygen uptake and surface charge is still required conclusions our study demonstrated that the rp4 plasmid was transferred to aob autotrophic bacteria from the heterotrophic bacterium e coli both in sbrs and in vitro via horizontal transfer the ammonia nitrogen removal of the sbr treated with the donor strains decreased continuously and recovered slowly furthermore the ammonia oxidation capacities of the aobs significantly decreased once the rp4 plasmid was transferred additionally aob rp4 generated almost no nitrite in short term experiments with different initial ammonia concentrations aob carrying rp4 also exhibited a downregulation of functional genes related to ammonia oxidation except cytl compared with normal aob the high expression of cytl could explain the low nitrite generation rates observed in this study however additional studies are required to identify the mechanisms by which rp4 affects gene expression in aob funding this

unknown nodal heads through available wdn information is an effective way to bypass data limitations but an accurate and easy to implement method is still absent for general wdns the spatial distribution of nodal heads is approximately smooth as there are few dramatic head changes if heads can be divided into components with different spatial varying speeds then they can be approximated by a few slow varying components on this basis a graph based head reconstruction ghr method is proposed which employs graph signal processing technologies to reconstruct the slow varying parts to estimate unknown nodal heads four metrics are proposed to bridge wdn hydraulics and signal processing to quantify the similarity of adjacent nodal heads which enhance the smoothness of heads over the graph and thus increase estimation accuracy ghr was tested with different parameter settings and compared with other head estimation methods results showed that ghr has less restrictive parameter requirements compared with hydraulic simulation and outperforms traditional data interpolation methods with better accuracy at a larger looped network under potential model uncertainties and measurement errors ghr still accurately estimated the heads for more than 10 000 unknown nodes achieving a mean absolute error of 0 13 m using only 100 pressure meters thus the proposed method provides an efficient robust and convenient way to estimate unknown nodal heads in wdns graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data estimation graph signal processing nodal pressure smart water water distribution network 1 introduction water distribution networks wdns play a decisive role in the safety and stability of urban water supply the rapid growth of city size and population mohammadi and taylor 2017 causes an increase in water resources consumption and wdn load urging the implementation of smart technologies and automatic solutions to improve the management of wdns olsson 2020 which requires large scale data collection for example automatic diagnosis and forecasting of operating status guo et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 xu et al 2020 relies on analysis of the variation of measurements across many locations and leakage control and energy saving samir et al 2017 monsef et al 2018 often require comprehensive knowledge of wdn operating status such as nodal pressures throughout a wdn data availability is also the foundation for recently developed integrated solutions such as digital twin smart water and internet of things alshattnawi 2017 radhakrishnan and wu 2018 conejos fuertes et al 2020 although the progress in data acquisition and recording systems have reduced the cost of wdn monitoring due to the sheer size and complexity of wdns the number of required monitoring sensors is often much larger than what is actually installed for affordability and or practicality reasons for most of wdns thus the low spatial density of available data has already become a bottleneck restricting the development and application of intelligent technologies in wdns how to accurately infer as much unknown information as possible from limited knowledge of the wdns could be the key to solve the problem nodal pressure is one of the most important indicators of the hydraulic status of a wdn for simplicity in the following discussion we also use head the summation of the pressure and elevation of a node to represent nodal pressure in order to estimate unknown pressures the most widely used approach is to develop a hydraulic model to simulate the operation status of a real wdn and calculate unknown nodal pressures and pipe flow rates by solving continuity and energy equations rossman 1999 sharoonizadeh et al 2016 although hydraulic models can estimate unknown wdn hydraulic status in a direct and complete way the model parameters often contain unavoidable uncertainties hutton et al 2014 as they cannot be directly measured or require unaffordable costs to be precisely determined zhou et al 2018 for example pipe roughness coefficients can only be roughly estimated based on pipe diameter and age or indirectly inferred through the relationship between head loss and pipe flow rate nodal demands fluctuate over temporal and spatial scales herrera et al 2010 and accurate estimation of nodal demands is difficult due to unpredictable random customer usages these model parameter uncertainties may result in erroneous or misleading estimation results of wdn status model calibration and state estimation methods savic et al 2009 preis et al 2011 tshehla et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 chu et al 2021 have been proposed to improve the performance of hydraulic models by reducing parametric model uncertainties via available measurements savic et al 2009 however there are usually thousands of unknown model parameters to be estimated whereas only a relatively small number of direct measurements are available this leads to a highly underdetermined calibration problem that may result in an unstable solution no unique solution or no solution at all preis et al 2011 a possible way to solve the underdetermined problem is to reduce the number of unknown parameters by grouping pipe roughness coefficients mallick et al 2002 and or nodal demands kang and lansey 2009 zhou et al 2018 this assumes that parameters in a group are equal or perfectly correlated which will result in potential uncertainties in calibrated models it is also difficult to determine the appropriate grouping criteria and strategies savic et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 some state estimation methods preis et al 2011 tshehla et al 2017 chu et al 2021 assume prior knowledge also referred to as pseudo measurements of nodal demands to increase the number of constraints then update hydraulic state estimations using real time measurements this could make the problem solvable but the accurate setting of pseudo measurements is challenging and the parameters with low sensitivity to direct measurements could still be ill posed and lead to unstable results which limits the representativeness of model simulation results beside as the model calibration and state estimation methods are often complex in computation and experienced pre processing is often required an accurate and easy to implement method is still in its absence due to the difficulty and high cost most water utilities do not have access to well calibrated high precision models especially for large complex wdns which limits their management capabilities when a high precision hydraulic model is unavailable an alternative way is to infer unknown pressures from field measurements using interrelated relationships and specific spatial distribution patterns in wdn nodal pressures which has been tried by researchers using data interpolation or machine learning methods for example mounce et al 2003 used triangle based cubic interpolation to estimate pressure drops during pipe burst soldevila et al 2019 and soldevila et al 2021 employed kriging spatial interpolation to estimate pressures of unmeasured nodes and boatwright et al 2018 estimated unknown pressures by a spatially constrained inverse distance weighted interpolation method the above methods neglect the topological structure and hydraulic features of wdn which limit their performance traditional interpolation methods assume that spatially closed nodes will have similar values fig 1 a however nodal heads determined by irregular wdn topology and diverse physical components may suggest the opposite fig 1b therefore interpolation methods could lead to large errors especially in branches and ends of a wdn some studies use machine learning methods to learn the relationships between known measurements and unknown states in wdns lima et al 2017 built an artificial neural network to estimate unknown pressures using monitored inlet flow and pressures hajgat o et al 2021 used chebnet to reconstruct the nodal pressures and achieved high accuracy with the examined wdns these approaches could be promising but they are difficult to thoroughly consider various operation conditions and hydraulic parameter uncertainties when training the model beside experienced setting of hyperparameters such as the number of layers and learning rate are often required when developing these models which also limit its wide range application it is necessary to consider the hydraulic features of a wdn to develop more accurate and convenient approaches to estimate unknown nodal pressures through limited measurements recent developments of graph signal processing gsp techniques stanković et al 2019 and the successful applications in environmental monitoring jain et al 2014 brain science atasoy et al 2016 and community analysis tremblay and borgnat 2014 provide a new perspective to bridge data processing methods and wdn hydraulics gsp extends classical signal processing tools to graph structured signals lorenzo et al 2018 and uses a weighted graph to represent the spatial relationships of data in irregular structures this characteristic provides the ability to model and analyze the complex interactions among the nodal pressures data of a wdn the reason for choosing gsp to reconstruct unknown nodal pressures lies in that 1 as the wdn structure can be easily represented by a graph gsp is able to consider the topological relationship among wdn data 2 gsp uses weights to represent the similarity between adjacent signals which provides the possibility to represent the wdn hydraulics by assigning different weights based on the wdn hydraulic features graph based methods have been used to solve wdn problems including resilience analysis ulusoy et al 2018 meng et al 2018 partitioning hajebi et al 2015 and reconstruction of wdn dynamics wei et al 2020 etc in these studies metrics such as potential energy loss ulusoy et al 2018 sitzenfrei et al 2020 and topological properties giustolisi et al 2019 meng et al 2018 were proposed to analyze the features of a wdn nevertheless due to the complex spatial relationship of wdn pressures it remains to investigate appropriate hydraulic metrics and data analysis methodologies to enable a more efficient feature description and utilization thus these questions still remain to be answered 1 what kind of metrics are more suitable to quantify the spatial relationship of pressures 2 to what extent can we better reveal the hydraulic features with limited information of a wdn 3 how can we use gsp to find our desired features and further use these features to reconstruct unmonitored pressures in this study a new methodology to bridge wdn hydraulics with gsp is introduced the wdn structure is represented by a graph and the nodal heads are represented by signals defined over the graph vertices different metrics are proposed to characterize the wdn hydraulics and quantify the similarity of adjacent nodal heads with consideration of limited knowledge of the wdn edge weights of the constructed graph are determined according to the proposed metrics which enable the graph to better represent the hydraulic relationship of wdn heads based on the constructed graph and gsp technology a graph based head reconstruction ghr method is proposed to estimate unmonitored pressures of wdns ghr is tested on networks of different sizes and compared with different pressure estimation methods to illustrate its effectiveness and robustness 2 methodology 2 1 graph based head reconstruction the basic idea of ghr is to use gsp to exploit the spatial features of wdn pressures and reconstruct unmeasured values in this section we will demonstrate how to use graph and graph signals to represent a wdn and its pressures and provide an overview of gsp and the proposed unknown pressure estimation method a graph consists of a set of vertices v 1 2 n and a set of weighted edges b w i j i j v connecting the vertices intuitively the nodes including tanks and reservoirs of a wdn can be represented by the vertices of a graph and the pipes including pumps can be represented by the edges if nodes i and j are linked by pipe i j then w i j 0 otherwise w i j 0 the adjacency matrix w of the weighted graph can be constructed as w i j w i j where i j represents the element at the i th row and the j th column the heads of the wdn nodes can be regarded as signals on the graph vertices and can be arranged in a vector form 1 h h 1 h 2 h n t where h i is the head of node i as well as the signal on vertex i of the graph in classical signal analysis signals can be decomposed onto a set of basis vectors with different frequencies by fourier spectral analysis this approach can be extended to the graph signals using graph fourier transform gft which allows a graph signal to be represented in the graph frequency domain spanned by a set of basis vectors hence different signal varying speeds with respect to the graph topology can be described mateos et al 2019 gft is based on the graph laplacian matrix l 2 l diag 1 t w w where diag converts a vector into a diagonal matrix having the vector as main diagonal 1 denotes a vector with all elements equal to one the eigen decomposition of l is 3 l u λ u t where λ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of l in ascending order u u 1 u 2 u n which is composed of eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues it was proved stanković et al 2019 that an eigenvector associated with a smaller eigenvalue will have a lower frequency i e lower varying speed and better smoothness on the defined graph the idea of gft is to represent the original signal h by a linear combination of eigenvectors thereby dividing it into components with different frequencies this is achieved by 4 h u 1 h 5 h u h where h h 1 h 2 h n is the laplacian spectrum eqs 4 and 5 are called gft and inverse graph fourier transform igft of the graph signal h which employ u as the basis set as u i which corresponds to a smaller eigenvalue has lower frequency the former elements of h represent the spatially slow varying parts of h while the latter elements correspond to the fast varying parts the variation of nodal heads in a wdn is determined by the wdn physical structure and pipe flow velocity generally for a wdn in a normal steady state operating condition the change of heads on connected nodes is limited thus the adjacent heads vary slowly and the distribution of heads is approximately not strictly smooth over the graph based on this we can assume that h is bandlimited and can be approximately represented by its low frequency parts i e 6 h b h 7 h ub h where b is the n n f bandlimited matrix b i i 1 for each i f and other elements are zeros f is the frequency limit which decides the number of low frequency items used to approximate the original signal b h extracts the first f low frequency elements of h eq 7 is equivalent to 8 h u b f h f u f h f where b f is constructed by the non zero columns of b u f is constructed by the first f rows of u and h f h 1 h 2 h f for large wdns in order to speed up the calculation we can only solve the first f eigenvectors of l to construct u f and the methods to solve the eigenvectors for large sparse symmetric matrices can be used lehoucq 1998 measuring nodal heads in the wdn by pressure meters can be considered as sampling the original signal h assuming there are m pressure meters the measurements are 9 y s d s h where y s is the measured heads d s is an m n sampling matrix d s i j 1 if the i th pressure meter is installed at node j and zeros otherwise substituting eq 8 into eq 9 and we will get 10 y s d s u f h f based on eq 10 the low frequency spectrum h f can be estimated by the measured nodal heads let x d s u f then 11 h f pinv x y s x t x 1 x t y s where h f is the estimation of low frequency spectrum pinv returns the pseudo inverse x needs to have full column rank in order to solve eq 11 and a necessary condition requires f m i e the number of low frequency items should be smaller than the number of pressure meters after h f is calculated we can reconstruct the low frequency parts of h by 12 h u f h f where h represents the reconstructed nodal heads the elements in h are the estimation of unknown nodal heads and pressures can be obtained after subtracting the heights of the nodes 2 2 bridging wdn hydraulics and graph signal processing for a real life wdn the pressure changes between different nodes are not uniform in most cases therefore the smoothness assumption in eqs 6 and 7 could not be strictly satisfied which will introduce errors and lead to deviations in the reconstructed results thus we can define appropriate weights to enhance the smoothness of pressure change among nodes so that the original heads are better approximated by the low frequency parts for an edge that connects vertex i and j the weight w i j measures the similarity of signals on the connected vertices larger w i j corresponds to more similarity or mutual effects between the signals mateos et al 2019 in literature w i j is generally calculated by the inverse of distance between the vertices as farther distance usually corresponds to smaller similarity for example in spatial radio signal processing the weights are determined by the inverse distance between real world locations of the vertices redondi 2018 and in electrical circuits the weights are defined as reciprocal values to the electrical resistance stanković et al 2019 as the resistance represents the distance in a circuit system analogically the distance of nodes in a wdn with respect to their heads can be measured by the head loss of pipes that connect the nodes thus the distance i e the similarity of two connected nodes i and j is given by 13 w i j w j i 1 h i j h i j ε 1 1 ε 1 h i j ε 1 where h i j is the head loss of pipe i j ε 1 is a threshold value to avoid the appearance of extremely large values set at 0 01 in our study eq 13 uses the inverse of head loss to measure the similarity as smaller head loss indicates less difference between the adjacent nodal heads for pumps and valves in wdn as they will cause a significant head change between the connected nodes very small weights are assigned to the corresponding edges in order to make the metric unitless and easier for comparison a min max normalization is applied 14 w i j w i j min w ε 2 max w min w ε 2 where min and max return the minimum and maximum of the set respectively w w i j which is the set of w i j corresponding to all the pipes in the wdn ε 2 is a small positive value used to avoid zero values set as 0 001 max w min w in our study w plays the role of bridging wdn hydraulic features and graph structures it is determined by various wdn hydraulic parameters such as topology roughness coefficients and nodal demands calculating w involves an integrated hydraulic simulation with the requirement of a hydraulic model rossman 1999 of which the parameters are difficult to be accurately determined as discussed in section 1 nevertheless the case studies of our study will show that a hydraulic model with inaccurate parameters can still provide enough information to calculate w for pressure reconstruction if a hydraulic model is not currently available we can still establish a rough model to estimate w under certain assumptions basic parameters such as topology nodal elevations and pipe lengths and diameters can easily be obtained from design files and or geographic information systems gis data abdelbaki et al 2017 the parameters which are difficult to determine are pipe roughness and nodal demands as they are not directly measurable zhou et al 2018 therefore the assumptions are 1 pipe roughness of all pipes are uniform 2 user demand is uniform along all the water supplying pipes except for the known big users i e the nodal demands are assumed to be 15 r i j q t q b l i j l s u m 16 q n 0 5 i j n r i j where q t is the total demand of the wdn q b is the demand of big users l s u m is the sum of the length of all water supplying pipes l i j is the length of pipe i j r i j is the demand of pipe i j and q n is the demand of node n the edge weights can then be calculated by simulating head losses using the roughly constructed model and are denoted as w u q herein the elements in w u q will also be normalised similar to eq 14 compared with w w u q is a not so accurate metric to measure the wdn hydraulics but it still reveals the impact of wdn topology and the possible distribution of user demands the assumptions to calculate w u q are especially useful for wdns with relatively uniformly distributed demands such as wdns in residential areas the calculation of w and w u q involves hydraulic simulation by solving continuity and energy equations in some cases an index that does not need to perform hydraulic simulation but can measure the wdn hydraulics as accurately as possible can be useful as it provides a cheaper and more convenient way to estimate unknown pressures with a compromise of acceptable decreasing of reconstruction accuracy referring to the hazen williams formula h i j can be represented by 17 h i j 10 67 q i j 1 852 l i j c w i j 1 852 d i j 4 87 where q i j d i j and c w i j are the flow rate diameter and pipe roughness coefficient of pipe i j respectively substituting q v π d 2 4 into eq 17 and we will get 18 h i j k 1 v i j 1 852 1 c w i j 1 852 l i j d i j 1 166 where k 1 is a constant and v i j is the velocity of pipe i j assume that the velocity and roughness of all pipes are uniform then we will get 19 w i j u v w j i u v k 2 d i j 1 166 l i j where k 2 is a constant that can be neglected in the subsequent procedures w i j u v is the weight of edge i j assuming uniform velocity and roughness it is further min max normalized the calculation of w u v only requires the topology pipe length and diameter of a wdn which is easy to be investigated and measured w u v provides a very rough estimation of pipe head loss and the similar metric also has been used to analyze wdn features in other studies ulusoy et al 2018 sitzenfrei et al 2020 finally as a very low cost alternative we can assume all weights as uniform for all the edges set 20 w i j u w j i u 1 where w i j u is the weight of edge i j assuming uniform weights the four metrics proposed in this section i e w w u q w u v and w u have different assumptions to measure wdn hydraulics as much as possible and will lead to different reconstruction accuracy choice of which metric to use can be determined by how much wdn information is available these metrics will be further tested and discussed in the following sections in summary ghr combines wdn hydraulics to enhance the signal smoothness on the graph domain and reconstruct unknown nodal heads by calculating the low frequency parts of the laplacian spectrum h f the mechanism and steps of ghr are shown in fig 2 by choosing a suitable metric the weights corresponding to different pipes can be calculated with available wdn information and graph laplacian matrix l can be constructed the eigenvectors of l form the basis of gft as shown in fig 2a and b the low frequency parts contain most of the information about the nodal heads fig 2c therefore the low frequency spectrum is calculated by a limited number of measured sampled nodal heads to approximately represent the original value while the high frequency parts can be assumed as zeros fig 2d and e finally the slow varying parts of the original signal are reconstructed and are used to estimate the unknown nodal heads as shown in fig 2f 3 case studies and results ghr is applied to two wdns of different sizes to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness to evaluate the performance of ghr under different working conditions and parameter settings synthetic data are generated using epanet2 toolkit rossman 1999 to represent field data pressures at nodes where the meters are installed are set as measurements and other data are ground truth to evaluate the performance of different pressure estimation methods a number of assumptions and presets are made 1 when calculating w the pipe roughness coefficients cw and nodal demands q contain errors by default as they are the most uncertain parameters in a wdn model and can hardly be directly measured zhou et al 2018 unless otherwise stated cw and q are assigned with gaussian white noise n 0 σ 2 with a standard deviation of 10 σ c w 10 and 20 of the corresponding true demands σ q 20 respectively 2 when used the topological structure node elevation pipe length and pipe diameter of the wdns are assumed to be known and certain 3 locations of pressure meters are determined according to d optimality winer 1962 tsitsvero et al 2016 lorenzo et al 2018 given by 21 s arg max s m log det x t x where s is the set of pressure meters 4 for all the tests the frequency limits are set as f 0 9 m to ensure x has full column rank and eq 11 is solvable 5 for illustration purposes the tested wdns operate under normal conditions and abnormal conditions such as main pipe bursts and pump failure are not considered 6 mean absolute error mae is used to measure the performance of ghr given as 22 mae 1 n u i 1 n u h i h i where h i is the estimated head of node i n u is the number of unknown nodes 3 1 overall performance and comparison with other methods a middle sized real life network is used to illustrate the construction and performance of ghr the network as shown in fig 3 a consists of 4 reservoirs 480 nodes and 567 pipes with a total length of 147 km about 57 000 m3 of water are supplied from 4 reservoirs per day the nodal heads at 8 00 am are considered during the test because the largest nodal demands occur at this time and the varying of heads is the most significant the nodal heads of the network range from 35 m to 45 m as shown in fig 3a a total of 30 pressure meters are used and the pressures of reservoirs are also assumed to be known the meter locations when using w as weights are marked as triangles in fig 3a thus the objective is to estimate the unknown heads of the rest of 450 nodes with 34 known pressures fig 3b shows the head loss of pipes many of the head losses are larger than 1 m with the largest head loss reaching 6 12 m which indicates the fast varying and less smoothness of heads among different nodes and makes it more difficult to infer the unknown pressures from known measurements thus the tested wdn can better illustrate the performance of ghr under a less favourable condition to illustrate the novelty of ghr fig 4 presents how the original nodal heads are approximated by a set of low frequency basis vectors some typical basis vectors and corresponding spectrums see eqs 4 and 5 are shown the former values of h such as h 1 and h 5 are much larger than the latter values therefore ignoring the latter value will have little impact as discussed in eqs 6 and 7 from another perspective the former basis vectors such as u 1 u 5 and u 15 change more smoothly and globally while the latter vectors such as u 100 and u 300 show local and rapid changes at the same time fig 3 a shows that the real nodal heads mainly include global changes which is consistent with the former low frequency basis vectors the analysis shows that using a limited number of low frequency basis vectors to approximate the original heads is feasible in practical wdns in fig 5 the performance of ghr with different weight metrics w w u q w u v and w u see section 2 2 are tested and are compared to two spatial interpolation methods fig 5a d shows the head reconstruction results using the four metrics as shown in fig 5a using w as weights the mae of the estimated heads is only 0 25 m and 83 of estimation errors are less than 0 5 m beside comparing with fig 3 we can find that the head differences of many adjacent nodes are larger than 1 m while ghr still obtains accurate estimation results for these nodes which also shows the effectiveness of ghr therefore despite the parameter uncertainties σ c w 10 σ q 20 ghr can provide very good estimation results with the help of a hydraulic model the calculation of w u q actually builds a temporal hydraulic model with roughly assigned hydraulic parameters to determine the weights leading to a larger mae of 0 29 m fig 5b although the calculation of w and w u q requires to perform hydraulic simulations ghr shows good robustness to hydraulic parameter uncertainties which will be further discussed in section 3 2 fig 5c shows the results of ghr using w u v calculating w u v needs less wdn knowledge and do not require performing hydraulic simulation although the accuracy decreases to mae 0 48 m 64 of the errors are still less than 0 5 m and 99 are less than 2 m larger errors occur when the nearby pipes have extremely large or small flow velocities using ghr with w u v provides a convenient and low cost alternative to estimate unknown wdn pressures as the required parameters e g length and diameter of pipes are easier to obtain the results using uniform weights w u is shown in fig 5d the overall estimation error increases to mae 0 51 m and some nodes especially nodes at the end of the network have significantly increased error using uniform weights assumes that all adjacent nodal heads have the same similarity which will lead to low accuracy when a large head loss occurs however compared with the interpolation methods ghr with uniform weights still achieves better results as the topology structure of the wdn is considered for comparison purposes nearest neighbor interpolation and universal kriging interpolation li and heap 2008 are tested and the results are presented in fig 5e and f these methods achieve lower accuracy compared with the results of ghr as discussed in fig 1 the interpolation methods cannot incorporate the topological structure and hydraulic features of wdn therefore larger errors may occur universal kriging interpolation is more accurate than nearest interpolation as it considers the spatial distance between nodes however it still shows poor performance for nodes that are far from the meters or located at the end of the network because the values of these nodes are less relevant to their distance to measured nodes 3 2 parameter uncertainties fig 5a shows that ghr can provide good estimation results with the help of hydraulic models despite parameter uncertainties it is meaningful to investigate whether using ghr with w can achieve better accuracy than direct hydraulic simulation under different parameter uncertainties in this section the impact of parameter uncertainties including systematic errors and random errors are tested and the results of ghr and hydraulic simulation under different degrees of uncertainties are compared each test is repeatedly performed 50 times with regenerated noises to cw and q the noises follow n μ c w σ c w 2 and n μ q σ q 2 where μ c w and μ q are the systematic error of cw and q respectively for ghr the pressure of 30 measured nodes and 4 reservoirs are used same as in section 3 1 the results are shown in fig 6 and it can be found that ghr is less affected by both systematic and random errors for example the hydraulic simulation results can only have better accuracy than ghr when there are small parameter uncertainties σ q 20 and σ c w 10 with no systematic error μ c w 0 and μ q 0 focusing on the first abscissa no random errors with different levels of systematic errors the maes of hydraulic simulation results increase 0 31 m 0 36 m and 0 70 m respectively while the mae of ghr results only increase 0 02 m 0 03 m and 0 05 m respectively fig 6a to 6d under a specific systematic error the increasing of random errors σ q and σ c w also has more significant impacts on the error of hydraulic simulation results the robustness of ghr to hydraulic parameter uncertainties lies in that it combines both the information from wdn hydraulics and the available measurements and the hydraulic model act only as a reference to calculate w the introduced errors in w can be tolerated as long as the smoothness hypothesis is ensured on the other hand although a hydraulic modal can utilize field measurements to achieve better accuracy by model calibration methods it is not easy to achieve as discussed in section 1 3 3 number of meters and measurement errors other factors that have significant effects on the performance of ghr include the quantity and quality of available measurements in this section different numbers of meters and measurement errors are tested with w w u q w u v and w u respectively the measurements are assigned with gaussian white noise with standard deviation σ h ranging from 0 m to 0 5 m each parameter set is performed 50 times with regenerated errors and the results are shown in fig 7 using more meters will improve the accuracy of ghr as more information about the spatial distribution of nodal heads can be provided with 75 pressure meters the mae of ghr using w as weights can decrease to only 0 10 m when small measurement errors are assigned fig 7a we also identified that using more meters can reduce the performance differences among different weights for example the difference of mae when using w and w u is around 0 5 m with only 15 meters whereas the difference decreases to around 0 15 m with 75 meters therefore when limited information about a wdn is known we can still install a sufficient number of meters and use ghr with the more easy to obtain weights to estimate the unknown pressures with high accuracy the mae with different degrees of measurement errors are compared in fig 7a d the accuracy decreases with larger measurement error as well as a wider distribution range of mae for different tests however ghr still shows good robustness with the increasing of the errors and the mae of estimation results can be even smaller than σ h with sufficient meters for instance when σ h increases from 0 01 m to 0 5 m the mae only increases by 0 2 0 3 m and the mae of ghr using w is only around 0 4 m when σ h 0 5 m the robustness of ghr to measurement errors comes from the fact that ghr discards the spatially high frequency parts and emphasis the low frequency parts thus implicitly filtering out part of the measurement errors 3 4 performance on large network in this section ghr is tested on a large looped network to further illustrate its performance on real life wdns the network as shown in fig 8 a contains 12 523 nodes 2 sources and 14 822 pipes it was initially used in the battle of the water sensor networks bwsn ostfeld et al 2008 for simplicity and better illustration of the effect of customer demand variation control rules in the original network are deleted the nodal heads at 7 00 am when the network has the largest nodal demands are used to test the performance of ghr model uncertainties σ c w 10 and σ q 20 and measurement errors σ h 0 2 m are considered during the tests the real nodal heads of the wdn range from 66 m to 75 m where the upper left parts show faster pressure change and the bottom right parts change slowly as shown in fig 8a the estimation error with 100 pressure meters and different weight metrics are shown in fig 8b c and d respectively despite the existence of parameter uncertainty and measurement errors ghr with w accurately estimated the nodal head of more than 10 000 unknown nodes with an mae of 0 13 m although the existing pumps and valves cause dramatic nodal head change that cannot be assumed as smooth the head of these nodes can still be successfully estimated by assigning small weights and setting appropriate meters as shown in fig 8c using w u q as weights reduces the overall estimation accuracy as cw and q are roughly determined and will introduce large uncertainties when calculating weights compared with fig 8d that using w u as weights using w u q has better performance especially for the nodes near the main pipes as these pipes have large head losses however using w u still shows good performance with an mae of 0 167 m especially for the nodes with slow pressure changes in order to further illustrate the performance of ghr under different operation conditions it is applied to real time estimate unknown nodal heads during 24 h the operating data of the second day of the original bwsn network are used because a large demand variation occurs on this day thus the impacts of daily demands variations can be better tested the tests are performed 50 times with regenerated errors for model parameters and measurements the graph weights w are calculated based on only the wdn hydraulics at 7 00 am same as in fig 8 and are used to estimate unknown heads at different operation conditions throughout the day the maes and the demand variation are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that ghr can have better accuracy with lower nodal demands as low nodal demands result in slow variation of nodal heads which is more consistent with the smoothness hypothesis of ghr comparing the mae at 7 00 am and 9 00 pm we can find that although the graph weights are calculated using the hydraulics of a different operation the increase in mae is small therefore it is feasible to use the w obtained from a specific operating condition to estimate unknown nodal heads under other operating conditions 4 discussions compared with hydraulic simulation estimating unknown nodal pressures from available measurements can be a more easy to implement alternative approach but there are few successful methods that can achieve high accuracy results through bridging wdn hydraulics with gsp ghr provides a novel method to reconstruct unknown nodal heads with not only high accuracy but also good robustness to parameter uncertainties and measurement errors based on the examples and results presented above comprehensive discussions are summarized as follows the main contribution of ghr is that it provides an effective but low cost methodology to estimate the unknown wdn pressures when an accurate hydraulic model is available or there are sufficient technicians and investments to perform elaborated model calibration integrated hydraulic simulation is still the best way to calculate the unknown pressures however water companies would have limited investments in the construction and maintenance of hydraulic models under a lot of cases and using ghr provides a convenient and low cost approach to achieve good estimation results without the requirement to accurately determine wdn hydraulic parameters for example although some water companies have currently available hydraulic models the absence of long term maintenance and calibration results in a significant decrease in model accuracy and thus the simulated results cannot be directly applied to infer wdn hydraulics in that case using the inaccurate hydraulic model to calculate w and employ ghr to reconstruct unknown pressures could be a very convenient way to achieve good results even with no hydraulic models ghr can use w u q w u v and w u to exploit more readily wdn information such as pipe length and diameters and reveal the wdn hydraulics as much as possible to improve its accuracy compared with traditional data interpolation methods ghr has better performance because it considers the topology of a wdn and reveals the relationship of heads at different nodes thus effectively improving the estimation accuracy ghr shows better performance in wdns with low pipe flow rates and slow varying nodal heads as these wdns are more in accordance with the smoothness hypothesis of ghr therefore for these wdns we can use fewer meters as well as a smaller frequency limit f to achieve the required accuracy for wdns with high pipe flow rates the head losses are larger and the spatial distribution of nodal heads changes faster thus more meters are required to ensure the estimation accuracy during the test f is set as 90 of the number of meters however when there are large measurement errors or inappropriate setting of meter locations we would recommend smaller f to ensure the stability for the calculation of low frequency spectrum eq 11 beside if there are a large number of meters we recommend keeping f 100 as too large f will introduce fast varying basis vectors which may also decrease the stability of ghr ghr is based on wdn operating status that already has occurred and been monitored thus it is difficult to simulate a hypothetic operating status that has not occurred yet for example if we need to know the impact of closing a valve or adding a large demand hydraulic simulation is the more appropriate way than ghr beside ghr estimates wdn pressures in a global way and it cannot accurately consider the head change of a certain pipe especially for valves and pumps that may cause significant pressure changes although we can assign very small weights to the edges that represent valves pumps additional meters are required which will lead to increasing investments therefore when ghr is applied to wdns with a large number of pumps and valves its cost and performance would be affected 5 conclusions a novel ghr method is proposed to estimate unknown pressures of wdns ghr assumes the spatial distribution of nodal heads is smooth and uses gsp theory to reconstruct the unknown heads by their slow varying parts it analyses wdn system hydraulic features to quantitate the similarity of different nodes with respect to their heads and assigns specific weights to the graph structure on this basis the smoothness of nodal head distribution on the graph domain is enhanced thus accurate estimation results can be achieved with a limited number of meters ghr is tested on two different wdns and the key findings are summarized below 1 ghr provides an efficient and convenient way to estimate unknown nodal pressures which does not require high investment to precisely determine wdn physical parameters comparing with hydraulic models and can provide accurate estimation results comparing with traditional data interpolation methods 2 ghr shows high estimation accuracy under large parameter uncertainties and measurement errors indicating its robustness for real life applications 3 the similarity metrics proposed in this study can significantly improve the performance of gsp methods in analysing wdn pressure data although the main focus of this study is to estimate unknown wdn data the idea that combining wdn hydraulics with graph signal processing methods also presents a new perspective to analyze the spatial features of irregularly distributed data and provides insights for solving other problems in the research field of water resources and environments such as estimating unknown water quality in wdns or basins or detecting anomalies such as pipe bursts and incident contaminations

16044,the low spatial density of monitored nodal pressures nodal heads has already become a bottleneck restricting the development of smart technologies for water distribution networks wdns inferring unknown nodal heads through available wdn information is an effective way to bypass data limitations but an accurate and easy to implement method is still absent for general wdns the spatial distribution of nodal heads is approximately smooth as there are few dramatic head changes if heads can be divided into components with different spatial varying speeds then they can be approximated by a few slow varying components on this basis a graph based head reconstruction ghr method is proposed which employs graph signal processing technologies to reconstruct the slow varying parts to estimate unknown nodal heads four metrics are proposed to bridge wdn hydraulics and signal processing to quantify the similarity of adjacent nodal heads which enhance the smoothness of heads over the graph and thus increase estimation accuracy ghr was tested with different parameter settings and compared with other head estimation methods results showed that ghr has less restrictive parameter requirements compared with hydraulic simulation and outperforms traditional data interpolation methods with better accuracy at a larger looped network under potential model uncertainties and measurement errors ghr still accurately estimated the heads for more than 10 000 unknown nodes achieving a mean absolute error of 0 13 m using only 100 pressure meters thus the proposed method provides an efficient robust and convenient way to estimate unknown nodal heads in wdns graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data estimation graph signal processing nodal pressure smart water water distribution network 1 introduction water distribution networks wdns play a decisive role in the safety and stability of urban water supply the rapid growth of city size and population mohammadi and taylor 2017 causes an increase in water resources consumption and wdn load urging the implementation of smart technologies and automatic solutions to improve the management of wdns olsson 2020 which requires large scale data collection for example automatic diagnosis and forecasting of operating status guo et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 xu et al 2020 relies on analysis of the variation of measurements across many locations and leakage control and energy saving samir et al 2017 monsef et al 2018 often require comprehensive knowledge of wdn operating status such as nodal pressures throughout a wdn data availability is also the foundation for recently developed integrated solutions such as digital twin smart water and internet of things alshattnawi 2017 radhakrishnan and wu 2018 conejos fuertes et al 2020 although the progress in data acquisition and recording systems have reduced the cost of wdn monitoring due to the sheer size and complexity of wdns the number of required monitoring sensors is often much larger than what is actually installed for affordability and or practicality reasons for most of wdns thus the low spatial density of available data has already become a bottleneck restricting the development and application of intelligent technologies in wdns how to accurately infer as much unknown information as possible from limited knowledge of the wdns could be the key to solve the problem nodal pressure is one of the most important indicators of the hydraulic status of a wdn for simplicity in the following discussion we also use head the summation of the pressure and elevation of a node to represent nodal pressure in order to estimate unknown pressures the most widely used approach is to develop a hydraulic model to simulate the operation status of a real wdn and calculate unknown nodal pressures and pipe flow rates by solving continuity and energy equations rossman 1999 sharoonizadeh et al 2016 although hydraulic models can estimate unknown wdn hydraulic status in a direct and complete way the model parameters often contain unavoidable uncertainties hutton et al 2014 as they cannot be directly measured or require unaffordable costs to be precisely determined zhou et al 2018 for example pipe roughness coefficients can only be roughly estimated based on pipe diameter and age or indirectly inferred through the relationship between head loss and pipe flow rate nodal demands fluctuate over temporal and spatial scales herrera et al 2010 and accurate estimation of nodal demands is difficult due to unpredictable random customer usages these model parameter uncertainties may result in erroneous or misleading estimation results of wdn status model calibration and state estimation methods savic et al 2009 preis et al 2011 tshehla et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 chu et al 2021 have been proposed to improve the performance of hydraulic models by reducing parametric model uncertainties via available measurements savic et al 2009 however there are usually thousands of unknown model parameters to be estimated whereas only a relatively small number of direct measurements are available this leads to a highly underdetermined calibration problem that may result in an unstable solution no unique solution or no solution at all preis et al 2011 a possible way to solve the underdetermined problem is to reduce the number of unknown parameters by grouping pipe roughness coefficients mallick et al 2002 and or nodal demands kang and lansey 2009 zhou et al 2018 this assumes that parameters in a group are equal or perfectly correlated which will result in potential uncertainties in calibrated models it is also difficult to determine the appropriate grouping criteria and strategies savic et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 some state estimation methods preis et al 2011 tshehla et al 2017 chu et al 2021 assume prior knowledge also referred to as pseudo measurements of nodal demands to increase the number of constraints then update hydraulic state estimations using real time measurements this could make the problem solvable but the accurate setting of pseudo measurements is challenging and the parameters with low sensitivity to direct measurements could still be ill posed and lead to unstable results which limits the representativeness of model simulation results beside as the model calibration and state estimation methods are often complex in computation and experienced pre processing is often required an accurate and easy to implement method is still in its absence due to the difficulty and high cost most water utilities do not have access to well calibrated high precision models especially for large complex wdns which limits their management capabilities when a high precision hydraulic model is unavailable an alternative way is to infer unknown pressures from field measurements using interrelated relationships and specific spatial distribution patterns in wdn nodal pressures which has been tried by researchers using data interpolation or machine learning methods for example mounce et al 2003 used triangle based cubic interpolation to estimate pressure drops during pipe burst soldevila et al 2019 and soldevila et al 2021 employed kriging spatial interpolation to estimate pressures of unmeasured nodes and boatwright et al 2018 estimated unknown pressures by a spatially constrained inverse distance weighted interpolation method the above methods neglect the topological structure and hydraulic features of wdn which limit their performance traditional interpolation methods assume that spatially closed nodes will have similar values fig 1 a however nodal heads determined by irregular wdn topology and diverse physical components may suggest the opposite fig 1b therefore interpolation methods could lead to large errors especially in branches and ends of a wdn some studies use machine learning methods to learn the relationships between known measurements and unknown states in wdns lima et al 2017 built an artificial neural network to estimate unknown pressures using monitored inlet flow and pressures hajgat o et al 2021 used chebnet to reconstruct the nodal pressures and achieved high accuracy with the examined wdns these approaches could be promising but they are difficult to thoroughly consider various operation conditions and hydraulic parameter uncertainties when training the model beside experienced setting of hyperparameters such as the number of layers and learning rate are often required when developing these models which also limit its wide range application it is necessary to consider the hydraulic features of a wdn to develop more accurate and convenient approaches to estimate unknown nodal pressures through limited measurements recent developments of graph signal processing gsp techniques stanković et al 2019 and the successful applications in environmental monitoring jain et al 2014 brain science atasoy et al 2016 and community analysis tremblay and borgnat 2014 provide a new perspective to bridge data processing methods and wdn hydraulics gsp extends classical signal processing tools to graph structured signals lorenzo et al 2018 and uses a weighted graph to represent the spatial relationships of data in irregular structures this characteristic provides the ability to model and analyze the complex interactions among the nodal pressures data of a wdn the reason for choosing gsp to reconstruct unknown nodal pressures lies in that 1 as the wdn structure can be easily represented by a graph gsp is able to consider the topological relationship among wdn data 2 gsp uses weights to represent the similarity between adjacent signals which provides the possibility to represent the wdn hydraulics by assigning different weights based on the wdn hydraulic features graph based methods have been used to solve wdn problems including resilience analysis ulusoy et al 2018 meng et al 2018 partitioning hajebi et al 2015 and reconstruction of wdn dynamics wei et al 2020 etc in these studies metrics such as potential energy loss ulusoy et al 2018 sitzenfrei et al 2020 and topological properties giustolisi et al 2019 meng et al 2018 were proposed to analyze the features of a wdn nevertheless due to the complex spatial relationship of wdn pressures it remains to investigate appropriate hydraulic metrics and data analysis methodologies to enable a more efficient feature description and utilization thus these questions still remain to be answered 1 what kind of metrics are more suitable to quantify the spatial relationship of pressures 2 to what extent can we better reveal the hydraulic features with limited information of a wdn 3 how can we use gsp to find our desired features and further use these features to reconstruct unmonitored pressures in this study a new methodology to bridge wdn hydraulics with gsp is introduced the wdn structure is represented by a graph and the nodal heads are represented by signals defined over the graph vertices different metrics are proposed to characterize the wdn hydraulics and quantify the similarity of adjacent nodal heads with consideration of limited knowledge of the wdn edge weights of the constructed graph are determined according to the proposed metrics which enable the graph to better represent the hydraulic relationship of wdn heads based on the constructed graph and gsp technology a graph based head reconstruction ghr method is proposed to estimate unmonitored pressures of wdns ghr is tested on networks of different sizes and compared with different pressure estimation methods to illustrate its effectiveness and robustness 2 methodology 2 1 graph based head reconstruction the basic idea of ghr is to use gsp to exploit the spatial features of wdn pressures and reconstruct unmeasured values in this section we will demonstrate how to use graph and graph signals to represent a wdn and its pressures and provide an overview of gsp and the proposed unknown pressure estimation method a graph consists of a set of vertices v 1 2 n and a set of weighted edges b w i j i j v connecting the vertices intuitively the nodes including tanks and reservoirs of a wdn can be represented by the vertices of a graph and the pipes including pumps can be represented by the edges if nodes i and j are linked by pipe i j then w i j 0 otherwise w i j 0 the adjacency matrix w of the weighted graph can be constructed as w i j w i j where i j represents the element at the i th row and the j th column the heads of the wdn nodes can be regarded as signals on the graph vertices and can be arranged in a vector form 1 h h 1 h 2 h n t where h i is the head of node i as well as the signal on vertex i of the graph in classical signal analysis signals can be decomposed onto a set of basis vectors with different frequencies by fourier spectral analysis this approach can be extended to the graph signals using graph fourier transform gft which allows a graph signal to be represented in the graph frequency domain spanned by a set of basis vectors hence different signal varying speeds with respect to the graph topology can be described mateos et al 2019 gft is based on the graph laplacian matrix l 2 l diag 1 t w w where diag converts a vector into a diagonal matrix having the vector as main diagonal 1 denotes a vector with all elements equal to one the eigen decomposition of l is 3 l u λ u t where λ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of l in ascending order u u 1 u 2 u n which is composed of eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues it was proved stanković et al 2019 that an eigenvector associated with a smaller eigenvalue will have a lower frequency i e lower varying speed and better smoothness on the defined graph the idea of gft is to represent the original signal h by a linear combination of eigenvectors thereby dividing it into components with different frequencies this is achieved by 4 h u 1 h 5 h u h where h h 1 h 2 h n is the laplacian spectrum eqs 4 and 5 are called gft and inverse graph fourier transform igft of the graph signal h which employ u as the basis set as u i which corresponds to a smaller eigenvalue has lower frequency the former elements of h represent the spatially slow varying parts of h while the latter elements correspond to the fast varying parts the variation of nodal heads in a wdn is determined by the wdn physical structure and pipe flow velocity generally for a wdn in a normal steady state operating condition the change of heads on connected nodes is limited thus the adjacent heads vary slowly and the distribution of heads is approximately not strictly smooth over the graph based on this we can assume that h is bandlimited and can be approximately represented by its low frequency parts i e 6 h b h 7 h ub h where b is the n n f bandlimited matrix b i i 1 for each i f and other elements are zeros f is the frequency limit which decides the number of low frequency items used to approximate the original signal b h extracts the first f low frequency elements of h eq 7 is equivalent to 8 h u b f h f u f h f where b f is constructed by the non zero columns of b u f is constructed by the first f rows of u and h f h 1 h 2 h f for large wdns in order to speed up the calculation we can only solve the first f eigenvectors of l to construct u f and the methods to solve the eigenvectors for large sparse symmetric matrices can be used lehoucq 1998 measuring nodal heads in the wdn by pressure meters can be considered as sampling the original signal h assuming there are m pressure meters the measurements are 9 y s d s h where y s is the measured heads d s is an m n sampling matrix d s i j 1 if the i th pressure meter is installed at node j and zeros otherwise substituting eq 8 into eq 9 and we will get 10 y s d s u f h f based on eq 10 the low frequency spectrum h f can be estimated by the measured nodal heads let x d s u f then 11 h f pinv x y s x t x 1 x t y s where h f is the estimation of low frequency spectrum pinv returns the pseudo inverse x needs to have full column rank in order to solve eq 11 and a necessary condition requires f m i e the number of low frequency items should be smaller than the number of pressure meters after h f is calculated we can reconstruct the low frequency parts of h by 12 h u f h f where h represents the reconstructed nodal heads the elements in h are the estimation of unknown nodal heads and pressures can be obtained after subtracting the heights of the nodes 2 2 bridging wdn hydraulics and graph signal processing for a real life wdn the pressure changes between different nodes are not uniform in most cases therefore the smoothness assumption in eqs 6 and 7 could not be strictly satisfied which will introduce errors and lead to deviations in the reconstructed results thus we can define appropriate weights to enhance the smoothness of pressure change among nodes so that the original heads are better approximated by the low frequency parts for an edge that connects vertex i and j the weight w i j measures the similarity of signals on the connected vertices larger w i j corresponds to more similarity or mutual effects between the signals mateos et al 2019 in literature w i j is generally calculated by the inverse of distance between the vertices as farther distance usually corresponds to smaller similarity for example in spatial radio signal processing the weights are determined by the inverse distance between real world locations of the vertices redondi 2018 and in electrical circuits the weights are defined as reciprocal values to the electrical resistance stanković et al 2019 as the resistance represents the distance in a circuit system analogically the distance of nodes in a wdn with respect to their heads can be measured by the head loss of pipes that connect the nodes thus the distance i e the similarity of two connected nodes i and j is given by 13 w i j w j i 1 h i j h i j ε 1 1 ε 1 h i j ε 1 where h i j is the head loss of pipe i j ε 1 is a threshold value to avoid the appearance of extremely large values set at 0 01 in our study eq 13 uses the inverse of head loss to measure the similarity as smaller head loss indicates less difference between the adjacent nodal heads for pumps and valves in wdn as they will cause a significant head change between the connected nodes very small weights are assigned to the corresponding edges in order to make the metric unitless and easier for comparison a min max normalization is applied 14 w i j w i j min w ε 2 max w min w ε 2 where min and max return the minimum and maximum of the set respectively w w i j which is the set of w i j corresponding to all the pipes in the wdn ε 2 is a small positive value used to avoid zero values set as 0 001 max w min w in our study w plays the role of bridging wdn hydraulic features and graph structures it is determined by various wdn hydraulic parameters such as topology roughness coefficients and nodal demands calculating w involves an integrated hydraulic simulation with the requirement of a hydraulic model rossman 1999 of which the parameters are difficult to be accurately determined as discussed in section 1 nevertheless the case studies of our study will show that a hydraulic model with inaccurate parameters can still provide enough information to calculate w for pressure reconstruction if a hydraulic model is not currently available we can still establish a rough model to estimate w under certain assumptions basic parameters such as topology nodal elevations and pipe lengths and diameters can easily be obtained from design files and or geographic information systems gis data abdelbaki et al 2017 the parameters which are difficult to determine are pipe roughness and nodal demands as they are not directly measurable zhou et al 2018 therefore the assumptions are 1 pipe roughness of all pipes are uniform 2 user demand is uniform along all the water supplying pipes except for the known big users i e the nodal demands are assumed to be 15 r i j q t q b l i j l s u m 16 q n 0 5 i j n r i j where q t is the total demand of the wdn q b is the demand of big users l s u m is the sum of the length of all water supplying pipes l i j is the length of pipe i j r i j is the demand of pipe i j and q n is the demand of node n the edge weights can then be calculated by simulating head losses using the roughly constructed model and are denoted as w u q herein the elements in w u q will also be normalised similar to eq 14 compared with w w u q is a not so accurate metric to measure the wdn hydraulics but it still reveals the impact of wdn topology and the possible distribution of user demands the assumptions to calculate w u q are especially useful for wdns with relatively uniformly distributed demands such as wdns in residential areas the calculation of w and w u q involves hydraulic simulation by solving continuity and energy equations in some cases an index that does not need to perform hydraulic simulation but can measure the wdn hydraulics as accurately as possible can be useful as it provides a cheaper and more convenient way to estimate unknown pressures with a compromise of acceptable decreasing of reconstruction accuracy referring to the hazen williams formula h i j can be represented by 17 h i j 10 67 q i j 1 852 l i j c w i j 1 852 d i j 4 87 where q i j d i j and c w i j are the flow rate diameter and pipe roughness coefficient of pipe i j respectively substituting q v π d 2 4 into eq 17 and we will get 18 h i j k 1 v i j 1 852 1 c w i j 1 852 l i j d i j 1 166 where k 1 is a constant and v i j is the velocity of pipe i j assume that the velocity and roughness of all pipes are uniform then we will get 19 w i j u v w j i u v k 2 d i j 1 166 l i j where k 2 is a constant that can be neglected in the subsequent procedures w i j u v is the weight of edge i j assuming uniform velocity and roughness it is further min max normalized the calculation of w u v only requires the topology pipe length and diameter of a wdn which is easy to be investigated and measured w u v provides a very rough estimation of pipe head loss and the similar metric also has been used to analyze wdn features in other studies ulusoy et al 2018 sitzenfrei et al 2020 finally as a very low cost alternative we can assume all weights as uniform for all the edges set 20 w i j u w j i u 1 where w i j u is the weight of edge i j assuming uniform weights the four metrics proposed in this section i e w w u q w u v and w u have different assumptions to measure wdn hydraulics as much as possible and will lead to different reconstruction accuracy choice of which metric to use can be determined by how much wdn information is available these metrics will be further tested and discussed in the following sections in summary ghr combines wdn hydraulics to enhance the signal smoothness on the graph domain and reconstruct unknown nodal heads by calculating the low frequency parts of the laplacian spectrum h f the mechanism and steps of ghr are shown in fig 2 by choosing a suitable metric the weights corresponding to different pipes can be calculated with available wdn information and graph laplacian matrix l can be constructed the eigenvectors of l form the basis of gft as shown in fig 2a and b the low frequency parts contain most of the information about the nodal heads fig 2c therefore the low frequency spectrum is calculated by a limited number of measured sampled nodal heads to approximately represent the original value while the high frequency parts can be assumed as zeros fig 2d and e finally the slow varying parts of the original signal are reconstructed and are used to estimate the unknown nodal heads as shown in fig 2f 3 case studies and results ghr is applied to two wdns of different sizes to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness to evaluate the performance of ghr under different working conditions and parameter settings synthetic data are generated using epanet2 toolkit rossman 1999 to represent field data pressures at nodes where the meters are installed are set as measurements and other data are ground truth to evaluate the performance of different pressure estimation methods a number of assumptions and presets are made 1 when calculating w the pipe roughness coefficients cw and nodal demands q contain errors by default as they are the most uncertain parameters in a wdn model and can hardly be directly measured zhou et al 2018 unless otherwise stated cw and q are assigned with gaussian white noise n 0 σ 2 with a standard deviation of 10 σ c w 10 and 20 of the corresponding true demands σ q 20 respectively 2 when used the topological structure node elevation pipe length and pipe diameter of the wdns are assumed to be known and certain 3 locations of pressure meters are determined according to d optimality winer 1962 tsitsvero et al 2016 lorenzo et al 2018 given by 21 s arg max s m log det x t x where s is the set of pressure meters 4 for all the tests the frequency limits are set as f 0 9 m to ensure x has full column rank and eq 11 is solvable 5 for illustration purposes the tested wdns operate under normal conditions and abnormal conditions such as main pipe bursts and pump failure are not considered 6 mean absolute error mae is used to measure the performance of ghr given as 22 mae 1 n u i 1 n u h i h i where h i is the estimated head of node i n u is the number of unknown nodes 3 1 overall performance and comparison with other methods a middle sized real life network is used to illustrate the construction and performance of ghr the network as shown in fig 3 a consists of 4 reservoirs 480 nodes and 567 pipes with a total length of 147 km about 57 000 m3 of water are supplied from 4 reservoirs per day the nodal heads at 8 00 am are considered during the test because the largest nodal demands occur at this time and the varying of heads is the most significant the nodal heads of the network range from 35 m to 45 m as shown in fig 3a a total of 30 pressure meters are used and the pressures of reservoirs are also assumed to be known the meter locations when using w as weights are marked as triangles in fig 3a thus the objective is to estimate the unknown heads of the rest of 450 nodes with 34 known pressures fig 3b shows the head loss of pipes many of the head losses are larger than 1 m with the largest head loss reaching 6 12 m which indicates the fast varying and less smoothness of heads among different nodes and makes it more difficult to infer the unknown pressures from known measurements thus the tested wdn can better illustrate the performance of ghr under a less favourable condition to illustrate the novelty of ghr fig 4 presents how the original nodal heads are approximated by a set of low frequency basis vectors some typical basis vectors and corresponding spectrums see eqs 4 and 5 are shown the former values of h such as h 1 and h 5 are much larger than the latter values therefore ignoring the latter value will have little impact as discussed in eqs 6 and 7 from another perspective the former basis vectors such as u 1 u 5 and u 15 change more smoothly and globally while the latter vectors such as u 100 and u 300 show local and rapid changes at the same time fig 3 a shows that the real nodal heads mainly include global changes which is consistent with the former low frequency basis vectors the analysis shows that using a limited number of low frequency basis vectors to approximate the original heads is feasible in practical wdns in fig 5 the performance of ghr with different weight metrics w w u q w u v and w u see section 2 2 are tested and are compared to two spatial interpolation methods fig 5a d shows the head reconstruction results using the four metrics as shown in fig 5a using w as weights the mae of the estimated heads is only 0 25 m and 83 of estimation errors are less than 0 5 m beside comparing with fig 3 we can find that the head differences of many adjacent nodes are larger than 1 m while ghr still obtains accurate estimation results for these nodes which also shows the effectiveness of ghr therefore despite the parameter uncertainties σ c w 10 σ q 20 ghr can provide very good estimation results with the help of a hydraulic model the calculation of w u q actually builds a temporal hydraulic model with roughly assigned hydraulic parameters to determine the weights leading to a larger mae of 0 29 m fig 5b although the calculation of w and w u q requires to perform hydraulic simulations ghr shows good robustness to hydraulic parameter uncertainties which will be further discussed in section 3 2 fig 5c shows the results of ghr using w u v calculating w u v needs less wdn knowledge and do not require performing hydraulic simulation although the accuracy decreases to mae 0 48 m 64 of the errors are still less than 0 5 m and 99 are less than 2 m larger errors occur when the nearby pipes have extremely large or small flow velocities using ghr with w u v provides a convenient and low cost alternative to estimate unknown wdn pressures as the required parameters e g length and diameter of pipes are easier to obtain the results using uniform weights w u is shown in fig 5d the overall estimation error increases to mae 0 51 m and some nodes especially nodes at the end of the network have significantly increased error using uniform weights assumes that all adjacent nodal heads have the same similarity which will lead to low accuracy when a large head loss occurs however compared with the interpolation methods ghr with uniform weights still achieves better results as the topology structure of the wdn is considered for comparison purposes nearest neighbor interpolation and universal kriging interpolation li and heap 2008 are tested and the results are presented in fig 5e and f these methods achieve lower accuracy compared with the results of ghr as discussed in fig 1 the interpolation methods cannot incorporate the topological structure and hydraulic features of wdn therefore larger errors may occur universal kriging interpolation is more accurate than nearest interpolation as it considers the spatial distance between nodes however it still shows poor performance for nodes that are far from the meters or located at the end of the network because the values of these nodes are less relevant to their distance to measured nodes 3 2 parameter uncertainties fig 5a shows that ghr can provide good estimation results with the help of hydraulic models despite parameter uncertainties it is meaningful to investigate whether using ghr with w can achieve better accuracy than direct hydraulic simulation under different parameter uncertainties in this section the impact of parameter uncertainties including systematic errors and random errors are tested and the results of ghr and hydraulic simulation under different degrees of uncertainties are compared each test is repeatedly performed 50 times with regenerated noises to cw and q the noises follow n μ c w σ c w 2 and n μ q σ q 2 where μ c w and μ q are the systematic error of cw and q respectively for ghr the pressure of 30 measured nodes and 4 reservoirs are used same as in section 3 1 the results are shown in fig 6 and it can be found that ghr is less affected by both systematic and random errors for example the hydraulic simulation results can only have better accuracy than ghr when there are small parameter uncertainties σ q 20 and σ c w 10 with no systematic error μ c w 0 and μ q 0 focusing on the first abscissa no random errors with different levels of systematic errors the maes of hydraulic simulation results increase 0 31 m 0 36 m and 0 70 m respectively while the mae of ghr results only increase 0 02 m 0 03 m and 0 05 m respectively fig 6a to 6d under a specific systematic error the increasing of random errors σ q and σ c w also has more significant impacts on the error of hydraulic simulation results the robustness of ghr to hydraulic parameter uncertainties lies in that it combines both the information from wdn hydraulics and the available measurements and the hydraulic model act only as a reference to calculate w the introduced errors in w can be tolerated as long as the smoothness hypothesis is ensured on the other hand although a hydraulic modal can utilize field measurements to achieve better accuracy by model calibration methods it is not easy to achieve as discussed in section 1 3 3 number of meters and measurement errors other factors that have significant effects on the performance of ghr include the quantity and quality of available measurements in this section different numbers of meters and measurement errors are tested with w w u q w u v and w u respectively the measurements are assigned with gaussian white noise with standard deviation σ h ranging from 0 m to 0 5 m each parameter set is performed 50 times with regenerated errors and the results are shown in fig 7 using more meters will improve the accuracy of ghr as more information about the spatial distribution of nodal heads can be provided with 75 pressure meters the mae of ghr using w as weights can decrease to only 0 10 m when small measurement errors are assigned fig 7a we also identified that using more meters can reduce the performance differences among different weights for example the difference of mae when using w and w u is around 0 5 m with only 15 meters whereas the difference decreases to around 0 15 m with 75 meters therefore when limited information about a wdn is known we can still install a sufficient number of meters and use ghr with the more easy to obtain weights to estimate the unknown pressures with high accuracy the mae with different degrees of measurement errors are compared in fig 7a d the accuracy decreases with larger measurement error as well as a wider distribution range of mae for different tests however ghr still shows good robustness with the increasing of the errors and the mae of estimation results can be even smaller than σ h with sufficient meters for instance when σ h increases from 0 01 m to 0 5 m the mae only increases by 0 2 0 3 m and the mae of ghr using w is only around 0 4 m when σ h 0 5 m the robustness of ghr to measurement errors comes from the fact that ghr discards the spatially high frequency parts and emphasis the low frequency parts thus implicitly filtering out part of the measurement errors 3 4 performance on large network in this section ghr is tested on a large looped network to further illustrate its performance on real life wdns the network as shown in fig 8 a contains 12 523 nodes 2 sources and 14 822 pipes it was initially used in the battle of the water sensor networks bwsn ostfeld et al 2008 for simplicity and better illustration of the effect of customer demand variation control rules in the original network are deleted the nodal heads at 7 00 am when the network has the largest nodal demands are used to test the performance of ghr model uncertainties σ c w 10 and σ q 20 and measurement errors σ h 0 2 m are considered during the tests the real nodal heads of the wdn range from 66 m to 75 m where the upper left parts show faster pressure change and the bottom right parts change slowly as shown in fig 8a the estimation error with 100 pressure meters and different weight metrics are shown in fig 8b c and d respectively despite the existence of parameter uncertainty and measurement errors ghr with w accurately estimated the nodal head of more than 10 000 unknown nodes with an mae of 0 13 m although the existing pumps and valves cause dramatic nodal head change that cannot be assumed as smooth the head of these nodes can still be successfully estimated by assigning small weights and setting appropriate meters as shown in fig 8c using w u q as weights reduces the overall estimation accuracy as cw and q are roughly determined and will introduce large uncertainties when calculating weights compared with fig 8d that using w u as weights using w u q has better performance especially for the nodes near the main pipes as these pipes have large head losses however using w u still shows good performance with an mae of 0 167 m especially for the nodes with slow pressure changes in order to further illustrate the performance of ghr under different operation conditions it is applied to real time estimate unknown nodal heads during 24 h the operating data of the second day of the original bwsn network are used because a large demand variation occurs on this day thus the impacts of daily demands variations can be better tested the tests are performed 50 times with regenerated errors for model parameters and measurements the graph weights w are calculated based on only the wdn hydraulics at 7 00 am same as in fig 8 and are used to estimate unknown heads at different operation conditions throughout the day the maes and the demand variation are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that ghr can have better accuracy with lower nodal demands as low nodal demands result in slow variation of nodal heads which is more consistent with the smoothness hypothesis of ghr comparing the mae at 7 00 am and 9 00 pm we can find that although the graph weights are calculated using the hydraulics of a different operation the increase in mae is small therefore it is feasible to use the w obtained from a specific operating condition to estimate unknown nodal heads under other operating conditions 4 discussions compared with hydraulic simulation estimating unknown nodal pressures from available measurements can be a more easy to implement alternative approach but there are few successful methods that can achieve high accuracy results through bridging wdn hydraulics with gsp ghr provides a novel method to reconstruct unknown nodal heads with not only high accuracy but also good robustness to parameter uncertainties and measurement errors based on the examples and results presented above comprehensive discussions are summarized as follows the main contribution of ghr is that it provides an effective but low cost methodology to estimate the unknown wdn pressures when an accurate hydraulic model is available or there are sufficient technicians and investments to perform elaborated model calibration integrated hydraulic simulation is still the best way to calculate the unknown pressures however water companies would have limited investments in the construction and maintenance of hydraulic models under a lot of cases and using ghr provides a convenient and low cost approach to achieve good estimation results without the requirement to accurately determine wdn hydraulic parameters for example although some water companies have currently available hydraulic models the absence of long term maintenance and calibration results in a significant decrease in model accuracy and thus the simulated results cannot be directly applied to infer wdn hydraulics in that case using the inaccurate hydraulic model to calculate w and employ ghr to reconstruct unknown pressures could be a very convenient way to achieve good results even with no hydraulic models ghr can use w u q w u v and w u to exploit more readily wdn information such as pipe length and diameters and reveal the wdn hydraulics as much as possible to improve its accuracy compared with traditional data interpolation methods ghr has better performance because it considers the topology of a wdn and reveals the relationship of heads at different nodes thus effectively improving the estimation accuracy ghr shows better performance in wdns with low pipe flow rates and slow varying nodal heads as these wdns are more in accordance with the smoothness hypothesis of ghr therefore for these wdns we can use fewer meters as well as a smaller frequency limit f to achieve the required accuracy for wdns with high pipe flow rates the head losses are larger and the spatial distribution of nodal heads changes faster thus more meters are required to ensure the estimation accuracy during the test f is set as 90 of the number of meters however when there are large measurement errors or inappropriate setting of meter locations we would recommend smaller f to ensure the stability for the calculation of low frequency spectrum eq 11 beside if there are a large number of meters we recommend keeping f 100 as too large f will introduce fast varying basis vectors which may also decrease the stability of ghr ghr is based on wdn operating status that already has occurred and been monitored thus it is difficult to simulate a hypothetic operating status that has not occurred yet for example if we need to know the impact of closing a valve or adding a large demand hydraulic simulation is the more appropriate way than ghr beside ghr estimates wdn pressures in a global way and it cannot accurately consider the head change of a certain pipe especially for valves and pumps that may cause significant pressure changes although we can assign very small weights to the edges that represent valves pumps additional meters are required which will lead to increasing investments therefore when ghr is applied to wdns with a large number of pumps and valves its cost and performance would be affected 5 conclusions a novel ghr method is proposed to estimate unknown pressures of wdns ghr assumes the spatial distribution of nodal heads is smooth and uses gsp theory to reconstruct the unknown heads by their slow varying parts it analyses wdn system hydraulic features to quantitate the similarity of different nodes with respect to their heads and assigns specific weights to the graph structure on this basis the smoothness of nodal head distribution on the graph domain is enhanced thus accurate estimation results can be achieved with a limited number of meters ghr is tested on two different wdns and the key findings are summarized below 1 ghr provides an efficient and convenient way to estimate unknown nodal pressures which does not require high investment to precisely determine wdn physical parameters comparing with hydraulic models and can provide accurate estimation results comparing with traditional data interpolation methods 2 ghr shows high estimation accuracy under large parameter uncertainties and measurement errors indicating its robustness for real life applications 3 the similarity metrics proposed in this study can significantly improve the performance of gsp methods in analysing wdn pressure data although the main focus of this study is to estimate unknown wdn data the idea that combining wdn hydraulics with graph signal processing methods also presents a new perspective to analyze the spatial features of irregularly distributed data and provides insights for solving other problems in the research field of water resources and environments such as estimating unknown water quality in wdns or basins or detecting anomalies such as pipe bursts and incident contaminations
