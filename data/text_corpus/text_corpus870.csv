4350,droughts are responsible for severe vegetation loss and declining agricultural yields as future climate change projections imply an increased risk of extreme events the occurrence of droughts is potentially accelerating in the future the influence of climate change on drought events in a danish agricultural catchment under the emission scenario rcp8 5 are evaluated by three different drought indices covering soil moisture groundwater and streamflow deficits the indices are based on results from a hydrological model forced by downscaled climate outputs from 16 euro cordex climate models gcm rcms while considering uncertainties among climate model projections the hydrological model demonstrated a satisfactory ability in modelling historical drought characteristics the results from the future projections showed that the intensity and frequency of droughts increased towards the end of the century the spatial patterns of changes in drought were found to be highly dependent on the climate model results index formulations and assumptions as well as the hydrogeological properties of the catchment groundwater based irrigation in the agricultural areas effectively mitigates soil moisture drought leading to lower future uncertainty of the ensemble mean higher model agreement for soil moisture droughts at irrigated locations this is obtained at the cost of lower groundwater levels in both reference and future periods resulting in larger uncertainties on the simulated groundwater droughts because of the addition of irrigation uncertainty while the joint impact of greater groundwater abstraction and changing dynamics of precipitation and groundwater recharge also leads to larger streamflow variability between model combinations standard deviation under rcp8 5 for the downstream discharge station keywords drought indices irrigation impact climate change impact hydrological model uncertainty spatiotemporal pattern 1 introduction drought is a natural hazard that can occur everywhere realizing an extended period of water deficiency in various parts or the entire hydrological cycle which can be modulated or amplified by other natural processes e g snowmelt compensation or increased evapotranspiration demand and human activities e g irrigation and pumping the impacts of the processes related to drought propagate through the systems non linearly and unequally mukherjee et al 2018 leading to multiple environmental and socio economic risks that may occur concurrently or sequentially therefore these underlying processes draw the attention of the scientific community from the perspective of meteorology hydrology agriculture and socio economics to quantify and forecast droughts and predict their impacts on the regional environment economy and society tramblay et al 2020 this complexity and uncertainty is further exacerbated in the future due to climate change natural droughts usually develop slowly when compared to other extreme events hence a major challenge of drought research is to accurately identify the onset duration and termination of a single drought and separate one event from others mukherjee et al 2018 mishra and singh 2010 the sophisticated characteristics also hinder the development of a universal definition which is essential for drought detection monitoring and analysis mckee et al 1993 broadly speaking droughts can be categorized into four main types based on their leading physical mechanisms and impacts meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic drought wilhite and glantz 1985 to monitor drought events and quantify their frequency and intensity one of the most straightforward ways is to compute drought indices over the past few decades numerous drought indices have been introduced wmo and gwp 2016 and many drought studies around the world have investigated drought events and drought characteristics applying such indices for historical time periods e g bloomfield and marchant 2013 nalbantis and tsakiris 2008 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 these investigations predominantly evaluate the temporal variability of drought at multiple timescales e g monthly seasonally and annually over a lumped study area or using point measurements like weather station data this approach however does not capture the spatial variability that may occur in response to heterogeneous land use and hydrogeological characteristics within the target area one of the novelties of this work is to evaluate the spatial distributions and temporal variations of drought which is vital information for identification of vulnerable areas and for drought monitoring much drought research has discussed and improved our understanding of the various processes related to droughts while less research has been dedicated to the potential changes in drought under the impact of future global warming studies in north america e g feng et al 2017 masud et al 2017 have suggested that an accelerated hydrologic cycle would trigger more severe droughts under a warming climate scenario the understanding of future changes in drought in temperate regions such as denmark is very limited only few drought related studies have addressed how anticipated climate change would influence groundwater recharge e g refsgaard et al 2016 stream discharge e g roosmalen et al 2007 and soil moisture e g karlsson et al 2015 these studies indicated wetter and hotter climate conditions in the future for denmark where seasonal difference between wet winters and drier summers were accelerated which might lead to an extension of dry spells especially during the growing season summer however more detailed assessments of the potential impact of droughts in a future climate are required to develop reliable mitigation and adaptation strategies additionally most previous studies have only evaluated the drought changes of a single component in the hydrologic system and may therefore overlook important linkages and governing mechanisms of the drying anomalies only a limited number of studies have to our knowledge examined the issue of future droughts from a multifactor perspective another important contribution of this work is to quantify the degree of water shortage by three drought indices aiming to explore the interactions and relationships between different components of the hydrologic cycle in response to drought as different types of drought may occur simultaneously or sequentially it is difficult to formulate a single drought index to present the entire abnormal condition mukherjee et al 2018 added that different indices show different degrees of sensitivity to the same level of warming therefore the assessment should be done from multivariate aspects of drought by considering more than one drought index this study assesses changes of drought by analysing drought indices using the output from an ensemble of 16 cordex regional climate models rcms under rcp8 5 for the ahlergaarde catchment in denmark jensen and refsgaard 2018 the climate model projections have been biased corrected to account for systematic errors pasten zapata et al 2019 different methods have been proposed for bias correction including the delta change and the distribution based scaling dbs methods pulido velazquez et al 2018 van roosmalen et al 2011 here a distribution based scaling dbs method proposed by seaby et al 2013 has been used as their study documented that the method was able to accurately transfer changes in mean monthly and seasonal temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration additionally the method provided a satisfactory representation of the day to day variation as well as heavy precipitation events the integrated and distributed hydrological model code mike she abbott et al 1986 is used in this study since we want to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in soil moisture content depth to the water table and streamflow a distributed representation of the catchment is required in addition an integrated model is required as we want to consider the interaction between the hydrological processes at catchment scale the mike she model code is widely used internationally for comprehensive hydrological studies and it is the framework for the development of the danish water resources model dk model henriksen et al 2003 the model is forced with gridded climate data on daily precipitation temperature and reference evapotranspiration using the same methodology as for the dk model stisen et al 2012 the catchment area was classified into two main categories irrigated and non irrigated areas to evaluate the different responses to dryness with and without irrigation given the importance of agriculture within the study area to the national economy and the impacts on the livelihoods and environment of the region it is essential to understand how climate change affects drought characteristics in a spatially distributed manner for both surface and sub surface variables therefore this study particularly explores the drying effect on factors influencing agricultural activities because prolonged dry spells will significantly reduce crop productivity groundwater conditions are also important as groundwater is the most crucial source of freshwater in denmark supplying 99 of the water use j√∏rgensen and stockmarr 2009 for most studies on drought characteristics index development and other dimensions associated with groundwater are largely ignored to fil this gap we analyze the propagation of drought impacts from the land surface to the groundwater system drought indices can be seen as a simplified representation of the impacts and they therefore provide a more comprehensible measure for the general public e g farmers to understand the potential impacts the study has the following specific objectives 1 to verify the hydrological model outputs of hydrological variables against observational data and assess model results based on the downscaled gcm rcm climate predictions 2 to estimate and compare several drought indices in the reference 1981 2010 and the future period 2070 2099 including soil moisture deficit index smdi standardized groundwater depth index sgdi and streamflow drought index sdi 3 to explore the linkage between the droughts and changing climate and 4 to evaluate the potential impact of uncertainties from climate model choices on the indices the results will help improve the understanding of the current and potential dryness condition in the ahlergaarde catchment and provide useful information for water management and agricultural activities in the future 2 study area and data the study is carried out in the ahlergaarde catchment situated in the central part of the jutland peninsula denmark the catchment covers an area of approximately 1050 km2 and is drained by the skjern river system this region has a relatively flat topography with elevation variations from about 125 m above sea level in the eastern part to 20 m in the western part fig 1 agricultural land use 61 dominates the catchment followed by forest 21 and meadow 15 sebok et al 2016 the dominant crops are wheat and barley and irrigation is the primary contributor to groundwater extraction especially during the growing season may to september the top soils are mainly coarse permeable sandy deposits with a relatively small water retention capability and the area is therefore one of the most irrigated catchments in denmark the high permeability of the surface layers also results in very limited overland flow with exceptions of wetlands and in the riparian zone where surface runoff might be generated as a result of saturation of the soils from shallow groundwater the catchment is characterized by a temperate maritime climate which leads to relatively mild winters and cool summers with an annual average temperature of 8 2 c the annual average precipitation reference evapotranspiration and stream discharge over the period of 1990 2013 are 983 mm 540 mm and 500 mm respectively lucatero et al 2018 precipitation occurs all year round but is typically higher in autumn and winter more than half of the precipitation is returned to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration and the remaining is transferred through the stream and groundwater systems the stream flow system is dominated by the baseflow component jensen and refsgaard 2018 numerous observations were collected in the catchment by the hobe project jensen and refsgaard 2018 including precipitation stream flow evapotranspiration soil moisture and groundwater levels the observational climatic hydrological and hydrogeological data are obtained from these data bases enoha http www enoha eu and jupiter geus http data geus dk jupiterwww index jsp the locations of the measurement stations in the catchment are shown in fig 2 including groundwater levels stream discharge evapotranspiration based on the eddy covariance method and soil moisture based on measurements from cosmic ray neutron sensors and capacitance sensors denager et al 2020 most soil moisture sensors were installed on agricultural land and placed at three different depths 2 5 cm 22 5 cm and 52 5 cm bircher et al 2012 the cosmic ray soil moisture measurements at voulund agriculture site represent the average water content of the soil approximately at depths of 0 20 cm andreasen et al 2020 the flux towers at voulund and gludsted forest site records the actual evapotranspiration ringgaard et al 2011 the depth to the groundwater table is measured in 10 wells within the catchment zhang et al 2016 apart from the observational data the bias corrected daily climate model outputs from cordex including air temperature precipitation and reference evapotranspiration under rcp8 5 ipcc 2014 are used table 1 the gridded data used to drive the model have the following spatial resolution 10 km 10 km for rainfall and 20 km 20 km for air temperature and reference evapotranspiration the individual gcm rcm coupled models are here treated as a single unity referred to as the climate model a detailed description of the bias correction can be found in pasten zapata et al 2019 all changes in the future period 2070 2099 are quantified using the period 1981 2010 as baseline 3 methods 3 1 hydrological model mike she 3 1 1 model setup the model code mike she abbott et al 1986 is used in the study mike she is a deterministic and physically based fully distributed modeling system which has formed the platform for the development of the danish national water resources model dk model henriksen et al 2003 the horizontal discretization of the model is 500 m 500 m resulting in a total of 4205 grids covering the ahlergaarde catchment actual evapotranspiration is simulated using the method developed by kristensen and jensen 1975 vertical unsaturated flow is calculated based on richards equation which is solved numerically by a finite difference scheme with a vertical discretization of 5 cm in the top 30 cm of the soil profile while cell sizes are gradually increased to 1 m cells at depths below 10 m groundwater flow is resolved by 14 computational layers and described by the 3d governing equation based on darcy s law the maximum time step for the unsaturated zone flow and saturated zone flow is both specified to 24 h the soil profile is divided into three soil horizons a 0 0 3 m b 0 3 0 8 m and c 0 8 m where the numbers indicate depth below ground surface the most common soil type is coarse sandy soil jb1 followed by clayey sandy soil jb3 greve et al 2007 land use is described by 11 classes and the catchment is divided into irrigated areas with crops i e wheat barley maize and grass and non irrigated areas all other land use types fig 1d crop rotation is not implemented as it is carried out in reality but is translated into a relative distribution of crop types and preserved within each land use soil combination karlsson et al 2015 irrigation is assumed to start in may and end in september and irrigation demand is computed by the model based on a maximum allowed deficit in maximum available water for crop transpiration maw maw refers to the difference between the field capacity Œ∏ fc and the wilting point Œ∏ wp integrated over the root zone the soil moisture deficit smd is defined as the portion of maw that is missing which ranges from 0 actual moisture content Œ∏ act equals field capacity Œ∏ fc to 1 actual moisture content Œ∏ act equals wilting point Œ∏ wp dhi 2017a 1 smd maw a w maw 2 aw Œ∏ act Œ∏ wp it is assumed that irrigation starts when smd reaches 0 3 i e 30 of the available water is used and stops when smd drops to 0 15 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis and optimization the hydrological model is run for the period 2008 2018 where 2011 2016 is used for calibration and 2017 2018 is used for validation the first three years are used as model warm up the autocal scheme incorporated in the mike she code dhi 2017a is used for parameter sensitivity analysis and automatic calibration a local sensitivity analysis based on backward difference approximation option is used to identify which parameters to include in the subsequent optimization the model is auto calibrated with the global optimization algorithm population simplex evolution method combined with monte carlo sampling dhi 2017b madsen 2000 in the calibration scheme five different objective functions are defined representing discharge q hydraulic head head soil moisture from sensors sensor soil moisture from cosmic ray measurements ray and evapotranspiration et the match to each observation type is assessed using the root mean square error rmse expressed as follows 3 f Œ∏ rmse x k 1 k 1 n i 1 n obs i sim i 2 1 2 where f Œ∏ rmse x represents the objective function for variable x obs i and sim i are observed and simulated values at time i 1 2 n for measurement location k 1 2 k where n and k are the number of time steps and number of measurement stations wells respectively the objective functions are assigned a weight to reflect the relative priorities given to the individual variables the weighted objective functions are subsequently aggregated and transformed to a common distance scale dhi 2017b the resulting objective functions within the predefined parameter space f Œ∏ is defined as 4 f Œ∏ m i n f Œ∏ rmse q f Œ∏ rmse h e a d f Œ∏ rmse s e n s o r f Œ∏ rmse r a y f Œ∏ rmse e t the stopping criterion of the optimization is defined by either i maximum number of model evaluations ii convergence in objective function space or iii convergence in parameter space dhi 2017b 3 2 drought indices in order to evaluate different types of droughts three drought indices have been chosen based on both frequent successful and well documented use in the literature soil moisture deficit index smdi standardized groundwater depth index sgdi and streamflow drought index sdi the thresholds between normal and drought conditions are calculated differently for the indexes see the following sections and drought ranges also differentiate table 2 following the original index formulation therefore care must be taken when comparing and interpreting the indices in addition to this some specific assumptions are also made in the study the long term thresholds of smdi grid and soil type based are calculated for non irrigated grids only in the period of may to july i e growing season 13 weeks the long term thresholds of sgdi grid based are calculated for all individual grids in the period from may to september i e irrigation period 21 weeks the long term thresholds of sdi station based are calculated for the downstream discharge station in the period from may to september i e irrigation period 21 weeks attention is given to agricultural drought and therefore smdi is calculated for the growing season only while the sgdi and sdi are calculated for an extended time period because groundwater and stream flow react more slowly to water shortage and an extended period is required to better capture the drought signals under the joint natural and anthropogenic factors for smdi thresholds were defined only for the non irrigated grids in order to obtain thresholds close to the natural level i e without influence of irrigation this is not done for the groundwater index as it is expected that the groundwater levels react to abstraction for irrigation beyond the grid cell being pumped 3 2 1 soil moisture deficit index smdi agricultural drought is characterized by insufficient soil moisture availability in the root zone adversely affecting crop growth and agricultural production the smdi was proposed by narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and the weekly percentage of moisture deficit is computed as 5 sd i j sw i j msw j msw j minsw j 100 i f sw i j msw j 6 sd i j sw i j msw j maxsw j m sw j 100 i f sw i j msw j where sd i j is the soil water deficit for the ith year and the jth week and sw i j is the available soil water available in the soil profile mm for year i and week j the available soil water is computed for a soil profile of 60 cm extent by integrating the values simulated for the individual nodal points according to the numerical discretization the long term minimum median and maximum available soil water of week j between 1981 and 2010 are denoted by minsw j msw j and maxsw j respectively as the soil water retention capability is highly associated with soil characteristics the three long term thresholds weekly for each soil type were estimated from the available soil water content of non agricultural grids in other words the same long term thresholds would be applied to grids belonging to the same soil type regardless of the land use and irrigation by utilizing eqs 5 or 6 the impact of the inherent seasonality in moisture content is assumed to be eliminated narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 the dryness condition is presented by the weekly sd values ranging from 100 very dry to 100 very wet palmer 1965 suggested that the drought index should be computed on an incremental basis and the dryness conditions need to be accumulated to determine drought severity therefore drought severity in any given week is given by 7 smdi i j 1 2 smdi j 1 sd j 50 hereby smdi will range between 4 and 4 in the reference period however the index range may go outside the normal 4 interval under changing climatic conditions because the long term minimum median and maximum water content derived from the reference period are also used to calculate the indices for the future period in order to see the relative changes between the two periods 3 2 2 standardized groundwater depth index sgdi a period of groundwater level decline which would result in significant adverse effects can be considered as a groundwater drought the standardized groundwater depth index sgdi is modified on the basis of standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and aims to evaluate the variations and characteristics of the groundwater level bhuiyan et al 2006 bloomfield and marchant 2013 the distance to the water table forms the basis of the index as other groundwater variables e g recharge and groundwater discharge cannot be measured directly in groundwater wells but rely on model results tate and gustard 2000 van lanen and peters 2000 the distance to the water table varies over the year in response to recharge fetter 2001 and the index on the weekly basis is calculated as follows for each grid 8 sgdi d i j d j std d j where d i j is the distance to the water table for the ith year and the jth week d j and std d j are the long term mean depth to the groundwater table and its standard deviation of week j in the control period 1981 2010 respectively for the majority of the randomly selected grids the kolmogorov smirnov ks normality test not shown indicated that the groundwater level time series from may to september were normally distributed at the p 0 01 level as a result the series values can be standardized without any transformation yeh et al 2016 bloomfield and marchant 2013 mendicino et al 2008 the classification of drought based on sgdi follows that of spi ranging from 2 dry to 2 wet the same long term thresholds are utilized to compute the indices for both reference and future period implying that the index range may go outside the normal range in the future because it preserves the historical statistics as a basis for comparing future results with a known reference 3 2 3 streamflow drought index sdi the streamflow drought index sdi is also developed based on spi as stream flow q i j is likely to be skewed and followed a gamma distribution a two parameter log normal distribution is used to transform the distribution into normal by taking natural logarithms of streamflow y i j nalbantis and tsakiris 2008 9 sdi y i j y j std y j 10 y i j ln q i j sdi is only calculated for the main station q250082 located at the outlet of the catchment where historical and future values of streamflow are assessed the natural logarithms of cumulative flow volume with average y j and standard deviation std y j estimated over the historical period are further applied to the future period and as for index sgd it may result in indices exceeding the normal range between 2 and 2 which might be attributed to extremely high or low flow under future climate 3 3 uncertainty analysis and multi model ensemble in order to assess the uncertainty arising from the different climate model combinations the multi model ensemble mean of three drought indices is presented along with the corresponding model spread and model agreement note that an equi feasible ensemble approach i e considering the simulations of all model combinations is applied in this study collados lara et al 2018 while the model spread describes the variability between the multi model ensemble members the model agreement shows where the different models agree disagree on the projected changes li et al 2016 tebaldi et al 2011 the model agreement is indicated by the number of models where indices project the same drought category as the ensemble mean note that for grids with a relatively low model agreement i e 6 results are not further differentiated 4 results in the following chapter results from the model analysis are presented first parameter sensitivity and model calibration are described followed by a quantification of climate change impacts on the hydrological variables next the impacts on drought indices are presented and finally the uncertainty caused by climate models is described 4 1 hydrological simulations parameter sensitivity and optimization a sensitivity analysis was carried out in which 47 parameters from different modules of the mike she model were evaluated fig 3 the initial value of these parameters was taken from the national water resources model the dk model henriksen et al 2003 which serves as a departure point for the analysis nine parameters table 3 were selected for calibration in order to avoid over parameterization while at the same time ensuring that the selected parameter combination contained at least one parameter which was highly sensitive to each of the five objective functions less sensitive parameters were tied to the most sensitive land use is dominated by agriculture and since irrigation depends on groundwater abstraction groundwater levels and streamflow in the catchment are both affected data on stream discharge and groundwater level are considered to be overall more reliable than the other types of measurements which are more complicated to carry out and prone to uncertainties partly caused by spatial scale discrepancies hence an accurate simulation of hydraulic head and discharge are prioritized compared to other variables included in the objective functions during the calibration process table 4 overall the model performance with respect to the hydrological dynamics for both the calibration and validation periods are considered satisfactory table 5 firstly the discharge performance in the downstream main station q250082 is acceptable nse 0 7 implying a high degree of accordance between observations and simulations fig 4 e nevertheless the model has a tendency to underestimate peak flows and overestimate low flows the performance for the four upstream stations not shown is not as good as the main station this might be explained by the lower streamflow values implying that uncertainties related to the topographical and geological characterization become more critical due to the smaller catchment sizes the performance with respect to groundwater levels is acceptable with a me of 20 cm in the calibration period and 16 cm in the validation period table 5 rmse values of less than 3 m are found for both calibration and validation 2 27 m and 2 43 m respectively which is considered to be an acceptable result sonnenborg et al 2003 for et a me of 0 07 mm day is found in the calibration period which is acceptable compared to the mean et of 1 57 mm day the results for the validation period are less convincing 0 3 mm day but is still within an acceptable range the variability of the deviations is relatively high with rmse values of 1 04 mm day and 1 15 mm day respectively for the two periods also for soil moisture the simulation results are within expected accuracy levels denager et al 2020 4 2 climate projection present versus future the simulated water balance components for the 16 gcm rcm combinations based on the optimized mike she model are shown in table 6 for the reference period 1981 2010 and changes in the future period 2070 2099 the annual precipitation and actual evapotranspiration in the historical period both resemble the observations ensemble mean of 1002 mm and 507 mm respectively implying that sufficient bias correction was done all models agree on an increase in precipitation and actual evapotranspiration in the future period resulting in average rises of 133 mm 13 3 and 91 mm 17 9 respectively the groundwater flow combination of drain flow and baseflow is the dominating inflow component to the streams however an increase of only 29 mm is found corresponding to about 6 increase the ensemble mean indicates a potential increase of stream discharge with respect to the baseline level the monthly patterns for precipitation actual evapotranspiration and irrigation are different for the reference and future periods fig 5 in the future climate precipitation is higher in winter and spring and slightly lower in late summer compared to the historical period actual evapotranspiration increases for all months in the future projection with the summer season experiencing the largest increments overall the uncertainty of projected precipitation is larger than that of actual evapotranspiration which is shown by the greater differences between maximum and minimum among the model combinations irrigation supplements precipitation in order to sustain agricultural production the study area is dominated by sandy soils and irrigation is therefore essential for crop development in the growing season the ensemble mean of annual areal irrigation in the historical period is 35 mm and is expected to increase to 55 mm for the future period corresponding to a relative increase of 59 table 6 the irrigation requirement is determined by the climatic conditions and the large spread of monthly irrigation is mainly related to the uncertainty of projecting precipitation and actual evapotranspiration fig 5 4 3 spatiotemporal changes in drought based on indices the spatial distributions of the drought indices smdi and sgdi are presented in fig 6 showing the ensemble mean of the index based on weekly results for the growing season for both the reference and future periods the reference period is the basis of the index statistics and definitions of extreme conditions therefore average conditions fig 6 upper row are expected to approximate 0 for smdi a slight tendency of smaller soil moisture content is observed in non irrigated regions indicated by black dots as reflected by the spatial mean index value of 0 3 this is a result of the formulation of the index and the assumption made on the threshold being based on soil type in non irrigated grids making room for slight deviations from zero the results for the sgdi index show that in the reference period index values of approximately 0 are found all over the catchment which is to be expected given the way the index has been computed the same conditions apply for the streamflow index sdi fig 7 upper were a mean of 0 is found for the reference period for the downstream discharge station q250082 for the future period slightly stronger drought signals are found in almost all non irrigated grids with a decline in average smdi to 0 4 in contrast for the irrigated farmland the dryness index remains unchanged which is attributed to the irrigation that counteracts drying out of the root zone in non irrigated areas the average sgdi increase to 0 3 due to increasing recharge during winter the rise in groundwater table is less in irrigated areas since groundwater abstraction for irrigation counteracts the rise in recharge resulting in a sgdi of only 0 1 for the sdi fig 7 a smaller intensification of the hydrological drought condition is found under rcp8 5 where the temporal ensemble mean drops from 0 to 0 03 to evaluate the extreme conditions by the 99 confidence level a normality test was carried out on the indices it was found that sgdi and sdi indices follow a normal distribution while in some irrigated grids the index series of smdi is not well fitted by a normal distribution not shown to simplify the analysis and to compare the drought signal changes across the indices the approximation that the data are normally distributed for all grids and for all three indices are adopted thereby approximately 99 of the population will lie within plus or minus three standard deviations of the ensemble mean the lower bound can be regarded as an extreme dry condition over the 30 year period the extreme conditions can be seen in fig 6 lower panel the standard deviation of the ensemble mean is estimated for each grid and the spatial pattern of the 99 confidence level is plotted according to the smdi for the extreme condition the irrigated area experience less extreme conditions compared to the non irrigated area both for the historical and future periods a reverse pattern is found for sgdi with increasing dryness in the agricultural regions caused by increasing groundwater abstraction in the future both indices indicate that the extremes become drier larger differences between the two periods are found for sgdi in comparison with smdi implying that the groundwater table further drops in extremely dry periods because of the combined effect of increasing demand for groundwater abstraction and changing dynamics of precipitation and groundwater recharge the joint impacts of irrigation precipitation and groundwater recharge would also fluctuate the streamflow volumes that the sdi series fig 7 shows that 99 confidence interval enlarge from 0 2 94 in the reference period to 0 03 3 96 in the future period implying that the study area would experience severer drought condition in the extremely dry week interesting that especially in the second half of the 30 year period within the irrigation period the sdi series starts higher probably due to higher winter precipitation and or groundwater recharge and has a steeper decline towards dry conditions this pattern seems more pronounced in the future period to further elucidate the development of agricultural and hydrological droughts in the study area the percentages of drought periods at each severity level are listed in table 7 overall the three indices agree that droughts prevail in more than half of the growing and irrigation season in the ahlergaarde catchment during the historical period with mild drought being the most dominant condition according to smdi and sdi the total number of weeks with drought will increase in the future by approximately 2 3 and 1 8 respectively in terms of percentage points corresponding to an increase in the number of dry weeks by about 0 3 and 0 4 weeks during a year respectively on the other hand sgdi shows a reduction in the period with drought by 5 2 percentage point when compared to the 1981 2010 reference level although the frequency of extreme drought is the smallest the relative change between the two periods is the largest for this category for example smdi indicates that the number of extremely dry weeks accounts for 1 2 in the future which is about three times higher than for the reference period moreover all indices produce consistent results on the increase of extreme and severe droughts in contrast mild droughts are projected to decrease in the future implying that the driest conditions become drier the less dry become wetter the increasing dryness in the catchment is also evident by comparing the accumulated distribution of the multi model ensemble between the two periods fig 8 here the three indices all show a shift to the left for the future accumulated distributions in comparison with the historical ones 4 4 uncertainty analysis of drought index as the climate conditions and droughts are projected differently it is important to quantify the uncertainties arising from the climate models to assess the ensemble based predictions of climate change and the corresponding hydro climatological impacts overall three general patterns are identified firstly smdi sgdi and sdi all show a relatively small uncertainty for the ensemble mean in the historical scenario fig 8 which might be attributed to a satisfactory bias correction more variation is seen in the future under rcp8 5 because of the combined effects of scenario uncertainty internal climate variability and inter model differences figs 7 and 9 secondly the variation in sgdi and sdi is considerably larger when compared to the uncertainty in smdi which can be seen in the accumulated distribution curves fig 8 and in the maps showing spatial uncertainty standard deviation and model agreement as shown in fig 9 soil moisture content smdi is jointly determined by the climatic conditions and irrigation within the growing season the depth to the water table sgdi is additionally dependent on recharge which is largely controlled by wintertime precipitation this also governs the amount of baseflow reaching the river sdi this additional factor may boost uncertainties in the simulations also irrigation would mitigate drought in smdi by minimizing the fluctuation of moisture content in the root zone in turn it would intensify the drying effect in sgdi by increasing groundwater abstraction thirdly the two spatial indices smdi sgdi also agree that the uncertainty in the irrigated grids is smaller in comparison to the non irrigated grids 5 discussion the discussion is organized into four sections first projected climatic and hydrological changes are compared to reference period and other studies then a discussion of the obtained drought indices is presented and finally results from analysis of climate model uncertainty is discussed 5 1 climate and hydrology in the catchment present versus future the bias corrected results from the cordex climate model ensemble are characterized by an increase in annual precipitation and evapotranspiration for the investigated area under rcp8 5 although the direction of the monthly changes is not the same for all models they all agree on higher precipitation during winter and higher evapotranspiration during summer fig 5 these patterns of changes in winter precipitation and summer evapotranspiration correspond well with other climate change studies for denmark e g karlsson et al 2016 2015 seaby et al 2013 the projections were then applied to the calibrated hydrological model to evaluate the changes of hydrological and agricultural drought in ahlergaarde catchment the model water balance focusing on the defined growing season shows that the overall increase in simulated actual evapotranspiration and the changes in projected precipitation of the ensemble members could potentially produce an overall drier environmental condition during 2070 2099 the risk of drought is also evident from the increasing pumping and irrigation in the catchment an increase in irrigation indirectly indicates soil moisture shortage in the cultivated land in terms of either frequency intensity or both which is associated with the weekly climate conditions soil characteristics and vegetation demand the drier conditions during the growing season together with the increasing demands for irrigation is expected to impact the groundwater levels negatively and the volume of water entering the river is therefore reduced during this season note that a small tendency of overestimating the low flows during the summertime in the calibration period fig 4e may imply that the drought conditions associated with streamflow would be more severe in both historical and future periods but the hydrological model in general can replicate the dynamics of river flows in historical times furthermore the exceptional diverse dataset in the area has made it possible to verify the model on actual soil and evaporation conditions strengthening the credibility of applying the model results for multifactor drought analysis 5 2 intensified and frequent drought under rcp8 5 as implied by the water balance results the multi model ensemble mean equi feasible approach extreme conditions and the number of occurrences particularly for extremely and severely dry weeks for all indices suggest increasing dryness in the future period with the exception of the ensemble mean of sgdi a wetter than normal condition in the ensemble of sgdi under rcp8 5 indicates that the average weekly groundwater table is expected to rise the reason for this is probably caused by the large increases in rainfall and recharge during winter fig 5 resulting in higher groundwater levels at the beginning of growing season however the monthly distribution of precipitation over the 30 year period may overlook the weekly changes in the extremely dry years and may not explain the weekly changes in indices moreover groundwater levels not only reflect the precipitation impacts but are also affected by the local and regional saturated flow and recharge processes the smdi index shows that the non irrigated area becomes drier than the irrigated area whereas the sgdi index shows the opposite pattern fig 6 on one hand irrigation will keep the soil moisture content at a relatively stable level by minimizing the fluctuations whereas the soil moisture in the non agricultural grids will gradually decline for extended dry conditions on the other hand while irrigation effectively mitigates drought at the surface it is at the cost of lowering the groundwater level as a result the water table will be located at larger depths especially in the agricultural grids under the extremely dry conditions an even larger divergence of drought responses between the two regions is found fig 6 bottom rows this linkage and implication have to the knowledge not been investigated before and it calls for more attention on whether increasing winter precipitation and recharge can balance a drying growing season and the accompanying irrigation needs furthermore it is also seen that the current pumping scheme for irrigation may not be able to cope entirely with the drought during extremely dry weeks as a more negative smdi is detected therefore further investigations of irrigation and pumping regulation should be done to achieve the balance between drought mitigation by irrigation and groundwater resource management moreover the increasing dryness would potentially reduce crop production and it would therefore be desirable to link the drought projection with crop yield change to further investigate the climate impact on agriculture 5 3 model ensemble uncertainty and climate change uncertainty analysis is an important topic in the climate study and impact assessment several examples for hydroclimatic variables can be found e g hawkins and sutton 2011 karlsson et al 2016 li et al 2016 in this study model agreement in conjunction with the standard deviation of the ensemble mean are used to quantify model uncertainty based on the drought index rather than the corresponding hydroclimatic variable s various gcm rcm model combinations generate different results for the same basin and the standard deviation of the ensemble and model agreement vary considerably for different areas and or for different drought indices therefore it is necessary to analyze and interpret these results carefully the hydrological model is calibrated and validated on present climate conditions and gives a consistent accumulated drought distribution with a narrow model spread among the 16 model combinations in the reference period fig 8 this suggest that the climate model bias correction on precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration is sufficient for describing drought conditions compared with the soil moisture content smdi future simulation of changes in groundwater levels sgdi and streamflow sdi is more uncertain given that a larger standard deviation of the ensemble and a lower model agreement figs 7 and 9 the response of the groundwater system to droughts can significantly differ from the meteorological drivers e g precipitation because of the hydrogeological properties of the catchment for water exchange which may diminish or magnify atmospheric drought signals these varying responses to dryness signals are also pronounced in hydrological anomalies e g streamflow volumes sdi a remarkable difference is demonstrated between irrigated and non irrigated areas the indices agree that the projected changes are more consistent among ensemble members in the cultivated area the reason behind this is that the anthropogenically forced impacts i e irrigation are likely to be dominating in comparison with other factors such as internal variability under the given emission scenario 5 4 model assumptions and limitations this study assumes that the relative distribution of crop types within all land use soil combination is preserved in the mike she setup for the future scenarios the study hereby neglects any land use changes on soil moisture content and irrigation that could be implemented in the future and that would alter the existing ecosystem and hydrological balance land use changes could be expected to mitigate the drying of the agricultural fields and the irrigation demand as farmers will adapt to different climate conditions by changing rotation schemes and crops for instance the effect of this would probably be a lessening of soil moisture drought and irrigation demand besides the model is calibrated and validated in the period of 2011 2016 and 2017 2018 respectively due to the limited available historical data which is slightly shorter than the recommended data series length of eight years in order to estimate performance and optimal parameters of hydrological model li et al 2010 however the calibration years represent the normal hydrological characteristics of the catchment and the associated inter annual variability of the climatic conditions thus the time period appears appropriate for this study focusing on the changes in dry conditions relative to the normal conditions smdi is usually used as an indicator of short term drought e g on a weekly basis whereas sgdi and sdi are considered for medium to long term drought e g on a monthly basis in this study the three indexes are calculated on a weekly timescale for easier comparison and evaluation across indices it is difficult to identify the major significant drought events on the weekly basis because of the successive alternations of drying and wetting e g fig 7 and it is normal to combine minor drought events by applying a smoothing window however as the focus of the study is the projected change of drought with respect to the reference level e g intensity and frequency changes in a spatial context rather than the identification of the timing of drought a weekly timescale is deemed appropriate the drought indices are used to illustrate the projected changes of dryness over the catchment toward the end of the 21st century by employing outputs from 16 climate model combinations the uncertainty sources investigated in the study only include uncertainties arising from the climate model as the study is based only on one hydrological model one emission scenario and one downscaling approach climate model uncertainties especially from the gcm have previously been shown to dominate the uncertainties in impact assessments e g minville et al 2008 refsgaard et al 2016 however studies have also shown that other sources of uncertainties may be important e g brigode et al 2013 teutschbein and seibert 2013 vansteenkiste et al 2014 especially when investigating extremes e g karlsson et al 2016 investigating additional sources of uncertainty are however beyond the scope of this study however additional uncertainties would have to be added to future projections potentially resulting in a wider spread in model results fig 8 6 conclusion this study is carried out to investigate the potential changes in drought indices including soil moisture deficit index smdi standardized groundwater depth index sgdi and streamflow drought index sdi across the ahlergaarde catchment during 2070 2099 relative to 1981 2010 using projections from the ensemble of 16 gcm rcm climate model combinations as input to the mike she model modelling results are used to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in droughts conditions and the contributions of climate models to the uncertainties with consideration of model agreement and standard deviation is examined the key findings of this work are multi model ensemble mean of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration increase by 133 mm 13 3 and 91 mm 17 9 from the historical to the future period respectively precipitation increases are mainly found in wintertime while the increases in actual evapotranspiration are predominantly realized in summertime all three drought indices agree that future climate conditions would result in increased risks of drought throughout the study area towards the end of the century in terms of both intensity and frequency according to the smdi sgdi and sdi the number of extremely dry weeks in the future period account for 1 2 4 6 and 5 8 of the weeks respectively which is more than twice that of the reference period meanwhile the occurrence of mild drought events is expected to decline by 2 5 8 0 and 5 2 percentage point respectively in the future irrigation in the cultivated areas effectively mitigates drought at the cost of lowering the groundwater level in both reference and future periods leading to higher smdi values and lower sgdi values in irrigated grids the differences between the irrigated and non irrigated areas are especially pronounced during extreme dry conditions as a result of anthropogenic impacts smdi and sgdi both show more consistent future drought conditions at irrigated locations when comparing to the non cultivated areas lower model agreements larger standard variations of the simulated groundwater level are also found because of the additional irrigation uncertainty altogether the root zone of the study area is expected to be drier during summertime under rcp8 5 implying that the ahlergaarde catchment may face greater threats from extreme drought and related hazards e g crop productivity reduction and water scarcity further work is needed to establish if increasing winter recharge is sufficient to replenish groundwater reservoirs during the projected increasing irrigation demand this work demonstrates the importance of evaluating multiple drought types in order to properly assess the linkages and implications of the different hydrological components the study also demonstrates the necessity for evaluating the uncertainty of climate models in drought impact assessments as it may be substantial these analyses may support decision making processes on drought mitigation and adaptation and at the same time provide important information to account for uncertainties in projections if investigations can further be linked to crop rotations and crop type alterations the results can be used for guiding farmer efforts to cope with a future climate there is furthermore a general need for exploring the uncertainty associated with other sources e g hydrological models and downscaling approaches separating the contribution of different sources of

4350,droughts are responsible for severe vegetation loss and declining agricultural yields as future climate change projections imply an increased risk of extreme events the occurrence of droughts is potentially accelerating in the future the influence of climate change on drought events in a danish agricultural catchment under the emission scenario rcp8 5 are evaluated by three different drought indices covering soil moisture groundwater and streamflow deficits the indices are based on results from a hydrological model forced by downscaled climate outputs from 16 euro cordex climate models gcm rcms while considering uncertainties among climate model projections the hydrological model demonstrated a satisfactory ability in modelling historical drought characteristics the results from the future projections showed that the intensity and frequency of droughts increased towards the end of the century the spatial patterns of changes in drought were found to be highly dependent on the climate model results index formulations and assumptions as well as the hydrogeological properties of the catchment groundwater based irrigation in the agricultural areas effectively mitigates soil moisture drought leading to lower future uncertainty of the ensemble mean higher model agreement for soil moisture droughts at irrigated locations this is obtained at the cost of lower groundwater levels in both reference and future periods resulting in larger uncertainties on the simulated groundwater droughts because of the addition of irrigation uncertainty while the joint impact of greater groundwater abstraction and changing dynamics of precipitation and groundwater recharge also leads to larger streamflow variability between model combinations standard deviation under rcp8 5 for the downstream discharge station keywords drought indices irrigation impact climate change impact hydrological model uncertainty spatiotemporal pattern 1 introduction drought is a natural hazard that can occur everywhere realizing an extended period of water deficiency in various parts or the entire hydrological cycle which can be modulated or amplified by other natural processes e g snowmelt compensation or increased evapotranspiration demand and human activities e g irrigation and pumping the impacts of the processes related to drought propagate through the systems non linearly and unequally mukherjee et al 2018 leading to multiple environmental and socio economic risks that may occur concurrently or sequentially therefore these underlying processes draw the attention of the scientific community from the perspective of meteorology hydrology agriculture and socio economics to quantify and forecast droughts and predict their impacts on the regional environment economy and society tramblay et al 2020 this complexity and uncertainty is further exacerbated in the future due to climate change natural droughts usually develop slowly when compared to other extreme events hence a major challenge of drought research is to accurately identify the onset duration and termination of a single drought and separate one event from others mukherjee et al 2018 mishra and singh 2010 the sophisticated characteristics also hinder the development of a universal definition which is essential for drought detection monitoring and analysis mckee et al 1993 broadly speaking droughts can be categorized into four main types based on their leading physical mechanisms and impacts meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic drought wilhite and glantz 1985 to monitor drought events and quantify their frequency and intensity one of the most straightforward ways is to compute drought indices over the past few decades numerous drought indices have been introduced wmo and gwp 2016 and many drought studies around the world have investigated drought events and drought characteristics applying such indices for historical time periods e g bloomfield and marchant 2013 nalbantis and tsakiris 2008 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 these investigations predominantly evaluate the temporal variability of drought at multiple timescales e g monthly seasonally and annually over a lumped study area or using point measurements like weather station data this approach however does not capture the spatial variability that may occur in response to heterogeneous land use and hydrogeological characteristics within the target area one of the novelties of this work is to evaluate the spatial distributions and temporal variations of drought which is vital information for identification of vulnerable areas and for drought monitoring much drought research has discussed and improved our understanding of the various processes related to droughts while less research has been dedicated to the potential changes in drought under the impact of future global warming studies in north america e g feng et al 2017 masud et al 2017 have suggested that an accelerated hydrologic cycle would trigger more severe droughts under a warming climate scenario the understanding of future changes in drought in temperate regions such as denmark is very limited only few drought related studies have addressed how anticipated climate change would influence groundwater recharge e g refsgaard et al 2016 stream discharge e g roosmalen et al 2007 and soil moisture e g karlsson et al 2015 these studies indicated wetter and hotter climate conditions in the future for denmark where seasonal difference between wet winters and drier summers were accelerated which might lead to an extension of dry spells especially during the growing season summer however more detailed assessments of the potential impact of droughts in a future climate are required to develop reliable mitigation and adaptation strategies additionally most previous studies have only evaluated the drought changes of a single component in the hydrologic system and may therefore overlook important linkages and governing mechanisms of the drying anomalies only a limited number of studies have to our knowledge examined the issue of future droughts from a multifactor perspective another important contribution of this work is to quantify the degree of water shortage by three drought indices aiming to explore the interactions and relationships between different components of the hydrologic cycle in response to drought as different types of drought may occur simultaneously or sequentially it is difficult to formulate a single drought index to present the entire abnormal condition mukherjee et al 2018 added that different indices show different degrees of sensitivity to the same level of warming therefore the assessment should be done from multivariate aspects of drought by considering more than one drought index this study assesses changes of drought by analysing drought indices using the output from an ensemble of 16 cordex regional climate models rcms under rcp8 5 for the ahlergaarde catchment in denmark jensen and refsgaard 2018 the climate model projections have been biased corrected to account for systematic errors pasten zapata et al 2019 different methods have been proposed for bias correction including the delta change and the distribution based scaling dbs methods pulido velazquez et al 2018 van roosmalen et al 2011 here a distribution based scaling dbs method proposed by seaby et al 2013 has been used as their study documented that the method was able to accurately transfer changes in mean monthly and seasonal temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration additionally the method provided a satisfactory representation of the day to day variation as well as heavy precipitation events the integrated and distributed hydrological model code mike she abbott et al 1986 is used in this study since we want to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in soil moisture content depth to the water table and streamflow a distributed representation of the catchment is required in addition an integrated model is required as we want to consider the interaction between the hydrological processes at catchment scale the mike she model code is widely used internationally for comprehensive hydrological studies and it is the framework for the development of the danish water resources model dk model henriksen et al 2003 the model is forced with gridded climate data on daily precipitation temperature and reference evapotranspiration using the same methodology as for the dk model stisen et al 2012 the catchment area was classified into two main categories irrigated and non irrigated areas to evaluate the different responses to dryness with and without irrigation given the importance of agriculture within the study area to the national economy and the impacts on the livelihoods and environment of the region it is essential to understand how climate change affects drought characteristics in a spatially distributed manner for both surface and sub surface variables therefore this study particularly explores the drying effect on factors influencing agricultural activities because prolonged dry spells will significantly reduce crop productivity groundwater conditions are also important as groundwater is the most crucial source of freshwater in denmark supplying 99 of the water use j√∏rgensen and stockmarr 2009 for most studies on drought characteristics index development and other dimensions associated with groundwater are largely ignored to fil this gap we analyze the propagation of drought impacts from the land surface to the groundwater system drought indices can be seen as a simplified representation of the impacts and they therefore provide a more comprehensible measure for the general public e g farmers to understand the potential impacts the study has the following specific objectives 1 to verify the hydrological model outputs of hydrological variables against observational data and assess model results based on the downscaled gcm rcm climate predictions 2 to estimate and compare several drought indices in the reference 1981 2010 and the future period 2070 2099 including soil moisture deficit index smdi standardized groundwater depth index sgdi and streamflow drought index sdi 3 to explore the linkage between the droughts and changing climate and 4 to evaluate the potential impact of uncertainties from climate model choices on the indices the results will help improve the understanding of the current and potential dryness condition in the ahlergaarde catchment and provide useful information for water management and agricultural activities in the future 2 study area and data the study is carried out in the ahlergaarde catchment situated in the central part of the jutland peninsula denmark the catchment covers an area of approximately 1050 km2 and is drained by the skjern river system this region has a relatively flat topography with elevation variations from about 125 m above sea level in the eastern part to 20 m in the western part fig 1 agricultural land use 61 dominates the catchment followed by forest 21 and meadow 15 sebok et al 2016 the dominant crops are wheat and barley and irrigation is the primary contributor to groundwater extraction especially during the growing season may to september the top soils are mainly coarse permeable sandy deposits with a relatively small water retention capability and the area is therefore one of the most irrigated catchments in denmark the high permeability of the surface layers also results in very limited overland flow with exceptions of wetlands and in the riparian zone where surface runoff might be generated as a result of saturation of the soils from shallow groundwater the catchment is characterized by a temperate maritime climate which leads to relatively mild winters and cool summers with an annual average temperature of 8 2 c the annual average precipitation reference evapotranspiration and stream discharge over the period of 1990 2013 are 983 mm 540 mm and 500 mm respectively lucatero et al 2018 precipitation occurs all year round but is typically higher in autumn and winter more than half of the precipitation is returned to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration and the remaining is transferred through the stream and groundwater systems the stream flow system is dominated by the baseflow component jensen and refsgaard 2018 numerous observations were collected in the catchment by the hobe project jensen and refsgaard 2018 including precipitation stream flow evapotranspiration soil moisture and groundwater levels the observational climatic hydrological and hydrogeological data are obtained from these data bases enoha http www enoha eu and jupiter geus http data geus dk jupiterwww index jsp the locations of the measurement stations in the catchment are shown in fig 2 including groundwater levels stream discharge evapotranspiration based on the eddy covariance method and soil moisture based on measurements from cosmic ray neutron sensors and capacitance sensors denager et al 2020 most soil moisture sensors were installed on agricultural land and placed at three different depths 2 5 cm 22 5 cm and 52 5 cm bircher et al 2012 the cosmic ray soil moisture measurements at voulund agriculture site represent the average water content of the soil approximately at depths of 0 20 cm andreasen et al 2020 the flux towers at voulund and gludsted forest site records the actual evapotranspiration ringgaard et al 2011 the depth to the groundwater table is measured in 10 wells within the catchment zhang et al 2016 apart from the observational data the bias corrected daily climate model outputs from cordex including air temperature precipitation and reference evapotranspiration under rcp8 5 ipcc 2014 are used table 1 the gridded data used to drive the model have the following spatial resolution 10 km 10 km for rainfall and 20 km 20 km for air temperature and reference evapotranspiration the individual gcm rcm coupled models are here treated as a single unity referred to as the climate model a detailed description of the bias correction can be found in pasten zapata et al 2019 all changes in the future period 2070 2099 are quantified using the period 1981 2010 as baseline 3 methods 3 1 hydrological model mike she 3 1 1 model setup the model code mike she abbott et al 1986 is used in the study mike she is a deterministic and physically based fully distributed modeling system which has formed the platform for the development of the danish national water resources model dk model henriksen et al 2003 the horizontal discretization of the model is 500 m 500 m resulting in a total of 4205 grids covering the ahlergaarde catchment actual evapotranspiration is simulated using the method developed by kristensen and jensen 1975 vertical unsaturated flow is calculated based on richards equation which is solved numerically by a finite difference scheme with a vertical discretization of 5 cm in the top 30 cm of the soil profile while cell sizes are gradually increased to 1 m cells at depths below 10 m groundwater flow is resolved by 14 computational layers and described by the 3d governing equation based on darcy s law the maximum time step for the unsaturated zone flow and saturated zone flow is both specified to 24 h the soil profile is divided into three soil horizons a 0 0 3 m b 0 3 0 8 m and c 0 8 m where the numbers indicate depth below ground surface the most common soil type is coarse sandy soil jb1 followed by clayey sandy soil jb3 greve et al 2007 land use is described by 11 classes and the catchment is divided into irrigated areas with crops i e wheat barley maize and grass and non irrigated areas all other land use types fig 1d crop rotation is not implemented as it is carried out in reality but is translated into a relative distribution of crop types and preserved within each land use soil combination karlsson et al 2015 irrigation is assumed to start in may and end in september and irrigation demand is computed by the model based on a maximum allowed deficit in maximum available water for crop transpiration maw maw refers to the difference between the field capacity Œ∏ fc and the wilting point Œ∏ wp integrated over the root zone the soil moisture deficit smd is defined as the portion of maw that is missing which ranges from 0 actual moisture content Œ∏ act equals field capacity Œ∏ fc to 1 actual moisture content Œ∏ act equals wilting point Œ∏ wp dhi 2017a 1 smd maw a w maw

hydrological model is run for the period 2008 2018 where 2011 2016 is used for calibration and 2017 2018 is used for validation the first three years are used as model warm up the autocal scheme incorporated in the mike she code dhi 2017a is used for parameter sensitivity analysis and automatic calibration a local sensitivity analysis based on backward difference approximation option is used to identify which parameters to include in the subsequent optimization the model is auto calibrated with the global optimization algorithm population simplex evolution method combined with monte carlo sampling dhi 2017b madsen 2000 in the calibration scheme five different objective functions are defined representing discharge q hydraulic head head soil moisture from sensors sensor soil moisture from cosmic ray measurements ray and evapotranspiration et the match to each observation type is assessed using the root mean square error rmse expressed as follows 3 f Œ∏ rmse x k 1 k 1 n i 1 n obs i sim i 2 1 2 where f Œ∏ rmse x represents the objective function for variable x obs i and sim i are observed and simulated values at time i 1 2 n for measurement location k 1 2 k where n and k are the number of time steps and number of measurement stations wells respectively the objective functions are assigned a weight to reflect the relative priorities given to the individual variables the weighted objective functions are subsequently aggregated and transformed to a common distance scale dhi 2017b the resulting objective functions within the predefined parameter space f Œ∏ is defined as 4 f Œ∏ m i n f Œ∏ rmse q f Œ∏ rmse h e a d f Œ∏ rmse s e n s o r f Œ∏ rmse r a y f Œ∏ rmse e t the stopping criterion of the optimization is defined by either i maximum number of model evaluations ii convergence in objective function space or iii convergence in parameter space dhi 2017b 3 2 drought indices in order to evaluate different types of droughts three drought indices have been chosen based on both frequent successful and well documented use in the literature soil moisture deficit index smdi standardized groundwater depth index sgdi and streamflow drought index sdi the thresholds between normal and drought conditions are calculated differently for the indexes see the following sections and drought ranges also differentiate table 2 following the original index formulation therefore care must be taken when comparing and interpreting the indices in addition to this some specific assumptions are also made in the study the long term thresholds of smdi grid and soil type based are calculated for non irrigated grids only in the period of may to july i e growing season 13 weeks the long term thresholds of sgdi grid based are calculated for all individual grids in the period from may to september i e irrigation period 21 weeks the long term thresholds of sdi station based are calculated for the downstream discharge station in the period from may to september i e irrigation period 21 weeks attention is given to agricultural drought and therefore smdi is calculated for the growing season only while the sgdi and sdi are calculated for an extended time period because groundwater and stream flow react more slowly to water shortage and an extended period is required to better capture the drought signals under the joint natural and anthropogenic factors for smdi thresholds were defined only for the non irrigated grids in order to obtain thresholds close to the natural level i e without influence of irrigation this is not done for the groundwater index as it is expected that the groundwater levels react to abstraction for irrigation beyond the grid cell being pumped 3 2 1 soil moisture deficit index smdi agricultural drought is characterized by insufficient soil moisture availability in the root zone adversely affecting crop growth and agricultural production the smdi was proposed by narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 and the weekly percentage of moisture deficit is computed as 5 sd i j sw i j msw j msw j minsw j 100 i f sw i j msw j 6 sd i j sw i j msw j maxsw j m sw j 100 i f sw i j msw j where sd i j is the soil water deficit for the ith year and the jth week and sw i j is the available soil water available in the soil profile mm for year i and week j the available soil water is computed for a soil profile of 60 cm extent by integrating the values simulated for the individual nodal points according to the numerical discretization the long term minimum median and maximum available soil water of week j between 1981 and 2010 are denoted by minsw j msw j and maxsw j respectively as the soil water retention capability is highly associated with soil characteristics the three long term thresholds weekly for each soil type were estimated from the available soil water content of non agricultural grids in other words the same long term thresholds would be applied to grids belonging to the same soil type regardless of the land use and irrigation by utilizing eqs 5 or 6 the impact of the inherent seasonality in moisture content is assumed to be eliminated narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 the dryness condition is presented by the weekly sd values ranging from 100 very dry to 100 very wet palmer 1965 suggested that the drought index should be computed on an incremental basis and the dryness conditions need to be accumulated to determine drought severity therefore drought severity in any given week is given by 7 smdi i j 1 2 smdi j 1 sd j 50 hereby smdi will range between 4 and 4 in the reference period however the index range may go outside the normal 4 interval under changing climatic conditions because the long term minimum median and maximum water content derived from the reference period are also used to calculate the indices for the future period in order to see the relative changes between the two periods 3 2 2 standardized groundwater depth index sgdi a period of groundwater level decline which would result in significant adverse effects can be considered as a groundwater drought the standardized groundwater depth index sgdi is modified on the basis of standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and aims to evaluate the variations and characteristics of the groundwater level bhuiyan et al 2006 bloomfield and marchant 2013 the distance to the water table forms the basis of the index as other groundwater variables e g recharge and groundwater discharge cannot be measured directly in groundwater wells but rely on model results tate and gustard 2000 van lanen and peters 2000 the distance to the water table varies over the year in response to recharge fetter 2001 and the index on the weekly basis is calculated as follows for each grid 8 sgdi d i j d j std d j where d i j is the distance to the water table for the ith year and the jth week d j and std d j are the long term mean depth to the groundwater table and its standard deviation of week j in the control period 1981 2010 respectively for the majority of the randomly selected grids the kolmogorov smirnov ks normality test not shown indicated that the groundwater level time series from may to september were normally distributed at the p 0 01 level as a result the series values can be standardized without any transformation yeh et al 2016 bloomfield and marchant 2013 mendicino et al 2008 the classification of drought based on sgdi follows that of spi ranging from 2 dry to 2 wet the same long term thresholds are utilized to compute the indices for both reference and future period implying that the index range may go outside the normal range in the future because it preserves the historical statistics as a basis for comparing future results with a known reference 3 2 3 streamflow drought index sdi the streamflow drought index sdi is also developed based on spi as stream flow q i j is likely to be skewed and followed a gamma distribution a two parameter log normal distribution is used to transform the distribution into normal by taking natural logarithms of streamflow y i j nalbantis and tsakiris 2008 9 sdi y i j y j std y j 10 y i j ln q i j sdi is only calculated for the main station q250082 located at the outlet of the catchment where historical and future values of streamflow are assessed the natural logarithms of cumulative flow volume with average y j and standard deviation std y j estimated over the historical period are further applied to the future period and as for index sgd it may result in indices exceeding the normal range between 2 and 2 which might be attributed to extremely high or low flow under future climate 3 3 uncertainty analysis and multi model ensemble in order to assess the uncertainty arising from the different climate model combinations the multi model ensemble mean of three drought indices is presented along with the corresponding model spread and model agreement note that an equi feasible ensemble approach i e considering the simulations of all model combinations is applied in this study collados lara et al 2018 while the model spread describes the variability between the multi model ensemble members the model agreement shows where the different models agree disagree on the projected changes li et al 2016 tebaldi et al 2011 the model agreement is indicated by the number of models where indices project the same drought category as the ensemble mean note that for grids with a relatively low model agreement i e 6 results are not further differentiated 4 results in the following chapter results from the model analysis are presented first parameter sensitivity and model calibration are described followed by a quantification of climate change impacts on the hydrological variables next the impacts on drought indices are presented and finally the uncertainty caused by climate models is described 4 1 hydrological simulations parameter sensitivity and optimization a sensitivity analysis was carried out in which 47 parameters from different modules of the mike she model were evaluated fig 3 the initial value of these parameters was taken from the national water resources model the dk model henriksen et al 2003 which serves as a departure point for the analysis nine parameters table 3 were selected for calibration in order to avoid over parameterization while at the same time ensuring that the selected parameter combination contained at least one parameter which was highly sensitive to each of the five objective functions less sensitive parameters were tied to the most sensitive land use is dominated by agriculture and since irrigation depends on groundwater abstraction groundwater levels and streamflow in the catchment are both affected data on stream discharge and groundwater level are considered to be overall more reliable than the other types of measurements which are more complicated to carry out and prone to uncertainties partly caused by spatial scale discrepancies hence an accurate simulation of hydraulic head and discharge are prioritized compared to other variables included in the objective functions during the calibration process table 4 overall the model performance with respect to the hydrological dynamics for both the calibration and validation periods are considered satisfactory table 5 firstly the discharge performance in the downstream main station q250082 is acceptable nse 0 7 implying a high degree of accordance between observations and simulations fig 4 e nevertheless the model has a tendency to underestimate peak flows and overestimate low flows the performance for the four upstream stations not shown is not as good as the main station this might be explained by the lower streamflow values implying that uncertainties related to the topographical and geological characterization become more critical due to the smaller catchment sizes the performance with respect to groundwater levels is acceptable with a me of 20 cm in the calibration period and 16 cm in the validation period table 5 rmse values of less than 3 m are found for both calibration and validation 2 27 m and 2 43 m respectively which is considered to be an acceptable result sonnenborg et al 2003 for et a me of 0 07 mm day is found in the calibration period which is acceptable compared to the mean et of 1 57 mm day the results for the validation period are less convincing 0 3 mm day but is still within an acceptable range the variability of the deviations is relatively high with rmse values of 1 04 mm day and 1 15 mm day respectively for the two periods also for soil moisture the simulation results are within expected accuracy levels denager et al 2020 4 2 climate projection present versus future the simulated water balance components for the 16 gcm rcm combinations based on the optimized mike she model are shown in table 6 for the reference period 1981 2010 and changes in the future period 2070 2099 the annual precipitation and actual evapotranspiration in the historical period both resemble the observations ensemble mean of 1002 mm and 507 mm respectively implying that sufficient bias correction was done all models agree on an increase in precipitation and actual evapotranspiration in the future period resulting in average rises of 133 mm 13 3 and 91 mm 17 9 respectively the groundwater flow combination of drain flow and baseflow is the dominating inflow component to the streams however an increase of only 29 mm is found corresponding to about 6 increase the ensemble mean indicates a potential increase of stream discharge with respect to the baseline level the monthly patterns for precipitation actual evapotranspiration and irrigation are different for the reference and future periods fig 5 in the future climate precipitation is higher in winter and spring and slightly lower in late summer compared to the historical period actual evapotranspiration increases for all months in the future projection with the summer season experiencing the largest increments overall the uncertainty of projected precipitation is larger than that of actual evapotranspiration which is shown by the greater differences between maximum and minimum among the model combinations irrigation supplements precipitation in order to sustain agricultural production the study area is dominated by sandy soils and irrigation is therefore essential for crop development in the growing season the ensemble mean of annual areal irrigation in the historical period is 35 mm and is expected to increase to 55 mm for the future period corresponding to a relative increase of 59 table 6 the irrigation requirement is determined by the climatic conditions and the large spread of monthly irrigation is mainly related to the uncertainty of projecting precipitation and actual evapotranspiration fig 5 4 3 spatiotemporal changes in drought based on indices the spatial distributions of the drought indices smdi and sgdi are presented in fig 6 showing the ensemble mean of the index based on weekly results for the growing season for both the reference and future periods the reference period is the basis of the index statistics and definitions of extreme conditions therefore average conditions fig 6 upper row are expected to approximate 0 for smdi a slight tendency of smaller soil moisture content is observed in non irrigated regions indicated by black dots as reflected by the spatial mean index value of 0 3 this is a result of the formulation of the index and the assumption made on the threshold being based on soil type in non irrigated grids making room for slight deviations from zero the results for the sgdi index show that in the reference period index values of approximately 0 are found all over the catchment which is to be expected given the way the index has been computed the same conditions apply for the streamflow index sdi fig 7 upper were a mean of 0 is found for the reference period for the downstream discharge station q250082 for the future period slightly stronger drought signals are found in almost all non irrigated grids with a decline in average smdi to 0 4 in contrast for the irrigated farmland the dryness index remains unchanged which is attributed to the irrigation that counteracts drying out of the root zone in non irrigated areas the average sgdi increase to 0 3 due to increasing recharge during winter the rise in groundwater table is less in irrigated areas since groundwater abstraction for irrigation counteracts the rise in recharge resulting in a sgdi of only 0 1 for the sdi fig 7 a smaller intensification of the hydrological drought condition is found under rcp8 5 where the temporal ensemble mean drops from 0 to 0 03 to evaluate the extreme conditions by the 99 confidence level a normality test was carried out on the indices it was found that sgdi and sdi indices follow a normal distribution while in some irrigated grids the index series of smdi is not well fitted by a normal distribution not shown to simplify the analysis and to compare the drought signal changes across the indices the approximation that the data are normally distributed for all grids and for all three indices are adopted thereby approximately 99 of the population will lie within plus or minus three standard deviations of the ensemble mean the lower bound can be regarded as an extreme dry condition over the 30 year period the extreme conditions can be seen in fig 6 lower panel the standard deviation of the ensemble mean is estimated for each grid and the spatial pattern of the 99 confidence level is plotted according to the smdi for the extreme condition the irrigated area experience less extreme conditions compared to the non irrigated area both for the historical and future periods a reverse pattern is found for sgdi with increasing dryness in the agricultural regions caused by increasing groundwater abstraction in the future both indices indicate that the extremes become drier larger differences between the two periods are found for sgdi in comparison with smdi implying that the groundwater table further drops in extremely dry periods because of the combined effect of increasing demand for groundwater abstraction and changing dynamics of precipitation and groundwater recharge the joint impacts of irrigation precipitation and groundwater recharge would also fluctuate the streamflow volumes that the sdi series fig 7 shows that 99 confidence interval enlarge from 0 2 94 in the reference period to 0 03 3 96 in the future period implying that the study area would experience severer drought condition in the extremely dry week interesting that especially in the second half of the 30 year period within the irrigation period the sdi series starts higher probably due to higher winter precipitation and or groundwater recharge and has a steeper decline towards dry conditions this pattern seems more pronounced in the future period to further elucidate the development of agricultural and hydrological droughts in the study area the percentages of drought periods at each severity level are listed in table 7 overall the three indices agree that droughts prevail in more than half of the growing and irrigation season in the ahlergaarde catchment during the historical period with mild drought being the most dominant condition according to smdi and sdi the total number of weeks with drought will increase in the future by approximately 2 3 and 1 8 respectively in terms of percentage points corresponding to an increase in the number of dry weeks by about 0 3 and 0 4 weeks during a year respectively on the other hand sgdi shows a reduction in the period with drought by 5 2 percentage point when compared to the 1981 2010 reference level although the frequency of extreme drought is the smallest the relative change between the two periods is the largest for this category for example smdi indicates that the number of extremely dry weeks accounts for 1 2 in the future which is about three times higher than for the reference period moreover all indices produce consistent results on the increase of extreme and severe droughts in contrast mild droughts are projected to decrease in the future implying that the driest conditions become drier the less dry become wetter the increasing dryness in the catchment is also evident by comparing the accumulated distribution of the multi model ensemble between the two periods fig 8 here the three indices all show a shift to the left for the future accumulated distributions in comparison with the historical ones 4 4 uncertainty analysis of drought index as the climate conditions and droughts are projected differently it is important to quantify the uncertainties arising from the climate models to assess the ensemble based predictions of climate change and the corresponding hydro climatological impacts overall three general patterns are identified firstly smdi sgdi and sdi all show a relatively small uncertainty for the ensemble mean in the historical scenario fig 8 which might be attributed to a satisfactory bias correction more variation is seen in the future under rcp8 5 because of the combined effects of scenario uncertainty internal climate variability and inter model differences figs 7 and 9 secondly the variation in sgdi and sdi is considerably larger when compared to the uncertainty in smdi which can be seen in the accumulated distribution curves fig 8 and in the maps showing spatial uncertainty standard deviation and model agreement as shown in fig 9 soil moisture content smdi is jointly determined by the climatic conditions and irrigation within the growing season the depth to the water table sgdi is additionally dependent on recharge which is largely controlled by wintertime precipitation this also governs the amount of baseflow reaching the river sdi this additional factor may boost uncertainties in the simulations also irrigation would mitigate drought in smdi by minimizing the fluctuation of moisture content in the root zone in turn it would intensify the drying effect in sgdi by increasing groundwater abstraction thirdly the two spatial indices smdi sgdi also agree that the uncertainty in the irrigated grids is smaller in comparison to the non irrigated grids 5 discussion the discussion is organized into four sections first projected climatic and hydrological changes are compared to reference period and other studies then a discussion of the obtained drought indices is presented and finally results from analysis of climate model uncertainty is discussed 5 1 climate and hydrology in the catchment present versus future the bias corrected results from the cordex climate model ensemble are characterized by an increase in annual precipitation and evapotranspiration for the investigated area under rcp8 5 although the direction of the monthly changes is not the same for all models they all agree on higher precipitation during winter and higher evapotranspiration during summer fig 5 these patterns of changes in winter precipitation and summer evapotranspiration correspond well with other climate change studies for denmark e g karlsson et al 2016 2015 seaby et al 2013 the projections were then applied to the calibrated hydrological model to evaluate the changes of hydrological and agricultural drought in ahlergaarde catchment the model water balance focusing on the defined growing season shows that the overall increase in simulated actual evapotranspiration and the changes in projected precipitation of the ensemble members could potentially produce an overall drier environmental condition during 2070 2099 the risk of drought is also evident from the increasing pumping and irrigation in the catchment an increase in irrigation indirectly indicates soil moisture shortage in the cultivated land in terms of either frequency intensity or both which is associated with the weekly climate conditions soil characteristics and vegetation demand the drier conditions during the growing season together with the increasing demands for irrigation is expected to impact the groundwater levels negatively and the volume of water entering the river is therefore reduced during this season note that a small tendency of overestimating the low flows during the summertime in the calibration period fig 4e may imply that the drought conditions associated with streamflow would be more severe in both historical and future periods but the hydrological model in general can replicate the dynamics of river flows in historical times furthermore the exceptional diverse dataset in the area has made it possible to verify the model on actual soil and evaporation conditions strengthening the credibility of applying the model results for multifactor drought analysis 5 2 intensified and frequent drought under rcp8 5 as implied by the water balance results the multi model ensemble mean equi feasible approach extreme conditions and the number of occurrences particularly for extremely and severely dry weeks for all indices suggest increasing dryness in the future period with the exception of the ensemble mean of sgdi a wetter than normal condition in the ensemble of sgdi under rcp8 5 indicates that the average weekly groundwater table is expected to rise the reason for this is probably caused by the large increases in rainfall and recharge during winter fig 5 resulting in higher groundwater levels at the beginning of growing season however the monthly distribution of precipitation over the 30 year period may overlook the weekly changes in the extremely dry years and may not explain the weekly changes in indices moreover groundwater levels not only reflect the precipitation impacts but are also affected by the local and regional saturated flow and recharge processes the smdi index shows that the non irrigated area becomes drier than the irrigated area whereas the sgdi index shows the opposite pattern fig 6 on one hand irrigation will keep the soil moisture content at a relatively stable level by minimizing the fluctuations whereas the soil moisture in the non agricultural grids will gradually decline for extended dry conditions on the other hand while irrigation effectively mitigates drought at the surface it is at the cost of lowering the groundwater level as a result the water table will be located at larger depths especially in the agricultural grids under the extremely dry conditions an even larger divergence of drought responses between the two regions is found fig 6 bottom rows this linkage and implication have to the knowledge not been investigated before and it calls for more attention on whether increasing winter precipitation and recharge can balance a drying growing season and the accompanying irrigation needs furthermore it is also seen that the current pumping scheme for irrigation may not be able to cope entirely with the drought during extremely dry weeks as a more negative smdi is detected therefore further investigations of irrigation and pumping regulation should be done to achieve the balance between drought mitigation by irrigation and groundwater resource management moreover the increasing dryness would potentially reduce crop production and it would therefore be desirable to link the drought projection with crop yield change to further investigate the climate impact on agriculture 5 3 model ensemble uncertainty and climate change uncertainty analysis is an important topic in the climate study and impact assessment several examples for hydroclimatic variables can be found e g hawkins and sutton 2011 karlsson et al 2016 li et al 2016 in this study model agreement in conjunction with the standard deviation of the ensemble mean are used to quantify model uncertainty based on the drought index rather than the corresponding hydroclimatic variable s various gcm rcm model combinations generate different results for the same basin and the standard deviation of the ensemble and model agreement vary considerably for different areas and or for different drought indices therefore it is necessary to analyze and interpret these results carefully the hydrological model is calibrated and validated on present climate conditions and gives a consistent accumulated drought distribution with a narrow model spread among the 16 model combinations in the reference period fig 8 this suggest that the climate model bias correction on precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration is sufficient for describing drought conditions compared with the soil moisture content smdi future simulation of changes in groundwater levels sgdi and streamflow sdi is more uncertain given that a larger standard deviation of the ensemble and a lower model agreement figs 7 and 9 the response of the groundwater system to droughts can significantly differ from the meteorological drivers e g precipitation because of the hydrogeological properties of the catchment for water exchange which may diminish or magnify atmospheric drought signals these varying responses to dryness signals are also pronounced in hydrological anomalies e g streamflow volumes sdi a remarkable difference is demonstrated between irrigated and non irrigated areas the indices agree that the projected changes are more consistent among ensemble members in the cultivated area the reason behind this is that the anthropogenically forced impacts i e irrigation are likely to be dominating in comparison with other factors such as internal variability under the given emission scenario 5 4 model assumptions and limitations this study assumes that the relative distribution of crop types within all land use soil combination is preserved in the mike she setup for the future scenarios the study hereby neglects any land use changes on soil moisture content and irrigation that could be implemented in the future and that would alter the existing ecosystem and hydrological balance land use changes could be expected to mitigate the drying of the agricultural fields and the irrigation demand as farmers will adapt to different climate conditions by changing rotation schemes and crops for instance the effect of this would probably be a lessening of soil moisture drought and irrigation demand besides the model is calibrated and validated in the period of 2011 2016 and 2017 2018 respectively due to the limited available historical data which is slightly shorter than the recommended data series length of eight years in order to estimate performance and optimal parameters of hydrological model li et al 2010 however the calibration years represent the normal hydrological characteristics of the catchment and the associated inter annual variability of the climatic conditions thus the time period appears appropriate for this study focusing on the changes in dry conditions relative to the normal conditions smdi is usually used as an indicator of short term drought e g on a weekly basis whereas sgdi and sdi are considered for medium to long term drought e g on a monthly basis in this study the three indexes are calculated on a weekly timescale for easier comparison and evaluation across indices it is difficult to identify the major significant drought events on the weekly basis because of the successive alternations of drying and wetting e g fig 7 and it is normal to combine minor drought events by applying a smoothing window however as the focus of the study is the projected change of drought with respect to the reference level e g intensity and frequency changes in a spatial context rather than the identification of the timing of drought a weekly timescale is deemed appropriate the drought indices are used to illustrate the projected changes of dryness over the catchment toward the end of the 21st century by employing outputs from 16 climate model combinations the uncertainty sources investigated in the study only include uncertainties arising from the climate model as the study is based only on one hydrological model one emission scenario and one downscaling approach climate model uncertainties especially from the gcm have previously been shown to dominate the uncertainties in impact assessments e g minville et al 2008 refsgaard et al 2016 however studies have also shown that other sources of uncertainties may be important e g brigode et al 2013 teutschbein and seibert 2013 vansteenkiste et al 2014 especially when investigating extremes e g karlsson et al 2016 investigating additional sources of uncertainty are however beyond the scope of this study however additional uncertainties would have to be added to future projections potentially resulting in a wider spread in model results fig 8 6 conclusion this study is carried out to investigate the potential changes in drought indices including soil moisture deficit index smdi standardized groundwater depth index sgdi and streamflow drought index sdi across the ahlergaarde catchment during 2070 2099 relative to 1981 2010 using projections from the ensemble of 16 gcm rcm climate model combinations as input to the mike she model modelling results are used to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in droughts conditions and the contributions of climate models to the uncertainties with consideration of model agreement and standard deviation is examined the key findings of this work are multi model ensemble mean of precipitation and actual evapotranspiration increase by 133 mm 13 3 and 91 mm 17 9 from the historical to the future period respectively precipitation increases are mainly found in wintertime while the increases in actual evapotranspiration are predominantly realized in summertime all three drought indices agree that future climate conditions would result in increased risks of drought throughout the study area towards the end of the century in terms of both intensity and frequency according to the smdi sgdi and sdi the number of extremely dry weeks in the future period account for 1 2 4 6 and 5 8 of the weeks respectively which is more than twice that of the reference period meanwhile the occurrence of mild drought events is expected to decline by 2 5 8 0 and 5 2 percentage point respectively in the future irrigation in the cultivated areas effectively mitigates drought at the cost of lowering the groundwater level in both reference and future periods leading to higher smdi values and lower sgdi values in irrigated grids the differences between the irrigated and non irrigated areas are especially pronounced during extreme dry conditions as a result of anthropogenic impacts smdi and sgdi both show more consistent future drought conditions at irrigated locations when comparing to the non cultivated areas lower model agreements larger standard variations of the simulated groundwater level are also found because of the additional irrigation uncertainty altogether the root zone of the study area is expected to be drier during summertime under rcp8 5 implying that the ahlergaarde catchment may face greater threats from extreme drought and related hazards e g crop productivity reduction and water scarcity further work is needed to establish if increasing winter recharge is sufficient to replenish groundwater reservoirs during the projected increasing irrigation demand this work demonstrates the importance of evaluating multiple drought types in order to properly assess the linkages and implications of the different hydrological components the study also demonstrates the necessity for evaluating the uncertainty of climate models in drought impact assessments as it may be substantial these analyses may support decision making processes on drought mitigation and adaptation and at the same time provide important information to account for uncertainties in projections if investigations can further be linked to crop rotations and crop type alterations the results can be used for guiding farmer efforts to cope with a future climate there is furthermore a general need for exploring the uncertainty associated with other sources e g hydrological models and downscaling approaches separating the contribution of different sources of uncertainty will be helpful to enhance the understanding of uncertainty linked to future climate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

4351,hydropower dam construction can alter the continuity of the river flow thereby influencing geochemical cycle of seldom monitored trace elements due to the change of hydrological regime by reservoir regulation here we investigated the response of hydrological regime on migration of boron b in the sediments of three gorges reservoir tgr using multiple geochemical approaches although b concentrations in tgr sediments increased slightly during five consecutive water seasons the potential ecological risk exhibited relatively low the spatial distribution patterns of b with high heterogeneity in tgr sediments were influenced by periodic water level fluctuation this high spatial heterogeneity significantly correlated with the distribution of fine grain sediments which was attributed to the change of hydrological regime including the decrease of water flow velocity sediment accumulation and extended residence time of suspended fine grain sediments in order to remove the sediment size effect the geochemical normalization approach was applied and revealed that the slope of normalization curve remarkably decreased from 0 9402 to 0 3682 this indicated that a small amount of b was still accumulated in the mid and downstream of tgr after removing the hydrological regime effect further source identification using geochemical baseline model and principal component analysis exposed that this slight accumulation of b in sediments originated from the anthropogenic input 8 45 our findings provide a geochemical insight on the environmental impacts of reservoir

yangtze river china 28 32 31 44 n and 105 44 111 39 e the storage capacity of the tgr is 39 3 billion m3 and its surface area reaches 1080 km2 bing et al 2016 the climate of the tgr region is affected by the southeast subtropical monsoon twenty five sampling sites distributed throughout the mainstream of the tgr region from yichang to chongqing were selected and 125 surface sediment samples were collected at these sites from 2015 to 2017 fig 1 a stainless steel grab sampler was used to collect samples from the upstream m1 m11 midstream m12 m22 and downstream m23 m25 areas every year in june wet season and december dry season the sediment samples from each site were stored in clean sampling bags and transported to the laboratory then freeze dried one part of the dried sediment samples was

materials was 99 15 117 03 and the data are listed in table s1 2 3 regional geochemical baseline establishment the regional geochemical baseline rgb concentration of b was calculated by normalization method xu et al 2018 the inert reference elements selected in this study were fe al and li first a linear regression equation between b and the three normalized elements fe al and li was established the data with the highest correlation coefficients r including b vs al b vs fe and b vs li were then used for further analysis the r values were listed in table s2 and presented in fig s1 teng and ni 2007 stated that the natural sources were the data points located inside of the 95 confidence limit while those outside the 95 confidence limit are anthropogenic sources the data outside 95 confidence limit anthropogenic sources were removed and the data inside the 95 confidence limit natural sources were applied to re establish a new linear regression as follows 1 b m a c n b where bm indicates the rgb of b mg kg c n indicates the average concentrations of the normalized elements with the highest r values mg kg and a and b indicate the regression constants the rgb in this study was taken as the b background value in the tgr sediments 2 4 statistical analysis the spss ibm spss statistics 22 0 for windows was used to statistical analysis in this study analysis of variance anova was

spatiotemporal variations of b in sediments during periodic water level fluctuation the average b concentration and distribution in tgr sediments is listed in table 1 the average value of b was 55 10 mg kg with the range of 32 47 83 12 mg kg from 2015 to 2017 table 1 the maximum b concentration was 2 6 times higher than the minimum concentration in tgr sediments comparing with the previous data in the year of 2010 in tgr sediments in china 59 15 mg kg gao et al 2014 the average concentration of b in recent tgr sediments exhibited slight reduction in addition the mean content of b in tgr sediments 55 10 mg kg was higher than those in the sediments of the miyun reservoir in china 31 26 mg kg and medjuvr≈°je reservoir in serbia 10 72 mg kg djikanovic et al 2018 han et al 2016 and lower than the mean value in the sediment of the yangtze river 63 00 mg kg and qinghai lake 58 88 mg kg in china chi and wu 2007 zhang et al 2018b the spatial distribution of b is presented in fig 2 d the color shifted from cool to warm from the upstream to downstream in tgr regions indicating that the b concentrations of the sediments increased gradually from upstream to downstream the high concentration of b in sediment was mainly concentrated in the midstream and downstream of tgr fig 3 the coefficient of variation of b in each sampling sites ranged from 12 88 to 20 26 meaning that there was a high spatial heterogeneity of b in tgr sediments p 0 05 the temporal changes of the b concentration in tgr sediments during the periodic water level fluctuation from 2015 to 2017 are shown in fig 3 and table 1 the concentrations of b in sediments fluctuated with slightly increase under the change of the periodic water seasons and the b concentrations in the downstream of tgr sediments tended to be stable fig 3 the result was similar to the variation of heavy metals e g as cd pb cu zn tl and sb etc in tgr sediments during the consecutive water period in previous study gao et al 2019 xu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 moreover the average concentration of b in tgr sediments in the wet season 54 26 mg kg was slightly lower than that in the dry season 56 36 mg kg p 0 908 which was resemble to the variations of thallium and antimony in tgr sediments xu et al 2019 nevertheless there was no significant influence on the concentrations of b in sediments with different water periods therefore the high spatial heterogeneity of b in tgr sediments may be attributed to two reasons 1 changes of hydrological regime in tgr the decrease of water flow velocity after tgd construction cnemc 1998 2016 resulted in the increase of residence time for suspended particles in tgr tang et al 2018 the change of the hydrological regime caused the coarse and fine grain particles of sediments redistribution in tgr tang et al 2018 2 anthropogenic influence although the release of b into the environment was driven by natural processes inputs from anthropogenic sources such as leachates from the bottom and fly ashes of coal fired power plants runoff from agricultural land treated with b containing fertilizers and wastewater treatment were also discharged into the river iwashita et al 2005 3 2 influence factors of hydrological regime on b distribution in sediments the change of hydrological regime can influence the distribution patterns of sediment with different particle sizes bing et al 2016 liu et al 2007 gao and wang 2008 after tgd construction the water flow velocity significantly decreased from 3 to 5 to 0 09 2 43 m s cnemc 1998 2016 forming a pattern of alternation of lake facies in front of tgd and river facies at the end of the reservoir s√° oliveira et al 2015 the change of water flow velocity of tgr prolonged the suspension time of fine particles in sediments causing redistribution of the sediment particles in tgr bing et al 2016 tang et al 2018 in this study the average percentages of clay silt and sand accounted for 38 81 54 43 and 6 76 of the sediments respectively showing that the tgr sediments were mainly composed of silt and clay with a small amount of sand this indicated that the fine grain particles of sediments silt and clay were the major particle fraction in tgr as shown in fig 2 a b and c the clay content rose towards the dam while the sand content declined silt was mainly distributed in the midstream region of the tgr this phenomenon indicated that the coarse grain sediments tended to accumulate in upstream of tgr while the fine grain sediments tended to deposit in the midstream and downstream of tgr based on the annual data of sediments in tgr after full impoundment of tgr in 2010 cwrc 2006 2017 the median particle size of sediments in yichang monitoring station mean 0 008 mm were lower than its upstream monitoring station cuntan mean 0 011 mm fig s6 indicating that the coarse grain particles in sediments could mostly distribute in the upstream of tgr and the fine grain particles in sediments concentrate settlement to the middle and lower reaches of tgr previous study indicated that the clay minerals in sediments could readily adsorb b gaillardet and lemarchand 2018 implying that the migration and deposition of clay fraction in sediments would affect the migration and deposition of b in sediments we further found that there was a positive correlation between fine grain particles in sediments clay and silt and b contents r 0 7535 p 0 001 fig s3 demonstrating that the accumulation of b in midstream and downstream of tgr was attributed to the accumulation of fine grain sediments in the same region therefore during five consecutive water periods the spatial distribution of b in tgr sediments was influenced by redistribution of sediments especially for fine grain sediments redistribution furthermore in order to remove the effect of hydrological regime variation on the distribution of b in tgr sediments the geochemical normalization was conducted to explore the b redistribution in tgr sediments sun et al 2018 xu et al 2019 specifically there were significantly positive relationships between the concentrations of fe al li and clay p 0 01 fig s4 illustrating that the concentrations of normalized elements were mainly affected by the variations in grain sizes due to natural weathering processes there was a positive correlation between the concentration of b and both al and clay fraction fig s4 and table s2 thus al was selected to normalize the influence of fine grain sediments on the b distribution in the sediments of tgr as shown in fig 4 the concentrations of b in the sediments of the midstream and downstream regions of tgr significantly decreased after the values were normalized by al leading to obviously decreased the slope of linear equation from 0 9402 to 0 3682 accounting for 60 8 decrease of the slope fig 4 the result manifested that the fine grain particles in tgr should play an important role in distribution of b in sediments notably after removing the influence of fine grain particles in sediments there was still a slightly accumulation of b in the midstream and downstream of the tgr fig 4 this accumulation of b might be attributed to the input by anthropogenic activities e g input of b containing detergents cleaning products and antifreeze etc 3 3 source identification of b in tgr sediments the geochemical rgb methodology can be used to distinguish the natural and anthropogenic sources in sediments xu et al 2018 meanwhile the rgb values can be taken as the background values bvs of elements in most study areas tian et al 2017 xu et al 2019 this method was used to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural sources of elements at different sampling sites in previous studies using normalized elements e g fe al li xu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 according to the geochemical baseline calculation principle of rgb model the results of the linear regression between b and the three normalized elements li fe al were listed in table s2 the correlation coefficients r of the linear regression for rgb models li fe and al were 0 9749 0 9722 and 0 9851 respectively fig s1 and table s2 based on the principle of selecting high correlation coefficient of normalized elements in previous studies lin et al 2012 xu et al 2019 al was selected to calculate the rgb b value of tgr sediments fig s1 the rgb value of b rgb b in tgr sediments was 56 92 mg kg which was a bit higher than the average b concentration 55 10 mg kg in the tgr sediments chi and wu 2007 the rgb b value was lower than that of sediment in the yangtze river 63 mg kg chi and wu 2007 owing to the absence of bvs in reservoirs soils and river basins the rgb values of trace metals in these regions have been taken as the bvs in pollution risk assessments xu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 tian et al 2017 therefore rgb b was used as the bv of b in the tgr region to further calculate its potential ecological risk the rgb model pearson s correlation coefficient analysis and pca were used to further identify the relationships and potential sources of b in the tgr sediments xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b the rgb b model can be used to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural sources xu et al 2018 and its results are presented in fig s2 the average anthropogenic contributions of b in the five consecutive sampling periods ranged from 5 79 to 12 55 mean value of 8 45 indicating that most of the b in the tgr sediments emanated from natural sources 91 55 additionally the pearson s correlation coefficient values of b in tgr sediments are presented in fig 5 the b concentration was significantly and positively correlated with the contents of li al fe and k p 0 01 illustrating that b mainly attributed from natural sources fig 5 the sources of the measured elements were further determined by conducting pca which can also be used to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic sources han et al 2016 the validity of the pca approach was demonstrated by the kmo value 0 5 and the significance of the result of bartlett s test p 0 001 the eigenvalues in two principal components pcs were higher than 1 were extracted as shown in table s3 there was 82 555 of the data variability with the pcs using pca individually the pc1 the first pc contained high loadings of b li fe al and k 0 5 indicating that b was associated with the normalized elements li fe k and al this was consistent with the pearson s correlation coefficient analysis results and also demonstrated that b mainly originated from natural sources in fact the major natural sources came from the sediments from upstream to downstream of tgr due to the high correlations between the normalized elements and fine grain particles in sediments table s4 the result also indicated that the deposition and accumulation of b in sediments mainly from natural process such as sediments erosion in the channel of tgr xu and milliman 2009 the natural and anthropogenic sources accumulation of b in sediments were calculated using the contribution rates obtained by rgb model 91 55 for anthropogenic source and 8 45 for natural source the accumulation quantity for different source sediments equaled to the contribution rates multiplied by the sediments inflow in 2015 and 2016 according to changjiang sediment bulletin cwrc 2006 2017 fig s5b the sediments were 0 278 mt million tons in 2015 and 0 334 mt million tons in 2016 respectively the sediments accumulation from natural sources from 2015 and 2016 were 0 253 mt and 0 309 mt respectively while 0 025 mt and 0 025 mt for anthropogenic sources distinguishing by rgb model fig s2 the result indicated that the anthropogenic source of b in tgr sediments changed steadily and the natural source changed with the variation of sediment accumulation in tgr 3 4 potential ecological risk of b in tgr sediments the potential ecological risk is calculated by the single factor pollution parameter cr and potential ecological index er as follows h√§kanson 1980 2 c r c x c 0 3 e r t r c r where cx and c0 are the concentration and rgb of b in the tgr sediments the classifications of cr and er are listed in table s5 tr is the toxicity coefficient of b the value is 2 referenced previous study xu et al 2020 the results are shown in fig 6 for the single pollution parameter cr the mean of cr was 0 97 indicating low pollution level in tgr sediments it should be noted that in the heat maps for cr the warm colors are mostly distributed in the midstream and downstream regions of tgr the cr values were mostly higher than 1 0 this result implied that the midstream and downstream may exist moderate pollution for b in addition considering the toxicity and bioavailability of b in sediments the potential ecological risk of b was assessed in tgr sediments using the calculated tr value fig 6 the average value of er was 1 94 suggesting that the low ecological risk of b in tgr sediments 4 conclusion in this study multiple geochemical approaches including the rgb model pca geochemical normalization and potential ecological risk were employed to explore the influence of hydrological regime on spatiotemporal distribution of b in tgr sediments during five consecutive water seasons the periodic water level fluctuation leaded to slightly increase of b concentrations in tgr sediments while significantly affected the spatial heterogeneity of b the distribution of b in tgr sediments exhibited accumulation in midstream to downstream in general this accumulation was at low potential ecological risk we found that the distribution of fine grain sediments played an important role in spatial distribution of b in sediments due to the change of hydrological regime based on the geochemical normalization and correlation analysis this influence also demonstrated by recalculating the b concentrations after removing the particle sizes effect although the influence of fine grain sediments was greatly reduced slope of curve decreased from 0 9402 to 0 3682 a small part of b was still accumulated in the mid and downstream of tgr combining the rgb model and pca the mean contribution rates of natural and anthropogenic sources in tgr sediments were 91 55 and 8 45 respectively the small part of b in sediments originated from the anthropogenic input of b containing contaminants credit authorship contribution statement

4351,hydropower dam construction can alter the continuity of the river flow thereby influencing geochemical cycle of seldom monitored trace elements due to the change of hydrological regime by reservoir regulation here we investigated the response of hydrological regime on migration of boron b in the sediments of three gorges reservoir tgr using multiple geochemical approaches although b concentrations in tgr sediments increased slightly during five consecutive water seasons the potential ecological risk exhibited relatively low the spatial distribution patterns of b with high heterogeneity in tgr sediments were influenced by periodic water level fluctuation this high spatial heterogeneity significantly correlated with the distribution of fine grain sediments which was attributed to the change of hydrological regime including the decrease of water flow velocity sediment accumulation and extended residence time of suspended fine grain sediments in order to remove the sediment size effect the geochemical normalization approach was applied and revealed that the slope of normalization curve remarkably decreased from 0 9402 to 0 3682 this indicated that a small amount of b was still accumulated in the mid and downstream of tgr after removing the hydrological regime effect further source identification using geochemical baseline model and principal component analysis exposed that this slight accumulation of b in sediments originated from the anthropogenic input 8 45 our findings provide a geochemical insight on the environmental impacts of reservoir operation on toxic element cycling with potential implications for ecological assessment of hydropower worldwide keywords three gorges reservoir boron redistribution sources periodic water level fluctuation 1 introduction global energy consumption is expected to continuously increase in the upcoming decades bhandari et al 2014 hydropower as a type of clean energy provides approximately 19 of the world s electricity supply in over 150 countries dams 2000 the number and storage capacities of dams and reservoirs have increased markedly over the past six decades and over 58 000 large dams height 15 m have been developed to provide hydropower water resources and aid navigation dams 2000 liro 2019 li and ma 2017 as a result global rivers were exposed to the pressure from fragmentation and loss of connectivity during the development of hydropower such as damming friedl and w√ºest 2002 the reservoir construction has greatly changed the hydrological situation of rivers forming a pattern of alternation of lake facies in front of the dam and river facies at the end of the reservoir s√° oliveira et al 2015 these changes affected many fundamental processes e g retaining sediment and nutrient accumulation of metal pollutants due to the decrease of the water flow velocity and redistribution of contaminants cardinale et al 2012 chen et al 2020 three gorges dam tgd located on the yangtze river is the world s largest hydropower project which began to store water in 2003 the three gorges reservoir tgr followed the regulation mode of impounding clean water and discharging turbid water the water level of tgr fluctuated between the base level of 145 m during the wet season period may to september for flood control and the high level of 175 m during the dry season october to april for hydropower generation lin et al 2020 tang et al 2018 this anti season regulation mode of tgr not only significantly reduced the flow velocity and also remarkably influenced the distribution of sediments in reservoir yang et al 2018 for instance the water flow velocity decreased from 3 to 5 m s to 0 09 2 43 m s after water impoundment resulting in the fine particle of sediment accumulated trend toward the tgd cnemc 1998 2016 hu et al 2013 tang et al 2018 nevertheless most of previous studies focused on the occurrence concentration distributions or assessment of heavy metals in tgr water sediments and soils in water fluctuation level zone gao et al 2019 bing et al 2019 xu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 the research on seldom monitored trace elements smtes in tgr sediments under the

were reported the concentrations of b in water in china e g yangtze yellow and qinghai gaillardet et al 2003 zhang et al 2018a in fact as the sink and source of contamination in water environment it is still unknown how the reservoir regulation affects the geochemical process of b in sediments gaillardet and lemarchand 2018 mao et al 2019 in this study we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of b in tgr sediments during five consecutive water level fluctuation in order to clarify the influence of hydrological regime the objectives of this study were to 1 show that the spatiotemporal distribution in tgr sediments affected by consecutive water level fluctuation and evaluate the potential ecological risk of b 2 assess the impact of particle sizes effect resulting from the change of hydrological regime on b spatial heterogeneity in tgr sediments using multiple geochemical approaches 3 identify the anthropogenic and natural sources by geochemical baseline model to further illustrate the influence of hydrological regime changes 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the tgr area is located in west of the huber province and east of chongqing city on yangtze river china 28 32 31 44 n and 105 44 111 39 e the storage capacity of the tgr is 39 3 billion m3 and its surface area reaches 1080 km2 bing et al 2016 the climate of the tgr region is affected by the southeast subtropical monsoon twenty five sampling sites distributed throughout the mainstream of the tgr region from yichang to chongqing were selected and 125 surface sediment samples were collected at these sites from 2015 to 2017 fig 1 a stainless steel grab sampler was used to collect samples from the upstream m1 m11 midstream m12 m22 and downstream m23 m25 areas every year in june wet season and december dry season the sediment samples from each site were stored in clean sampling bags and transported to the laboratory then freeze dried one part of the dried sediment samples was used to analyze the particle size by a particle size analyzer microtrac s3500 usa the particle size was clarified as following clay 2 Œºm silt 2 20 Œºm and sand 20 2000 Œºm han et al 2017 the other dried samples were ground with an agate mortar to ensure homogeneity then the samples were sieved through a 0 25 mm sieve before analyzing their metal contents 2 2 chemical analysis a method of mixture acids with hf h2o2 hno3 was used to digest the sediment samples following a procedure described in a previous study xu et al 2018 an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes was used to analyze the concentrations of b al ca fe k and mg in tgr sediments and the inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms was used to analyze li concentrations gsd 9 and gsd 1a produced by chinese institute of geophysical and geochemical exploration for standard sediments were used to control the analysis quality of icp aes and icp ms respectively the recovery of reference materials was 99 15 117 03 and the data are listed in table s1 2 3 regional geochemical baseline establishment the regional geochemical baseline rgb concentration of b was calculated by normalization method xu et al 2018 the inert reference elements selected in this study were fe al and li first a linear regression equation between b and the three normalized elements fe al and li was established the data with the highest correlation coefficients r including b vs al b vs fe and b vs li were then used for further analysis the r values were listed in table s2 and presented in fig s1 teng and ni 2007 stated that the natural sources were the data points located inside of the 95 confidence limit while those outside the 95 confidence limit are anthropogenic sources the data outside 95 confidence limit anthropogenic sources were removed and the data inside the 95 confidence limit natural sources were applied to re establish a new linear regression as follows 1 b m a c n b where bm indicates the rgb of b mg kg c n indicates the average concentrations of the normalized elements with the highest r values mg kg and a and b indicate the regression constants the rgb in this study was taken as the b background value in the tgr sediments 2 4 statistical analysis the spss ibm spss statistics 22 0 for windows was used to statistical analysis in this study analysis of variance anova was performed to analyze the significant spatial and temporal difference p 0 05 relationships among the considered variables were tested using pearson s coefficient with statistical significance set at p 0 05 and p 0 01 the kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s sphericity tests were performed to examine the suitability of the data for principal component analysis pca 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal variations of b in sediments during periodic water level fluctuation the average b concentration and distribution in tgr sediments is listed in table 1 the average value of b was 55 10 mg kg with the range of 32 47 83 12 mg kg from 2015 to 2017 table 1 the maximum b concentration was 2 6 times higher than the minimum concentration in tgr sediments comparing with the previous data in the year of 2010 in tgr sediments in china 59 15 mg kg gao et al 2014 the average concentration of b in recent tgr sediments exhibited slight reduction in addition the mean content of b in tgr sediments 55 10 mg kg was higher than those in the sediments of the miyun reservoir in china 31 26 mg kg and medjuvr≈°je reservoir in serbia 10 72 mg kg djikanovic et al 2018 han et al 2016 and lower than the mean value in the sediment of the yangtze river 63 00 mg kg and qinghai lake 58 88 mg kg in china chi and wu 2007 zhang et al 2018b the spatial distribution of b is presented in fig 2 d the color shifted from cool to warm from the upstream to downstream in tgr regions indicating that the b concentrations of the sediments increased gradually from upstream to downstream the high concentration of b in sediment was mainly concentrated in the midstream and downstream of tgr fig 3 the coefficient of variation of b in each sampling sites ranged from 12 88 to 20 26 meaning that there was a high spatial heterogeneity of b in tgr sediments p 0 05 the temporal changes of the b concentration in tgr sediments during the periodic water level fluctuation from 2015 to 2017 are shown in fig 3 and table 1 the concentrations of b in sediments fluctuated with slightly increase under the change of the periodic water seasons and the b concentrations in the downstream of tgr sediments tended to be stable fig 3 the result was similar to the variation of heavy metals e g as cd pb cu zn tl and sb etc in tgr sediments during the consecutive water period in previous study gao et al 2019 xu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 moreover the average concentration of b in tgr sediments in the wet season 54 26 mg kg was slightly lower than that in the dry season 56 36 mg kg p 0 908 which was resemble to the variations of thallium and antimony in tgr sediments xu et al 2019 nevertheless there was no significant influence on the concentrations of b in sediments with different water periods therefore the high spatial heterogeneity of b in tgr sediments may be attributed to two reasons 1 changes of hydrological regime in tgr the decrease of water flow velocity after tgd construction cnemc 1998 2016 resulted in the increase of residence time for suspended particles in tgr tang et al 2018 the change of the hydrological regime caused the coarse and fine grain particles of sediments redistribution in tgr tang et al 2018 2 anthropogenic influence although the release of b into the environment was driven by natural processes inputs from anthropogenic sources such as leachates from the bottom and fly ashes of coal fired power plants runoff from agricultural land treated with b containing fertilizers and wastewater treatment were also discharged into the river iwashita et al 2005 3 2 influence factors of hydrological regime on b distribution in sediments the change of hydrological regime can influence the distribution patterns of sediment with different particle sizes bing et al 2016 liu et al 2007 gao and wang 2008 after tgd construction the water flow velocity significantly decreased from 3 to 5 to 0 09 2 43 m s cnemc 1998 2016 forming a pattern of alternation of lake facies in front of tgd and river facies at the end of the reservoir s√° oliveira et al 2015 the change of water flow velocity of tgr prolonged the suspension time of fine particles in sediments causing redistribution of the sediment particles in tgr bing et al 2016 tang et al 2018 in this study the average percentages of clay silt and sand accounted for 38 81 54 43 and 6 76 of the sediments respectively showing that the tgr sediments were mainly composed of silt and clay with a small amount of sand this indicated that the fine grain particles of sediments silt and clay were the major particle fraction in tgr as shown in fig 2 a b and c the clay content rose towards the dam while the sand content declined silt was mainly distributed in the midstream region of the tgr this phenomenon indicated that the coarse grain sediments tended to accumulate in upstream of tgr while the fine grain sediments tended to deposit in the midstream and downstream of tgr based on the annual data of sediments in tgr after full impoundment of tgr in 2010 cwrc 2006 2017 the median particle size of sediments in yichang monitoring station mean 0 008 mm were lower than its upstream monitoring station cuntan mean 0 011 mm fig s6 indicating that the coarse grain particles in sediments could mostly distribute in the upstream of tgr and the fine grain particles in sediments concentrate settlement to the middle and lower reaches of tgr previous study indicated that the clay minerals in sediments could readily adsorb b gaillardet and lemarchand 2018 implying that the migration and deposition of clay fraction in sediments would affect the migration and deposition of b in sediments we further found that there was a positive correlation between fine grain particles in sediments clay and silt and b contents r 0 7535 p 0 001 fig s3 demonstrating that the accumulation of b in midstream and downstream of tgr was attributed to the accumulation of fine grain sediments in the same region therefore during five consecutive water periods the spatial distribution of b in tgr sediments was influenced by redistribution of sediments especially for fine grain sediments redistribution furthermore in order to remove the effect of hydrological regime variation on the distribution of b in tgr sediments the geochemical normalization was conducted to explore the b redistribution in tgr sediments sun et al 2018 xu et al 2019 specifically there were significantly positive relationships between the concentrations of fe al li and clay p 0 01 fig s4 illustrating that the concentrations of normalized elements were mainly affected by the variations in grain sizes due to natural weathering processes there was a positive correlation between the concentration of b and both al and clay fraction fig s4 and table s2 thus al was selected to normalize the influence of fine grain sediments on the b distribution in the sediments of tgr as shown in fig 4 the concentrations of b in the sediments of the midstream and downstream regions of tgr significantly decreased after the values were normalized by al leading to obviously decreased the slope of linear equation from 0 9402 to 0 3682 accounting for 60 8 decrease of the slope fig 4 the result manifested that the fine grain particles in tgr should play an important role in distribution of b in sediments notably after removing the influence of fine grain particles in sediments there was still a slightly accumulation of b in the midstream and downstream of the tgr fig 4 this accumulation of b might be attributed to the input by anthropogenic activities e g input of b containing detergents cleaning products and antifreeze etc 3 3 source identification of b in tgr sediments the geochemical rgb methodology can be used to distinguish the natural and anthropogenic sources in sediments xu et al 2018 meanwhile the rgb values can be taken as the background values bvs of elements in most study areas tian et al 2017 xu et al 2019 this method was used

geochemical baseline calculation principle of rgb model the results of the linear regression between b and the three normalized elements li fe al were listed in table s2 the correlation coefficients r of the linear regression for rgb models li fe and al were 0 9749 0 9722 and 0 9851 respectively fig s1 and table s2 based on the principle of selecting high correlation coefficient of normalized elements in previous studies lin et al 2012 xu et al 2019 al was selected to calculate the rgb b value of tgr sediments fig s1 the rgb value of b rgb b in tgr sediments was 56 92 mg kg which was a bit higher than the average b concentration 55 10 mg kg in the tgr sediments chi and wu 2007 the rgb b value was lower than that of sediment in the yangtze river 63 mg kg chi and wu 2007 owing to the absence of bvs in reservoirs soils and river basins the rgb values of trace metals in these regions have been taken as the bvs in pollution risk assessments xu et al 2018 xu et al 2019 tian et al 2017 therefore rgb b was used as the bv of b in the tgr region to further calculate its potential ecological risk the rgb model pearson s correlation coefficient analysis and pca were used to further identify the relationships and potential sources of b in the tgr sediments xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b the rgb b model can be used to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural sources xu et al 2018 and its results are presented in fig s2 the average anthropogenic contributions of b in the five consecutive sampling periods ranged from 5 79 to 12 55 mean value of 8 45 indicating that most of the b in the tgr sediments emanated from natural sources 91 55 additionally the pearson s correlation coefficient values of b in tgr sediments are presented in fig 5 the b concentration was significantly and positively correlated with the contents of li al fe and k p 0 01 illustrating that b mainly attributed from natural sources fig 5 the sources of the measured elements were further determined by conducting pca which can also be used to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic sources han et al 2016 the validity of the pca approach was demonstrated by the kmo value 0 5 and the significance of the result of bartlett s test p 0 001 the eigenvalues in two principal components pcs were higher than 1 were extracted as shown in table s3 there was 82 555 of the data variability with the pcs using pca individually the pc1 the first pc contained high loadings of b li fe al and k 0 5 indicating that b was associated with the normalized elements li fe k and al this was consistent with the pearson s correlation coefficient analysis results and also demonstrated that b mainly originated from natural sources in fact the major natural sources came from the sediments

distinguishing by rgb model fig s2 the result indicated that the anthropogenic source of b in tgr sediments changed steadily and the natural source changed with the variation of sediment accumulation

study numerical simulation and time series analysis methods are used to explore the input of phosphorus p in different types of tributary watersheds around the reservoirs in river reservoir systems and the impact of dam construction on reservoir water quality watersheds within a reservoir were divided into larger and smaller tributary watersheds according to whether their area was greater than or less than 1000 km2 the results showed that smaller tributary watersheds which account for 29 of the area of the three gorges reservoir region tgrr transported approximately 36 45 of p and 43 7 47 8 of sediment deposited into the mainstream from 2003 to 2017 p from the smaller tributary watersheds of the reservoir had a stronger influence on the aquatic environment of the river reservoir system than that from the larger tributary watersheds in addition the annual mean contributions of the p inputs from the three rivers the yangtze river the jialingjiang river and the wujiang river and tributary watersheds within the reservoir were 68 76 and 31 18 from 2003 to 2017 respectively the dam altered the composition of the form of p in the river reservoir system and the waterbody close to the dam was identified as the main area containing dissolved p dp enrichment accordingly the risk of eutrophication remains high in head area of the dam due to the relatively high and stable p concentration this study provides critical information for the management of nutrients in a river reservoir system and the prevention of eutrophication of water bodies keywords phosphorus flux retention effects three gorges reservoir region tributary watershed eutrophication 1 introduction the number of large hydroelectric dams worldwide will double after the completion of dams under construction or planned at present especially in developing countries akbarzadeh et al 2019 dam construction to utilize water resources generate clean energy and prevent floods has formed many reservoirs with the characteristics of lakes worldwide hu et al 2020 maavara et al 2015 reservoir impoundment can disrupt the natural river hydrological regime and cause interruption of river connectivity sedimentation and nutrient retention han et al 2018 dam reservoirs act as in stream reactors impeding river flow and increasing residence time thereby providing a suitable environment for biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and leading to variations in nutrient flux and water quality gao et al 2020 maavara et al 2020 wang 2020 however the challenge posed by dam reservoirs is not only that they affect the ecosystems of downstream rivers and marginal seas van meter et al 2017 but also that they can cause nutrient enrichment and subsequent eutrophication of the river reservoir ecosystem wang et al 2019a p is a key limiting nutrient in lake and reservoir systems because of its role in restricting the development of aquatic biomass moges et al 2018 a reservoir becomes a lacustrine system after impoundment which induces thermal stratification and sediment trapping winton et al 2019 accordingly the physical changes within these reservoirs enhance p retention through adsorption and sedimentation lewis et al 2011 liang et al 2020 while the anoxic bottom waters of these reservoirs greatly accelerate the transformation of particulate p pp into dissolved p dp kunz et al 2011 the physical and chemical changes created by the reservoir also cause continuous variations in water quality within the reservoir and downstream tributary streams are conduits from watersheds to the receiving water bodies and are priority points for directing terrestrial nutrient management because they are strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities robertson and saad 2011 representative supervision and management efforts are mainly focused on the largest tributary watersheds around the reservoirs and lakes due to their dominant hydrological loads and their likely transmission large proportions of nutrients corresponding to their high discharge however the plumes from smaller tributaries are much more likely to stay in the littoral zone and increase the possibility of them affecting the water environment of receiving wate bodies mooney et al 2020 in addition smaller tributaries around reservoirs and lakes may import more nutrients than their watershed area and the nutrient composition may also be different from that of larger tributaries due to the discrepancy in watershed land use and attributes bernhardt et al 2005 lottig et al 2011 therefore it is noteworthy that the lack of synchronized monitoring of small and medium sized tributary watersheds has hindered understanding of the role these tributaries play in overall nutrient transmittal and deterioration of water quality yurista et al 2016 marcarelli et al 2019 xue et al 2020 the rise of water level after impoundment causes the variation in geometric characteristics of surrounding watersheds such as area average elevation and slope liu et al 2020a which increases the number of small and medium sized watersheds and affects the anthropogenic activities and thereby the delivery of nutrients the lack of study on the yields of the abundant smaller tributaries brings uncertainty to the nutrient input of lakes and reservoirs and the impact of dam construction wide range and high frequency monitoring is an important method to solve the inadequate understanding of smaller tributaries but it is not easy to implement due to the high cost chen et al 2019 numerous physical based models have been developed for nonpoint source nps prediction at varying scopes and locations due to limited resources but it should be noted that these models require considerable field data for accuracy verification huang et al 2017 karamouz et al 2015 wellen et al 2015 wang et al 2019b the small scale watershed extended method swem combined with a physical based model has been proposed as a remedy for insufficient data on the restriction of regional nutrient research hong et al 2012 the combined monitoring and modelling approach can be used not only for long term planning and management of water quality but also for real time prediction of its variation revealing the different mechanisms and drivers that affect water quality changes goh et al 2017 wang et al 2019c it has been proven to greatly reduce uncertainty and yield high quality results wang et al 2016 meanwhile the trend analysis of water quality also helps to understand the impact of dam construction because of its significance in changing the transportation of river nutrients sun et al 2013 wang 2020 based on the development of these methods a detailed study of p from every tributary watershed will help to improve the understanding the overall role of smaller tributaries around a reservoir as well as develop practical water quality safeguards under the current and foreseeable future dam construction boom in this study we hypothesize that smaller tributary watersheds around a reservoir contribute a large quantity of p to the river reservoir system and that the reservoir p flux is underestimated to test this hypothesis the three gorges reservoir region tgrr was selected as the focus of a detailed investigation a tributary watershed with an area greater and smaller than 1000 km2 is considered to be a larger and smaller tributary watershed respectively the main objectives of this study were 1 to reveal the p load from larger and smaller tributary watersheds within reservoirs after impoundment and 2 to elaborate on the effect of reservoir on p and sediment retention and its influence on water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the tgrr 28 10 32 13 n 105 17 110 11 e is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and has abundant water resources the tgrr contains all of the districts and counties affected by the reservoir impoundment it also contains all the tributary watersheds that flow into the mainstream of the reservoir in this study with a total area of 6 60 104 km2 the length of the mainstream tgrr is approximately 660 km and the water surface area is 1100 km2 when the water level reaches 175 m the tgrr mainly receives inflow from the upper reaches of the yangtze river and the jialingjiang and wujiang rivers which are collectively called the three rivers fig 1 and they account for over 90 of the total inflow han et al 2017 the average precipitation is 1200 mm 80 of which occurs from april to october the zhutuo zt transect of the yangtze river and wusheng ws transect of jialingjiang river represent the inflow stations of the reservoir the qingxichang qxc wanxian wx fengjie fj and badong bd are the monitoring stations from upstream to downstream in the reservoir the yichang yc station is located 37 km downstream of the three gorges dam and represents the outflow of the tgrr this study takes the mainstream of the tgrr as the research object which mainly accepts p from the three rivers as well as from the surrounding tributary watersheds monthly water quality data measured daily flow and sediment data from 2003 to 2017 across the transects and monitoring stations were collected from the yangtze water resources commission the hydrological and water quality monitoring data of typical watersheds within the study area and the point source data were collected by the chongqing and yichang ecological environment monitoring center 2 2 p mass balance in the tgrr in this study the p budget of the tgrr contained four major components the inflow of the three rivers fin the nps p load entering the reservoir with rainfall runoff in the tributary watersheds fnps the outflow of the tgrr fout and the reservoir retention rt the p inflow and outflow of the tgrr was calculated as follows 1 fin out c q where fin out t yr 1 is the p flux of the inflow zt ws and wj and the outflow yc of the tgrr c is the concentration of p mg l 1 and q is the discharge m3 month 1 or m3 yr 1 the p retention was calculated as follows 2 rt fin fnps fout 3 fnps fl fs where fl and fs represent the nps p load from larger and smaller tributary watersheds within the reservoir respectively 2 3 calculation of the p load from larger and smaller tributary watersheds within the tgrr the soil and water assessment tool swat model which was developed by the agriculture research service of the united states department of agriculture was used for simulating the p load from the surrounding smaller and larger tributary watersheds in the swat model the watershed was divided into multiple sub watersheds which were further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus that consist of a unique combination of soil slope land use and land management the simulation process can be further divided into a land surface process and a main channel process runoff sediment and p were calculated for each hru and then routed in stream using the qual2e model teshager et al 2017 the successful operation of the swat model requires the land use type soil type cultivation measures and meteorological database of the study area in this study the dem land use and soil data were obtained from the global digital elevation model dataset landsat 5 tm dataset and the institute of geography chinese academy of sciences respectively the physical and chemical properties of the soil for the soil dataset were mainly derived from the chinese soil database and field surveying the meteorological data collected at fifty weather stations were obtained from the state meteorological data sharing service system the basic information about crop form irrigation social economics the amount and time of fertilization were collected from the statistics yearbook and field investigation in the typical watersheds of the study area the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup developed by the neprash corporation and texas a m university was adopted to calibrate the swat model and obtain parameter groups rostamian et al 2008 the correlation coefficient r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency ens were selected to quantify the goodness of fit between the monitoring data and the simulated data which can be calculated as follows 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 5 e ns 1 i 1 n q sim i q mea i 2 i 1 n q mea i q mea 2 where oi o pi and p are the flow and p load monitoring data the mean value of the flow and p load monitoring data the simulated flow and p load value and the mean value of flow and o load data respectively qmea i is the observation data qsim i is the simulated value qmea is the mean value of the observation data and n is the total number of observations ens 0 5 is recommended as the lower limit evaluation for an acceptable simulation result in this study the 80 surrounding watersheds were divided into larger and smaller tributary watersheds according to whether their areas were larger or smaller than 1000 km2 fig s1 the total area ratio of smaller to larger tributary watersheds was 41 the detailed land use categories are shown in table s1 we introduced the small scale watershed extended method swem for parameter calibration in the tgrr hong et al 2012 this method uses physical based models in some small typical watersheds of the targeted large watersheds and then the parameters of models obtained from those small watersheds are extended to the surrounding area until the whole p flux of the entire study area is acquired the tgrr was divided into four districts for quantitative study which were the yulin xiaojiang daning and xiangxi districts based on the data availability and partition homogeneity we consider topography area size and adequacy of monitoring data to choose four typical small watersheds in the four districts of the tgrr for the swem they were the yulin river xiaojiang river daning river and xiangxi river watershed fig s2 the swat models of these four watersheds were constructed and calibrated to get model representative parameter groups of their respective districts and then the remaining watersheds in the four districts were run using the parameter group of the districts to run the swat model the influence of rural and domestic enterprises were calculated according to the pollution production and discharge coefficient and were added as a point source for the sub watersheds of each typical watershed then the model parameters that were not affected by the point sources were obtained through calibration the swat models of the four watersheds were calibrated at monthly scales the r2 and ens values of the flow fig 2 a c e and g and tp fig 2 b d f and h of the calibrated models were all greater than 0 65 and 0 60 respectively the calibration and validation results were accepted if the r2 values and nse values of flow and tp were greater than 0 5 wang et al 2019d then the extended results of the parameter groups were verified in the adjacent watersheds of each section fig s2 the results showed that the r2 and ens values of the flow in the modao and yandu watersheds were 0 79 and 0 69 and 0 83 and 0 50 fig s3a and c respectively the r2 and ens values of the tp in the tangxi watershed were 0 65 and 0 50 respectively fig s3b the verification results indicated that the parameter groups obtained by the four watersheds could be extended to their respective districts and the calibrated models could be used for the following analysis then the yield and input of the p load from tributary watersheds within the tgrr could be calculated as follows 6 q sub i 1 n q i i 1 n j 1 m a sub i j c sub i j where qsub is the total yield of p qi is the yield from district i asub ij is the area of sub watershed j in district i and csub ij is the load intensity of the p from the corresponding sub watersheds 7 t i 1 n t i i 1 n j 1 m t ij where t is the p load from the tributary watersheds within the tgrr ti is the total p load at the outlet of the watershed in district i and tij is the p load at the outlet of watershed j in part i 2 4 trend analysis methods in order to reveal the impact of the reservoirs on the water quality the time series trend analysis method was used to detect the variation trend in water quality after dam construction a time series regression with autoregressive integrated moving average model arima noise missing values and outlier analysis tramo and signal extraction in the arima time series seats program were used to remove the effects of seasonality and discharge and to decompose the time series the arima is a model that reflects the variation of the sequence by introducing the method of probability analysis when dealing with a time series that does not have a specific change trend these methods were developed by caporello maravall and have been widely used by various institutions such as the us census bureau and eurostat g√≤mez and maravall 1996 tramo is a widely used program for estimating and predicting the nonstationary arima errors of regression models and the missing values of any sequence the seats program was used for estimating the unobserved components in the time series and followed the arima model based method the overall trends and seasonal irregular and cyclical components were estimated and predicted with signal extraction techniques applied to the arima models the seats program revealed most of the unique features of the time series the conventional components trend cycle seasonal and transitory that seats decomposed into a univariate time series model are considered to be the products of the arima process which was driven by a statistically independent white noise process the estimation contained two steps in the first step the time series was preprocessed and decomposed according to the conventional method specifically tramo preprocessed the time series data and then passed the results to seats seats then decomposed the time series into the following two models 8 additive model z tc s ir by tramo seats 9 multiplicative model z tc s ir by tramo seats where z represents the time series tc represents the trend cycle component of a time series s represents the seasonal component and is a cyclical change that occurs repeatedly every year and ir represents irregular components in the second step the hp filter was applied to trend components that were distinct from the trend cycle component 10 the cycle was defined as specific frequency bands in the hp filter the optimal value of the smoothing parameter was determined by the cycle and the smoothing parameter was set to 14 400 for monthly data in accordance with hodrick prescott 1997 10 tc t c by hp filter where t and c represent the trend and cycle components respectively 2 5 data analysis in this study statistical analyses were performed with spss statistical software ibm spss statistics ver 22 0 the time series analysis of water quality was conducted with the eviews software ver 10 display and expression of the research results were performed using origin ver 9 1 3 results 3 1 comparison of the p loads from larger and smaller tributary watersheds within the reservoirs the results of the p load from tributary watersheds within the reservoirs obtained through the swat model are presented in fig 3 the annual tp load from tributary watersheds showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing during the study period and the maximum appeared in 2014 fig 3a this finding can be explained by the fact that precipitation which is the main driving factor of nps was greater than that in other years the annual tp load from larger tributary watersheds was higher than that of smaller tributary watersheds with the values fluctuating between 1 0 104 and 2 1 104 t and 7 8 103 and 1 4 104 t respectively throughout the simulation period the tp loading ratio of smaller and larger tributary watersheds ranged from 0 55 to 0 81 with relatively small fluctuations occurring from 2006 to 2013 the annual inorganic p ip load also showed the same variations as the tp load fig 3b this value ranged from 6 8 103 to 1 5 104 t and from 4 7 103 to 7 3 103 t for larger and smaller tributary watersheds respectively and the ip load ratio was between 0 47 and 0 71 in contrast the annual organic p op load from smaller and larger tributary watersheds showed little difference and presented different trends from those of the tp and ip loads fig 3c the annual op load ratio ranged from 0 73 to 1 06 in terms of the variations on a monthly timescale fig 3d the p load from larger and smaller tributary watersheds ranged from 0 10 103 t to 3 00 103 t and from 0 07 103 t to 2 78 103 t respectively the maximum and minimum p loads appeared in july and december and were affected by the precipitation distribution the average tp yield exhibited wide variation across the study area fig s4 it ranged from 0 03 to 27 43 kg ha 1 and from 0 04 to 29 17 kg ha 1 with the average of 5 87 and 6 74 kg ha 1 in the larger and smaller tributary watersheds respectively the tp yields were significantly related to the distribution of land use types fig s1 the higher yields were mainly distributed in watersheds with dense cropland while lower yields were in areas with forestland in general it is worth noting that smaller tributary watersheds which occupy 29 of the reservoir area contributed 36 45 of the p load to the mainstream of the tgrr and should not be ignored 3 2 p flux and concentration in the inflow and outflow of the tgrr the time series of tp ss flux and discharge along the direction of flow obtained by the observation data and their statistical analysis are shown in fig 4 and table 1 the tp and ss fluxes showed the same variation among these stations which increased from 2003 to 2008 and then decreased thereafter excluding 2006 and 2012 the decline in ss flux from 2013 to 2017 was particularly significant fig 4a and b the tp flux at the inflow zt and mainstream qxc and wx stations were larger than that at the outflow yc station from 2004 to 2013 but the tp flux at the outflow station began to exceed that at the other stations after 2014 fig 4a the average tp fluxes at the zt qxc wx and yc stations were 4 85 2 11 7 01 2 43 5 67 1 88 and 4 59 1 25 104 t yr 1 respectively the mass balance of tp in this study showed that 3 70 2 08 104 t yr 1 of p was retained in the reservoir after passing the dam furthermore the variable quantities of tp from the zt to qxc qxc to wx and wx to yc stations were 0 55 0 42 1 84 0 91 and 1 54 1 04 104 t yr 1 respectively table 1 which were related to the retention of ss and pp along the fluvial direction the ss flux showed a downward trend from the inflow to downstream of the dam excluding the qxc station fig 4b as this station was downstream where the three rivers converge however the tp and ss fluxes from the jialingjiang and wujiang rivers were significantly smaller than those originating in the upper reaches of the yangtze river input into the reservoir table 1 the ss flux at the zt and qxc stations was larger than that at the wx and yc stations and the variable quantities from the zt station to the qxc station from the qxc station to the wx stations and from the wx station to the yc station were 7 11 39 36 52 26 23 98 and 49 97 29 02 mt respectively in contrast the annual discharge fluctuated and increased along the flow direction fig 4c which differed from that of ss and tp in the global aquatic ecosystems over 90 of fluvial p is in the form of pp and sediment is the major carrier of p the fitted curves of the ss flux with the tp flux along the flow direction were plotted to quantify the impact of the ss flux on the tp flux fig 5 a d the results indicated that the ss and tp fluxes are in accordance with a power function relation the correlation between sediment and the tp flux showed a declining trend from inflow to outflow the r2 of the fitted curve between sediment and the tp flux in the inflow r2 0 63 was significantly higher than that in the outflow r2 0 10 with the development of physical and chemical stratification within the reservoirs after impoundment changes in the water quality of the river reservoir system appear to be discrete along the flow direction understanding the variations in water quality is very important for the management of the reservoir and surrounding watersheds the seasonally adjusted series and the trend and cycle components of the tp concentration obtained by tramo seats methods are shown in fig 6 the smooth trend component extracted from the hp filter gave us a clear idea of the evolution of the tp concentration along the fluvial direction of the river reservoir system after dam construction red lines in fig 6 the tp concentrations at these stations changed significantly but presented different trends and the potential inflection points were detected by using the trend components among these stations in the inflow fig 6a there was only one inflection point which was observed at the end of 2011 the tp concentration showed an upward trend before this time but it decreased significantly thereafter the tp concentrations at the qxc and wx stations fig 6b and c within the reservoir showed the same variation and the inflection points were at the end of 2007 and 2012 the tp concentration presented repeated changes that first increased and then decreased however the fluctuation range of the tp concentration at the qxc station fig 6b was larger than that at the wx station this is because qxc is the downstream station of the three rivers confluence and the input of the dp from the wujiang was the main factor affecting the variation in p concentration at the qxc station in terms of the fj and bd stations the tp concentration first decreased then increased and finally remained stable and the inflection points were at the end of 2003 and 2006 fig 6d and e the tp concentration after dam construction presented the same trend as the bd station but its fluctuation range was relatively larger fig 6f 4 discussion 4 1 impact of the p input from surrounding smaller tributary watersheds notwithstanding that rivers play an important role in promoting the eutrophication in reservoirs and lakes most supervision and monitoring work ignores nutrient input from the surrounding small tributaries the tgrr mainly receives p input from three rivers and all tributary watersheds within the reservoir without considering the influence of point source pollution the observation and simulation results revealed that annual contribution rates of p input from three rivers and the surrounding tributary watersheds were 68 76 and 31 18 table 1 the ratio of p from the surrounding tributary watersheds and three rivers ranged from 20 to 96 which indicated that the tributary watersheds were an important source of p to the river reservoir system minor large tributary watersheds input the majority of nutrient into the receiving reservoir but we found that the smaller tributary watersheds also had a key effect the smaller tributary watersheds which account for 29 of the surrounding area contribute 36 45 of the total tp load from the surrounding tributary watersheds to the reservoir the present study about the p load shed new light on the critical role that smaller tributary watersheds have on the nutrient budget and water quality of the tgrr and potentially other large receiving water bodies especially in developing countries where dam construction is booming now and in the foreseeable future there will be approximately 3 700 new dams built in the larger watersheds such as amazon river congo river and yangtze river basins by 2030 maavara et al 2015 latrubesse et al 2017 barbarossa et al 2020 which will increase the area of inland water and lead to the increment of smaller tributary watersheds in the past several decades the total surface area of inland water has increased by 6 672 km2 in china due to dam construction gao et al 2020 the smaller tributary watersheds delivered relatively large amount of nutrients especially disproportionate amount of op fig 3b the reason was that smaller tributaries have shorter flow paths from land to water as well as within the channel leading to more direct impacts of land use on smaller watersheds lottig et al 2011 baker et al 2014 op from fertilization in the farmland was migrated with runoff erosion furthermore the inundation of the lowlands within the reservoir caused the agricultural land to move toward high altitude areas and the slope of the farmland increased wu et al 2009 the nutrient leached from soil or attached to the sediment could easily migrate to reservoir with the rainfall runoff mooney et al 2020 the sediment sourced from the smaller tributary watersheds accounted for 43 7 47 8 of the total sediment within the reservoir and a large quantity of p was input to the mainstream due to the soil erosion caused by rainfall runoff with a short confluence time a fast flow rate and a strong scouring ability pang et al 2018 research in the mississippi atchafalaya river basin also indicated that smaller streams in the central and eastern regions contributed over 50 75 of the stream nutrients to the gulf of mexico alexander et al 2008 hoang et al 2019 revealed that a significant quantity of p was derived from small watersheds in near stream areas where agricultural activities were relatively active along the cannonsville reservoir reducing nutrient inputs to sensitive water bodies remains a pivotal management priority worldwide the relatively high proportion of the input of p from the surrounding tributary watersheds indicated that it is of great significance to control p from the tributary watersheds to protect the aquatic environment of the river reservoir system the control of p was mainly concentrated in large watersheds with agricultural activities kamruzzaman et al 2020 and the amount of p was reduced by implementing bmps in high yield areas bhumika and madan 2020 based on this study controlling the p coming from smaller the tributary watersheds within the reservoirs should be a priority these smaller tributary watersheds are representative of high yield areas within reservoirs compared with those in a certain region it is cost effective to control nps pollution primarily in highly polluted areas smaller tributary watersheds could also be more feasible targets for management measures due to their oversight by fewer landowner and political jurisdictions implementing a plan similar to the sloping land conversion program and the farm to forest program and engineering and non engineering measures together with bmps in the large tributaries should greatly reduce the p load zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the reduction in limited nutrients in smaller tributary watersheds coupled with the destruction of the hydrodynamic conditions required for algae outbreaks bao et al 2015 could effectively prevent and alleviate the eutrophication caused by reservoir storage 4 2 reservoir retention effect dam construction and impoundment not only increases the number of smaller tributary watersheds but also causes the retention and deposition of sediment and nutrients thereby changing the water quality of reservoirs and downstream rivers carles and peuelas 2019 maavara et al 2020 the results of present study indicate that approximately 3 70 104 t of p was retained within the reservoir which accounted for 70 of the input from the three rivers and 42 of the total input table 1 the retention of p in the tgrr was lower than that in dam impounded lake kariba lake diefenbaker and lac d orient of which account for 87 94 and 71 of the total input kunz et al 2011 donald et al 2015 the retention of p by dams remained poorly constrained compared to lakes an average of 12 of the global river tp load was trapped in reservoirs and this proportion will reach 17 in 2030 with the increase of dam construction maavara et al 2015 under the combined effects of the biogeochemical cycle and reservoir retention the nutrient composition in the head area of dams was obviously different form that in the inflow maavara et al 2015 winton et al 2019 the correlation between the sediment and tp flux in the outflow compared to that in the inflow fig 5a and d indicated that sediment deposition resulted in a large amount of pp being deposited into the reservoir therefore the form and composition of tp changed in the reservoir and the proportion of dp increased most of the dp in the water body can be consumed by algae lewis et al 2011 thus the impoundment of reservoirs greatly contributes to the eutrophication of reservoirs and estuaries because of the variations in the form of p and the hydrodynamic conditions the time series analysis results among these stations showed that tp concentration along the river reservoir system presented different trends after dam construction fig s5 which indicated the synthesis results of the upstream surrounding tributary watersheds and biogeochemical reactions inside the reservoir han et al 2018 wang et al 2019c the tp concentration in the inflow showed stable fluctuation and a downward trend after 2006 fig s5a which demonstrated the effectiveness of the chinese government s water and soil conservation policies environmental restoration investments and cascade reservoir interception in the upper reaches of the yangtze river ouyang et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 resulting in a significant reduction of sediment and p input fig 4 a and b soil and water conservation measures in the upper reaches of the yangtze river began in the 1990s and more than 592 large reservoirs were gradually built after the completion of the three gorges reservoir the joint operation of these reservoirs resulted in a significant reduction in p and sediment undershot studies have shown that the sediment into the tgrr from 2003 to 2017 decreased by 56 3 compared to 1991 2002 zhou et al 2017 liu et al 2020b simultaneously the tp concentration in water close to the dam and the outflow remained relatively high and stable after tp concentration in the inflow presented downward trend fig s5 the tp concentration increase in the head area of the dam after 2006 fig s5b could be attributed to the surrounding tributary watersheds inputs as well as the internal release of p from sediment which was a function of the extent to which p retention by dams could offset the anthropogenic p enrichment of rivers maavara et al 2015 wu et al 2020 moreover the death and decomposition of microorganisms could also induce an increase in p in the overlying water gao et al 2020 the discrepancy variation trend of the tp concentration at the monitoring stations indicated the special impact of the surrounding tributary watersheds around the reservoir on the water quality in addition the hydraulic power of low flow plumes from smaller tributaries cannot drive the nutrients to far shore these inflows with high nutrient concentrations will have greater impact on the deterioration and eutrophication of the receiving waterbody allan et al 2013 although the main input from the smaller tributary watersheds was op with low bioavailability the study revealed that more than 30 of op can be converted into bioavailable ip after mineralization and hydrolysis baker et al 2014 the plumes from smaller tributary watersheds were more easily trapped due to the reservoir water level fluctuation and their adverse effects on the reservoir water quality might be magnified gloege et al 2020 variations in the concentration of dissolved nutrients directly respond to the quality of the aquatic environment the results of this study illustrate that the reservoir altered the composition of the form of p and that the proportion of dp increased from the tail area to the head area of the dam where the tp concentration remained high and stable more dp in the water body generates more p available to phytoplankton and increases the risk of eutrophication zhou et al 2017 ding et al 2019 the reduced water flow caused increased sedimentation and water transparency in the reservoir and tributaries after the impoundment the level of p within the reservoir and tributaries then exceeded the international recognized threshold for eutrophication thomann 1987 which implies that there is a risk of algal outbreaks within the reservoirs and tributaries therefore adjusting the hydrodynamic conditions within the reservoirs during bloom prone periods to avoid creating the environment required for algae growth together with reducing nutrients in tributary watersheds may alleviate and eliminate eutrophication 5 conclusion in the present study the results showed that smaller tributary watersheds which account for 29 of the reservoir area transport approximately 36 45 of p and 43 7 47 8 of sediment to the mainstream the annual mean contributions of the p input from the three rivers and tributary watersheds within the reservoir were 68 76 and 31 18 from 2003 to 2017 respectively the results of the tp budget showed that 42 of tp was retained in the reservoir from 2003 to 2017 the time series analysis results of tp demonstrated the retention effect of the reservoir on pp and the influence of the p input from tributary watersheds variation trends of tp concentrations and the correlation of the tp with the sediment of the reservoir imply that the dam has the effect of altering the composition and the form of p in the river reservoir system and that the proportion of dp increases from the tail to the head area of the reservoir with the deposition of pp the proportion of dp increases and the risk of eutrophication in the head area of the reservoir remains high the results of this study indicate that the smaller surrounding tributary watersheds are a main source of nutrients to the reservoirs measures taken to return farmland to forests and grasslands in these watersheds and control projects are more cost effective compared to implementing such changes in larger tributary watersheds within reservoirs after the upstream watershed environment has been improved credit authorship contribution

4352,water level fluctuation and modification in human activities induced by dam construction have significantly affected the production and input of nutrients in the tributary watersheds in this study numerical simulation and time series analysis methods are used to explore the input of phosphorus p in different types of tributary watersheds around the reservoirs in river reservoir systems and the impact of dam construction on reservoir water quality watersheds within a reservoir were divided into larger and smaller tributary watersheds according to whether their area was greater than or less than 1000 km2 the results showed that smaller tributary watersheds which account for 29 of the area of the three gorges reservoir region tgrr transported approximately 36 45 of p and 43 7 47 8 of sediment deposited into the mainstream from 2003 to 2017 p from the smaller tributary watersheds of the reservoir had a stronger influence on the aquatic environment of the river reservoir system than that from the larger tributary watersheds in addition the annual mean contributions of the p inputs from the three rivers the yangtze river the jialingjiang river and the wujiang river and tributary watersheds within the reservoir were 68 76 and 31 18 from 2003 to 2017 respectively the dam altered the composition of the form of p in the river reservoir system and the waterbody close to the dam was identified as the main area containing dissolved p dp enrichment accordingly the risk of eutrophication remains high in head area of the dam due to the relatively high and stable p concentration this study provides critical information for the management of nutrients in a river reservoir system and the prevention of eutrophication of water bodies keywords phosphorus flux retention effects three gorges reservoir region tributary watershed eutrophication 1 introduction the number of large hydroelectric dams worldwide will double after the completion of dams under construction or planned at present especially in developing countries akbarzadeh et al 2019 dam construction to utilize water resources generate clean energy and prevent floods has formed many reservoirs with the characteristics of lakes worldwide hu et al 2020 maavara et al 2015 reservoir impoundment can disrupt the natural river hydrological regime and cause interruption of river connectivity sedimentation and nutrient retention han et al 2018 dam reservoirs act as in stream reactors impeding river flow and increasing residence time thereby providing a suitable environment for biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and leading to variations in nutrient flux and water quality gao et al 2020 maavara et al 2020 wang 2020 however the challenge posed by dam reservoirs is not only that they affect the ecosystems of downstream rivers and marginal seas van meter et al 2017 but also that they can cause nutrient enrichment and subsequent eutrophication of the river reservoir ecosystem wang et al 2019a p is a key limiting nutrient in lake and reservoir systems because of its role in restricting the development of aquatic biomass moges et al 2018 a reservoir becomes a lacustrine system after impoundment which induces thermal stratification and sediment trapping winton et al 2019 accordingly the physical changes within these reservoirs enhance p retention through adsorption and sedimentation lewis et al 2011 liang et al 2020 while the anoxic bottom waters of these reservoirs greatly accelerate the transformation of particulate p pp into dissolved p dp kunz et al 2011 the physical and chemical changes created by the reservoir also cause continuous variations in water quality within the reservoir and downstream tributary streams are conduits from watersheds to the receiving water bodies and are priority points for directing terrestrial nutrient management because they are strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities robertson and saad 2011 representative supervision and management efforts are mainly focused on the largest tributary watersheds around the reservoirs and lakes due to their dominant hydrological loads and their likely transmission large proportions of nutrients corresponding to their high discharge however the plumes from smaller tributaries are much more likely to stay in the littoral zone and increase the possibility of them affecting the water environment of receiving wate bodies mooney et al 2020 in addition smaller tributaries around reservoirs and lakes may import more nutrients than their watershed area and the nutrient composition may also be different from that of larger tributaries due to the discrepancy in watershed land use and attributes bernhardt et al 2005 lottig et al 2011 therefore it is noteworthy that the lack of synchronized monitoring of small and medium sized tributary watersheds has hindered understanding of the role these tributaries play in overall nutrient transmittal and deterioration of water quality yurista et al 2016 marcarelli et al 2019 xue et al 2020 the rise of water level after impoundment causes the variation in geometric characteristics of surrounding watersheds such as area average elevation and slope liu et al 2020a which increases the number of small and medium sized watersheds and affects the anthropogenic activities and thereby the delivery of nutrients the lack of study on the yields of the abundant smaller tributaries brings uncertainty to the nutrient input of lakes and reservoirs and the impact of dam construction wide range and high frequency monitoring is an important method to solve the inadequate understanding of smaller tributaries but it is not easy to implement due to the high cost chen et al 2019 numerous physical based models have been developed for nonpoint source nps prediction at varying scopes and locations due to limited resources but it should be noted that these models require considerable field data for accuracy verification huang et al 2017 karamouz et al 2015 wellen et al 2015 wang et al 2019b the small scale watershed extended method swem combined with a physical based model has been proposed as a remedy for insufficient data on the restriction of regional nutrient research hong et al 2012 the combined monitoring and modelling approach can be used not only for long term planning and management of water quality but also for real time prediction of its variation revealing the different mechanisms and drivers that affect water quality changes goh et al 2017 wang et al 2019c it has been proven to greatly reduce uncertainty and yield high quality results wang et al 2016 meanwhile the trend analysis of water quality also helps to understand the impact of dam construction because of its significance in changing the transportation of river nutrients sun et al 2013 wang 2020 based on the development of these methods a detailed study of p from every tributary watershed will help to improve the understanding the overall role of smaller tributaries around a reservoir as well as develop practical water quality safeguards under the current and foreseeable future dam construction boom in this study we hypothesize that smaller tributary watersheds around a reservoir contribute a large quantity of p to the river reservoir system and that the reservoir p flux is underestimated to test this hypothesis the three gorges reservoir region tgrr was selected as the focus of a detailed investigation a tributary watershed with an area greater and smaller than 1000 km2 is considered to be a larger and smaller tributary watershed respectively the main objectives of this study were 1 to reveal the p load from larger and smaller tributary watersheds within reservoirs after impoundment and 2 to elaborate on the effect of reservoir on p and sediment retention and its influence on water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the tgrr 28 10 32 13 n 105 17 110 11 e is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and has abundant water resources the tgrr contains all of the districts and counties affected by the reservoir impoundment it also contains all the tributary watersheds that flow into the mainstream of the reservoir in this study with a total area of 6 60 104 km2 the length of the mainstream tgrr is approximately 660 km and the water surface area is 1100 km2 when the water level reaches 175 m the tgrr mainly receives inflow from the upper reaches of the yangtze river and the jialingjiang and wujiang rivers which are collectively called the three rivers fig 1 and they account for over 90 of the total inflow han et al 2017 the average precipitation is 1200 mm 80 of which occurs from april to october the zhutuo zt transect of the yangtze river and wusheng ws transect of jialingjiang river represent the inflow stations of the reservoir the qingxichang qxc wanxian wx fengjie fj and badong bd are the monitoring stations from upstream to downstream in the reservoir the yichang yc station is located 37 km downstream of the three gorges dam and represents the outflow of the tgrr this study takes the mainstream of the tgrr as the research object which mainly accepts p from the three rivers as well as from the surrounding tributary watersheds monthly water quality data measured daily flow and sediment data from 2003 to 2017 across the transects and monitoring stations were collected from the yangtze water resources commission the hydrological and water quality monitoring data of typical watersheds within the study area and the point source data were collected by the chongqing and yichang ecological environment monitoring center 2 2 p mass balance in the tgrr in this study the p budget of the tgrr contained four major components the inflow of the three rivers fin the nps p load entering the reservoir with rainfall runoff in the tributary watersheds fnps the outflow of the tgrr fout and the reservoir retention rt the p inflow and outflow of the tgrr was calculated as follows 1 fin out c q where fin out t yr 1 is the p flux of the inflow zt ws and wj and the outflow yc of the tgrr c is the concentration of p mg l 1 and q is the discharge m3 month 1 or m3 yr 1 the p retention was calculated as follows 2 rt fin fnps fout 3 fnps fl fs where fl and fs represent the nps p load from larger and smaller tributary watersheds within the reservoir respectively 2 3 calculation of the p load from larger and smaller tributary watersheds within the tgrr the soil and water assessment tool swat model which was developed by the agriculture research service of the united states department of agriculture was used for simulating the p load from the surrounding smaller and larger tributary watersheds in the swat model the watershed was divided into multiple sub watersheds which were further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus that consist of a unique combination of soil slope land use and land management the simulation process can be further divided into a land surface process and a main channel process runoff sediment and p were calculated for each hru and then routed in stream using the qual2e model teshager et al 2017 the successful operation of the swat model requires the land use type soil type cultivation measures and meteorological database of the study area in this study the dem land use and soil data were obtained from the global digital elevation model dataset landsat 5 tm dataset and the institute of geography chinese academy of sciences respectively the physical and chemical properties of the soil for the soil dataset were mainly derived from the chinese soil database and field surveying the meteorological data collected at fifty weather stations were obtained from the state meteorological data sharing service system the basic information about crop form irrigation social economics the amount and time of fertilization were collected from the statistics yearbook and field investigation in the typical watersheds of the study area the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup developed by the neprash corporation and texas a m university was adopted to calibrate the swat model and obtain parameter groups rostamian et al 2008 the correlation coefficient r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency ens were selected to quantify the goodness of fit between the monitoring data and the simulated data which can be calculated as follows 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 5 e ns 1 i 1 n q sim i q mea i 2 i 1 n q mea i q mea 2 where oi o pi and p are the flow and p load monitoring data the mean value of the flow and p load monitoring data the simulated flow and p load value and the mean value of flow and o load data respectively qmea i is the observation data qsim i is the simulated value qmea is the mean value of the observation data and n is the total number of observations ens 0 5 is recommended as the lower limit evaluation for an acceptable simulation result in this study the 80 surrounding watersheds were divided into larger and smaller tributary watersheds according to whether their areas were larger or smaller than 1000 km2 fig s1 the total area ratio of smaller to larger tributary watersheds was 41 the detailed land use categories are shown in table s1 we introduced the small scale watershed extended method swem for parameter calibration in the tgrr hong et al 2012 this method uses physical based models in some small typical watersheds of the targeted large watersheds and then the parameters of models obtained from those small watersheds are extended to the surrounding area until the whole p flux of the entire study area is acquired the tgrr was divided into four districts for quantitative study which were the yulin xiaojiang daning and xiangxi districts based on the data availability and partition homogeneity we consider topography area size and adequacy of monitoring data to choose four typical small watersheds in the four districts of the tgrr for the swem they were the yulin river xiaojiang river daning river and xiangxi river watershed fig s2 the swat models of these four watersheds were constructed and calibrated to get model representative parameter groups of their respective districts and then the remaining watersheds in the four districts were run using the parameter group of the districts to run the swat model the influence of rural and domestic enterprises were calculated according to the pollution production and discharge coefficient and were added as a point source for the sub watersheds of each typical watershed then the model parameters that were not affected by the point sources were obtained through calibration the swat models of the four watersheds were calibrated at monthly scales the r2 and ens values of the flow fig 2 a c e and g and tp fig 2 b d f and h of the calibrated models were all greater than 0 65 and 0 60 respectively the calibration and validation results were accepted if the r2 values and nse values of flow and tp were greater than 0 5 wang et al 2019d then the extended results of the parameter groups were verified in the adjacent watersheds of each section fig s2 the results showed that the r2 and ens values of the flow in the modao and yandu watersheds were 0 79 and 0 69 and 0 83 and 0 50 fig s3a and c respectively the r2 and ens values of the tp in the tangxi watershed were 0 65 and 0 50 respectively fig s3b the verification results indicated that the parameter groups obtained by the four watersheds could be extended to their respective districts and the calibrated models could be used for the following analysis then the yield and input of the p load from tributary watersheds within the tgrr could be calculated as follows 6 q sub i 1 n q i i 1 n j 1 m a sub i j c sub i j where qsub is the total yield of p qi is the yield from district i asub ij is the area of sub watershed j in district i and csub ij is the load intensity of the p from the corresponding sub watersheds 7 t i 1 n t i i 1 n j 1 m t ij where t is the p load from the tributary watersheds within the tgrr ti is the total p load at the outlet of the watershed in district i and tij is the p load at the outlet of watershed j in part i 2 4 trend analysis methods in order to reveal the impact of the reservoirs on the water quality the time series trend analysis method was used to detect the variation trend in water quality after dam construction a time series regression with autoregressive integrated moving average model arima noise missing values and outlier analysis tramo and signal extraction in the arima time series seats program were used to remove the effects of seasonality and discharge and to decompose the time series the arima is a model that reflects the variation of the sequence by introducing the method of probability analysis when dealing with a time series that does not have a specific change trend these methods were developed by caporello maravall and have been widely used by various institutions such as the us census bureau and eurostat g√≤mez and maravall 1996 tramo is a widely used program for estimating and predicting the nonstationary arima errors of regression models and the missing values of any sequence the seats program was used for estimating the unobserved components in the time series and followed the arima model based method the overall trends and seasonal irregular and cyclical components were estimated and predicted with signal extraction techniques applied to the arima models the seats program revealed most of the unique features of the time series the conventional components trend cycle seasonal and transitory that seats decomposed into a univariate time series model are considered to be the products of the arima process which was driven by a statistically independent white noise process the estimation contained two steps in the first step the time series was preprocessed and decomposed according to the conventional method specifically tramo preprocessed the time series data and then passed the results to seats seats then decomposed the time series into the following two models 8 additive model z tc s ir by tramo seats 9 multiplicative model z tc s ir by tramo seats where z represents the time series tc represents the trend cycle component of a time series s represents the seasonal component and is a cyclical change that occurs repeatedly every year and ir represents irregular components in the second step the hp filter was applied to trend components that were distinct from the trend cycle component 10 the cycle was defined as specific frequency bands in the hp filter the optimal value of the smoothing parameter was determined by the cycle and the smoothing parameter was set to 14 400 for monthly data in accordance with hodrick prescott 1997 10 tc t c by hp filter where t and c represent the trend and cycle components respectively 2 5 data analysis in this study statistical analyses were performed with spss statistical software ibm spss statistics ver 22 0 the time series analysis of water quality was conducted with the eviews software ver 10 display and expression of the research results were performed using origin ver 9 1 3 results 3 1 comparison of the p loads from larger and smaller tributary watersheds within the reservoirs the results of the p load from tributary watersheds within the reservoirs obtained through the swat model are presented in fig 3 the annual tp load from tributary watersheds showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing during the study period and the maximum appeared in 2014 fig 3a this finding can be explained by the fact that precipitation which is the main driving factor of nps was greater than that in other years the annual tp load from larger tributary watersheds was higher than that of smaller tributary watersheds with the values fluctuating between 1 0 104 and 2 1 104 t and 7 8 103 and 1 4 104 t respectively throughout the simulation period the tp loading ratio of smaller and larger tributary watersheds ranged from 0 55 to 0 81 with relatively small fluctuations occurring from 2006 to 2013 the annual inorganic p ip load also showed the same variations as the tp load fig 3b this value ranged from 6 8 103 to 1 5 104 t and from 4 7 103 to 7 3 103 t for larger and smaller tributary watersheds respectively and the ip load ratio was between 0 47 and 0 71 in contrast the annual organic p op load from smaller and larger tributary watersheds showed little difference and presented different trends from those of the tp and ip loads fig 3c the annual op load ratio ranged from 0 73 to 1 06 in terms of the variations on a monthly timescale fig 3d the p load from larger and smaller tributary watersheds ranged from 0 10 103 t to 3 00 103 t and from 0 07 103 t to 2 78 103 t respectively the maximum and minimum p loads appeared in july and december and were affected by the precipitation distribution the average tp yield exhibited wide variation across the study area fig s4 it ranged from 0 03 to 27 43 kg ha 1 and from 0 04 to 29 17 kg ha 1 with the average of 5 87 and 6 74 kg ha 1 in the larger and smaller tributary watersheds respectively the tp yields were significantly related to the distribution of land use types fig s1 the higher yields were mainly distributed in watersheds with dense cropland while lower yields were in areas with forestland in general it is worth noting that smaller tributary watersheds which occupy 29 of the reservoir area contributed 36 45 of the p load to the mainstream of the tgrr and should not be ignored 3 2 p flux and concentration in the inflow and outflow of the tgrr the time series of tp ss flux and discharge along the direction of flow obtained by the observation data and their statistical analysis are shown in fig 4 and table 1 the tp and ss fluxes showed the same variation among these stations which increased from 2003 to 2008 and then decreased thereafter excluding 2006 and 2012 the decline in ss flux from 2013 to 2017 was particularly significant fig 4a and b the tp flux at the inflow zt and mainstream qxc and wx stations were larger than that at the outflow yc station from 2004 to 2013 but the tp flux at the outflow station began to exceed that at the other stations after 2014 fig 4a the average tp fluxes at the zt qxc wx and yc stations were 4 85 2 11 7 01 2 43 5 67 1 88 and 4 59 1 25 104 t yr 1 respectively the mass balance of tp in this study showed that 3 70 2 08 104 t yr 1 of p was retained in the reservoir after passing the dam furthermore the variable quantities of tp from the zt to qxc qxc to wx and wx to yc stations were 0 55 0 42 1 84 0 91 and 1 54 1 04 104 t yr 1 respectively table 1 which were related to the retention of ss and pp along the fluvial direction the ss flux showed a downward trend from the inflow to downstream of the dam excluding the qxc station fig 4b as this station was downstream where the three rivers converge however the tp and ss fluxes from the jialingjiang and wujiang rivers were significantly smaller than those originating in the upper reaches of the yangtze river input into the reservoir table 1 the ss flux at the zt and qxc stations was larger than that at the wx and yc stations and the variable quantities from the zt station to the qxc station from the qxc station to the wx stations and from the wx station to the yc station were 7 11 39 36 52 26 23 98 and 49 97 29 02 mt respectively in contrast the annual discharge fluctuated and increased along the flow direction fig 4c which differed from that of ss and tp in the global aquatic ecosystems over 90 of fluvial p is in the form of pp and sediment is the major carrier of p the fitted curves of the ss flux with the tp flux along the flow direction were plotted to quantify the impact of the ss flux on the tp flux fig 5 a d the results indicated that the ss and tp fluxes are in accordance with a power function relation the correlation between sediment and the tp flux showed a declining trend from inflow to outflow the r2 of the fitted curve between sediment and the tp flux in the inflow r2 0 63 was significantly higher than that in the outflow r2 0 10 with the development of physical and chemical stratification within the reservoirs after impoundment changes in the water quality of the river reservoir system appear to be discrete along the flow direction understanding the variations in water quality is very important for the management of the reservoir and surrounding watersheds the seasonally adjusted series and the trend and cycle components of the tp concentration obtained by tramo seats methods are shown in fig 6 the smooth trend component extracted from the hp filter gave us a clear idea of the evolution of the tp concentration along the fluvial direction of the river reservoir system after dam construction red lines in fig 6 the tp concentrations at these stations changed significantly but presented different trends and the potential inflection points were detected by using the trend components among these stations in the inflow fig 6a there was only one inflection point which was observed at the end of 2011 the tp concentration showed an upward trend before this time but it decreased significantly thereafter the tp concentrations at the qxc and wx stations fig 6b and c within the reservoir showed the same variation and the inflection points were at the end of 2007 and 2012 the tp concentration presented repeated changes that first increased and then decreased however the fluctuation range of the tp concentration at the qxc station fig 6b was larger than that at the wx station this is because qxc is the downstream station of the three rivers confluence and the input of the dp from the wujiang was the main factor affecting the variation in p concentration at the qxc station in terms of the fj and bd stations the tp concentration first decreased then increased and finally remained stable and the inflection points were at the end of 2003 and 2006 fig 6d and e the tp concentration after dam construction presented the same trend as the bd station but its fluctuation range was relatively larger fig 6f 4 discussion 4 1 impact of the p input from surrounding smaller tributary watersheds notwithstanding that rivers play an important role in promoting the eutrophication in reservoirs and lakes most supervision and monitoring work ignores nutrient input from the surrounding small tributaries the tgrr mainly receives p input from three rivers and all tributary watersheds within the reservoir without considering the influence of point source pollution the observation and simulation results revealed that annual contribution rates of p input from three rivers and the surrounding tributary watersheds were 68 76 and 31 18 table 1 the ratio of p from the surrounding tributary watersheds and three rivers ranged from 20 to 96 which indicated that the tributary watersheds were an important source of p to the river reservoir system minor large tributary watersheds input the majority of nutrient into the receiving reservoir but we found that the smaller tributary watersheds also had a key effect the smaller tributary watersheds which account for 29 of the surrounding area contribute 36 45 of the total tp load from the surrounding tributary watersheds to the reservoir the present study about the p load shed new light on the critical role that smaller tributary watersheds have on the nutrient budget and water quality of the tgrr and potentially other large receiving water bodies especially in developing countries where dam construction is booming now and in the foreseeable future there will be approximately 3 700 new dams built in the larger watersheds such as amazon river congo river and yangtze river basins by 2030 maavara et al 2015 latrubesse et al 2017 barbarossa et al 2020 which will increase the area of inland water and lead to the increment of smaller tributary watersheds in the past several decades the total surface area of inland water has increased by 6 672 km2 in china due to dam construction gao et al 2020 the smaller tributary watersheds delivered relatively large amount of nutrients especially disproportionate amount of op fig 3b the reason was that smaller tributaries have shorter flow paths from land to water as well as within the channel leading to more direct impacts of land use on smaller watersheds lottig et al 2011 baker et al 2014 op from fertilization in the farmland was migrated with runoff erosion furthermore the inundation of the lowlands within the reservoir caused the agricultural land to move toward high altitude areas and the slope of the farmland increased wu et al 2009 the nutrient leached from soil or attached to the sediment could easily migrate to reservoir with the rainfall runoff mooney et al 2020 the sediment sourced from the smaller tributary watersheds accounted for 43 7 47 8 of the total sediment within the reservoir and a large quantity of p was input to the mainstream due to the soil erosion caused by rainfall runoff with a short confluence time a fast flow rate and a strong scouring ability pang et al 2018 research in the mississippi atchafalaya river basin also indicated that smaller streams in the central and eastern regions contributed over 50 75 of the stream nutrients to the gulf of mexico alexander et al 2008 hoang et al 2019 revealed that a significant quantity of p was derived from small watersheds in near stream areas where agricultural activities were relatively active along the cannonsville reservoir reducing nutrient inputs to sensitive water bodies remains a pivotal management priority worldwide the relatively high proportion of the input of p from the surrounding tributary watersheds indicated that it is of great significance to control p from the tributary watersheds to protect the aquatic environment of the river reservoir system the control of p was mainly concentrated in large watersheds with agricultural activities kamruzzaman et al 2020 and the amount of p was reduced by implementing bmps in high yield areas bhumika and madan 2020 based on this study controlling the p coming from smaller the tributary watersheds within the reservoirs should be a priority these smaller tributary watersheds are representative of high yield areas within reservoirs compared with those in a certain region it is cost effective to control nps pollution primarily in highly polluted areas smaller tributary watersheds could also be more feasible targets for management measures due to their oversight by fewer landowner and political jurisdictions implementing a plan similar to the sloping land conversion program and the farm to forest program and engineering and non engineering measures together with bmps in the large tributaries should greatly reduce the p load zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the reduction in limited nutrients in smaller tributary watersheds coupled with the destruction of the hydrodynamic conditions required for algae outbreaks bao et al 2015 could effectively prevent and alleviate the eutrophication caused by reservoir storage 4 2 reservoir retention effect dam construction and impoundment not only increases the number of smaller tributary watersheds but also causes the retention and deposition of sediment and nutrients thereby changing the water quality of reservoirs and downstream rivers carles and peuelas 2019 maavara et al 2020 the results of present study indicate that approximately 3 70 104 t of p was retained within the reservoir which accounted for 70 of the input from the three rivers and 42 of the total input table 1 the retention of p in the tgrr was lower than that in dam impounded lake kariba lake diefenbaker and lac d orient of which account for 87 94 and 71 of the total input kunz et al 2011 donald et al 2015 the retention of p by dams remained poorly constrained compared to lakes an average of 12 of the global river tp load was trapped in reservoirs and this proportion will reach 17 in 2030 with the increase of dam construction maavara et al 2015 under the combined effects of the biogeochemical cycle and reservoir retention the nutrient composition in the head area of dams was obviously different form that in the inflow maavara et al 2015 winton et al 2019 the correlation between the sediment and tp flux in the outflow compared to that in the inflow fig 5a and d indicated that sediment deposition resulted in a large amount of pp being deposited into the reservoir therefore the form and composition of tp changed in the reservoir and the proportion of dp increased most of the dp in the water body can be consumed by algae lewis et al 2011 thus the impoundment of reservoirs greatly contributes to the eutrophication of reservoirs and estuaries because of the variations in the form of p and the hydrodynamic conditions the time series analysis results among these stations showed that tp concentration along the river reservoir system presented different trends after dam construction fig s5 which indicated the synthesis results of the upstream surrounding tributary watersheds and biogeochemical reactions inside the reservoir han et al 2018 wang et al 2019c the tp concentration in the inflow showed stable fluctuation and a downward trend after 2006 fig s5a which demonstrated the effectiveness of the chinese government s water and soil conservation policies environmental restoration investments and cascade reservoir interception in the upper reaches of the yangtze river ouyang et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 resulting in a significant reduction of sediment and p input fig 4 a and b soil and water conservation measures in the upper reaches of the yangtze river began in the 1990s and more than 592 large reservoirs were gradually built after the completion of the three gorges reservoir the joint operation of these reservoirs resulted in a significant reduction in p and sediment undershot studies have shown that the sediment into the tgrr from 2003 to 2017 decreased by 56 3 compared to 1991 2002 zhou et al 2017 liu et al 2020b simultaneously the tp concentration in water close to the dam and the outflow remained relatively high and stable after tp concentration in the inflow presented downward trend fig s5 the tp concentration increase in the head area of the dam after 2006 fig s5b could be attributed to the surrounding tributary watersheds inputs as well as the internal release of p from sediment which was a function of the extent to which p retention by dams could offset the anthropogenic p enrichment of rivers maavara et al 2015 wu et al 2020 moreover the death and decomposition of microorganisms could also induce an increase in p in the overlying water gao et al 2020 the discrepancy variation trend of the tp concentration at the monitoring stations indicated the special impact of the surrounding tributary watersheds around the reservoir on the water quality in addition the hydraulic power of low flow plumes from smaller tributaries cannot drive the nutrients to far shore these inflows with high nutrient concentrations will have greater impact on the deterioration and eutrophication of the receiving waterbody allan et al 2013 although the main input from the smaller tributary watersheds was op with low bioavailability the study revealed that more than 30 of op can be converted into bioavailable ip after mineralization and hydrolysis baker et al 2014 the plumes from smaller tributary watersheds were more easily trapped due to the reservoir water level fluctuation and their adverse effects on the reservoir water quality might be magnified gloege et al 2020 variations in the concentration of dissolved nutrients directly respond to the quality of the aquatic environment the results of this study illustrate that the reservoir altered the composition of the form of p and that the proportion of dp increased from the tail area to the head area of the dam where the tp concentration remained high and stable more dp in the water body generates more p available to phytoplankton and increases the risk of eutrophication zhou et al 2017 ding et al 2019 the reduced water flow caused increased sedimentation and water transparency in the reservoir and tributaries after the impoundment the level of p within the reservoir and tributaries then exceeded the international recognized threshold for eutrophication thomann 1987 which implies that there is a risk of algal outbreaks within the reservoirs and tributaries therefore adjusting the hydrodynamic conditions within the reservoirs during bloom prone periods to avoid creating the environment required for algae growth together with reducing nutrients in tributary watersheds may alleviate and eliminate eutrophication 5 conclusion in the present study the results showed that smaller tributary watersheds which account for 29 of the reservoir area transport approximately 36 45 of p and 43 7 47 8 of sediment to the mainstream the annual mean contributions of the p input from the three rivers and tributary watersheds within the reservoir were 68 76 and 31 18 from 2003 to 2017 respectively the results of the tp budget showed that 42 of tp was retained in the reservoir from 2003 to 2017 the time series analysis results of tp demonstrated the retention effect of the reservoir on pp and the influence of the p input from tributary watersheds variation trends of tp concentrations and the correlation of the tp with the sediment of the reservoir imply that the dam has the effect of altering the composition and the form of p in the river reservoir system and that the proportion of dp increases from the tail to the head area of the reservoir with the deposition of pp the proportion of dp increases and the risk of eutrophication in the head area of the reservoir remains high the results of this study indicate that the smaller surrounding tributary watersheds are a main source of nutrients to the reservoirs measures taken to return farmland to forests and grasslands in these watersheds and control projects are more cost effective compared to implementing such changes in larger tributary watersheds within reservoirs after the upstream watershed environment has been improved credit authorship contribution

4353,large landslides are one of the most menacing geological hazards in mountainous regions around the world due to their high speed large scale characteristics up to now the thermo poro mechanical coupling mechanism of catastrophic landslides under initial water saturated conditions has been recognized by many scholars nevertheless most slip zones of landslides are located in both the unsaturated and saturated zones and the unsaturated zone can account for a much larger portion when the groundwater level is relatively low typical examples of this situation include many loess landslides which have occurred in northwestern china in this study a unified quasi two dimensional thermo poro mechanical model was proposed taking into account both the unsaturated and saturated zones in the slip band of landslides and an attempt was made to describe the complete movement process moreover the dongfeng loess landslide was chosen as a case study with an assumed triggering condition and the model was validated by comparison between the simulation results and previous published work a sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the frictional heating mechanism and the presence of a dry air phase in the slip band have clear impacts on the characteristics of the landslide in particular it was found that the soil water characteristic curve and the initial degree of saturation are of significance keywords unsaturated soil landslides thermo poro mechanical model numerical simulation 1 introduction catastrophic landslides have long been significant threats to human safety and infrastructure security due to their high speed and large volume characteristics the chinese loess plateau is one of the most severely affected areas where landslides occur frequently and account for about one third of the total number in china in 2004 2014 zhuang and peng 2014 typical examples include the sale mountain landslide which occurred in 1983 and resulted in the death of 237 people and the destruction of 585 houses kang et al 2018 and the dongfeng landslide which occurred in 2003 which caused the destruction of two roads and damage to approximately 15 acres of farmland long 2008 although the complete physical mechanism of these large landslides is not yet recognized both frictional heating and thermal pressurization have been viewed as the main factors by many authors vardoulakis 2002 rice 2006 veveakis et al 2007 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b segui et al 2020 therefore taking into account the thermal effects may be the key to identifying the dynamic characteristics of high speed landslides and ensuring public safety and infrastructure security based on the mechanism of thermal pressurization and friction softening vardoulakis 2002 first proposed a comprehensive thermo poro mechanical model to study the motion of the vaiont landslide and the model has been substantially developed and validated by many authors goren and aharonov 2007 goren and aharonov 2009 goren et al 2010 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b alonso et al 2016 pinyol et al 2018 veveakis et al 2007 veveakis et al 2010 cecinato et al 2011 cecinato and zervos 2012 these models can be divided into two dominant processes the long term creeping process and the rapid slide process as for the creeping phase veveakis et al 2007 studied the creeping phase of the vaiont landslide and analytical and numerical solutions were put forward to predict the collapse date of the landslide alonso et al 2016 then developed thermo poro mechanical models to investigate catastrophic landslides from creeping characteristics to final failure more recently segui et al 2020 carried out an interesting study on the impacts of the groundwater level variation on the stability of deep seated landslides and two distinct scenarios under similar external conditions were successfully predicted one of which was the vaiont landslide becoming unstable while the other was a prediction of the shuping landslide that it would stay stable as for the rapid slide phase pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b carried out in depth studies on the dynamic model of the vaiont landslide and significant impact factors of catastrophic landslides were analyzed goren et al 2010 later proposed a thermo poro mechanical model considering carbonate decomposition and the extreme long run out distance of the heart mountain slide along a very shallow slope was reproduced in addition cecinato et al 2011 cecinato and zervos 2012 developed a thermomechanical model considering the constitutive assumption of thermoplastic modified cam clay recently zhao et al 2018 2020 put forward a quasi two dimensional thermo poro mechanical model considering landslide morphology and evaporation and the models were validated through the study of the vaiont and qianjiangping landslides the above models assumed that the soil in the slip band was initially water saturated and the dry air in the slip band was not considered nevertheless the in situ slip band of most landslides contains both the unsaturated and saturated zones simultaneously and the unsaturated zone can form a much larger portion when the groundwater level is relatively low many landslides which occurred in the chinese loess plateau are typical examples of this situation in view of this the dongfeng landslide which occurred on 23 july 2003 was chosen as a case study the groundwater level of the cross section of the dongfeng landslide was referred to in the documented literature li et al 2019 and relevant investigations have been carried out by several authors long et al 2007 long 2008 liu 2016 zhang et al 2020 li et al 2019 performed three dimensional numerical simulations of the dongfeng landslide considering entrainment effects and the slide mass was viewed as a continuous fluid however the effect of heat was not taken into account miao et al 2001 developed a spring block slice model to describe the complete movement process of the sale mountain landslide another high speed loess landslide which occurred in northwestern china and yang et al 2015 then generalized the model to three dimensional conditions but the thermal effects and pore pressure in the slip band were not considered in fact few published studies can be found taking into account both the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone of the slip band in this paper a unified thermo poro mechanical model is proposed based on vardoulakis 2000 2002 and zhao s et al 2018 models simultaneously taking into account both the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone in the slip band in the model the slip band above the groundwater level is considered unsaturated and that below the groundwater level is considered saturated the unsaturated zone is described by the thermo poro mechanical model considering the presence of dry air in the slip band while the saturated zone is described by the model under water saturated conditions the dongfeng landslide is chosen as a case study and an attempt is made to describe the complete movement process of the landslide considering the variation of the sliding path and several sensitivity analyses of different conditions are carried out to further investigate the thermo poro mechanical coupling mechanism under unsaturated conditions particularly the roles of the soil water characteristic curve and the initial degree of saturation are discussed in detail 2 computational model for unsaturated soil slope in the proposed model the geometry of the landslide comprises two substructures i the rapidly deforming long slip band which is a thin weak zone embedded in thicker soil and ii the accelerating overburden where elastic deformation can take place as shown in fig 1 the thermo poro mechanical coupling is taken into account inside the slip band which is affected by the motion of the sliding mass due to both frictional heating and friction softening and the coupling in turn also contributes to the motion of the sliding mass meanwhile the landslide is divided into two zones according to the groundwater level one is the unsaturated zone whose slip band is above the groundwater level and the other is the saturated zone whose slip band is below the groundwater level as shown in fig 2 the reason for considering the unsaturated conditions is that the governing equations for the unsaturated zone are different from those for the saturated zone which may produce different results and is closer to reality in order to include both the unsaturated and saturated zones in a unified model and taking the landslide topography into account the spring block slice method miao et al 2001 zhao et al 2018 2020 is employed and the principles of the unified model are elaborated as follows 2 1 interactions between adjacent blocks based on the assumption that only elastic deformation can take place in each block of the sliding mass miao et al 2001 proposed the spring block slice model and the entire movement process of the sale mountain landslide another high speed loess landslide which took place in northern china on 7 march 1983 was modeled recently zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 developed a quasi two dimensional thermo poro mechanical model for high speed landslides based on the spring block slice method and vardoulakis models in this current paper the thermo poro mechanical model is established for each slide block both saturated and unsaturated and the adjacent blocks interact with each other through the interslice force p i as shown in figs 1 3 the symbol x i in fig 2 denotes the horizontal position of the block i and the sliding path is given as the known interpolation function f x it is assumed that p i acts at the midpoint of the block i parallel to the base of the block i and only continuous elastic deformation can occur within each block miao et al 2001 zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 in this paper p i is expressed as 1 p i h i cos Œ± i where Œ± i is the slope angle of the slide surface of the block i obtained by x and f x h i is the horizontal component of p i which can be calculated as 2 h i h i 0 k i 1 s di 1 where the subscript 0 corresponds to the initial state and s di 1 is the elastic deformation of the block i 1 3 s di 1 b i 1 0 b i 1 x i 1 0 x i 0 x i 1 x i b i 1 0 b i 1 are the initial and current widths respectively h i 0 is the initial horizontal component of the interslice force according to p i 0 the determination of p i 0 has been discussed by several authors miao et al 2001 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 and relevant content is discussed in section 5 2 based on the actual case k i 1 is the spring coefficient expressed as miao et al 2001 zhao et al 2018 4 k i 1 e h i 1 b i 1 where e is the deformation modulus of the slide block and h i 1 denotes the average height of the block i 1 2 2 phase diagram of the unsaturated soil in the slip band for the unsaturated soil in the slip band above the groundwater level the various phase contents are determined as follows 5 Œ∏ a n 1 s Œ∏ w n s Œ∏ s 1 n where the total volume of a representative element is set to a unit volume Œ∏ a Œ∏ w and Œ∏ s represent the pore air content pore water content and soil particle content respectively n represents the porosity and s represents the degree of saturation with respect to liquid water 3 dynamic equations of the sliding mass in line with the research done by miao et al 2001 and zhao et al 2018 the dynamic motion of the slide block i can be expressed as 6 m i d v di dt dr i re i where m i and v di are the mass and the velocity of the block i respectively the driving force dr i of block i is 7 dr i w i s i n Œ± i p i 1 c o s Œ± i 1 Œ± i and the resistant force re i is 8 re i p i Œº i w i c o s Œ± i p i 1 s i n Œ± i 1 Œ± i p pormi l i where p pormi denotes the maximum pore pressure in the middle of the slip band i w i is the weight of block i and Œº i is the corresponding friction coefficient in contrast to the previous research the length of the bottom l i of block i is expressed as follows to consider the variation of the topography 9 l i x i 1 x i 1 f x 2 d x in addition according to the assumption that all blocks are continuous during the movement the following equation is established 10 0 t v di d x i 0 x i 1 f x 2 dx 4 governing equations inside and outside the slip band in the quasi two dimensional thermo poro mechanical model developed by zhao et al 2018 the slip band of landslides was considered to be fully water saturated and the variation of the initial effective normal stress was not taken into account in the pore pressure equation for simplicity however the slip band of most landslides contains both the saturated and unsaturated zones and the effective normal stress will gradually increase when the topography flattens out therefore different governing equations are set up to describe the two distinct zones and the variation of the effective stress due to the landslide morphology is also taken into account 4 1 governing equations for mass balance the elementary mass balance equations for the soil skeleton the pore water and the dry pore air under unsaturated conditions are expressed as follows respectively coussy 2004 11 d s d t œÅ s Œ∏ s œÅ s Œ∏ s v s 0 12 d w d t œÅ w Œ∏ w œÅ w Œ∏ w v w 0 13 d a d t œÅ a Œ∏ a œÅ a Œ∏ a v a

relevant parameters are shown in table 1 moreover darcy s law is widely used to describe the flow of liquid fluid and it is applicable to water in the soil within the slip band as well vardoulakis 2002 veveakis et al 2007 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b pinyol et al 2018 for further derivation the relative specific fluxes q w and q a are estimated by the generalized darcy s law 18 q w k r l k Œº

linear vardoulakis 2002 pinyol and alonso 2010b zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 the above boundary conditions are summarized in fig 4 5 case study landslides frequently occur in the chinese loess plateau some of which typically exhibit high speed large volume characteristics several large loess landslides such as the sale mountain landslide and heifangtai landslide have been studied by many authors long et al 2007 long 2008 liu 2016 peng et al 2019 long et al 2007 investigated the mechanical characteristics of the loess in the slip zone of several large loess landslides and ni et al 2010 studied the thermal effects of the sale mountain landslide therefore the principles of the thermo poro mechanical model proposed by many authors vardoulakis 2002 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b pinyol et al 2018 were employed to describe the large loess landslides in addition taking into account the usually low groundwater level of loess landslides in northern china the mechanisms of both frictional heating and thermal pressurization are investigated under unsaturated conditions the dongfeng landslide was chosen as a case study since it is a high speed landslide with a large volume and the groundwater level has been referenced in published work li et al 2019 5 1 a review of the dongfeng landslide the dongfeng landslide occurred in northern china on july 23 2003 the original volume of the landslide was approximately 9 89 10 5 m 3 and the relative height of the pre failure slope was 74 m li et al 2019 based on the geological cross section of the dongfeng landslide from observations by li et al 2019 fig 5 a the simulation geometry is shown in fig 5 b according to field investigations and research by other authors the run out distance is about 380 m and the maximum velocity is estimated to be 11 2 m s li et al 2019 in this study of the dongfeng landslide the dry pore air in the unsaturated slip band is considered neglecting evaporation for simplicity 5 2 parameter determination the basic parameters of the dongfeng landslide are obtained from the investigation of li et al 2019 as listed in table 1 in addition some parameters such as the governing parameters of the hydraulic conductivity and the residual frictional coefficient are determined based on the research of unsaturated loess of documented references as follows in the model proposed in this paper the well known vg m model van genuchten 1980 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 is employed to describe the relative permeability k r l and the relative pneumatic permeability k r g of the unsaturated loess 42 k r l s e l Œ≥ 1 1 s e l 1 m m 2 43 k r g 1 s e l Œ≥ 1 s e l 1 m 2 m 44 s e l s s r l 1 s r l 1 1 Œ± s n m where s e l s s r l and s are the effective water saturation water

the type of soil is consistent and the laboratory experiment conditions œÅ d 1 50 g cm 3 e 0 0 80 are similar to those of the dongfeng loess landslide œÅ d 1 52 g cm 3 e 0 0 79 the hydraulic conductivity of loess under water saturated conditions k ws is set to 3 624 10 7 m s according to wang et al 2020 and the pneumatic conductivity under fully dry conditions k as is expressed as 45 k as k ws Œº w Œº a where the dynamic viscosity coefficients of liquid water Œº w and of dry air Œº a are expressed by the empirical equations which have been employed to carry out simulations of the

soils and it is assumed that they are also suitable for loess in addition the coefficient of the reduced suction œá can be expressed as nuth and laloui 2008 48 œá s equation 48 is adopted since no documented literature can be found where the parameter œá of loess can be determined more rigorously meanwhile according to nuth s arguments this expression can be valid when the degree of water saturation is within a certain range i e 20 80 which is consistent with our results in addition other complex expressions will not promote further understanding of the mechanism in the proposed model and thus we adopt equation 48 as a first approximation to further study the mechanism the slip band thickness is estimated by d 200 d 50 vardoulakis 2002 and d 50 is determined as 0 0105 mm according to the study of the loess characteristics in the slip band of the dongfeng landslide by long et al 2007 furthermore the starting condition of the landslide is mainly discussed below according to miao et al 2001 and zhao et al 2018 the initial interslice force can be obtained by assuming the values of fs or friction angle until p n equals zero in the model proposed in this paper we may assume the values of the friction angle of the unsaturated and saturated zones respectively based on documented literature and finally satisfy p n 0 the friction angle of intact loess of the dongfeng landslide is about 27 4 31 long 2008 liu 2016 li et al 2019 and that of corresponding saturated loess is about 21 1 21 3 long 2008 liu 2016 in view of this the peak friction angle of the saturated zone œÜ ps is set to 21 3 and that of the unsaturated zone œÜ p is set to 28 07 and the residual friction angle œÜ r is 8 2 based on laboratory experiments long 2008 other than reducing œÜ ps or œÜ p by 0 1 directly we only reduce the friction angle of the nearest block of the upper part of the saturated zone i e block 12 in this case by 0 1 in order to reflect the effect of the slight variation of groundwater level on the loess characteristic in relevant areas since loess is very sensitive to the water level moreover several sensitivity analyses are carried out based on the different conditions which are listed in table 2 5 3 numerical results the simulations mainly consist of two parts the results of the dongfeng landslide and the sensitivity analysis of dominant factors which are shown below fig 6 a b show the various velocities of the representative blocks of the dongfeng landslide and their corresponding horizontal positions respectively the simulation runs for 30 s when the velocity of each slide block eventually reaches 0 which is similar to the termination time 28 s of the model proposed by li et al 2019 as shown in the figure the velocity of the tail of the landslide is slightly greater than that of the front edge in the initial stage but the front moves faster in the deceleration phase the reason is that the slope angle of the tail is larger which will result in a higher velocity and this distribution trend is consistent with the research done by zhao et al 2018 however as the sliding process progresses the slope angle gradually decreases and the front edge will not stop moving until the velocities of all other blocks reach zero fig 7 a b show the comparisons of the results between the proposed model and li et al 2019 the maximum velocity and the front position were selected since they are of significance to investigate a landslide as shown in fig 7 a the maximum initial acceleration of li s model is about 4 5 m s2 which leads to a much higher velocity in the initial stage while that of the proposed model is only about 0 0038 m s2 appearing at block 12 where a slight disturbance to the equilibrium state is taken into account and other blocks initial accelerations are almost 0 m s2 in the middle stage however the maximum velocity of the proposed model becomes higher due to both thermal pressurization and friction softening mechanisms which were not considered in li s model and the maximum velocity 12 8 m s is similar to li et al 2019 11 2 m s in the later stage the entrainment effect in li s model results in a higher velocity and a longer deceleration period as shown in fig 7 b the final horizontal position of the front edge is about 310 m according to the proposed model which is less than 380 m based on the field observation while the result of li s model is about 370 m the difference may be because the entrainment is not taken into account in our model in the deceleration stage which would result in a greater slide distance as discussed by li et al 2019 and liu et al 2020 figs 8 and 9 respectively show the evolution of the maximum temperature and the excess pore pressure the differences between the unsaturated and saturated zones can be clearly seen due to the relatively low specific heat in the slip band with the presence of dry air and the relatively larger volume of the unsaturated blocks most variables of those blocks are greater than those of the saturated blocks note that the temperature and the excess pore pressure of block 1 are distinctly small since the volume is small and the initial effective stress is nearly zero resulting in poor heat generation and thus low excess pore pressure this can be reasonably explained due to the tensile cracks of the tail of the slide mass based on field observations li et al 2019 fig 10 shows the sensitivity of the variables to different water saturated hydraulic conductivities k ws in this paper k ws m s is selected for sensitivity analysis instead of the intrinsic permeability k m2 since they are linked through equation 18 and k ws can be easier to measure and obtain in many cases the variations of k as are not considered independently since k as can be derived from k ws Œº w and Œº a though the differences in the values of the results are not very significant we can still observe that the lower intrinsic permeability will result in a higher velocity lower temperature and greater excess pore pressure which is consistent with previous studies goren and aharonov 2009 pinyol and alonso 2010b cecinato and zervos 2012 it is worth noting that in our study the landslide can develop to be catastrophic even under high intrinsic permeability conditions the reason is probably that friction softening contributes significantly to the velocity and makes the landslide reach a high speed even under low thermal pressurization conditions furthermore the hydraulic conductivity will still be low due to the presence of the dry air in the slip band for example when k ws 3 624 10 6 m s the hydraulic conductivity is about k w 2 10 9 m s which is still quite low nevertheless the final outcome is mainly controlled by the soil water characteristic curve swcc and the initial degree of saturation which will be discussed later the pneumatic conductivity k a is several orders of magnitude larger than k w and thus the excess pore air pressure dissipates more quickly figs 11 13 show the different hypothetical scenarios of no heat generation no dry air in the whole slip band i e fully water saturated no liquid water in the whole slip band i e fully dry and no heat conduction inside and outside the slip band respectively the peak friction angles of the fully saturated and fully dry conditions are set to 24 32 and 28 43 to meet the initial limit equilibrium conditions respectively the results of the original model and the saturated model clearly demonstrate that the unsaturated condition will lead to increases in the excess pore pressure the temperature and the velocity the maximum temperature is about 35 degrees greater than that in the saturated model and the excess pore pressure is more than twice the latter and it will dissipate more slowly due to the much lower hydraulic conductivity caused by the dry air phase moreover the fully dry condition in the slip band will result in a higher temperature due to the relatively lower specific heat but the excess pore pressure is smaller since the pneumatic conductivity is relatively high the high velocity occurs in the fully dry condition because when the friction softening is considered the landslide is easier to trigger and then the initial pore pressure will affect the velocity which is assumed to be p a t m a higher value than the initial pore water pressures due to the low groundwater level and thus reducing the effective normal stress and increasing the velocity adiabatic conditions can produce both higher temperature and greater excess pore pressure but the effect on the velocity is minimal as pointed out by pinyol and alonso 2010b and goren and aharonov 2009 it is worth noting that if heat generation and thus excess pore pressure are not taken into account in this model it seems that the landslide will be hard to initiate under the triggering condition assumed in this paper at least the velocity could be ignored in the first 30 s fig 14 shows the distribution of the velocity the maximum temperature and excess pore pressure along the sliding surface of the dongfeng landslide at 6 5 s after being triggered and the differences between the unsaturated and saturated zones can be seen clearly this time window is selected since the entrainment effects are minor according to li et al 2019 although the proposed model is different from li et al 2019 the maximum velocity and the displacement are similar and the overall trend is consistent with the simulation by zhao et al 2018 where the quasi two dimensional thermo poro mechanical model was studied one notable phenomenon is that the maximum excess pore pressure and the maximum temperature appear at different positions this is because the velocity of block 3 is higher and thus the initial effective stress increases faster due to the variation of the sliding morphology which will result in a higher excess pore pressure which was not considered in the previous studies fig 15 a and b show the comparisons of the velocity the maximum temperature and excess pore pressure along the sliding surface between the proposed model and zhao et al s saturated model 2018 at t 6 5 s and t 20 0 s respectively all these key variables in the proposed model are generally higher than those in the saturated model and the displacement at t 20 0 s in the proposed model is approximately 11 m farther than that under fully saturated conditions it is worth noting that the variation of the initial effective stress due to the changes of topography was not taken into account in zhao et al s model and thus the excess pore pressures are much lower than those of the proposed model due to the high hydraulic conductivity of the loess and the position where the maximum excess pore pressure takes place is also different 5 4 discussions 5 4 1 thermal pressurization under unsaturated conditions the mechanism of thermal pressurization is considered under unsaturated conditions in order to more realistically model many landslides in which both saturated and unsaturated zones of the slip band exist simultaneously as shown in fig 9 and fig 13 although the magnitude of thermal pressurization is not high in this case the landslide may not even initiate when the thermal effects are not taken into account under the initial conditions assumed in this research since the initial reduction of the friction angle can be rapidly counterbalanced by the flattening morphological characteristics in addition although the maximum temperature is relatively high fig 8 and evaporation may take place its effect on the velocity is not significant which results in a 4 3 increase of the velocity in the case of the vaiont landslide according to zhao et al 2020 therefore evaporation is neglected in this paper for simplicity but could be further investigated in the future the model proposed in this study can also be used to investigate other landslides when the groundwater level and the sliding path can be estimated 5 4 2 the significance of considering unsaturated conditions although there are some differences between the proposed model and the fully saturated model the final velocity does not seem to be significantly affected as shown in fig 13 the reason is that friction softening is taken into account which contributes significantly to the acceleration and the thermal pressurization is not very evident in this case in fact friction softening was not considered in many studies goren and aharonov 2009 goren et al 2010 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b where the mechanism of thermal pressurization alone can also successfully account for the catastrophic failure of large landslides in view of this further studies under no friction softening and higher thermal pressurization coefficient conditions are carried out here because of the lack of experimental data the thermal pressurization coefficient relative to the pore water is set to about 0 0631 mpa corresponding to Œ≤c 0 006 based on the studies by vardoulakis 2002 and veveakis et al 2007 where it was 0 06 0 07 mpa for clay while in the above simulation the value is about 0 0014 mpa in fig 16 it is demonstrated that the parameter n of the soil water characteristic curve swcc as well as the initial degree of saturation s 0 have significant influences on the velocity of the landslide and can lead to substantial differences between the proposed model and the fully saturated model fig 16 a b c and d show that the smaller parameter n and s 0 are more dangerous conditions which can still predict a catastrophic disaster under high intrinsic permeability conditions while the landslide will not even trigger according to the fully saturated model the reason is that the lower parameter n or s 0 allows a higher variation of suction and the excess pore water pressure can increase much more than the excess pore air pressure since the presence of dry air reduces the hydraulic conductivity significantly while the excess pore water pressure will not reach a high value due to the characteristics of swcc when parameter n and s 0 are high that is if p w increases due to the low hydraulic conductivity the suction will decrease and then the degree of saturation increases more quickly resulting in a reduction in p w and an increase in p a preventing further pressurization fig 16 e and f depict the relationship between the velocity and s 0 and the dash lines suggest a potential trend when s 0 is very high which may be inappropriate under the unsaturated soil framework utilized in this paper the growth of the velocity at the end of the curve in fig 16 f is probably due to the distinct decrease in the pneumatic conductivity and both p w and p a can reach a high value without too much change in the suction it is worth noting that chen et al 2017 found parameter n 1 176 and wang et al 2020 suggested parameter n 1 225 1 310 for loess while the initial degree of saturation of intact loess was measured as 36 8 by wang et al 2020 and some samples of the dongfeng landslide reached a lower value of 34 9 long 2008 all seem to be more dangerous conditions than the original case therefore considering the unsaturated conditions in such cases which may be encountered in natural landslides is of significance since the fully saturated model fails to predict the catastrophic landslide while the proposed model is still valid it is worth noting that the saturated model is not the same as the saturated landslides since the initial limit equilibrium state conditions of the model are assumed which may have already been broken during the process from unsaturated to saturated conditions but this initial limit equilibrium state is still needed in the previous saturated models therefore the above conclusion accounts for the significance and advantage of the proposed model compared to the previous fully saturated models and it does not mean the unsaturated landslides are more likely to fail than the saturated landslides 5 4 3 investigation of different conditions the intrinsic permeability in the slip band has been viewed as a significant factor by many authors goren and aharonov 2007 goren and aharonov 2009 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b cecinato and zervos 2012 segui et al 2020 in this paper various intrinsic permeability conditions are simulated where the intrinsic permeability is substituted by the water saturated hydraulic conductivity k ws as discussed after fig 10 and the results are shown in fig 10 and fig 16 both unsaturated and saturated in line with the previous studies the lower intrinsic permeability will lead to a higher speed due to the poor dissipation of the excess pore pressures meanwhile less dissipation will result in higher excess pore pressures and smaller effective stress and thus the temperature will be lower if the landslide is triggered furthermore as shown in figs 11 13 although the hydraulic conductivity under fully water saturated conditions or the pneumatic conductivity under fully dry conditions is relatively high the excess pore pressure is enough to trigger the landslide movement when friction softening is taken into account this suggests that the thermal pressurization can contribute to the high speed movement of the landslide under unsaturated conditions and friction softening is also of significance since the speed can still reach a high value even though the excess pore pressure is not very large 6 conclusions in this paper a unified thermo poro mechanical model taking into account both the unsaturated and saturated zones in the slip band of large landslides is proposed in order to simultaneously consider the topography of landslides and the two zones separated by the groundwater level a quasi two dimensional dynamic model is developed based on the spring block method the dongfeng loess landslide which occurred in northwestern china and which typically presents high speed and large volume characteristics is chosen as a case study due to its relatively low groundwater level and its large unsaturated zone the model is then validated by comparisons between the simulation results and previous published work and after investigations of various conditions the following conclusions can be drawn both thermal pressurization and friction softening can be important mechanisms under unsaturated conditions when dry air in the slip band is considered the hydraulic conductivity can be much lower resulting in a higher excess pore water pressure than the excess pore air pressure the excess pore pressures contribute to the decrease of the effective stress and thus will lead to fast motion it is also found that if thermal effects are not taken into account the landslide may be hard to trigger according to the assumption of initial reduction of the friction angle near the upper band of the saturated zone the unsaturated zone can present clearly higher temperatures excess pore pressure and velocity compared to the saturated zone due to the presence of the dry air and the effects of block volume and slope angle it is also demonstrated that the swcc as well as the initial degree of saturation of the unsaturated soil deserve special attention since they can lead to distinctly different results a lower swcc parameter n and lower initial degree of saturation s 0 are more dangerous especially under high intrinsic permeability conditions where the fully saturated model fails to predict the disaster and the landslide can still reach a high speed in a few seconds according to the proposed model in contrast higher parameter n and intermediate s 0 values are safer and the prediction results from a fully saturated model are probably conservative to some degree thus taking into account natural unsaturated conditions in a catastrophic landslide can be closer to reality and is of significance in some cases which may be encountered in nature the problem to be addressed in the future is the determination of some basic parameters including the energy conversion coefficient e and the effective stress parameter œá which may have an important impact on the predicted results although there are some simplifications in the proposed model it can be used to study the mechanism of high speed large landslides closer to natural conditions and at least as a post

4353,large landslides are one of the most menacing geological hazards in mountainous regions around the world due to their high speed large scale characteristics up to now the thermo poro mechanical coupling mechanism of catastrophic landslides under initial water saturated conditions has been recognized by many scholars nevertheless most slip zones of landslides are located in both the unsaturated and saturated zones and the unsaturated zone can account for a much larger portion when the groundwater level is relatively low typical examples of this situation include many loess landslides which have occurred in northwestern china in this study a unified quasi two dimensional thermo poro mechanical model was proposed taking into account both the unsaturated and saturated zones in the slip band of landslides and an attempt was made to describe the complete movement process moreover the dongfeng loess landslide was chosen as a case study with an assumed triggering condition and the model was validated by comparison between the simulation results and previous published work a sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the frictional heating mechanism and the presence of a dry air phase in the slip band have clear impacts on the characteristics of the landslide in particular it was found that the soil water characteristic curve and the initial degree of saturation are of significance keywords unsaturated soil landslides thermo poro mechanical model numerical simulation 1 introduction catastrophic landslides have long been significant threats to human safety and infrastructure security due to their high speed and large volume characteristics the chinese loess plateau is one of the most severely affected areas where landslides occur frequently and account for about one third of the total number in china in 2004 2014 zhuang and peng 2014 typical examples include the sale mountain landslide which occurred in 1983 and resulted in the death of 237 people and the destruction of 585 houses kang et al 2018 and the dongfeng landslide which occurred in 2003 which caused the destruction of two roads and damage to approximately 15 acres of farmland long 2008 although the complete physical mechanism of these large landslides is not yet recognized both frictional heating and thermal pressurization have been viewed as the main factors by many authors vardoulakis 2002 rice 2006 veveakis et al 2007 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b segui et al 2020 therefore taking into account the thermal effects may be the key to identifying the dynamic characteristics of high speed landslides and ensuring public safety and infrastructure security based on the mechanism of thermal pressurization and friction softening vardoulakis 2002 first proposed a comprehensive thermo poro mechanical model to study the motion of the vaiont landslide and the model has been substantially developed and validated by many authors goren and aharonov 2007 goren and aharonov 2009 goren et al 2010 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b alonso et al 2016 pinyol et al 2018 veveakis et al 2007 veveakis et al 2010 cecinato et al 2011 cecinato and zervos 2012 these models can be divided into two dominant processes the long term creeping process and the rapid slide process as for the creeping phase veveakis et al 2007 studied the creeping phase of the vaiont landslide and analytical and numerical solutions were put forward to predict the collapse date of the landslide alonso et al 2016 then developed thermo poro mechanical models to investigate catastrophic landslides from creeping characteristics to final failure more recently segui et al 2020 carried out an interesting study on the impacts of the groundwater level variation on the stability of deep seated landslides and two distinct scenarios under similar external conditions were successfully predicted one of which was the vaiont landslide becoming unstable while the other was a prediction of the shuping landslide that it would stay stable as for the rapid slide phase pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b carried out in depth studies on the dynamic model of the vaiont landslide and significant impact factors of catastrophic landslides were analyzed goren et al 2010 later proposed a thermo poro mechanical model considering carbonate decomposition and the extreme long run out distance of the heart mountain slide along a very shallow slope was reproduced in addition cecinato et al 2011 cecinato and zervos 2012 developed a thermomechanical model considering the constitutive assumption of thermoplastic modified cam clay recently zhao et al 2018 2020 put forward a quasi two dimensional thermo poro mechanical model considering landslide morphology and evaporation and the models were validated through the study of the vaiont and qianjiangping landslides the above models assumed that the soil in the slip band was initially water saturated and the dry air in the slip band was not considered nevertheless the in situ slip band of most landslides contains both the unsaturated and saturated zones simultaneously and the unsaturated zone can form a much larger portion when the groundwater level is relatively low many landslides which occurred in the chinese loess plateau are typical examples of this situation in view of this the dongfeng landslide which occurred on 23 july 2003 was chosen as a case study the groundwater level of the cross section of the dongfeng landslide was referred to in the documented literature li et al 2019 and relevant investigations have been carried out by several authors long et al 2007 long 2008 liu 2016 zhang et al 2020 li et al 2019 performed three dimensional numerical simulations of the dongfeng landslide considering entrainment effects and the slide mass was viewed as a continuous fluid however the effect of heat was not taken into account miao et al 2001 developed a spring block slice model to describe the complete movement process of the sale mountain landslide another high speed loess landslide which occurred in northwestern china and yang et al 2015 then generalized the model to three dimensional conditions but the thermal effects and pore pressure in the slip band were not considered in fact few published studies can be found taking into account both the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone of the slip band in this paper a unified thermo poro mechanical model is proposed based on vardoulakis 2000 2002 and zhao s et al 2018 models simultaneously taking into account both the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone in the slip band in the model the slip band above the groundwater level is considered unsaturated and that below the groundwater level is considered saturated the unsaturated zone is described by the thermo poro mechanical model considering the presence of dry air in the slip band while the saturated zone is described by the model under water saturated conditions the dongfeng landslide is chosen as a case study and an attempt is made to describe the complete movement process of the landslide considering the variation of the sliding path and several sensitivity analyses of different conditions are carried out to further investigate the thermo poro mechanical coupling mechanism under unsaturated conditions particularly the roles of the soil water characteristic curve and the initial degree of saturation are discussed in detail 2 computational model for unsaturated soil slope in the proposed model the geometry of the landslide comprises two substructures i the rapidly deforming long slip band which is a thin weak zone embedded in thicker soil and ii the accelerating overburden where elastic deformation can take place as shown in fig 1 the thermo poro mechanical coupling is taken into account inside the slip band which is affected by the motion of the sliding mass due to both frictional heating and friction softening and the coupling in turn also contributes to the motion of the sliding mass meanwhile the landslide is divided into two zones according to the groundwater level one is the unsaturated zone whose slip band is above the groundwater level and the other is the saturated zone whose slip band is below the groundwater level as shown in fig 2 the reason for considering the unsaturated conditions is that the governing equations for the unsaturated zone are different from those for the saturated zone which may produce different results and is closer to reality in order to include both the unsaturated and saturated zones in a unified model and taking the landslide topography into account the spring block slice method miao et al 2001 zhao et al 2018 2020 is employed and the principles of the unified model are elaborated as follows 2 1 interactions between adjacent blocks based on the assumption that only elastic deformation can take place in each block of the sliding mass miao et al 2001 proposed the spring block slice model and the entire movement process of the sale mountain landslide another high speed loess landslide which took place in northern china on 7 march 1983 was modeled recently zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 developed a quasi two dimensional thermo poro mechanical model for high speed landslides based on the spring block slice method and vardoulakis models in this current paper the thermo poro mechanical model is established for each slide block both saturated and unsaturated and the adjacent blocks interact with each other through the interslice force p i as shown in figs 1 3 the symbol x i in fig 2 denotes the horizontal position of the block i and the sliding path is given as the known interpolation function f x it is assumed that p i acts at the midpoint of the block i parallel to the base of the block i and only continuous elastic deformation can occur within each block miao et al 2001 zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 in this paper p i is expressed as 1 p i h i cos Œ± i where Œ± i is the slope angle of the slide surface of the block i obtained by x and f x h i is the horizontal component of p i which can be calculated as 2 h i h i 0 k i 1 s di 1 where the subscript 0 corresponds to the initial state and s di 1 is the elastic deformation of the block i 1 3 s di 1 b i 1 0 b i 1 x i 1 0 x i 0 x i 1 x i b i 1 0 b i 1 are the initial and current widths respectively h i 0 is the initial horizontal component of the interslice force according to p i 0 the determination of p i 0 has been discussed by several authors miao et al 2001 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 and relevant content is discussed in section 5 2 based on the actual case k i 1 is the spring coefficient expressed as miao et al 2001 zhao et al 2018 4 k i 1 e h i 1 b i 1 where e is the deformation modulus of the slide block and h i 1 denotes the average height of the block i 1 2 2 phase diagram of the unsaturated soil in the slip band for the unsaturated soil in the slip band above the

represent the pore air content pore water content and soil particle content respectively n represents the porosity and s represents the degree of saturation with respect to liquid water 3 dynamic equations of the sliding mass in line with the research done by miao et al 2001 and zhao et al 2018 the dynamic motion of the slide block i can be expressed as 6 m i d v di dt dr i re i where m i and v di are the mass and the velocity of the block i respectively the driving force dr i of block i is 7 dr i w i s i n Œ± i p i 1 c o s Œ± i 1 Œ± i and the resistant force re i is 8 re i p i Œº i w i c

coefficient in contrast to the previous research the length of the bottom l i of block i is expressed as follows to consider the variation of the topography 9 l i x i 1 x i 1 f x 2 d x in addition according to the assumption that all blocks are continuous during the movement the following equation is established 10 0 t v di d x i 0 x i 1 f x 2 dx 4 governing equations inside and outside the slip band in the quasi two dimensional thermo poro mechanical model developed by zhao et al 2018 the slip band of landslides was considered to be fully water saturated and the variation of the initial effective normal stress was not taken into account in the pore pressure equation for simplicity however the slip band of most landslides contains both the saturated and unsaturated zones and the effective normal stress will gradually increase when the topography flattens out therefore different governing equations are set up to describe the two distinct zones and the variation of the effective stress due to the landslide morphology is also taken into account 4 1 governing equations for mass balance the elementary mass balance equations for the soil skeleton the pore water and the dry pore air under unsaturated conditions are expressed as follows respectively coussy 2004 11 d s d t œÅ s Œ∏ s œÅ s Œ∏ s v s 0 12 d w d t œÅ w Œ∏ w œÅ w Œ∏ w v w 0 13 d a d t œÅ a Œ∏ a œÅ a Œ∏ a v a

relevant parameters are shown in table 1 moreover darcy s law is widely used to describe the flow of liquid fluid and it is applicable to water in the soil within the slip band as well vardoulakis 2002 veveakis et al 2007 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b pinyol et al 2018 for further derivation the relative specific fluxes q w and q a are estimated by the generalized darcy s law 18 q w k r l k Œº

linear vardoulakis 2002 pinyol and alonso 2010b zhao et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 the above boundary conditions are summarized in fig 4 5 case study landslides frequently occur in the chinese loess plateau some of which typically exhibit high speed large volume characteristics several large loess landslides such as the sale mountain landslide and heifangtai landslide have been studied by many authors long et al 2007 long 2008 liu 2016 peng et al 2019 long et al 2007 investigated the mechanical characteristics of the loess in the slip zone of several large loess landslides and ni et al 2010 studied the thermal effects of the sale mountain landslide therefore the principles of the thermo poro mechanical model proposed by many authors vardoulakis 2002 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b pinyol et al 2018 were employed to describe the large loess landslides in addition taking into account the usually low groundwater level of loess landslides in northern china the mechanisms of both frictional heating and thermal pressurization are investigated under unsaturated conditions the dongfeng landslide was chosen as a case study since it is a high speed landslide with a large volume and the groundwater level has been referenced in published work li et al 2019 5 1 a review of the dongfeng landslide the dongfeng landslide occurred in northern china on july 23 2003 the original volume of the landslide was approximately 9 89 10 5 m 3 and the relative height of the pre failure slope was 74 m li et al 2019 based on the geological cross section of the dongfeng landslide from observations by li et al 2019 fig 5 a the simulation geometry is shown in fig 5 b according to field investigations and research by other authors the run out distance is about 380 m and the maximum velocity is estimated to be 11 2 m s li et al 2019 in this study of the dongfeng landslide the dry pore air in the unsaturated slip band is considered neglecting evaporation for simplicity 5 2 parameter determination the basic parameters of the dongfeng landslide are obtained from the investigation of li et al 2019 as listed in table 1 in addition some parameters such as the governing parameters of the hydraulic conductivity and the residual frictional coefficient are determined based on the research of unsaturated loess of documented references as follows in the model proposed in this paper the well known vg m model van genuchten 1980 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 is employed to describe the relative permeability k r l and the relative pneumatic permeability k r g of the unsaturated loess 42 k r l s e l Œ≥ 1 1 s e l 1 m m 2 43 k r g 1 s e l Œ≥ 1 s e l 1 m 2 m 44 s e l s s r l 1 s r l 1 1 Œ± s n m where s e l s s r l and s are the effective water saturation water

the type of soil is consistent and the laboratory experiment conditions œÅ d 1 50 g cm 3 e 0 0 80 are similar to those of the dongfeng loess landslide œÅ d 1 52 g cm 3 e 0 0 79 the hydraulic conductivity of loess under water saturated conditions k ws is set to 3 624 10 7 m s according to wang et al 2020 and the pneumatic conductivity under fully dry conditions k as is expressed as 45 k as k ws Œº w Œº a where the dynamic viscosity coefficients of liquid water Œº w and of dry air Œº a are expressed by the empirical equations which have been employed to carry out simulations of the consolidation of unsaturated soils abed and solowski 2017 46 Œº w 243 18 10 7 10 247 8 t 133 15 47 Œº a 1 48 10 6 t 273 15 1 119 t 273 15 note that equations 46 and 47 are not dependent on the type of soils and it is assumed that they are also suitable for loess in addition the coefficient of the reduced suction œá can be expressed as nuth and laloui 2008 48 œá s equation 48 is adopted since no documented literature can be found where the parameter œá of loess can be determined more rigorously meanwhile according to nuth s arguments this expression can be valid when the degree of water saturation is within a certain range i e 20 80 which is consistent with our results in addition other complex expressions will not promote further understanding of the mechanism in the proposed model and thus we adopt equation 48 as a first approximation to further study the mechanism the slip band thickness is estimated by d 200 d 50 vardoulakis 2002 and d 50 is determined as 0 0105 mm according to the study of the loess characteristics in the slip band of the dongfeng landslide by long et al 2007 furthermore the starting condition of the landslide is mainly discussed below according to miao et al 2001 and zhao et al 2018 the initial interslice force can be obtained by assuming the values of fs or friction angle until p n equals zero in the model proposed in this paper we may assume the values of the friction angle of the unsaturated and saturated zones respectively based on documented literature and finally satisfy p n 0 the friction angle of intact loess of the dongfeng landslide is about 27 4 31 long 2008 liu 2016 li et al 2019 and that of corresponding saturated loess is about 21 1 21 3 long 2008 liu 2016 in view of this the peak friction angle of the saturated zone œÜ ps is set to 21 3 and that of the unsaturated zone œÜ p is set to 28 07 and the residual friction angle œÜ r is 8 2 based on laboratory experiments long 2008 other than reducing œÜ ps or œÜ p by 0 1 directly we only reduce the friction angle of the nearest block of the upper part of the saturated zone i e block 12 in this case by 0 1 in order to reflect the effect of the slight variation of groundwater level on the loess characteristic in relevant areas since loess is very sensitive to the water level moreover several sensitivity analyses are carried out based on the different conditions which are listed in table 2 5 3 numerical results the simulations mainly consist of two parts the results of the dongfeng landslide and the sensitivity analysis of dominant factors which are shown below fig 6 a b show the various velocities of the representative blocks of the dongfeng landslide and their corresponding horizontal positions respectively the simulation runs for 30 s when the velocity of each slide block eventually reaches 0 which is similar to the termination time 28 s of the model proposed by li et al 2019 as shown in the figure the velocity of the tail of the landslide is slightly greater than that of the front edge in the initial stage but the front moves faster in the deceleration phase the reason is that the slope angle of the tail is larger which will result in a higher velocity and this distribution trend is consistent with the research done by zhao et al 2018 however as the sliding process progresses the slope angle gradually decreases and the front edge will not stop moving until the velocities of all other blocks reach zero fig 7 a b show the comparisons of the results between the proposed model and li et al 2019 the maximum velocity and the front position were selected since they are of significance to investigate a landslide as shown in fig 7 a the maximum initial acceleration of li s model is about 4 5 m s2 which leads to a much higher velocity in the initial stage while that of the proposed model is only about 0 0038 m s2 appearing at block 12 where a slight disturbance to the equilibrium state is taken into account and other blocks initial accelerations are almost 0 m s2 in the middle stage however the maximum velocity of the proposed model becomes higher due to both thermal pressurization and friction softening mechanisms which were not considered in li s model and the maximum velocity 12 8 m s is similar to li et al 2019 11 2 m s in the later stage the entrainment effect in li s model results in a higher velocity and a longer deceleration period as shown in fig 7 b the final horizontal position of the front edge is about 310 m according to the proposed model which is less than 380 m based on the field observation while the result of li s model is about 370 m the difference may be because the entrainment is not taken into account in our model in the deceleration stage which would result in a greater slide distance as discussed by li et al 2019 and liu et al 2020 figs 8 and 9 respectively show the evolution of the maximum temperature and the excess pore pressure the differences between the unsaturated and saturated zones can be clearly seen due to the relatively low specific heat in the slip band with the presence of dry air and the relatively larger volume of the unsaturated blocks most variables of those blocks are greater than those of the saturated blocks note that the temperature and the excess pore pressure of block 1 are distinctly small since the volume is small and the initial effective stress is nearly zero resulting in poor heat generation and thus low excess pore pressure this can be reasonably explained due to the tensile cracks of the tail of the slide mass based on field observations li et al 2019 fig 10 shows the sensitivity of the variables to different water saturated hydraulic conductivities k ws in this paper k ws m s is selected for sensitivity analysis instead of the intrinsic permeability k m2 since they are linked through equation 18 and k ws can be easier to measure and obtain in many cases the variations of k as are not considered independently since k as can be derived from k ws Œº w and Œº a though the differences in the values of the results are not very significant we can still observe that the lower intrinsic permeability will result in a higher velocity lower temperature and greater excess pore pressure which is consistent with previous studies goren and aharonov 2009 pinyol and alonso 2010b cecinato and zervos 2012 it is worth noting that in our study the landslide can develop to be catastrophic even under high intrinsic permeability conditions the reason is probably that friction softening contributes significantly to the velocity and makes the landslide reach a high speed even under low thermal pressurization conditions furthermore the hydraulic conductivity will still be low due to the presence of the dry air in the slip band for example when k ws 3 624 10 6 m s the hydraulic conductivity is about k w 2 10 9 m s which is still quite low nevertheless the final outcome is mainly controlled by the soil water characteristic curve swcc and the initial degree of saturation which will be discussed later the pneumatic conductivity k a is several orders of magnitude larger than k w and thus the excess pore air pressure dissipates more quickly figs 11 13 show the different hypothetical scenarios of no heat generation no dry air in the whole slip band i e fully water saturated no liquid water in the whole slip band i e fully dry and no heat conduction inside and outside the slip band respectively the peak friction angles of the fully saturated and fully dry conditions are set to 24 32 and 28 43 to meet the initial limit equilibrium conditions respectively the results of the original model and the saturated model clearly demonstrate that the unsaturated condition will lead to increases in the excess pore pressure the temperature and the velocity the maximum temperature is about 35 degrees greater than that in the saturated model and the excess pore pressure is more than twice the latter and it will dissipate more slowly due to the much lower hydraulic conductivity caused by the dry air phase moreover the fully dry condition in the slip band will result in a higher temperature due to the relatively lower specific heat but the excess pore pressure is smaller since the pneumatic conductivity is relatively high the high velocity occurs in the fully dry condition because when the friction softening is considered the landslide is easier to trigger and then the initial pore pressure will affect the velocity which is assumed to be p a t m a higher value than the initial pore water pressures due to the low groundwater level and thus reducing the effective normal stress and increasing the velocity adiabatic conditions can produce both higher temperature and greater excess pore pressure but the effect on the velocity is minimal as pointed out by pinyol and alonso 2010b and goren and aharonov 2009 it is worth noting that if heat generation and thus excess pore pressure are not taken into account in this model it seems that the landslide will be hard to initiate under the triggering condition assumed in this paper at least the velocity could be ignored in the first 30 s fig 14 shows the distribution of the velocity the maximum temperature and excess pore pressure along the sliding surface of the dongfeng landslide at 6 5 s after being triggered and the differences between the unsaturated and saturated zones can be seen clearly this time window is selected since the entrainment effects are minor according to li et al 2019 although the proposed model is different from li et al 2019 the maximum velocity and the displacement are similar and the overall trend is consistent with the simulation by zhao et al 2018 where the quasi two dimensional thermo poro mechanical model was studied one notable phenomenon is that the maximum excess pore pressure and the maximum temperature appear at different positions this is because the velocity of block 3 is higher and thus the initial effective stress increases faster due to the variation of the sliding morphology which will result in a higher excess pore pressure which was not considered in the previous studies fig 15 a and b show the comparisons of the velocity the maximum temperature and excess pore pressure along the sliding surface between the proposed model and zhao et al s saturated model 2018 at t 6 5 s and t 20 0 s respectively all these key variables in the proposed model are generally higher than those in the saturated model and the displacement at t 20 0 s in the proposed model is approximately 11 m farther than that under fully saturated conditions it is worth noting that the variation of the initial effective stress due to the changes of topography was not taken into account in zhao et al s model and thus the excess pore pressures are much lower than those of the proposed model due to the high hydraulic conductivity of the loess and the position where the maximum excess pore pressure takes place is also different 5 4 discussions 5 4 1 thermal pressurization under unsaturated conditions the mechanism of thermal pressurization is considered under unsaturated conditions in order to more realistically model many landslides in which both saturated and unsaturated zones of the slip band exist simultaneously as shown in fig 9 and fig 13 although the magnitude of thermal pressurization is not high in this case the landslide may not even initiate when the thermal effects are not taken into account under the initial conditions assumed in this research since the initial reduction of the friction angle can be rapidly counterbalanced by the flattening morphological characteristics in addition although the maximum temperature is relatively high fig 8 and evaporation may take place its effect on the velocity is not significant which results in a 4 3 increase of the velocity in the case of the vaiont landslide according to zhao et al 2020 therefore evaporation is neglected in this paper for simplicity but could be further investigated in the future the model proposed in this study can also be used to investigate other landslides when the groundwater level and the sliding path can be estimated 5 4 2 the significance of considering unsaturated conditions although there are some differences between the proposed model and the fully saturated model the final velocity does not seem to be significantly affected as shown in fig 13 the reason is that friction softening is taken into account which contributes significantly to the acceleration and the thermal pressurization is not very evident in this case in fact friction softening was not considered in many studies goren and aharonov 2009 goren et al 2010 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b where the mechanism of thermal pressurization alone can also successfully account for the catastrophic failure of large landslides in view of this further studies under no friction softening and higher thermal pressurization coefficient conditions are carried out here because of the lack of experimental data the thermal pressurization coefficient relative to the pore water is set to about 0 0631 mpa corresponding to Œ≤c 0 006 based on the studies by vardoulakis 2002 and veveakis et al 2007 where it was 0 06 0 07 mpa for clay while in the above simulation the value is about 0 0014 mpa in fig 16 it is demonstrated that the parameter n of the soil water characteristic curve swcc as well as the initial degree of saturation s 0 have significant influences on the velocity of the landslide and can lead to substantial differences between the proposed model and the fully saturated model fig 16 a b c and d show that the smaller parameter n and s 0 are more dangerous conditions which can still predict a catastrophic disaster under high intrinsic permeability conditions while the landslide will not even trigger according to the fully saturated model the reason is that the lower parameter n or s 0 allows a higher variation of suction and the excess pore water pressure can increase much more than the excess pore air pressure since the presence of dry air reduces the hydraulic conductivity significantly while the excess pore water pressure will not reach a high value due to the characteristics of swcc when parameter n and s 0 are high that is if p w increases due to the low hydraulic conductivity the suction will decrease and then the degree of saturation increases more quickly resulting in a reduction in p w and an increase in p a preventing further pressurization fig 16 e and f depict the relationship between the velocity and s 0 and the dash lines suggest a potential trend when s 0 is very high which may be inappropriate under the unsaturated soil framework utilized in this paper the growth of the velocity at the end of the curve in fig 16 f is probably due to the distinct decrease in the pneumatic conductivity and both p w and p a can reach a high value without too much change in the suction it is worth noting that chen et al 2017 found parameter n 1 176 and wang et al 2020 suggested parameter n 1 225 1 310 for loess while the initial degree of saturation of intact loess was measured as 36 8 by wang et al 2020 and some samples of the dongfeng landslide reached a lower value of 34 9 long 2008 all seem to be more dangerous conditions than the original case therefore considering the unsaturated conditions in such cases which may be encountered in natural landslides is of significance since the fully saturated model fails to predict the catastrophic landslide while the proposed model is still valid it is worth noting that the saturated model is not the same as the saturated landslides since the initial limit equilibrium state conditions of the model are assumed which may have already been broken during the process from unsaturated to saturated conditions but this initial limit equilibrium state is still needed in the previous saturated models therefore the above conclusion accounts for the significance and advantage of the proposed model compared to the previous fully saturated models and it does not mean the unsaturated landslides are more likely to fail than the saturated landslides 5 4 3 investigation of different conditions the intrinsic permeability in the slip band has been viewed as a significant factor by many authors goren and aharonov 2007 goren and aharonov 2009 pinyol and alonso 2010a 2010b cecinato and zervos 2012 segui et al 2020 in this paper various intrinsic permeability conditions are simulated where the intrinsic permeability is substituted by the water saturated hydraulic conductivity k ws as discussed after fig 10 and the results are shown in fig 10 and fig 16 both unsaturated and saturated in line with the previous studies the lower intrinsic permeability will lead to a higher speed due to the poor dissipation of the excess pore pressures meanwhile less dissipation will result in higher excess pore pressures and smaller effective stress and thus the temperature will be lower if the landslide is triggered furthermore as shown in figs 11 13 although the hydraulic conductivity under fully water saturated conditions or the pneumatic conductivity under fully dry conditions is relatively high the excess pore pressure is enough to trigger the landslide movement when friction softening is taken into account this suggests that the thermal pressurization can contribute to the high speed movement of the landslide under unsaturated conditions and friction softening is also of significance since the speed can still reach a high value even though the excess pore pressure is not very large 6 conclusions in this paper a unified thermo poro mechanical model taking into account both the unsaturated and saturated zones in the slip band of large landslides is proposed in order to simultaneously consider the topography of landslides and the two zones separated by the groundwater level a quasi two dimensional dynamic model is developed based on the spring block method the dongfeng loess landslide which occurred in northwestern china and which typically presents high speed and large volume characteristics is chosen as a case study due to its relatively low groundwater level and its large unsaturated zone the model is then validated by comparisons between the simulation results and previous published work and after investigations of various conditions the following conclusions can be drawn both thermal pressurization and friction softening can be important mechanisms under unsaturated conditions when dry air in the slip band is considered the hydraulic conductivity can be much lower resulting in a higher excess pore water pressure than the excess pore air pressure the excess pore pressures contribute to the decrease of the effective stress and thus will lead to fast motion it is also found that if thermal effects are not taken into account the landslide may be hard to trigger according to the assumption of initial reduction of the friction angle near the upper band of the saturated zone the unsaturated zone can present clearly higher temperatures excess pore pressure and velocity compared to the saturated zone due to the presence of the dry air and the effects of block volume and slope angle it is also demonstrated that the swcc as well as the initial degree of saturation of the unsaturated soil deserve special attention since they can lead to distinctly different results a lower swcc parameter n and lower initial degree of saturation s 0 are more dangerous especially under high intrinsic permeability conditions where the fully saturated model fails to predict the disaster and the landslide can still reach a high speed in a few seconds according to the proposed model in contrast higher parameter n and intermediate s 0 values are safer and the prediction results from a fully saturated model are probably conservative to some degree thus taking into account natural unsaturated conditions in a catastrophic landslide can be closer to reality and is of significance in some cases which may be encountered in nature the problem to be addressed in the future is the determination of some basic parameters including the energy conversion coefficient e and the effective stress parameter œá which may have an important impact on the predicted results although there are some simplifications in the proposed model it can be used to study the mechanism of high speed large landslides closer to natural conditions and at least as a post

4354,peatland disturbances can disrupt the ecohydrological functions that sustain net carbon sequestration in peatlands anthropogenic disturbances such as peatland drainage and harvesting are often followed by peatland restoration that aims to return the carbon sink function this is typically achieved by raising the water table and re establishing keystone sphagnum moss species however with an increasingly uncertain climate and intensifying land use changes the potential for multiple disturbances such as co occurring wildfires drainage and harvesting to disrupt the ecohydrological feedbacks that support peatland function is increasing yet few studies investigate the ecohydrological trade offs induced by multiple disturbances in peatlands to elucidate the complexities of multiple disturbances and restoration on sphagnum re establishment and wildfire potential we studied a deep and shallow harvested area in a drained and restored peatland in southern ontario canada that experienced a wildfire in 2012 harvesting depth did not significantly increase the bulk density of the upper 32 cm of exposed peat but the shallower harvest depth did significantly increase the depth of burn dob due to the more varied remnant topography the difference in topography of the shallower harvested area increased peat carbon losses 16 5 kg c m 2 from the wildfire relative to the deeper harvest area 15 1 kg c m 2 the difference in post fire peat hydrophysical properties of the deep and shallow harvest area drove divergent soil water conditions in the post burn peat the establishment of suitable conditions for the regeneration of sphagnum mosses was more prevalent at the shallow harvest areas but the higher soil water retention capabilities of the deep harvest peat lowered the risk of subsequent peat ignition this study highlights the complex interactions multiple disturbances have on peatland ecohydrology and that we urgently need to understand these interactions to better

to be released annually turetsky et al 2004 the ignition of peat depends on a multitude of factors but chief among them is the gravimetric water content gwc where peat with gwc less than 295 is at a higher likelihood of ignition than above this threshold benscoter et al 2011 under a warmer climate these drier conditions are more likely to persist throughout the fire season resulting in an increase in peatland wildfires nelson et al 2021 essentially drier and denser peat has a greater likelihood of ignition benscoter et al 2011 a condition found in many disturbed and degraded peatlands the drainage of peatlands for harvesting also referred to as peat extraction or mining of horticultural amendments agriculture forestry and resource development are common practices across the globe kechavarzi et al 2010 liu et al 2020 menberu et al 2016 nieminen et al 2018 pellerin et al 2016 the artificial and sustained lowering of the water table induces accelerated decomposition of the peat kechavarzi et al 2010 liu and lennartz 2019 tonks et al 2017 increasing bulk density and soil water retention liu and lennartz 2019 mccarter et al 2020 price and schlotzhauer 1999 schlotzhauer and price 1999 in vacuum harvested peatlands these processes are exacerbated because the less dense acrotelm peat and some shallow catotelm peat is removed leaving higher bulk density peat at the surface malloy and price 2014 price and whitehead 2001 which is more vulnerable to high peat burn severity granath et al 2016 post harvesting these remnant peat deposits often are unable to regenerate critical peatland vegetation such as sphagnum mosses that are essential to reducing peat ignition potential moore et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2019 the regeneration of sphagnum moss on remnant peat deposits requires soil water pressures in the near surface above 100 mbar price and whitehead 2004 which are often exceeded in these disturbed peatlands mccarter and price 2015 price and whitehead 2001 price and whitehead 2004 similar ecohydrological and hydrophysical changes induced by drainage and harvesting have also been observed to occur following peatland wildfire in part due to combustion of the acrotelm and increased hydrophobicity of the exposed peat sherwood et al 2013 wilkinson et al 2020b returning the water table to the near surface by blocking drainage ditches increases soil water pressures to support sphagnum regeneration and increases near surface soil water contents lucchese et al 2010 mccarter and price 2015 price and whitehead 2004 waddington et al 2003 granath et al 2016 suggested that the re wetting and restoration of drained peatlands was sufficient to mitigate the risk of peatland wildfire but these finding have not been physically observed in field conditions while multiple disturbances of drainage and harvesting followed by restoration is common in many northern peatlands the risk of additional disturbances such as wildfire likely adds complexity for these ecohydrological feedbacks waddington et al 2015 the interactions between multiple disturbances can have unexpected outcomes where the overall impact could be divergent compounding or offsetting depending on the specific disturbances buma 2015 yet relative to single disturbances our understanding of how multiple disturbances impact ecohydrological feedbacks and the subsequent implications for the management of disturbed peatlands remains a critical knowledge gap here we explore how the multiple disturbances of drainage harvesting and restoration interact with peatland wildfire and how these multiple disturbances alter the ecohydrological processes that support critical peatland functions using a harvested restored then burned peatland we 1 elucidated whether different harvesting depths impacted peatland burn severity 2 determined the impact of restoration on the likelihood of subsequent peatland wildfires 3 assessed the ability of the post fire peatland to spontaneously regenerate sphagnum moss and 4 comment on the ecohydrological trade offs for managing disturbed peatlands 2 study site the study took place in the wainfleet bog located near wainfleet ontario canada 42 916748 79 305824 wainfleet bog is a 1200 ha carolinian temperate bog dominated by sphagnum moss and invasive betula pendula european white birch and is ringed by a mixed deciduous lagg fig 1 the bog is estimated to be 5000 years old and has an average peat depth of 3 m with a maximum peat depth of 5 m diamond et al 2003 jonsson ninniss and middleton 1991 a network of drainage ditches was installed to promote peat harvesting which occurred until 2000 with different regions of the bog being abandoned at different preceding periods one area was abandoned in 1955 resulting in a relatively shallow depth of harvest browning 2015 frohlich 1997 and a more sphagnum dominated near surface peat profile the other area was abandoned much more recently 2000 and had a deeper depth of harvest browning 2015 frohlich 1997 where more heavily decomposed peat was prevalent herein these two areas are referenced as shallow and deep respectively fig 1 the peat harvesting process left a distinct topographical profile in the shallow harvested area the bulk of the area is comprised of peat fields which are slightly raised above the field edges and separated by drainage ditches herein the elements of the topographical profile are classified as field edge and ditch respectively in the deep harvest area no such topography was clearly visible as such the deep harvest area was assigned a field topographic classification in 2000 a portion of wainfleet bog was restored with the aim to return sphagnum mosses frohlich 1997 by blocking the drainage ditches thus raising the water tables since then a carpet of sphagnum moss has developed over the site likely returning some ecohydrological functionality to the restored peatland despite raising the water table wainfleet bog has experienced multiple peatland wildfires since 2000 browning 2015 frohlich 1997 in august 2012 a 12 ha smouldering wildfire burned for eight days and was eventually extinguished by fire crews fig 1 the region that burned was comprised of the two different harvesting depths deep and shallow the two burned areas were compared to the nearby unburned region of wainfleet bog also classified as field fig 1 3 methods unravelling ecohydrological trade offs between multiple disturbances requires a varied experiment design briefly we measured the peat burn severity and carbon loss from field measurements while taking both burned and unburned peat cores to assess hydrophysical peat properties then using the derived hydrophysical peat properties we developed several 1d hydrological models to extrapolate both the critical surface soil water pressure for sphagnum establishment 100 mbar price and whitehead 2001 and the potential for peat ignition gwc 295 benscoter et al 2011 for different harvesting depths and pre post restoration scenarios 3 1 sampling and field measurements to assess the spatial variability of the peat burn severity 20 30 depth of burn dob measurements were taken at 102 5 5 m plots randomly selected in each of the burned deep n 12 plots and shallow n 90 plots harvest areas in may through july in 2013 following mack et al 2011 briefly in each plot a levelled string was attached taught to two unburned surfaces and the height from the string to the ground surface was measured every 2 cm along the line until at least 20 measurements were recorded in areas where it was difficult to identity an original surface adventitious roots were used as the baseline following lukenbach et al 2015 the percentage of sphagnum moss cover on the recently burned peat was also estimated newly regenerated moss was counted as burned thus the sphagnum cover represents the remnant sphagnum moss that did not burn during the wildfire triplicate peat profiles 0 40 cm were taken in five centimeter segments in the burned section of both the fields of the deep and shallow harvest areas unburned profiles 0 32 cm were taken in both the shallow and deep harvest areas in four centimeter segments in the unburned area eight peat profiles were randomly taken in the unburned deep harvested area which consisted of only field topography while triplicate profiles were taken in each of the topographical classifications field edge and ditch in the unburned shallow harvested area resulting in a total sample size of nine for the unburned shallow harvest all samples were extracted using a 5x5 cm metal hand corer care was taken to avoid undue disturbance of the sampled peat and any sample with a large degree of visible disturbance were discarded once extracted the samples were wrapped in plastic wrap for transportation back to the ecohydrology laboratory at mcmaster university for hydrophysical measurements 3 2 laboratory measurements the soil water retention curves were determined for the samples from the burned areas prior to estimation of bulk density these samples were placed on a ceramic soil water tension disk soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca effective pore size 6 0 Œºm hydraulic conductivity 3 11 10 7 m s 1 and porosity of 50 and the volumetric soil water content was determined as the residual water content at 5 10 20 30 40 50

methods assuming a particle density of 1 4 g cm 3 redding and devito 2006 using the soil water retention data the radius of the pore opening r theoretical pore size distribution was then determined

indicates a greater proportion of pores less then or equal to the given pore radius gauthier et al 2018 mccarter and price 2014 once the unburned samples were dried and weighed the organic matter content was determined following the loss on ignition method outlined benscoter et al 2005 briefly approximately 0 5 g of dried peat was placed in a muffle furnace at 550 for two hours and the mass lost weight of organic matter determined once the samples cooled the total organic carbon content oc of a given peat layer was assumed to be 50 by weight of the total organic matter lost through combustion chambers et al 2011 the total carbon loss c loss kg m 2 for a given peat profile and topographical classification was then determined by 3 c l o s s l 0 dob l oc l bd l where bdi is the bulk density of a given sample dobl is the average dob of a given sample location and ocl is the total organic content of a given sample location this results in several total c loss estimates for the different sites based on variations in bulk density and dob these values were then averaged for each unique topographical classification and the c loss was then normalized to the depth of burn kg c cm

soil water retention data using fit function in matlab r2020a the mathworks inc for each sample depth of the burned peat the measurements from all three replicates were used as the measured data for the non linear least squares fitting using a trust region minimization algorithm the average porosity was fixed and the residual soil water content Œ∏r Œ± and n parameters in the van genuchten soil hydraulic property model were estimated the resultant parameter estimation and 95 confidence intervals represent the average soil hydraulic properties as mentioned earlier the peat properties and water table co govern both the likelihood of peat to ignite gmc 295 and the potential for sphagnum recolonization soil water pressures 100 mbar both of which are modulated by local weather to elucidate how these factors interact four scenarios were constructed in hydrus 1d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 ≈°im≈Ønek and van genuchten 2008 representing the different harvesting depths deep and shallow and pre post restoration during a prolonged rain free period each simulation used a 40 cm deep soil domain split into eight 5 cm layers corresponding with the depth intervals of moisture retention samples the van genuchten parameters derived from lab measurements were used to partially populate the hydrus 1d model while the remaining parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity 0 57 m hr 1 and l 0 76 were averages taken from the remnant peat of the bois des bel peatland described by mccarter and price 2015 the upper boundary condition was driven by diurnal variation in evaporative flux with an average of 2 mm day 1 a zero flux lower boundary condition was used with an initial condition set using the average water table position measured by diamond et al 2003 and the soil pore water pressure in equilibrium with water table position a monte carlo approach was used to account for uncertainty of measured input data for each of the four scenarios 10 000 simulations were run using independent samples of bd Œ± n and initial water table position the distribution of bd was taken directly from measured data while parameter uncertainty from the non linear fitting procedure was used to define the distribution of the vg parameters the average water tables and 95 confidence intervals from wells station numbers 5b 6 7 7a 8 11 and 14 diamond et al 2003 were used to create a distribution of water tables across the study site table s1 these specific station numbers were chosen as they align with this study s geographical extent and correspond to the pre restoration water tables all water tables were increased by the average dob 23 8 cm to account for the loss of surface elevation due to the peat wildfire as the measurements were completed by diamond et al 2003 prior to the wildfire the post restoration water tables were determined by adding a 15 cm water table rise based on the average effect size of the installation of peat dams 16 cm water table rise determined by browning 2015 and from measured water table increases from at other similarly restored peatlands bois des bel mccarter and price 2013 3 4 statistical analysis differences in bulk density between

completed in r statistical software r development core team 2021 4 results 4 1 depth of burn and sphagnum moss cover the difference in dob between deep and shallow harvest plots tended not to be significant pr p 0 05 31 but the deep harvest average dob 22 9 cm was lower than the shallow harvest dob 35 19 cm fig 2 much of the difference in dob was primarily driven by relatively large differences between topography classifications where both ditch pr p 0 01 96 7 and edge pr p 0 001 86 tended to be significantly different from field the pairwise comparison which segregates deep and shallow field shows similar results where the large dob in the shallow edge is what drove the significant differences table s2 in the shallow harvest area the ditches burned the least followed by the field and then the edges table 1 aside from the ditches the shallow harvest burned consistently more than the deep harvest table 1 despite no other significant comparisons table s2 across the entire burned area the dob had a significant relationship with the remaining sphagnum moss cover adj r2 0 42 p 0 01 where higher remnant sphagnum cover corresponded to lower dob fig 3 4 2 hydrophysical properties the harvesting depth significantly impacted the bulk density of the upper 40 cm of peat where the deep harvest area was significantly higher than the shallow harvest area fig 4 table s3 this trend of higher bulk densities in the deep harvest area was consistent even after burning fig 4 table s3 however when comparing the overall difference between burned and unburned peat at this peatland there was no statistical difference in the peat profiles fig 2 p 0 15 117 df t ratio 1 4 despite limited difference in bulk density there were large differences in soil water retention post fire in the upper 20 cm of the peat profile fig 5 in the deep harvest area the soil water retention was much higher for a given pore radius i e soil water pressure head than the shallow harvest area fig 5 yet in the upper 5 cm of peat there was no clear difference between most of the replicates similar to the soil water retention curves below 20 cm in the peat profile fig 5 at the shallow harvest both the Œ± and n van genuchten parameters varied mostly decreasing with depth table s4 the Œ∏r increased with depth from 0 26 at the surface to 0 47 at 35 40 cm table s4 conversely the deep harvest peat was more consistent throughout the peat profile where only the Œ∏r increased with depth table s4 4 3 carbon loss the average carbon loss assuming equal areas of each topographic profile from the deep 15 1 kg c m 2 and shallow 16 5 kg c m 2 harvest areas were similar but there were large differences between the topographical profiles table 1 both fields deep and shallow harvest were similar in carbon loss while the ditch was approximately half that of the fields the large carbon loss from the shallow harvest area edge and low carbon loss from the ditch was due to their larger and smaller dobs respectively table 1 rather than differences in carbon loss per centimeter burned fig 6 when normalized for depth of burn there was no difference in carbon loss in the upper 15 cm but in the deeper peats the deep harvest area had roughly twice the carbon loss per centimeter burned than the shallow harvest area field fig 6 4 4 sphagnum re establishment potential raising the water tables through restoration had a large impact on both the suitability of the remnant burned peat to re establish sphagnum moss and the conditions for re ignition ensuring that the soil water pressure remains above 100 mbar 102 cmh20 at the surface of the peat is a key indicator for sphagnum re establishment post harvesting price and whitehead 2001 here the surface of the peat was represented by the average soil water pressure of the upper 3 nodes 0 8 cm in the different models following an extended drying period pre restoration the modelling results show that the burned peatland would experience soil water pressures that exceeded this critical threshold in 98 and 13 of the model runs in the deep and shallow harvests respectively fig 7 post restoration the threshold was exceeded 91 of the entire model run in the deep harvest while exceedance decreased to 0 01 in the shallow harvest fig 7 4 5 re ignition potential peat ignition has been observed at gwc below 295 benscoter et al 2011 which is used here as a threshold for determining repeated peat wildfire risks both the depth of harvest and restoration impacted the probability of exceeding this threshold under our modelled drying scenario fig s1 pre restoration the shallow harvest exceeded this ignition threshold in 53 of the model runs in the upper 5 cm of peat deceasing to 0 by 15 20 cm below the peat surface while the deep harvest only exceeded the threshold in 26 of the model runs in the upper 5 cm of peat table 2 fig s1 in both harvest depths following restoration the likelihood of ignition decreases substantially and only exceeded the threshold in the upper 5 cm of peat in 18 and 17 of the model runs in the deep and shallow harvest areas respectively table 2 5 discussion 5 1 depth of burn carbon loss the increase in bulk density observed in the deep harvest did not increase the peat burn severity as measured by dob the similar dob between both harvest depths was likely driven by the trade off between bulk density and gwc benscoter et al 2011 where the denser deep harvest peat likely had increased gwc offsetting the higher bulk density the dob has a strong control on both the amount of carbon released during a peatland wildfire and the resulting hydrophysical properties of the remnant peat lukenbach et al 2016 turetsky et al 2011 wilkinson et al 2020a as a result of the 2012 wainfleet bog wildfire dob in the shallow 35 19 cm and deep 22 10 cm harvest areas were an order of magnitude greater than natural temperate 0 5 6 cm wilbur and christensen 1983 and boreal peatlands 2 5 3 5 cm wilkinson et al 2018 the dob at wainfleet bog compares similarly to other drained peatlands 19 2 cm turetsky et al 2011 37 29 cm wilkinson et al 2018 despite the ditches at this site being blocked for 12 years prior to the fire ditches blocked in 2000 however the extent of water table rise was potentially limited in the 2012 burn footprint as the greatest effects of the ditch blocking were within 150 m of the peat dams browning 2015 we note that the active fire fighting measures employed during this fire likely altered the dob without intervention the dob and spatial extent of the burn would have likely been larger and possibly resulted in greater differences between the deep and shallow harvest areas the different dob between the shallow and deep harvest areas combined with the higher bulk density of deep harvest peat resulted in no significant difference in average c loss between the two harvest depths nevertheless c losses were greater from the edge topography compared to the field in the shallow harvest area highlighting the influence topography has on peat burn severity and carbon loss given that the proportion of field to edge topography depends on ditch spacing where fields typically occupy a greater proportion of the area in harvested peatlands the total carbon loss would be sensitive to harvesting design similarly deep burning margins in boreal peatlands have been observed to contribute up to 90 of total peat carbon losses hokanson et al 2016 lukenbach et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2020a and limiting these areas of severe smouldering is key to reduce cumulative carbon emissions in managed peatlands overall average carbon loss for shallow and deep harvest areas 16 5 and 15 1 kg c m 2 respectively were very similar to drained and burned peatlands in boreal alberta 16 8 kg c m 2 turetsky et al 2011 12 17 kg c m 2 wilkinson et al 2018 where this extent of carbon loss is unlikely to be re accumulated by the system before a consecutive wildfire in natural systems e g ingram et al 2019 in fact assuming a c accumulation rate of 0 025 kg c m 2 yr 1 gorham 1991 this c loss would require 600 years to reaccumulate whereby the probability of fire re occurrence in this harvested peatland will likely be modulated by restoration and keystone species re establishment 5 2 sphagnum re establishment potential maintaining soil water pressures above 100 mbar in the near surface peat is critical for sphagnum moss establishment on remnant cutover peat price and whitehead 2001 in many harvested peatlands active restoration measures such as ditch blocking are required to raise the surface soil water pressure above this critical threshold ketcheson and price 2011 price and whitehead 2001 price and whitehead 2004 shantz and price 2006 at the wainfleet bog the harvesting depth impacted the modelled surface soil water pressures both pre and post restoration in the burned peat this modelled increase in near surface soil water pressure agrees with the measured increase in near surface soil moisture 14 18 by browning 2015 suggesting the restoration measures were broadly successful in creating conditions suitable for sphagnum re establishment prior to blocking the ditches and raising the water table the 100 mbar tension threshold was almost always exceeded following extended drying in the upper 0 8 cm of the modelled peat at the deep harvest while only exceeded in 13 of the model runs at the shallow harvest the smaller pore radii at the surficial peat in the deep harvest increased the air entry pressure and subsequently decreased the soil water pressure at the surface as evaporative losses continued throughout the model run these hydrophysical properties of the deep harvest peat continued to impact the critical threshold of sphagnum regeneration whereby raising the average water table 15 cm did not create suitable conditions for sphagnum regeneration in contrast deeper areas of burn in natural peatlands tend to re establish moss cover quickly due to their proximity to the water table and low degree of hydrophobicity lukenbach et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2020b indeed in deeper harvested peatlands where the surface peat is more typical of denser fen peat the return of sphagnum moss as was the case in this peatland frohlich 1997 is not always the restoration goal and restoration may aim to return obligate fen peatland species b√©rub√© et al 2017 bourgeois et al 2018 malloy and price 2014 in contrast the shallow harvest peat only exceeded the regeneration threshold in 0 01 of the model runs post restoration suggesting sphagnum regeneration would be possible despite the burned peat surface being lowered towards the water table the burned and unrestored peat hydrophysical properties limits the regeneration of sphagnum moss in this case the shallow harvest areas would more likely spontaneously regenerate sphagnum moss without further interventions while the deep harvest would need further active restoration measures such as limiting evaporation through mulch application petrone et al 2004 or returning fen peatland species b√©rub√© et al 2017 bourgeois et al 2018 malloy and price 2014 the peat burn severity here expressed as dob can play an important role in the regeneration of the sphagnum moss lukenbach et al 2017 and subsequent return of ecohydrological functionality lukenbach et al 2016 as the burn severity decreased the remnant sphagnum moss cover increased these refugia of sphagnum moss in the burned peatland can enhance the regeneration of sphagnum moss in both vacuum harvested lavoie et al 2003 and block cut ketcheson and price 2011 ketcheson and price 2014 peatlands the spontaneous regeneration of sphagnum can occur often in the form of sphagnum cushions within these spontaneously regenerated sphagnum cushions the soil water pressures and moisture contents are higher than the surrounding bare peat at equivalent remnant peat depths ketcheson and price 2014 these cushions grow both vertically and laterally covering a larger area of once bare peat lavoie et al 2003 lavoie and rochefort 1996 mcneil and waddington 2003 further increasing near surface soil water content the increase in moss cover with decreasing burn severity will likely increase favourable soil moisture conditions for further expansion of the remnant sphagnum cover post burn this creates a positive feedback where lower burn severities will regenerate quicker than higher burn severities due to the presence of remnant sphagnum moss and the hydrological benefits these remnants provide however the exact mechanisms and feedbacks that creates the sphagnum refugia in burned peatlands are not clear limiting our ability to target restoration efforts to promote these sphagnum refugia and prevent additional carbon loss in managed peatlands 5 3 peat ignition potential the probability of ignition and sustained smouldering combustion increases with increasing peat bulk density such that dense peat has a critical ignition threshold of 295 gwc benscoter et al 2011 the probability of ignition further increases with decreasing gwc rein et al 2008 the modelled gwc exceeded the critical threshold in the near surface peat profiles in all modelled periods of extended drying regardless of restoration the deep harvest area only exceeded the threshold at the 0 5 cm peat depth hence restoration had minimal impact on the re ignition potential in this area since exceedance probability was already low conversely the shallow harvest area tended to exceed the critical threshold down to depths of 15 cm potentially exposing more peat to combustion if re ignition was to occur this difference was driven by the greater moisture retention exhibited by the deep harvest peat due to the predominance of smaller pores and the process of lowering the surface of the peat profile in the deep harvest area bringing it closer to the water table the adjustment of the peat profile surface in addition to changes in near surface hydrological fluxes post fire thompson et al 2014 can result in greater water availability in deeply burned peatlands analogous to deeply harvested which can promote pioneer and keystone species establishment lukenbach et al 2017 assuming favourable soil water pressure conditions 5 4 ecohydrological trade offs managing drained and or harvested peatlands is a complex balancing act between social economic and environmental factors bullock et al 2012 juutinen et al 2020 once the economic viability of the peat resources has been exceeded it is often environmental concerns that prompt the restoration or re greening of abandoned peatlands collier 2011 from a quantitative approach peatland restoration usually targets returning keystone species i e sphagnum mosses chimner et al 2016 rochefort 2000 and subsequently net carbon sequestration waddington et al 2010 young et al 2017 or the peatlands are adapted for continual sphagnum fibre production paludiculture pouliot et al 2015 wichmann et al 2020 these targets are often achieved at least partially through raising the water table and applying mineral fertilizers to mitigate any potential nutrient deficiencies of the remnant peat andersen et al 2006 rochefort et al 2003 unlike harvested peatlands the ash from burned peatlands often contains higher concentrations of mineralized nutrients such as phosphorous than unburned peat bod√≠ et al 2014 this natural fertilizer may enhance the natural re establishment of sphagnum post fire or the restoration of burned peatlands thus offsetting some potential restoration cost the flooding of harvested peatlands due to restoration can increase methane emissions which partially counteract carbon sequestration from primary productivity evans et al 2021 however these emissions are typically outweighed after 30 years g√ºnther et al 2020 increasingly the management of peatlands prior to and after restoration requires trade offs between harvesting depth carbon sequestration sphagnum moss development and wildfire risk a large net carbon source to the atmosphere wildfire risk is likely to increase across peatland dominated regions as high extreme fire weather becomes more common wang et al 2015 given that managed peatlands also tend to be relatively close to the wildland human interface compared to pristine peatlands there are additional challenges at hand such as increased ignition sources robinne et al 2016 and the human health impacts of air pollution from peat smouldering rappold et al 2011 while harvesting deeper into the peat profile may extend the economic productivity of a peatland we find it comes at the expense of likely requiring additional restoration efforts such as mulching to limit evaporation to ameliorate the adverse hydrological conditions at the surface simply put blocking the ditches has the effect of raising the average water table while seasonal water table variability leads to increased surface drying beyond what would be predicted for the average water table the seasonal drying in deeper harvested peatlands will more likely result in higher tensions that can limit spontaneous sphagnum regeneration than if harvesting had ceased at a shallower peat depth however we also show that a deeper harvest brings the surface closer to the water table and substantially decreases the risk of ignition compared to the shallow harvested peat regardless of restoration the longer term stability i e less likelihood of repeated peatland wildfires of the deeper harvests may increase the sphagnum moss cover relative to a shallower harvested peatland over longer time scales in this scenario the shallower harvested peatland would initially be more suitable for sphagnum moss regeneration but would more likely experience repeated burns over longer time periods thus reducing overall sphagnum cover and increase net carbon emissions relative to the deeper harvested peatland these trade offs should be considered when planning the lifecycle of a resource baring peatland so that the economic social and environmental factors are balanced regardless raising the water table quickly after abandonment is critical not only for promoting sphagnum reestablishment but also to reducing the risk of peatland wildfire which incidentally promotes longer term net carbon sequestration 6 conclusions the increasing prevalence of multiple and potentially compounding disturbances to peatland ecosystems requires a more holistic approach to the response and management of disturbed peatlands at the wainfleet bog the harvesting depth did not significantly increase the bulk density of the upper 32 cm of exposed peat but the shallower harvest depth did significantly increase the dob due to the more varied remnant topography the difference in topography of the shallower harvested area increased c losses from the wildfire relative to the deeper harvest area the differences between the deep and shallow harvest areas in dob and post fire hydrophysical properties created divergent soil water conditions impacting the establishment of suitable conditions for the regeneration of sphagnum mosses suitable conditions for the re establishment of sphagnum mosses were more prevalent at the shallow harvest area while the higher soil water retention capabilities of the deep harvest peat lower the potential of subsequent peat ignition relative to the shallow harvest area these divergent conditions between the two harvesting depths will likely impact the long term sequestration of carbon both avoiding subsequent peat wildfire and re establishing keystone peatland species are critical to the long term accumulation of carbon in peatlands yet the conditions that will promote or impede each process will depend on climatic change which are confounded by great uncertainty this study highlights the complex interactions and trade offs that multiple disturbances

4354,peatland disturbances can disrupt the ecohydrological functions that sustain net carbon sequestration in peatlands anthropogenic disturbances such as peatland drainage and harvesting are often followed by peatland restoration that aims to return the carbon sink function this is typically achieved by raising the water table and re establishing keystone sphagnum moss species however with an increasingly uncertain climate and intensifying land use changes the potential for multiple disturbances such as co occurring wildfires drainage and harvesting to disrupt the ecohydrological feedbacks that support peatland function is increasing yet few studies investigate the ecohydrological trade offs induced by multiple disturbances in peatlands to elucidate the complexities of multiple disturbances and restoration on sphagnum re establishment and wildfire potential we studied a deep and shallow harvested area in a drained and restored peatland in southern ontario canada that experienced a wildfire in 2012 harvesting depth did not significantly increase the bulk density of the upper 32 cm of exposed peat but the shallower harvest depth did significantly increase the depth of burn dob due to the more varied remnant topography the difference in topography of the shallower harvested area increased peat carbon losses 16 5 kg c m 2 from the wildfire relative to the deeper harvest area 15 1 kg c m 2 the difference in post fire peat hydrophysical properties of the deep and shallow harvest area drove divergent soil water conditions in the post burn peat the establishment of suitable conditions for the regeneration of sphagnum mosses was more prevalent at the shallow harvest areas but the higher soil water retention capabilities of the deep harvest peat lowered the risk of subsequent peat ignition this study highlights the complex interactions multiple disturbances have on peatland ecohydrology and that we urgently need to understand these interactions to better manage our shared peatland resources in an increasingly uncertain future keywords fire peat management numerical modelling hydrology carolinian temperate peatland 1 introduction peatlands are critically important for regulating the global carbon cycle storing an estimated 600 gt of carbon c limpens et al 2008 yu et al 2011 yu et al 2010 carbon sequestration in peatlands is governed by the delicate interactions between hydrological biogeochemical and ecological processes limpens et al 2008 mccarter et al 2020 waddington et al 2015 which are mediated by hydrogeomorphic setting and local climate rydin et al 2013 disturbances whether anthropogenic or natural disrupt these processes and interactions often switching net carbon sinks to net carbon sources fenner and freeman 2011 gray et al 2020 holden 2005 strack et al 2015 strack and zuback 2013 turetsky et al 2002 waddington et al 2010 wilkinson et al 2018 with increasing land usage resource extraction and climate change the severity and frequency of disturbances to peatlands is increasing often resulting in multiple disturbances granath et al 2016 kronberg et al 2016 lamothe et al 2019 musetta lambert et al 2019 despite the increase in frequency of multiple disturbances in many landscapes there remains few studies on the impacts of interacting effects between multiple disturbances in peatland ecosystems global climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of climate mediated disturbances like peatland wildfires which are further perturbing the global carbon cycle krawchuk et al 2009 krikken et al 2019 nelson et al 2021 for instance it is estimated that the 1997 98 indonesian peat wildfires emitted between 0 95 and 2 57 gt c page et al 2002 while in western canada alone 0 006 gt c is estimated to be released annually turetsky et al 2004 the ignition of peat depends on a multitude of factors but chief among them is the gravimetric water content gwc where peat with gwc less than 295 is at a higher likelihood of ignition than above this threshold benscoter et al 2011 under a warmer climate these drier conditions are more likely to persist throughout the fire season resulting in an increase in peatland wildfires nelson et al 2021 essentially drier and denser peat has a greater likelihood of ignition benscoter et al 2011 a condition found in many disturbed and degraded peatlands the drainage of peatlands for harvesting also referred to as peat extraction or mining of horticultural amendments agriculture forestry and resource development are common practices across the globe kechavarzi et al 2010 liu et al 2020 menberu et al 2016 nieminen et al 2018 pellerin et al 2016 the artificial and sustained lowering of the water table induces accelerated decomposition of the peat

price 1999 in vacuum harvested peatlands these processes are exacerbated because the less dense acrotelm peat and some shallow catotelm peat is removed leaving higher bulk density peat at the surface malloy and price 2014 price and whitehead 2001 which is more vulnerable to high peat burn severity granath et al 2016 post harvesting these remnant peat deposits often are unable to regenerate critical peatland vegetation such as sphagnum mosses that are essential to reducing peat ignition potential moore et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2019 the regeneration of sphagnum moss on remnant peat deposits requires soil water pressures in the near surface above 100 mbar price and whitehead 2004 which are often exceeded in these disturbed peatlands mccarter and price 2015 price and whitehead 2001 price and whitehead 2004 similar ecohydrological and hydrophysical changes induced by drainage and harvesting have also been observed to occur following peatland wildfire in part due to combustion of the acrotelm and increased hydrophobicity of the exposed peat sherwood et al 2013 wilkinson et al 2020b returning the water table to the near surface by blocking drainage ditches increases soil water pressures to support sphagnum regeneration and increases near surface soil water contents lucchese et al 2010 mccarter and price 2015 price and whitehead 2004 waddington et al 2003 granath et al 2016 suggested that the re wetting and restoration of drained peatlands was sufficient to mitigate the risk of peatland wildfire but these finding have not been physically observed in field conditions while multiple disturbances of drainage and harvesting followed by restoration is common in many northern peatlands the risk of additional disturbances such as wildfire likely adds complexity for these ecohydrological feedbacks waddington et al 2015 the interactions between multiple disturbances can have unexpected outcomes where the overall impact could be divergent compounding or offsetting depending on the specific disturbances buma 2015 yet relative to single disturbances our understanding of how multiple disturbances impact ecohydrological feedbacks and the subsequent implications for the management of disturbed peatlands remains a critical knowledge gap here we explore how the multiple disturbances of drainage harvesting and restoration interact with peatland wildfire and how these multiple disturbances alter the ecohydrological processes that support critical peatland functions using a harvested restored then burned peatland we 1 elucidated whether different harvesting depths impacted peatland burn severity 2 determined the impact of restoration on the likelihood of subsequent peatland wildfires 3 assessed the ability of the post fire peatland to spontaneously regenerate sphagnum moss and 4 comment on the ecohydrological trade offs for managing disturbed peatlands 2 study site the study took place in the wainfleet bog located near wainfleet ontario canada 42 916748 79 305824 wainfleet bog is a 1200 ha carolinian temperate bog dominated by sphagnum moss and invasive betula pendula european white birch and is ringed by a mixed deciduous lagg fig 1 the bog is estimated to be 5000 years old and has an average peat depth of 3 m with a maximum peat depth of 5 m diamond et al 2003 jonsson ninniss and middleton 1991 a network of drainage ditches was installed to promote peat harvesting which occurred until 2000 with different regions of the bog being abandoned at different preceding periods one area was abandoned in 1955 resulting in a relatively shallow depth of harvest browning 2015 frohlich 1997 and a more sphagnum dominated near surface peat profile the other area was abandoned much more recently 2000 and had a deeper depth of harvest browning 2015 frohlich 1997 where more heavily decomposed peat was prevalent herein these two areas are referenced as shallow and deep respectively fig 1 the peat harvesting process left a distinct topographical profile in the shallow harvested area the bulk of the area is comprised of peat fields which are slightly raised above the field edges and separated by drainage ditches herein the elements of the topographical profile are classified as field edge and ditch respectively in the deep harvest area no such topography was clearly visible as such the deep harvest area was assigned a field topographic classification in 2000 a portion of wainfleet bog was restored with the aim to return sphagnum mosses frohlich 1997 by blocking the drainage ditches thus raising the water tables since then a carpet of sphagnum moss has developed over the site likely returning some ecohydrological functionality to the restored peatland despite raising the water table wainfleet bog has experienced multiple peatland wildfires since 2000 browning 2015 frohlich 1997 in august 2012 a 12 ha smouldering wildfire burned for eight days and was eventually extinguished by fire crews fig 1 the region that burned was comprised of the two different harvesting depths deep and shallow the two burned areas were compared to the nearby unburned region of wainfleet bog also classified as field fig 1 3 methods unravelling ecohydrological trade offs between multiple disturbances requires a varied experiment design briefly we measured the peat burn severity and carbon loss from field measurements while taking both burned and unburned peat cores to assess hydrophysical peat properties then using the derived hydrophysical peat properties we developed several 1d hydrological models to extrapolate both the critical surface soil water pressure for sphagnum establishment 100 mbar price and whitehead 2001 and the potential for peat ignition gwc 295 benscoter et al 2011 for different harvesting depths and pre post restoration scenarios 3 1 sampling and field measurements to assess the spatial variability of the peat burn severity 20 30 depth of burn dob measurements were taken at 102 5 5 m plots randomly selected in each of the burned deep n 12 plots and shallow n 90 plots harvest areas in may through july in 2013 following mack et al 2011 briefly in each plot a levelled string was attached taught to two unburned surfaces and the height from the string to the ground surface was measured every 2 cm along the line until at least 20 measurements were recorded in areas where it was difficult to identity an original surface adventitious roots were used as the baseline following lukenbach et al 2015 the percentage of sphagnum moss cover on the recently burned peat was also estimated newly regenerated moss was counted as burned thus the sphagnum cover represents the remnant sphagnum moss that did not burn during the wildfire triplicate peat profiles 0 40 cm were taken in five centimeter segments in the burned section of both the fields of the deep and shallow harvest areas unburned profiles 0 32 cm were taken in both the shallow and deep harvest areas in four centimeter segments in the unburned area eight peat profiles were randomly taken in the unburned deep harvested area which consisted of only field topography while triplicate profiles were taken in each of the topographical classifications field edge and ditch in the unburned shallow harvested area resulting in a total sample size of nine for the unburned shallow harvest all samples were extracted using a 5x5 cm metal hand corer care was taken to avoid undue disturbance of the sampled peat and any sample with a large degree of visible disturbance were discarded once extracted the samples were wrapped in plastic wrap for transportation back to the ecohydrology laboratory at mcmaster university for hydrophysical measurements 3 2 laboratory measurements the soil water retention curves were determined for the samples from the burned areas prior to estimation of bulk density these samples were placed on a ceramic soil water tension disk soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca effective pore size 6 0 Œºm hydraulic conductivity 3 11 10 7 m s 1 and porosity of 50 and the volumetric soil water content was determined as the residual water content at 5 10 20 30 40 50 75 100 150 200 and 500 mbar of pressure after which the samples were dried at 80 for 48 h along with the unburned samples for determination of bulk density porosity was estimated using standard methods assuming a particle density of 1 4 g cm 3 redding and devito 2006 using the soil water retention data the radius of the pore opening r theoretical pore size distribution was then determined using the capillary rise equation for a given pressure head 1 r 2 Œ≥ cos Œ≤ œÅ g h where Œ≥ is the surface tension of water n m 1 Œ≤ is the contact angle 51 for surficial peat gharedaghloo 2018 gharedaghloo and price 2019 œÅ is the density of water 1000 kg m 3 g is gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 and h is pressure head m the volumetric soil moisture content was then converted into the

indicates a greater proportion of pores less then or equal to the given pore radius gauthier et al 2018 mccarter and price 2014 once the unburned samples were dried and weighed the organic matter content was determined following the loss on ignition method outlined benscoter et al 2005 briefly approximately 0 5 g of dried peat was placed in a muffle furnace at 550 for two hours and the mass lost weight of organic matter determined once the samples cooled the total organic carbon content oc of a given peat layer was assumed to be 50 by weight of the total organic matter lost through combustion chambers et al 2011 the total carbon loss c loss kg m 2 for a given peat profile and topographical classification was then determined by 3 c l o s s l 0 dob l oc l bd l where bdi is the bulk density of a given sample dobl is the average dob of a given sample location and ocl is the total organic content of a given sample location this results in several total c loss estimates for the different sites based on variations in bulk density and dob these values were then averaged for each unique topographical classification and the c loss was then normalized to the depth of burn kg c cm burned 1 3 3 ecohydrological modelling the van genuchten soil water retention parameters van genuchten 1980 were estimated by fitting the van genuchten soil hydraulic property model to the measured soil water retention data using fit function in matlab r2020a the mathworks inc for each sample depth of the burned peat the measurements from all three replicates were used as the measured data for the non linear least squares fitting using a trust region minimization algorithm the average porosity was fixed and the residual soil water content Œ∏r Œ± and n parameters in the van genuchten soil hydraulic property model were estimated the resultant parameter estimation and 95 confidence intervals represent the average soil hydraulic properties as mentioned earlier the peat properties and water table co govern both the likelihood of peat to ignite gmc 295 and the potential for sphagnum recolonization soil water pressures 100 mbar both of which are modulated by local weather to elucidate how these factors interact four scenarios were constructed in hydrus 1d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 ≈°im≈Ønek and van genuchten 2008 representing the different harvesting depths deep and shallow and pre post restoration during a prolonged rain free period each simulation used a 40 cm deep soil domain split into eight 5 cm layers corresponding with the depth intervals of moisture retention samples the van genuchten parameters derived from lab measurements were used to partially populate the hydrus 1d model while the remaining parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity 0 57 m hr 1 and l 0 76 were averages taken from the remnant peat of the bois des bel peatland described by mccarter and price 2015 the upper boundary condition was driven by diurnal variation in evaporative flux with an average of 2 mm day 1 a zero flux lower boundary condition was used with an initial condition set using the average water table position measured by diamond et al 2003 and the soil pore water pressure in equilibrium with water table position a monte carlo approach was used to account for uncertainty of measured input data for each of the four scenarios 10 000 simulations were run using independent samples of bd Œ± n and initial water table position the distribution of bd was taken directly from measured data while parameter uncertainty from the non linear fitting procedure was used to define the distribution of the vg parameters the average water tables and 95 confidence intervals from wells station numbers 5b 6 7 7a 8 11 and 14 diamond et al 2003 were used to create a distribution of water tables across the study site table s1 these specific station numbers were chosen as they align with this study s geographical extent and correspond to the pre restoration water tables all water tables were increased by the average dob 23 8 cm to account for the loss of surface elevation due to the peat wildfire as the measurements were completed by diamond et al 2003 prior to the wildfire the post restoration water tables were determined by adding a 15 cm water table rise based on the average effect size of the installation of peat dams 16 cm water table rise determined by browning 2015 and from measured water table increases from at other similarly restored peatlands bois des bel mccarter and price 2013 3 4 statistical analysis differences in bulk density between

status burned and unburned and harvest depth shallow and deep for both mixed effect models above to determine overall differences between these broader characterizations all statistical analysis were completed in r statistical software r development core team 2021 4 results 4 1 depth of burn and sphagnum moss cover the difference in dob between deep and shallow harvest plots tended not to be significant pr p 0 05 31 but the deep harvest average dob 22 9 cm was lower than the shallow harvest dob 35 19 cm fig 2 much of the difference in dob was primarily driven by relatively large differences between topography classifications where both ditch pr p 0 01 96 7 and edge pr p 0 001 86 tended to be significantly different from field the pairwise comparison which segregates deep and shallow field shows similar results where the large dob in the shallow edge is what drove the significant differences table s2 in the shallow harvest area the ditches burned the least followed by the field and then the edges table 1 aside from the ditches the shallow harvest burned consistently more than the deep harvest table 1 despite no other significant comparisons table s2 across the entire burned area the dob had a significant relationship with the remaining sphagnum moss cover adj r2 0 42 p 0 01 where higher remnant sphagnum cover corresponded to lower dob fig 3 4 2 hydrophysical properties the harvesting depth significantly impacted the bulk density of the upper 40 cm of peat where the deep harvest area was significantly higher than the shallow harvest area fig 4 table s3 this trend of higher bulk densities in the deep harvest area was consistent even after burning fig 4 table s3 however when comparing the overall difference between burned and unburned peat at this peatland there was no statistical difference in the peat profiles fig 2 p 0 15 117 df t ratio 1 4 despite limited difference in bulk density there were large differences in soil water retention post fire in the upper 20 cm of the peat profile fig 5 in the deep harvest area the soil water retention was much higher for a given pore radius i e soil water pressure head than the shallow harvest area fig 5 yet in the upper 5 cm of peat there was no clear difference between most of the replicates similar to the soil water retention curves below 20 cm in the peat profile fig 5 at the shallow harvest both the Œ± and n van genuchten parameters varied mostly decreasing with depth table s4 the Œ∏r increased with depth from 0 26 at the surface to 0 47 at 35 40 cm table s4 conversely the deep harvest peat was more consistent throughout the peat profile where only the Œ∏r increased with depth table s4 4 3 carbon loss the average carbon loss assuming equal areas of each topographic profile from the deep 15 1 kg c m 2 and shallow 16 5 kg c m 2 harvest areas were similar but there were large differences between the topographical profiles table 1 both fields deep and shallow harvest were similar in carbon loss while the ditch was approximately half that of the fields the large carbon loss from the shallow harvest area edge and low carbon loss from the ditch was due to their larger and smaller dobs respectively table 1 rather than differences in carbon loss per centimeter burned fig 6 when normalized for depth of burn there was no difference in carbon loss in the upper 15 cm but in the deeper peats the deep harvest area had roughly twice the carbon loss per centimeter burned than the shallow harvest area field fig 6 4 4 sphagnum re establishment potential raising the water tables through restoration had a large impact on both the suitability of the remnant burned peat to re establish sphagnum moss and the conditions for re ignition ensuring that the soil water pressure remains above 100 mbar 102 cmh20 at the surface of the peat is a key indicator for sphagnum re establishment post harvesting price and whitehead 2001 here the surface of the peat was represented by the average soil water pressure of the upper 3 nodes 0 8 cm in the different models following an extended drying period pre restoration the modelling results show that the burned peatland would experience soil water pressures that exceeded this critical threshold in 98 and 13 of the model runs in the deep and shallow harvests respectively fig 7 post restoration the threshold was exceeded 91 of the entire model run in the deep harvest while exceedance decreased to 0 01 in the shallow harvest fig 7 4 5 re ignition potential peat ignition has been observed at gwc below 295 benscoter et al 2011 which is used here as a threshold for determining repeated peat wildfire risks both the depth of harvest and restoration impacted the probability of exceeding this threshold under our modelled drying scenario fig s1 pre restoration the shallow harvest exceeded this ignition threshold in 53 of the model runs in the upper 5 cm of peat deceasing to 0 by 15 20 cm below the peat surface while the deep harvest only exceeded the threshold in 26 of the model runs in the upper 5 cm of peat table 2 fig s1 in both harvest depths following restoration the likelihood of ignition decreases substantially and only exceeded the threshold in the upper 5 cm of peat in 18 and 17 of the model runs in the deep and shallow harvest areas respectively table 2 5 discussion 5 1 depth of burn carbon loss the increase in bulk density observed in the deep harvest did not increase the peat burn severity as measured by dob the similar dob between both harvest depths was likely driven by the trade off between bulk density and gwc benscoter et al 2011 where the denser deep harvest peat likely had increased gwc offsetting the higher bulk density the dob has a strong control on both the amount of carbon released during a peatland wildfire and the resulting hydrophysical properties of the remnant peat lukenbach et al 2016 turetsky et al 2011 wilkinson et al 2020a as a result of the 2012 wainfleet bog wildfire dob in the shallow 35 19 cm and deep 22 10 cm harvest areas were an order of magnitude greater than natural temperate 0 5 6 cm wilbur and christensen 1983 and boreal peatlands 2 5 3 5 cm wilkinson et al 2018 the dob at wainfleet bog compares similarly to other drained peatlands 19 2 cm turetsky et al 2011 37 29 cm wilkinson et al 2018 despite the ditches at this site being blocked for 12 years prior to the fire ditches blocked in 2000 however the extent of water table rise was potentially limited in the 2012 burn footprint as the greatest effects of the ditch blocking were within 150 m of the peat dams browning 2015 we note that the active fire fighting measures employed during this fire likely altered the dob without intervention the dob and spatial extent of the burn would have likely been larger and possibly resulted in greater differences between the deep and shallow harvest areas the different dob between the shallow and deep harvest areas combined with the higher bulk density of deep harvest peat resulted in no significant difference in average c loss between the two harvest depths nevertheless c losses were greater from the edge topography compared to the field in the shallow harvest area highlighting the influence topography has on peat burn severity and carbon loss given that the proportion of field to edge topography depends on ditch spacing where fields typically occupy a greater proportion of the area in harvested peatlands the total carbon loss would be sensitive to harvesting design similarly deep burning margins in boreal peatlands have been observed to contribute up to 90 of total peat carbon losses hokanson et al 2016 lukenbach et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2020a and limiting these areas of severe smouldering is key to reduce cumulative carbon emissions in managed peatlands overall average carbon loss for shallow and deep harvest areas 16 5 and 15 1 kg c m 2 respectively were very similar to drained and burned peatlands in boreal alberta 16 8 kg c m 2 turetsky et al 2011 12 17 kg c m 2 wilkinson et al 2018 where this extent of carbon loss is unlikely to be re accumulated by the system before a consecutive wildfire in natural systems e g ingram et al 2019 in fact assuming a c accumulation rate of 0 025 kg c m 2 yr 1 gorham 1991 this c loss would require 600 years to reaccumulate whereby the probability of fire re occurrence in this harvested peatland will likely be modulated by restoration and keystone species re establishment 5 2 sphagnum re establishment potential maintaining soil water pressures above 100 mbar in the near surface peat is critical for sphagnum moss establishment on remnant cutover peat price and whitehead 2001 in many harvested peatlands active restoration measures such as ditch blocking are required to raise the surface soil water pressure above this critical threshold ketcheson and price 2011 price and whitehead 2001 price and whitehead 2004 shantz and price 2006 at the wainfleet bog the harvesting depth impacted the modelled surface soil water pressures both pre and post restoration in the burned peat this modelled increase in near surface soil water pressure agrees with the measured increase in near surface soil moisture 14 18 by browning 2015 suggesting the restoration measures were broadly successful in creating conditions suitable for sphagnum re establishment prior to blocking the ditches and raising the water table the 100 mbar tension threshold was almost always exceeded following extended drying in the upper 0 8 cm of the modelled peat at the deep harvest while only exceeded in 13 of the model runs at the shallow harvest the smaller pore radii at the surficial peat in the deep harvest increased the air entry pressure and subsequently decreased the soil water pressure at the surface as evaporative losses continued throughout the model run these hydrophysical properties of the deep harvest peat continued to impact the critical threshold of sphagnum regeneration whereby raising the average water table 15 cm did not create suitable conditions for sphagnum regeneration in contrast deeper areas of burn in natural peatlands tend to re establish moss cover quickly due to their proximity to the water table and low degree of hydrophobicity lukenbach et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2020b indeed in deeper harvested peatlands where the surface peat is more typical of denser fen peat the return of sphagnum moss as was the case in this peatland frohlich 1997 is not always the restoration goal and restoration may aim to return obligate fen peatland species b√©rub√© et al 2017 bourgeois et al 2018 malloy and price 2014 in contrast the shallow harvest peat only exceeded the regeneration threshold in 0 01 of the model runs post restoration suggesting sphagnum regeneration would be possible despite the burned peat surface being lowered towards the water table the burned and unrestored peat hydrophysical properties limits the regeneration of sphagnum moss in this case the shallow harvest areas would more likely spontaneously regenerate sphagnum moss without further interventions while the deep harvest would need further active restoration measures such as limiting evaporation through mulch application petrone et al 2004 or returning fen peatland species b√©rub√© et al 2017 bourgeois et al 2018 malloy and price 2014 the peat burn severity here expressed as dob can play an important role in the regeneration of the sphagnum moss lukenbach et al 2017 and subsequent return of ecohydrological functionality lukenbach et al 2016 as the burn severity decreased the remnant sphagnum moss cover increased these refugia of sphagnum moss in the burned peatland can enhance the regeneration of sphagnum moss in both vacuum harvested lavoie et al 2003 and block cut ketcheson and price 2011 ketcheson and price 2014 peatlands the spontaneous regeneration of sphagnum can occur often in the form of sphagnum cushions within these spontaneously regenerated sphagnum cushions the soil water pressures and moisture contents are higher than the surrounding bare peat at equivalent remnant peat depths ketcheson and price 2014 these cushions grow both vertically and laterally covering a larger area of once bare peat lavoie et al 2003 lavoie and rochefort 1996 mcneil and waddington 2003 further increasing near surface soil water content the increase in moss cover with decreasing burn severity will likely increase favourable soil moisture conditions for further expansion of the remnant sphagnum cover post burn this creates a positive feedback where lower burn severities will regenerate quicker than higher burn severities due to the presence of remnant sphagnum moss and the hydrological benefits these remnants provide however the exact mechanisms and feedbacks that creates the sphagnum refugia in burned peatlands are not clear limiting our ability to target restoration efforts to promote these sphagnum refugia and prevent additional carbon loss in managed peatlands 5 3 peat ignition potential the probability of ignition and sustained smouldering combustion increases with increasing peat bulk density such that dense peat has a critical ignition threshold of 295 gwc benscoter et al 2011 the probability of ignition further increases with decreasing gwc rein et al 2008 the modelled gwc exceeded the critical threshold in the near surface peat profiles in all modelled periods of extended drying regardless of restoration the deep harvest area only exceeded the threshold at the 0 5 cm peat depth hence restoration had minimal impact on the re ignition potential in this area since exceedance probability was already low conversely the shallow harvest area tended to exceed the critical threshold down to depths of 15 cm potentially exposing more peat to combustion if re ignition was to occur this difference was driven by the greater moisture retention exhibited by the deep harvest peat due to the predominance of smaller pores and the process of lowering the surface of the peat profile in the deep harvest area bringing it closer to the water table the adjustment of the peat profile surface in addition to changes in near surface hydrological fluxes post fire thompson et al 2014 can result in greater water availability in deeply burned peatlands analogous to deeply harvested which can promote pioneer and keystone species establishment lukenbach et al 2017 assuming favourable soil water pressure conditions 5 4 ecohydrological trade offs managing drained and or harvested peatlands is a complex balancing act between social economic and environmental factors bullock et al 2012 juutinen et al 2020 once the economic viability of the peat resources has been exceeded it is often environmental concerns that prompt the restoration or re greening of abandoned peatlands collier 2011 from a quantitative approach peatland restoration usually targets returning keystone species i e sphagnum mosses chimner et al 2016 rochefort 2000 and subsequently net carbon sequestration waddington et al 2010 young et al 2017 or the peatlands are adapted for continual sphagnum fibre production paludiculture pouliot et al 2015 wichmann et al 2020 these targets are often achieved at least partially through raising the water table and applying mineral fertilizers to mitigate any potential nutrient deficiencies of the remnant peat andersen et al 2006 rochefort et al 2003 unlike harvested peatlands the ash from burned peatlands often contains higher concentrations of mineralized nutrients such as phosphorous than unburned peat bod√≠ et al 2014 this natural fertilizer may enhance the natural re establishment of sphagnum post fire or the restoration of burned peatlands thus offsetting some potential restoration cost the flooding of harvested peatlands due to restoration can increase methane emissions which partially counteract carbon sequestration from primary productivity evans et al 2021 however these emissions are typically outweighed after 30 years g√ºnther et al 2020 increasingly the management of peatlands prior to and after restoration requires trade offs between harvesting depth carbon sequestration sphagnum moss development and wildfire risk a large net carbon source to the atmosphere wildfire risk is likely to increase across peatland dominated regions as high extreme fire weather becomes more common wang et al 2015 given that managed peatlands also tend to be relatively close to the wildland human interface compared to pristine peatlands there are additional challenges at hand such as increased ignition sources robinne et al 2016 and the human health impacts of air pollution from peat smouldering rappold et al 2011 while harvesting deeper into the peat profile may extend the economic productivity of a peatland we find it comes at the expense of likely requiring additional restoration efforts such as mulching to limit evaporation to ameliorate the adverse hydrological conditions at the surface simply put blocking the ditches has the effect of raising the average water table while seasonal water table variability leads to increased surface drying beyond what would be predicted for the average water table the seasonal drying in deeper harvested peatlands will more likely result in higher tensions that can limit spontaneous sphagnum regeneration than if harvesting had ceased at a shallower peat depth however we also show that a deeper harvest brings the surface closer to the water table and substantially decreases the risk of ignition compared to the shallow harvested peat regardless of restoration the longer term stability i e less likelihood of repeated peatland wildfires of the deeper harvests may increase the sphagnum moss cover relative to a shallower harvested peatland over longer time scales in this scenario the shallower harvested peatland would initially be more suitable for sphagnum moss regeneration but would more likely experience repeated burns over longer time periods thus reducing overall sphagnum cover and increase net carbon emissions relative to the deeper harvested peatland these trade offs should be considered when planning the lifecycle of a resource baring peatland so that the economic social and environmental factors are balanced regardless raising the water table quickly after abandonment is critical not only for promoting sphagnum reestablishment but also to reducing the risk of peatland wildfire which incidentally promotes longer term net carbon sequestration 6 conclusions the increasing prevalence of multiple and potentially compounding disturbances to peatland ecosystems requires a more holistic approach to the response and management of disturbed peatlands at the wainfleet bog the harvesting depth did not significantly increase the bulk density of the upper 32 cm of exposed peat but the shallower harvest depth did significantly increase the dob due to the more varied remnant topography the difference in topography of the shallower harvested area increased c losses from the wildfire relative to the deeper harvest area the differences between the deep and shallow harvest areas in dob and post fire hydrophysical properties created divergent soil water conditions impacting the establishment of suitable conditions for the regeneration of sphagnum mosses suitable conditions for the re establishment of sphagnum mosses were more prevalent at the shallow harvest area while the higher soil water retention capabilities of the deep harvest peat lower the potential of subsequent peat ignition relative to the shallow harvest area these divergent conditions between the two harvesting depths will likely impact the long term sequestration of carbon both avoiding subsequent peat wildfire and re establishing keystone peatland species are critical to the long term accumulation of carbon in peatlands yet the conditions that will promote or impede each process will depend on climatic change which are confounded by great uncertainty this study highlights the complex interactions and trade offs that multiple disturbances and management practices can have on peatland ecohydrology with the increasing pressures peatlands are facing in light of a rapidly changing climate and often land uses we need to better contextualize how disturbances interact with the critical processes that support peatlands through understanding these interactions and feedbacks we will be able to better manage and restore our shared peatland
