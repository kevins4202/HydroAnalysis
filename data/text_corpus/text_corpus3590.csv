17950,previous studies have focused on investigating the formation of odorous by products during the chlorination of free amino acids aas however studies on the formation of odorous by products during the chlorination of combined aas which are much more abundant in natural waters than free aas are very limited in this study the generation of odorous aldehyde nitrile and n chloroaldimine from short oligopeptides containing combined leucine leu a typical precursor of odorous by products including glycylleucine gly leu leucylglycine leu gly and trileucine leu leu leu was investigated the reaction mechanisms were then proposed based on acquity uplc qtof mass spectrometer measurement and kinetic studies modelled with kintecus the results indicated that a series of sequential reactions including substitution dehydrohalogenation β elimination hydrolysis and decarboxylation reactions occurred during the chlorination of short oligopeptides the chlorination of gly leu and leu leu leu formed free leu which continued to react with chlorine producing isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine compared with gly leu leu leu leu produced less free leu and therefore a smaller amount of leu derived odorous by products was generated leu gly produced free gly which was not a precursor of odorous by products thus neither isovaleraldehyde nor n chloroisovaleraldimine was formed notably isovaleronitriles can be formed directly from a β elimination reaction during chlorination of leu gly and leu leu leu and thus high yields of isovaleronitriles were observed after chlorination the yields of odorous by products during chlorination of short oligopeptides increased with increasing cl n ratios the molar ratio of chlorine to nitrogen in the aas and reached their maximum at cl n 2 4 except the yield of isovaleraldehyde formed from gly leu reached its maximum at cl n 1 6 uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments decreased odorous by product formation during subsequent chlorination through non peptide bond breaking of short oligopeptides this study facilitates the identification of the causes of off flavour problems in drinking water and the development of ways to control these problems

water disinfection due to its low cost convenience and long retention time bond et al 2011 richardson et al 2002 however over the last four decades the disinfection by products dbps formed by the chlorination of natural organic matter nom in waters have become a subject of public concern mainly due to their potential genotoxicity and carcinogenicity krasner 2009 mitch and sedlak 2002 plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2007 sedlak and von gunten 2011 moreover some dbps with odor taste properties can lead to off flavour problems in drinking water which is also of great concern since consumers use organoleptic properties to assess the safety of drinking water freuze et al 2004 froese et al 1999 krasner et al 1983 young et al 1996 amino acids aas including free and combined aas are common organic matters in natural waters hureiki et al 1994 the concentrations of free aas in drinking water sources were reported to range from 0 to 10 μg l in southern california chinn and barrett 2000 and 0 30 μg l in several plants in western france berne et al 1994 while combined aas were nearly 10 times more abundant than free aas peake et al 1972 thurman 1985 since the traditional processes of drinking water treatment as well as membrane processes are of little use in removing low molecular weight mw aas including free aas and some short oligopeptides these compounds may pass through and react with chlorine dotson and westerhoff 2009 freuze et al 2004 toxic carbonaceous dbps c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as trihalomethanes and haloacetonitriles have been reported to be produced during chlorination of free and combined tyrosine tyr chu et al 2015 moreover yu et al illustrated the mechanisms underlying formation of metastable dbps including dichloroacetonitrile and n chloro 2 2 dichloroacetamide during chlorination of free and combined aspartic acid yu and reckhow 2020 for odorous by products earlier studies indicated that chlorination of certain free aas such as valine val leucine leu isoleucine ile and phenylalanine phe can produce odorous aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines r chncl which are stable and have low odor perception thresholds at the μg l level refer to table si supporting information 1 for details freuze et al 2004 2005 hrudey et al 1988 how et al demonstrated the mechanism by which these odorous by products are formed from chlorination of free aas how et al 2017 2018 cai et al studied the impacts of ph and chlorine dosages on the formation of the three types of odorous by products and the technologies to control their formation cai et al 2019 however information on the formation of odorous by products resulting from the chlorination of combined aas is limited fox et al and keefe et al fox et al 1997 keefe et al 1997 presented the mechanism underlying the chlorination of short peptides but whether odorous by products would be formed from the subsequent reaction was not investigated freuze et al 2006 reported that the chlorination of short peptides could produce odorous n chloroaldimines but the mechanism of these processes and the potential for the formation of other odorous by products were not described it is noteworthy that as the concentrations of combined aas are much higher than those of free aas combined aas could cause more severe off flavour problems if odorous by products can be similarly produced from these species during chlorination thus there is a great need to investigate whether these odorous compounds can be formed from short oligopeptides during chlorination particular for understanding and controlling the off flavour problems caused by the chlorination of amino acids therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the formation of odorous aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines from short oligopeptides during chlorination glycylleucine gly leu leucylglycine leu gly and trileucine leu leu leu which contain combined leu were chosen as model compounds because free leu has been shown to be the precursor of odorous by products and is of higher abundance than other free aa precursors cai et al 2019 the evolution of these odorous by products over time and the effect of chlorine dosage were studied mechanisms of odorous by product formation from chlorination of selected short oligopeptides were proposed based on the measurement of intermediate products and the reaction rate constants were determined through modelling using the kintecus software ianni 2019 finally the influence of uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments on the formation of odorous by products from short oligopeptides during chlorination was examined this study is of great value because the results obtained herein will facilitate the identification of the causes of odorous issues in drinking water and the development of ways to control these issues 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals used listed in table si2 were at least analytical reagent grade all solutions were prepared in millipore water without chlorine demand 2 2 experimental procedures first a determined amount of an individual model precursor was introduced into 200 ml of phosphate buffer solution 0 2 m ph 7 00 0 05 so that the initial concentrations for free leu gly leu leu gly and leu leu leu were all 0 1 mm then every 10 ml of buffered aa solution was transferred into a 20 ml brown headspace sample vial a chlorine solution was freshly prepared on the day of use by diluting a commercial sodium hypochlorite solution 6 14 and the actual chlorine concentration was determined by a portable residual chlorine meter each vial of buffered aa solution was chlorinated by adding the appropriate micro volume sodium hypochlorite solutions to reach prescribed cl n ratios the molar ratio of chlorine to nitrogen in the aas after that the samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature at each designated reaction time one vial of the sample was analysed for odorous by products and free aas the samples were not quenched before analysis since the quenched agent can react with n chloroaldimine thus the samples were injected into instruments immediately after incubation the uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments experiments were conducted in a photo reactor xpa 7 xujiang electromechanical plant nanjing china described in our previous study cai et al 2019 a 100 w medium pressure mp mercury uv lamp was applied and the average irradiance entering the solution from the mp uv lamp was determined to be 3 5 mw cm2 as described in text si1 each buffered aa solution 50 ml was pre treated by uv irradiation for a certain exposure time to reach a pre designated uv dose mw cm2 the average irradiance exposure time and freshly prepared h2o2 solution was added to attain an h2o2 aa molar ratio of 1 then 10 ml of the sample was transferred to the headspace vial and chlorinated at cl n 2 4 for 24 h before analysis all experiments were carried out at least twice and error bars represented one standard deviation 2 3 chemical analysis the concentration of free chlorine was detected by a portable residual chlorine meter pcii hach usa as described in text si2 in details solution ph was measured by a ph meter la ph 10 hach usa the concentrations of glycine gly and leu were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector hplc fld agilent 1200 usa the details were described in text si3 the volatile odorous by products including isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry 5977 7890b agilent usa the details of the method were described in our previous study cai et al 2019 and the limit of detections lods and limit of quantificantion loqs of the method were listed in table si4 the intermediate products in the proposed pathways were analysed using an acquity uplc xevo g2 xs qtof mass spectrometer waters the measurement conditions and gradient elution conditions for acquity uplc were listed in table si5a and b respectively the qtof mass spectrometer was operated in electrospray ionization esi positive mode and the operating parameters were shown in table si6 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of odorous by products from selected aas during chlorination over time fig 1a d displayed the evolution of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during the chlorination of free leu a gly leu b leu gly c and leu leu leu d over 72 h at a cl n ratio of 2 4 the corresponding simulated results obtained by modelling using kintecus software ianni 2019 were shown in fig 1 and table 1 the model and fitting were described in detail in text si4 as shown in fig 1a the formation of isovaleraldehyde reached a maximum at 9 h and the highest yield the molar ratio of odorous by product to initial aa was 6 3 after 10 h chlorination the concentration of isovaleraldehyde remained stable this stabilization can be attributed to the fact that excess residual chlorine reacted with isovaleraldehyde whereas the hydrolysis of n chloroisovaleraldimine produced isovaleraldehyde and these two reactions can result in an equilibrium cai et al 2019 how et al 2017 the yields of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine reached maxima of 51 1 at 9 h and 41 5 at 6 h respectively and afterward the content of each decreased with increasing contact time of note the concentration of n chloroisovaleraldimine decreased faster than that of isovaleronitrile because the isovaleronitrile hydrolysed into valeric acid kb13 2 00 10 6 s 1 table 1 whereas n chloroisovaleraldimine hydrolysed into isovaleronitrile kb10 1 00 10 6 s 1 table 1 and isovaleraldehyde kb11 4 00 10 6 s 1 table 1 cai et al 2019 as shown in fig 1b the formation of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine from chlorination of gly leu at a cl n ratio of 2 4 during 72 h was observed moreover the formation of free leu from the chlorination of gly leu when cl n 1 0 monotonically increased with increasing contact time and reached a maximum yield of 89 3 after 72 h fig si2 while no free leu was detected when cl n 2 4 probably because the great excess of chlorine promoted the rapid reaction between chlorine and the formed free leu this reflected that the chlorination of gly leu produced free leu which would subsequently react with chlorine to form odorous by products during the 72 h contact time the yields of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine from chlorination of gly leu at a cl n ratio of 2 4 reached maxima of 4 9 39 6 and 24 2 at 72 h 72 h and 48 h respectively in contrast to the 72 h chlorinating experiment of free leu fig 1a the maximal yields of the three odorous by products from an equivalent amount gly leu during 72 h chlorination were lower and the reaction time needed to reach the highest yield was longer this was most likely because the degradation of gly leu into free leu needs a series of stepwise reactions before these reactions finished completely the available free leu would be less compared with that in the experiment described in fig 1a furthermore odorous by products formed early from chlorination of gly leu would also degrade early so the final maximal yields were less of note after reaching its maximum only the formation of n chloroisovaleraldimine decreased likely for the same reason mentioned in the previous paragraph from fig 1c the yields of isovaleronitrile were quite high during the chlorination of leu gly at a cl n ratio of 2 4 reaching a maximum of 68 0 at 68 h and then decreasing to 67 2 after 72 h chlorination furthermore as shown in fig si2 the formation of free gly was detected but the free leu was not suggesting that leu gly formed free gly rather than free leu during chlorination because free gly was not the precursor of the odorous by products the two other odorous by products i e isovaleraldehyde nor n chloroisovaleraldimine were not detected and the high yield of isovaleronitrile observed might be formed during the process of leu gly chlorination producing free gly of note among the selected aas the highest yield of isovaleronitrile was generated from leu gly as shown in fig 1d low yields of isovaleraldehyde and n chloroisovaleraldimine were detected from chlorination of leu leu leu when cl n 2 4 and their maximal yields during 72 h chlorination were 2 15 at 72 h and 8 6 at 56 h respectively moreover from fig si2 significantly less free leu was formed from leu leu leu than from gly leu this was likely because the tripeptide had a more complicated structure which led to more complicated reactions with chlorine thus when cl n 2 4 the chlorine dosage was not sufficient to produce as much free leu from leu leu leu and then leading to less isovaleraldehyde and n chloroisovaleraldimine formation however the yield of isovaleronitrile was high and reached 43 2 after 72 h chlorination indicating that a portion of the isovaleronitrile might be formed during the process of leu leu leu chlorination producing free leu 3 2 effect of chlorine dosage fig 2a c displayed the effect of chlorine dosage on the formation of isovaleraldehyde a isovaleronitrile b and n chloroisovaleraldimine c from gly leu leu gly and leu leu leu after 24 h chlorination as shown in fig 2 a the formation of isovaleraldehyde from gly leu was higher when cl n 1 0 likely because the more excess of chlorine at cl n 1 0 promoted the formation of free leu from gly leu and subsequently produced more isovaleraldehyde furthermore the yield of isovaleraldehyde from gly leu at cl n 1 6 reached a maximum of 1 85 this was probably because studies isovaleraldehyde was mainly produced from n monochloroleucine and more chlorine will lead to the chlorination of n monochloroleucine into n n dichloroleucine cai et al 2019 freuze et al 2005 during the chlorination of leu gly no isovaleraldehyde was detected since the chlorination of leu gly produced free gly which is not an odorous by product precursor for leu leu leu the formation of isovaleraldehyde increased with increasing cl n ratios notably the formation of isovaleraldehyde from leu leu leu was lower than that from gly leu at the same cl n ratio probably because leu leu leu produced less free leu than gly leu during chlorination which was discussed in section 3 1 from fig 2b no isovaleronitrile was detected during the chlorination of gly leu when cl n 1 0 as shown in table 1 the reaction rate constant for the chlorination of gly leu ka3 6 40 106 m 1s 1 was much higher than that of the chlorination of free leu kb3 5 40 104 m 1s 1 indicating that the reaction between chlorine and gly leu occurred first then the residual chlorine reacted with the free leu formed from gly leu since the chlorine dosages at cl n 0 4 0 8 and 1 0 were low after the chlorination of gly leu the amount of chlorine left to react with the formed free leu was insufficient to produce isovaleronitrile when cl n 1 0 the chlorine was enough and thus the yield of isovaleronitrile increased with increasing cl n ratios and reached 21 9 when cl n 2 4 previous studies have also confirmed that isovaleronitrile was only formed from the chlorination of free leu under a high chlorine dosage and its formation increased with increasing chlorine dosage cai et al 2019 how et al 2017 the yields of isovaleronitrile from leu gly and leu leu leu reached 42 9 and 22 5 respectively at cl n 2 4 notably the amounts of isovaleronitrile formed from leu gly and leu leu leu during chlorination were more significant than that from gly leu at the same cl n ratio but the formation of free leu from both of these short oligopeptides was lower therefore the high yields of isovaleronitrile were thought to be formed during the process for chlorination of leu gly and leu leu leu producing the corresponding free aas fig 2c showed that the formation of n chloroisovaleraldimines was only detected at cl n 1 0 during the chlorination of gly leu and leu leu leu and the yields kept going up with increasing cl n ratios this was likely the result of n chloroisovaleraldimine formation from the free leu produced by the chlorination of gly leu and leu leu leu and the n chloroisovaleraldimine has been reported to be formed when the ratio of chlorine to free leu was high freuze et al 2005 no n chloroisovaleraldimine was detected from the chlorination of leu gly because no free leu was formed from leu gly and the chlorination of leu gly can not directly form n chloroisovaleraldimine 3 3 mechanism 3 3 1 chlorination of gly leu and leu gly the intermediate products produced during the formation of odorous by products from chlorination of gly leu a and b and leu gly c were analysed with an acquity uplc xevo g2 xs qtof mass spectrometer and the results were listed in table si7a c the pathways were proposed accordingly as shown in fig 3 a c furthermore kintecus software ianni 2019 was used to determine the reaction rate constant of each step by iteration through modelling which was described in detail in text si4 and table si8 the results were shown in table 1a c fig 3a showed the formation pathways of free leu from gly leu during chlorination first a substitution reaction occurred between gly leu a1 and two equivalents of hocl cl n 1 0 producing n n dichloroglycylleucine a3 then the n n dichloroglycylleucine a3 dehydrohalogenated twice to form an intermediate compound a5 called n cyanoacylleucine a subsequent β elimination reaction of n cyanoacylleucine a5 led to the formation of hcn and unstable isocyanate a6 which rapidly hydrolysed into carbamic acid a7 as the carbamic acid a7 was also not stable it rapidly lost co2 to form free leu a8 keefe et al and fox et al have reported the mechanisms of the decomposition of n n dichloroglycylphenylalanine and dichloroalanylphenylalanine fox et al 1997 keefe et al 1997 which are the n n dichloropeptide of glycylphenylalanine gly phe and alanylphenylalanine ala phe respectively both decompositions would produce free phenylalanine and their pathways are similar to that of n n dichloroglycylleucine a3 all the intermediate products in this pathway were successfully detected table si7a except the unstable isocyanate a6 and the modelled reaction rate constants were listed in table 1a fig 3b displayed how the free leu b1 formed from chlorination of gly leu subsequently reacted with chlorine to produce the three studied odorous by products b4 b6 and b8 when the ratio of cl leu 1 0 n monochloroamine b2 was first formed from free leu and subsequently decomposed into isovaleraldehyde b4 as the ratio of cl leu 1 0 n monochloroamine b2 was chlorinated to produce n n dichloroamine b5 which then degraded into n chloroisovaleraldimine b6 and isovaleronitrile b8 therefore the chlorination of gly leu would produce free leu which was then chlorinated to form odorous isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine the determination of intermediate products b2 b3 b5 and b7 was shown in table si7b and the reaction rate constants predicted by kintecus were listed in table 1b similar pathways for the chlorination of leu gly c1 were shown in fig 3c through a series of sequential reactions including substitution dehydrohalogenation β elimination hydrolysis and decarboxylation reactions free gly c7 was formed since instead of leu the free aa formed was gly which is not a precursor of the odorous by products the subsequent chlorination of free gly would not lead to isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile or n chloroisovaleraldimine formation however when isocyanate c5 was produced from the β elimination and dehydrohalogenation c4 c5 of n chloroketimine c4 isovaleronitrile was formed in the meantime thus of the three studied odorous by products the chlorination of leu gly can only form isovaleronitrile except for the unstable isocyanate c5 all the detected intermediate products were presented in table si7c in addition the reaction rate constants for each step as determined by modelling were listed in table 1c 3 3 2 chlorination of leu leu leu as a tripeptide leu leu leu has a more complicated chlorination mechanism as displayed in fig 4 a and b two pathways i and ii were proposed for the reaction of leu leu leu with hocl fig 4a showed the proposed pathways i for the formation of free leu from leu leu leu similarly leu leu leu d1 was first chlorinated to produce n n dichlorotrileucine d3 after the series of reactions mentioned in section 3 3 1 leu leu d7 was formed then leu leu underwent the same reactions ultimately producing free leu d13 after that the free leu can continue to react with chlorine forming isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine through the pathways displayed in fig 3b all the intermediate products were confirmed and only the unstable d5 and d11 were not detected table si7d moreover the reaction rate constants predicted by modelling using kintecus ianni 2019 were listed in table 1d fig 4b showed another proposed pathway ii for the chlorination of leu leu leu and the intermediate products were detected table si7e the methylene group ch2 between the carbonyl groups was easily substituted by chlorine since the hydrogen atoms of the methylene group are easily dissociated due to the influence of the electron withdrawing group chu et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 thus as shown in fig 4b the methylene group of leu leu leu e1 was substituted by chlorine and compound e3 was formed then compounds e4 and e5 were produced upon cleavage of the c n bond portefaix et al 1991 prins et al 2005 finally compound e5 was converted to dichloroacetonitrile e9 and trichloroacetonitrile e10 via substitution and dehydration reactions jha 2012 of note although pathway ii fig 4b cannot produce free leu and odorous by products it still consumed chlorine thus only a portion of the chlorine was available to react with the formed free leu pathway i fig 4a to form odorous by products fig 3b therefore the yields of free leu and odorous by products from leu leu leu were much lower than those from gly leu during chlorination at the same cl n ratio 3 4 effects of uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments short oligopeptides tend to form lower concentrations of odorous by products relative to free aas during chlorination however if drinking water pre treatment led to free aa formation by breaking the peptide bond of short oligopeptide the subsequent chlorination of free aa would increase the formation of odorous by products therefore the impacts of uv photolysis and uv h2o2 pre treatments which are common pre treatment technologies nowadays tan et al 2013 on the formation of odorous by products from selected short oligopeptides were investigated fig 5 a c displayed the effects of uv irradiation and uv h2o2 pre treatments on the formation of isovaleraldehyde a isovaleronitrile b and n chloroisovaleraldimine c from gly leu leu gly and leu leu leu during subsequent chlorination following uv and uv h2o2 pre treatment the formation of all the odorous by products from short oligopeptides during subsequent chlorination was decreased with increasing uv dosages at a uv dose of 37800 mj cm2 the uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments decreased the formation of odorous by products from short oligopeptides during subsequent chlorination by approximately 20 and 85 respectively this was probably because both pre treatments can degrade the short oligopeptide precursor it has been reported that mp uv irradiation and uv h2o2 treatment can degrade organic precursors impacting the formation of dbps during subsequent chlorination chu et al 2014 shah et al 2011 the results suggested the impact of uv pre treatment was not significant even with increasing uv dosages indicating uv irradiation cannot degrade short oligopeptide precursor effectively the previous study has proved that mp uv photolysis was also not effective in removing free aas cai et al 2019 moreover it can be seen that uv h2o2 better controlled odorous by products formations than uv pre treatment alone it is noteworthy that no free aas were detected after uv or uv h2o2 pre treatments of each short oligopeptide thus it can be concluded that uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments may degrade short oligopeptides through non peptide bond breaking previous studies also demonstrated that the degradation of combined phe by uv photolysis did not involve peptide bond breaking freuze et al 2006 mclean and giese 1950 4 conclusion odorous by products were not only formed from certain free aas during chlorination but also from short oligopeptides that contained those free aas in combined form the short oligopeptides reacted with chlorine producing corresponding free aas which were subsequently chlorinated to form odorous by products in addition the structure of the short oligopeptide influenced the species and amounts of the odorous by products formed furthermore the yields of odorous by products increased with increasing cl n ratios and among the ratio applied in this study reached their maxima at cl n 2 4 the exception was the yield of isovaleraldehydes formed from gly leu which reached its maximum at cl n 1 6 of note although these short oligopeptides tended to form lower concentrations of odorous by products relative to free aas during chlorination the off flavour issues caused by the chlorination of combined aas should also be paid great attention since combined aas were much more abundant in source water than free aas uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments decreased the formation of odorous by products from selected short oligopeptides during subsequent chlorination and the effect of uv h2o2 was better indicating that uv h2o2 can control the off flavour problem caused by chlorination of short oligopeptides to some degree declaration

the yields of odorous by products during chlorination of short oligopeptides increased with increasing cl n ratios the molar ratio of chlorine to nitrogen in the aas and reached their maximum at cl n

because free leu has been shown to be the precursor of odorous by products and is of higher abundance than other free aa precursors cai et al 2019 the evolution of these odorous by products over time and the effect of chlorine dosage were studied mechanisms of odorous by product formation from chlorination of selected short oligopeptides were proposed based on the measurement of intermediate products and the reaction rate constants were determined through modelling using the kintecus software ianni 2019 finally the influence of uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments on the formation of odorous by products from short oligopeptides during chlorination was examined this study is of great value because the results obtained herein will facilitate the identification of the causes of odorous issues in drinking water and the development of ways to control these issues 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals used listed in table si2 were at least analytical reagent grade all solutions were prepared in millipore water without chlorine demand 2 2 experimental procedures first a determined amount of an individual model precursor was introduced into 200 ml of phosphate buffer solution 0 2 m ph 7 00 0 05 so that the initial concentrations for free leu gly leu leu gly and leu leu leu were all 0 1 mm then every 10 ml of buffered aa solution was transferred into a 20 ml brown headspace sample vial a chlorine solution was freshly prepared on the day of use by diluting a commercial sodium hypochlorite solution 6 14 and the actual chlorine concentration was determined by a portable residual chlorine meter each vial of buffered aa solution was chlorinated by adding the appropriate micro volume sodium hypochlorite solutions to reach prescribed cl n ratios the molar ratio of chlorine to nitrogen in the aas after that the samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature at each designated reaction time one vial of the sample was analysed for odorous by products and free aas the samples were not quenched before analysis since the quenched agent can react with n chloroaldimine thus the samples were injected into instruments immediately after incubation the uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments experiments were conducted in a photo reactor xpa 7 xujiang electromechanical plant nanjing china described in our previous study cai et al 2019 a 100 w medium pressure mp mercury uv lamp was applied and the average irradiance entering the solution from the mp uv lamp was determined to be 3 5 mw cm2 as described in text si1 each buffered aa solution 50 ml was pre treated by uv irradiation for a certain exposure time to reach a pre designated uv dose mw cm2 the average irradiance exposure time and freshly prepared h2o2 solution was added to attain an h2o2 aa molar ratio of 1 then 10 ml of the sample was transferred to the headspace vial and chlorinated at cl n 2 4 for 24 h before analysis all experiments were carried out at least twice and error bars represented one standard deviation 2 3 chemical analysis the concentration of free chlorine was detected by a portable residual chlorine meter pcii hach usa as described in text si2 in details solution ph was measured by a ph meter la ph 10 hach usa the concentrations of glycine gly and leu were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with a fluorescence detector hplc fld agilent 1200 usa the details were described in text si3 the volatile odorous by products including isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry 5977 7890b agilent usa the details of the method were described in our previous study cai et al 2019 and the limit of detections lods and limit of quantificantion loqs of the method were listed in table si4 the intermediate products in the proposed pathways were analysed using an acquity uplc xevo g2 xs qtof mass spectrometer waters the measurement conditions and gradient elution conditions for acquity uplc were listed in table si5a and b respectively the qtof mass spectrometer was operated in electrospray ionization esi positive mode and the operating parameters were shown in table si6 3 results and discussion 3 1 evolution of odorous by products from selected aas during chlorination over time fig 1a d displayed the evolution of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine during the chlorination of free leu a gly leu b leu gly c and leu leu leu d over 72 h at a cl n ratio of 2 4 the corresponding simulated results obtained by modelling using kintecus software ianni 2019 were shown in fig 1 and table 1 the model and fitting were described in detail in text si4 as shown in fig 1a the formation of isovaleraldehyde reached a maximum at 9 h and the highest yield the molar ratio of odorous by product to initial aa was 6 3 after 10 h chlorination the concentration of isovaleraldehyde remained stable this stabilization can be attributed to the fact that excess residual chlorine reacted with isovaleraldehyde whereas the hydrolysis of n chloroisovaleraldimine produced isovaleraldehyde and these two reactions can result in an equilibrium cai et al 2019 how et al 2017 the yields of isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine reached maxima of 51 1 at 9 h and 41 5 at 6 h respectively and afterward the content of each decreased with increasing contact time of note the concentration of n chloroisovaleraldimine decreased faster than that of isovaleronitrile because the isovaleronitrile hydrolysed into valeric acid kb13 2 00 10 6 s 1 table 1 whereas n chloroisovaleraldimine hydrolysed into isovaleronitrile kb10 1 00 10 6 s 1 table 1 and isovaleraldehyde kb11 4 00 10 6 s 1 table 1 cai et al 2019 as shown in fig 1b the formation of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine from chlorination of gly leu at a cl n ratio of 2 4 during 72 h was observed moreover the formation of free leu from the chlorination of gly leu when cl n 1 0 monotonically increased with increasing contact time and reached a maximum yield of 89 3 after 72 h fig si2 while no free leu was detected when cl n 2 4 probably because the great excess of chlorine promoted the rapid reaction between chlorine and the formed free leu this reflected that the chlorination of gly leu produced free leu which would subsequently react with chlorine to form odorous by products during the 72 h contact time the yields of isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine from chlorination of gly leu at a cl n ratio of 2 4 reached maxima of 4 9 39 6 and 24 2 at 72 h 72 h and 48 h respectively in contrast to the 72 h chlorinating experiment of free leu fig 1a the maximal yields of the three odorous by products from an equivalent amount gly leu during 72 h chlorination were lower and the reaction time needed to reach the highest yield was longer this was most likely because the degradation of gly leu into free leu needs a series of stepwise reactions before these reactions finished completely the available free leu would be less compared with that in the experiment described in fig 1a furthermore odorous by products formed early from chlorination of gly leu would also degrade early so the final maximal yields were less of note after reaching its maximum only the formation of n chloroisovaleraldimine decreased likely for the same reason mentioned in the previous paragraph from fig 1c the yields of isovaleronitrile were quite high during the chlorination of leu gly at a cl n ratio of 2 4 reaching a maximum of 68 0 at 68 h and then decreasing to 67 2 after 72 h chlorination furthermore as shown in fig si2 the formation of free gly was detected but the free leu was not suggesting that leu gly formed free gly rather than free leu during chlorination because free gly was not the precursor of the odorous by products the two other odorous by products i e isovaleraldehyde nor n chloroisovaleraldimine were not detected and the high yield of isovaleronitrile observed might be formed during the process of leu gly chlorination producing free gly of note among the selected aas the highest yield of isovaleronitrile was generated from leu gly as shown in fig 1d low yields of isovaleraldehyde and n chloroisovaleraldimine were detected from chlorination of leu leu leu when cl n 2 4 and their maximal yields during 72 h chlorination were 2 15 at 72 h and 8 6 at 56 h respectively moreover from fig si2 significantly less free leu was formed from leu leu leu than from gly leu this was likely because the tripeptide had a more complicated structure which led to more complicated reactions with chlorine thus when cl n 2 4 the chlorine dosage was not sufficient to produce as much free leu from leu leu leu and then leading to less isovaleraldehyde and n chloroisovaleraldimine formation however the yield of isovaleronitrile was high and reached 43 2 after 72 h chlorination indicating that a portion of the isovaleronitrile might be formed during the process of leu leu leu chlorination producing free leu 3 2 effect of chlorine dosage fig 2a c displayed the effect of chlorine dosage on the formation of isovaleraldehyde a isovaleronitrile b and n chloroisovaleraldimine c from gly leu leu gly and leu leu leu after 24 h chlorination as shown in fig 2 a the formation of isovaleraldehyde from gly leu was higher when cl n 1 0 likely because the more excess of chlorine at cl n 1 0 promoted the formation of free leu from gly leu and subsequently produced more isovaleraldehyde furthermore the yield of isovaleraldehyde from gly leu at cl n 1 6 reached a maximum of 1 85 this was probably because studies isovaleraldehyde was mainly produced from n monochloroleucine and more chlorine will lead to the chlorination of n monochloroleucine into n n dichloroleucine cai et al 2019 freuze et al 2005 during the chlorination of leu gly no isovaleraldehyde was detected since the chlorination of leu gly produced free gly which is not an odorous by product precursor for leu leu leu the formation of isovaleraldehyde increased with increasing cl n ratios notably the formation of isovaleraldehyde from leu leu leu was lower than that from gly leu at the same cl n ratio probably because leu leu leu produced less free leu than gly leu during chlorination which was discussed in section 3 1 from fig 2b no isovaleronitrile was detected during the chlorination of gly leu when cl n 1 0 as shown in table 1 the reaction rate constant for the chlorination of gly leu ka3 6 40 106 m 1s 1 was much higher than that of the chlorination of free leu kb3 5 40 104 m 1s 1 indicating that the reaction between chlorine and gly leu occurred first then the residual chlorine reacted with the free leu formed from gly leu since the chlorine dosages at cl n 0 4 0 8 and 1 0 were low after the chlorination of gly leu the amount of chlorine left to react with the formed free leu was insufficient to produce isovaleronitrile when cl n 1 0 the chlorine was enough and thus the yield of isovaleronitrile increased with increasing cl n ratios and reached 21 9 when cl n 2 4 previous studies have also confirmed that isovaleronitrile was only formed from the chlorination of free leu under a high chlorine dosage and its formation increased with increasing chlorine dosage cai et al 2019 how et al 2017 the yields of isovaleronitrile from leu gly and leu leu leu reached 42 9 and 22 5 respectively at cl n 2 4 notably the amounts of isovaleronitrile formed from leu gly and leu leu leu during chlorination were more significant than that from gly leu at the same cl n ratio but the formation of free leu from both of these short oligopeptides was lower therefore the high yields of isovaleronitrile were thought to be formed during the process for chlorination of leu gly and leu leu leu producing the corresponding free aas fig 2c showed that the formation of n chloroisovaleraldimines was only detected at cl n 1 0 during the chlorination of gly leu and leu leu leu and the yields kept going up with increasing cl n ratios this was likely the result of n chloroisovaleraldimine formation from the free leu produced by the chlorination of gly leu and leu leu leu and the n chloroisovaleraldimine has been reported to be formed when the ratio of chlorine to free leu was high freuze et al 2005 no n chloroisovaleraldimine was detected from the chlorination of leu gly because no free leu was formed from leu gly and the chlorination of leu gly can not directly form n chloroisovaleraldimine 3 3 mechanism 3 3 1 chlorination of gly leu and leu gly the intermediate products produced during the formation of odorous by products from chlorination of gly leu a and b and leu gly c were analysed with an acquity uplc xevo g2 xs qtof mass spectrometer and the results were listed in table si7a c the pathways were proposed accordingly as shown in fig 3 a c furthermore kintecus software ianni 2019 was used to determine the reaction rate constant of each step by iteration through modelling which was described in detail in text si4 and table si8 the results were shown in table 1a c fig 3a showed the formation pathways of free leu from gly leu during chlorination first a substitution reaction occurred between gly leu a1 and two equivalents of hocl cl n 1 0 producing n n dichloroglycylleucine a3 then the n n dichloroglycylleucine a3 dehydrohalogenated twice to form an intermediate compound a5 called n cyanoacylleucine a subsequent β elimination reaction of n cyanoacylleucine a5 led to the formation of hcn and unstable isocyanate a6 which rapidly hydrolysed into carbamic acid a7 as the carbamic acid a7 was also not stable it rapidly lost co2 to form free leu a8 keefe et al and fox et al have reported the mechanisms of the decomposition of n n dichloroglycylphenylalanine and dichloroalanylphenylalanine fox et al 1997 keefe et al 1997 which are the n n dichloropeptide of glycylphenylalanine gly phe and alanylphenylalanine ala phe respectively both decompositions would produce free phenylalanine and their pathways are similar to that of n n dichloroglycylleucine a3 all the intermediate products in this pathway were successfully detected table si7a except the unstable isocyanate a6 and the modelled reaction rate constants were listed in table 1a fig 3b displayed how the free leu b1 formed from chlorination of gly leu subsequently reacted with chlorine to produce the three studied odorous by products b4 b6 and b8 when the ratio of cl leu 1 0 n monochloroamine b2 was first formed from free leu and subsequently decomposed into isovaleraldehyde b4 as the ratio of cl leu 1 0 n monochloroamine b2 was chlorinated to produce n n dichloroamine b5 which then degraded into n chloroisovaleraldimine b6 and isovaleronitrile b8 therefore the chlorination of gly leu would produce free leu which was then chlorinated to form odorous isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine the determination of intermediate products b2 b3 b5 and b7 was shown in table si7b and the reaction rate constants predicted by kintecus were listed in table 1b similar pathways for the chlorination of leu gly c1 were shown in fig 3c through a series of sequential reactions including substitution dehydrohalogenation β elimination hydrolysis and decarboxylation reactions free gly c7 was formed since instead of leu the free aa formed was gly which is not a precursor of the odorous by products the subsequent chlorination of free gly would not lead to isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile or n chloroisovaleraldimine formation however when isocyanate c5 was produced from the β elimination and dehydrohalogenation c4 c5 of n chloroketimine c4 isovaleronitrile was formed in the meantime thus of the three studied odorous by products the chlorination of leu gly can only form isovaleronitrile except for the unstable isocyanate c5 all the detected intermediate products were presented in table si7c in addition the reaction rate constants for each step as determined by modelling were listed in table 1c 3 3 2 chlorination of leu leu leu as a tripeptide leu leu leu has a more complicated chlorination mechanism as displayed in fig 4 a and b two pathways i and ii were proposed for the reaction of leu leu leu with hocl fig 4a showed the proposed pathways i for the formation of free leu from leu leu leu similarly leu leu leu d1 was first chlorinated to produce n n dichlorotrileucine d3 after the series of reactions mentioned in section 3 3 1 leu leu d7 was formed then leu leu underwent the same reactions ultimately producing free leu d13 after that the free leu can continue to react with chlorine forming isovaleraldehyde isovaleronitrile and n chloroisovaleraldimine through the pathways displayed in fig 3b all the intermediate products were confirmed and only the unstable d5 and d11 were not detected table si7d moreover the reaction rate constants predicted by modelling using kintecus ianni 2019 were listed in table 1d fig 4b showed another proposed pathway ii for the chlorination of leu leu leu and the intermediate products were detected table si7e the methylene group ch2 between the carbonyl groups was easily substituted by chlorine since the hydrogen atoms of the methylene group are easily dissociated due to the influence of the electron withdrawing group chu et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 thus as shown in fig 4b the methylene group of leu leu leu e1 was substituted by chlorine and compound e3 was formed then compounds e4 and e5 were produced upon cleavage of the c n bond portefaix et al 1991 prins et al 2005 finally compound e5 was converted to dichloroacetonitrile e9 and trichloroacetonitrile e10 via substitution and dehydration reactions jha 2012 of note although pathway ii fig 4b cannot produce free leu and odorous by products it still consumed chlorine thus only a portion of the chlorine was available to react with the formed free leu pathway i fig 4a to form odorous by products fig 3b therefore the yields of free leu and odorous by products from leu leu leu were much lower than those from gly leu during chlorination at the same cl n ratio 3 4 effects of uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments short oligopeptides tend to form lower concentrations of odorous by products relative to free aas during chlorination however if drinking water pre treatment led to free aa formation by breaking the peptide bond of short oligopeptide the subsequent chlorination of free aa would increase the formation of odorous by products therefore the impacts of uv photolysis and uv h2o2 pre treatments which are common pre treatment technologies nowadays tan et al 2013 on the formation of odorous by products from selected short oligopeptides were investigated fig 5 a c displayed the effects of uv irradiation and uv h2o2 pre treatments on the formation of isovaleraldehyde a isovaleronitrile b and n chloroisovaleraldimine c from gly leu leu gly and leu leu leu during subsequent chlorination following uv and uv h2o2 pre treatment the formation of all the odorous by products from short oligopeptides during subsequent chlorination was decreased with increasing uv dosages at a uv dose of 37800 mj cm2 the uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments decreased the formation of odorous by products from short oligopeptides during subsequent chlorination by approximately 20 and 85 respectively this was probably because both pre treatments can degrade the short oligopeptide precursor it has been reported that mp uv irradiation and uv h2o2 treatment can degrade organic precursors impacting the formation of dbps during subsequent chlorination chu et al 2014 shah et al 2011 the results suggested the impact of uv pre treatment was not significant even with increasing uv dosages indicating uv irradiation cannot degrade short oligopeptide precursor effectively the previous study has proved that mp uv photolysis was also not effective in removing free aas cai et al 2019 moreover it can be seen that uv h2o2 better controlled odorous by products formations than uv pre treatment alone it is noteworthy that no free aas were detected after uv or uv h2o2 pre treatments of each short oligopeptide thus it can be concluded that uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments may degrade short oligopeptides through non peptide bond breaking previous studies also demonstrated that the degradation of combined phe by uv photolysis did not involve peptide bond breaking freuze et al 2006 mclean and giese 1950 4 conclusion odorous by products were not only formed from certain free aas during chlorination but also from short oligopeptides that contained those free aas in combined form the short oligopeptides reacted with chlorine producing corresponding free aas which were subsequently chlorinated to form odorous by products in addition the structure of the short oligopeptide influenced the species and amounts of the odorous by products formed furthermore the yields of odorous by products increased with increasing cl n ratios and among the ratio applied in this study reached their maxima at cl n 2 4 the exception was the yield of isovaleraldehydes formed from gly leu which reached its maximum at cl n 1 6 of note although these short oligopeptides tended to form lower concentrations of odorous by products relative to free aas during chlorination the off flavour issues caused by the chlorination of combined aas should also be paid great attention since combined aas were much more abundant in source water than free aas uv and uv h2o2 pre treatments decreased the formation of odorous by products from selected short oligopeptides during subsequent chlorination and the effect of uv h2o2 was better indicating that uv h2o2 can control the off flavour problem caused by chlorination of short oligopeptides to some degree declaration

17951,the adsorption and desorption of cesium cs on clays of contaminated soil in a rhizosphere zone can be greatly affected by various biogeochemical processes the timespans of which are usually months to years herein we present several representative scenarios of the binding of cs on diverse sites of vermiculitized biotite by controlled cs adsorption to particles of different sizes we investigated whether and how the fixed cs in the different scenarios is desorbed by ambient and hydrothermal treatments with several low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas the results showed that the sorbed cs was discriminatively retained in the un collapsed partially collapsed and thoroughly collapsed structures of vermiculites the desorption of the sorbed cs by hydrothermal lmwoas extractions was easily realized in the un collapsed structure but was limited or minimal in the partially collapsed and thoroughly collapsed structures the cs desorption varied in accord with the lmwoa species applied and increased with the acid concentration temperature and number of treating cycles the analysis of cs desorbed specimens confirmed their partial destruction and interlayer expansion suggesting that the underlying mechanism of cs removal by lmwoas involves not only acid dissolution and complexation but also the accelerated weathering of clays within a short time under hydrothermal conditions our findings contribute novel insights into the mobility bioavailability and fate of cs in contaminated soils and its removal from these soils for environmental restorations

hundreds to tens of thousands of bq kg in primary decontamination activities japan ministry of the environment 2018 sakai et al 2014 it remains a great challenge to decontaminate these soils for their clean up sustainable treatment recycling and or long term disposal sato et al 2013 cesium migration into and retention in soils is affected by many factors including the candidate clay mineral species in the soil and coexisting organic matter om e g fungal secretions root exudates and their contents fan et al 2014 park et al 2019 staunton et al 2002 clay minerals especially micaceous phyllosilicates fractions have several types of potential binding sites with different affinities to cs these sites include external planar edge sites that coordinate cs by outer sphere complexation through the electrostatic sorption of positive cs on the negative surfaces and internal interlayer frayed edge sites that are associated with cs by engaging in inner sphere coordination fan et al 2014 the associated cs on the latter type of sites can readily give rise to the interlayer collapse of clays making the removal of cs rather difficult as cs could be safely trapped in the size compatible hexagonal cavities of tetrahedral planar sheets and closely shielded within two adjacent sheets dzene et al 2015 motokawa et al 2014 park et al 2019 yin et al 2017b regarding fukushima soils it has been repeatedly observed that one type of micaceous mineral weathered from the local granites called vermiculite or vermiculitized biotite can adsorb cs to a far greater extent than many other clays or even rob the sorbed cs from other coexisting cs sorbed clays in the same solution possibly contributing to the main fixation and deposition of radiocesium mukai et al 2016a 2016b okamoto et al 2014 organic matter is ubiquitous in soils and may play various significant roles in the mobility of cs due to its association with soil characteristics bondar et al 2003 fan et al 2014 staunton et al 2002 for example before cs is sorbed to clay fractions the existence of om in the soil could block the access of cs to specific internal sites i e frayed edge sites and interlayer sites thus maintaining the association with cs at highly exchangeable sites i e planar edge sites dumat and staunton 1999 once cs is sorbed at these specific sites the further interaction of the om with clay may prevent the release of sorbed cs while enhancing the trapping of cs on these poorly exchangeable sites fan et al 2014 roughly 70 of the contaminated region in fukushima is covered by forests which inevitably promotes the transfer of most of the cs released into the surface organic layers on the forest floor and finally presents the deposited cs within a system of interacted minerals and om in the soil akai et al 2013 several methods of cs separation have been tested for the remediation of cs contaminated soils including the physical separation of phyllosilicate clay by magnetic separation or foam flotation igarashi et al 2014 nishijima et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 electro phytoremediation eapen et al 2006 kim et al 2010 mao et al 2018 2019 sharma et al 2015 cs sublimation by heat treatment with mixed alkali salts honda et al 2017a 2017b acid salty solution elution mukai et al 2018 parajuli et al 2015 and supercritical co2 extraction leybros et al 2016 though much progress has been made with these methods the removal of cs from soil remains problematic due to the limited efficiency of cs removal high reagent energy consumption and or long processing times necessitating the continued development of more options see suppl table s1 notably the hydrothermal treatment of soil with cationic solutions under subcritical conditions was shown to provide effective cs extraction yin et al 2016 2017a 2017c 2018 this treatment efficiently desorbed cs from various types of binding sites especially high affinity binding sites of both micaceous clay and contaminated soil via enhanced cation exchange properties at elevated temperatures with the use of divalent rather than monovalent cations to be specific the divalent cations generally keep larger hydrated radius and higher hydration energy than monovalent ones their replacement for cs will induce an easier interlayer expansion which help to decrease more the migration barrier of interlayer cations and cause to achieve more cs removal yin et al 2017a nevertheless considering the complex composition of soils the effects of hydrothermal treatment of other components mainly oms or their by products on cs desorption are poorly understood generally the oms in soil include various low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas as the products of microbial secretions root exudates and the decomposition of plant animal residue the oms may alter the mobility and bioavailability of radionuclides or heavy metals on various clay minerals at ambient temperature hazotte et al 2016 lusa et al 2015 wendling et al 2005 under subcritical conditions oms may also be converted to lmwoas as a result of biomass hydrolysis liaw and wu 2013 we conducted the present study to assess the effects of the hydrothermal treatment of lmwoas on the desorption of cs from the various binding sites of vermiculitized biotite and we examined the cs removal mechanism the clarification of the effects of the various lmwoas will extend the feasibility of hydrothermal treatments for the whole soil components not only inorganic clay minerals but also oms contributing insights into cs remediation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials partially weathered natural vermiculite from biotite enriched with mg was purchased from vermitech co tokyo and used as the original material the details of its physiochemical and mineralogical properties have been described this material is classified as a 2 1 clay consisting of an octahedral sheet occupied mainly by mg fe and al sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets occupied mainly by si and al kogure et al 2012 yin et al 2017a 2017b we prepared two fractions 0 100 and 100 800 μm for the cs sorption experiments by rinsing raw vermiculite in ethanol and distilled water to remove impurities drying in air at 40 c for 48 h and finally sieving of milled vermiculite particles with 150 grid mesh we selected particles of different sizes based on their varied binding site distributions dzene et al 2015 larger vermiculite lv particles 100 800 μm tend to have higher ratios of internal to total sorption sites promoting more cs adsorption to interlayer sites whereas smaller vermiculite sv particles 0 100 μm keep shorter diffusion paths from edge sides to the center of a particle facilitating an easier penetration of sorbed cs into whole interlayers kogure et al 2012 motokawa et al 2014 we used milli q grade distilled water and analytical grade reagents the lmwoas including acetic malonic pyruvic lactic itaconic succinic maleic malic and citric acids as received from wako pure chemical industries of japan without further purification unless specified otherwise 2 2 the preparation of cs adsorbed vermiculite at different cs loading levels given the diverse clay compositions in soils and the potential heterogeneous distribution of cs on various binding sites of different clays akai et al 2013 we prepared several cs adsorbed vermiculites with different cs adsorption amounts since the fixation of cs on vermiculite is controlled largely by the structural alteration of cs under cs sorption at various loading levels motokawa et al 2014 yin et al 2017a we conducted the adsorption experiments by using a batch wise approach at room temperature large and small vermiculite particles lvs and svs were suspended in cscl solution with an initial cs concentration of 30 100 300 or 1000 ppm mg l at a liquid to solid ratio of 100 ml g with continuous stirring after 1 week which was shown to be sufficient for reaching equilibrium with respect to similar sorption systems dzene et al 2015 kogure et al 2012 motokawa et al 2014 the mixtures were centrifuged and solid to liquid separation was performed by filtering the mixture through a 0 22 μm pore polypropylene membrane here we suggested such time used for cs adsorption would not be long enough to eliminate the diffusion path effect for large and small particles as the interlayer exchange process in situ had been reported to be linear in the square root of time and the larger particles could proceed with a longer slow tail of cs adsorption to timescale of months or years comans et al 1991 fuller et al 2015 pestana et al 2017 these cs adsorbed vermiculites lv cs and sv cs were dried in air at 40 c for 48 h followed by their characterization and cs desorption tests the filtered supernatant was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas spectraa 6200 shimadzu kyoto japan for the quantification of the residual cs concentration which was used to calculate the cs loading amounts with the following equation q c i c f v m where q mg g gives the cs loading amount per unit mass of vermiculite c i and c f ppm are the initial and final cs concentrations in solution before and after adsorption and v m ml g is the liquid to solid ratio used for the adsorption tests the vermiculites sorbed cs from solutions with initial cs concentrations of 100 and 1000 ppm which separately allows cs loading at low and high levels these vermiculites are hereafter referred to as lv low lv high sv high respectively here sv low is not included in the studied group due to its similar cs binding property with that of lv low at low cs loading levels 2 3 cs desorption by extraction with various lmwoas we conducted the lmwoa extracted desorption of cs from its loaded vermiculites by sequential extractions as described yin et al 2018 the desired mass of cs sorbed vermiculite lv low lv high and sv high were mixed with a specific volume of 0 05 0 1 0 3 or 0 5 mol l organic acid under the liquid to solid ratio of 100 ml g the resulting mixture was then subjected to ambient extraction in an end to end shaker for 3 days or to hydrothermal treatment in a temperature controlled 120 280 c cylinder reactor tpr 1 n2 120 taiatsu co tokyo for 0 5 2 h subsequently the solid to liquid separation the drying of the solid cs extracted vermiculites and the quantification of the cs concentration in filtered solution were all performed as described above for cs adsorption for the repetition experiments these treated vermiculites subjected to primary extractions were immediately subjected to the next treatment by their direct dispersion in the same newly prepared acid solution for a total of five cycles of treatment the amounts of the released cations k mg al and fe in addition to cs in each extract were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes finally the cs desorption ratio was determined on the basis of the transfer ratio of cs from the cs sorbed vermiculites to acid solutions as follows cs desorption ratio c e v 1000 m q where q mg g is the cs loading amount per unit mass of vermiculite c e ppm is the cs concentration in the extracted solutions and v m ml g is the liquid to solid ratio used for the desorption tests in present study all the runs of experiments were performed in duplicates and the reported results were the averages of two repetitions 2 4 sample analysis and characterization to observe the structural alterations of vermiculite induced by cs adsorption at different loading levels or desorption under lmwoa extractions we analyzed the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the original vermiculite specimens in two size fractions their cs sorbed vermiculites with different sorption amounts and the cs desorbed vermiculites after lmwoa extraction under various conditions these xrd patterns were recorded at 25 c by a diffractometer smartlab rigaku co tokyo with cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm from 2 to 12 2θ at a continuous scan rate of 1 2θ min and a step interval of 0 01 under 40 kv tube voltage and 30 ma current we used x ray fluorescence spectrometry xrf nex de u s to measure the chemical structural composition of the vermiculites i e the original and treated vermiculites before and after cs adsorption or desorption at the acceleration voltage of 20 kev xrf is a sensitive method for characterizing the cation exchange or dissolution processes involved in the interlayer or layered structure of clay minerals which can be easily measured by the change of the relative content of structural components e g si al constituting a tetrahedral sheet and fe mg al constituting an octahedral sheet and interlayer components e g mg k we carried out a scanning electron microscope sem analysis to discern the morphology changes of the treated specimens on a ve 9800 instrument keyence osaka japan with an accelerating voltage of 30 kev the specimens were ultrasonicated in ethanol solutions for dispersion before sem imaging 3 results and discussion 3 1 the nature of the sites for cs binding on vermiculite fractions of different particle sizes regarding the cs adsorption on the different sized vermiculites the measured loading amounts of cs were approx 10 8 37 9 and 55 1 mg g for lv low lv high and sv high respectively here the higher sorption capacity achieved for the smaller sized vermiculites would be partially attributed to their greater number of total sorption sites created on the planar and edge sides of the fine fraction particles see details in suppl fig s5 a d s6a d to confirm the specific sites for the binding of this sorbed cs we further explored the structural and composition changes of vermiculites after loading cs at different levels by combining xrd and xrf analyses as shown in fig 1 a d both fractions of the original vermiculites lv and sv exhibited similar xrd patterns that showed the featured peaks for a k interlayer 10 1 å and a mg2 interlayer 14 3 å coupled with their random 12 0 12 4 å or regular 25 0 å interstratifications achieving good agreement with previously detected results dzene et al 2015 kikuchi et al 2015 kogure et al 2012 motokawa et al 2014 since the main peaks of the lv and sv were located at 12 0 and 12 4 å corresponding to a random interstratification of mg k interlayers rather than their regular interstratification or their d values kogure et al 2012 this result clearly indicated the moderate weathering of our used vermiculites from biotite and the coexistence of a nearly equivalent number of biotite interlayers with the insertion of anhydrous k and vermiculite interlayers interlaminating hydrous mg2 right cartoons in fig 1a d in addition a minor ca2 impurity was detected for the lv and sv suppl fig s1 suggesting its partial occupation within mg2 interlayers for the cs sorbed vermiculites the xrd pattern of lv low remained nearly the same as that of the original lv fig 1b suppl fig s3 suggesting that cs adsorption at such low levels had insufficiently induced the structural alteration i e interlayer collapse or expansion due to cation exchange of lv and most of these sorbed cs could thus be on accessible external or un collapsed internal sites right cartoon in fig 1b however the xrd pattern of lv high totally disappeared the featured peak corresponding to mg2 interlayer i e 14 3 å but remained the characteristic peak associating with k interlayer i e 10 1 å coupling with its shift of the interstratified peak from 12 4 12 0 å to 11 6 å fig 1c this observation indicated that sorbed cs had preferably broken into the mg2 interlayers rather than k interlayers by an easier cation exchange with hydrous mg2 compared to anhydrous k which could be reasonably interpreted as the results of larger hydrated radius of mg2 in interlayer allowing its easier release from the surfaces hexagonal cavities and larger basal spacing of mg2 interlayer permitting easier migration of interlayer cations kikuchi et al 2015 kogure et al 2012 with the increase in the cs adsorption amounts these collectively sorbed cs would tend to accumulate in mg2 interlayers from the edge side inward in addition due to the relatively low hydration energy of cs the accumulated cs in mg2 interlayers would easily dehydrate and cause an interlayer collapse motokawa et al 2014 once this happens it might strongly prevent the subsequent cs adsorption and lead to the final residual of partial un exchanged mg2 in center regions of lv high particles based on these results we propose that the sorbed cs on lv high were immobilized mainly in wedge like interlayer zones 11 6 å between the edge collapsed cs interlayers and the center expanded mg2 interlayers fig 1c right cartoon in contrast the xrd pattern of sv high completely lost all of the characteristic peaks associated with mg2 interlayers i e not merely the featured peak at 14 3 å but also its interstratified peaks at 25 12 4 and 12 0 å but retained the k interlayer peak at 10 1 å along with appearance of a new peak at 10 7 å which corresponds well to the featured basal spacing of cs mica observed previously fig 1e fuller et al 2015 park et al 2019 with the decrease in the particle size the diffusion paths for cs adsorption from edge side to the center of a particle was shortened thus facilitating the easier penetration of sorbed cs through whole mg2 interlayers for thorough mg2 replacement and finally permitting the strongest fixation of most of the sorbed cs in the completely collapsed interlayers 10 7 å fig 1e right cartoon interestingly all the above mentioned cation exchange processes were further confirmed by our xrf analysis of lv and sv before and after cs adsorption suppl fig s1 demonstrating the negligible change of content for the structural elements of si al fe and interlayer k but the content decrease of interlayer mg and ca with the cs content increase this is in full accord with the cs adsorption amounts on lv low lv high and sv high revealed by the liquid solution analysis these results confirmed the main location of sorbed cs to different binding sites of vermiculites with changes in the cs loading amounts and particle size i e cs in the un collapsed structure of lv low the partially collapsed structure of lv high and the thoroughly collapsed structure of sv high we thus conducted desorption tests to evaluate the extraction abilities of lmwoas for the removal of cs in each of these scenarios 3 2 easy removal of cs from the un collapsed structure of lv low by lmwoa extraction we first investigated the cs desorption from lv low fig 2 a illustrates the cs extraction from lv low by ambient or hydrothermal treatment with various lmwoas in both the ambient and hydrothermal treatment conditions the ratio of cs desorption depended on the lmwoa species and it increased showing the following trend h2o acetic succinic malic citric acid a similar extraction trend was observed for these organic acids when they were used to extract radioactive 137cs from contaminated soils chiang et al 2011 these results can be plausibly explained as the results of the increase in the number of carboxyl groups from acetic to citric acid for which the latter one has a smaller or more negative value of pka a term used to express the logarithmic scale of acidity for different acids see suppl table s2 allowing its release of more protons h via carboxyl ionizing for the exchange of cs from various accessible binding sites of lv low nevertheless the cs desorption ratio produced by treatment with lmwoas at room temperature was considerably low prolonged extraction for 3 days removed only 8 of the cs even with the most efficient acid i e citric acid showing results that were similar to those obtained previously for the extraction of 137cs from contaminated soils 2 5 chiang et al 2011 notably in sharp contrast to the limited cs removal 4 8 by our ambient treatment the desorption of cs was greatly boosted under subcritical conditions in which the cs desorption ratio reached with the use of each specific acid increased 9 10 fold 30 70 when treated at 200 c even for 30 min indicating the important impact of the treatment temperature on the desorption of cs liu et al 2003a yin et al 2017c to further test the dependence of the cs extraction on the temperature treatment duration and number of treatment cycles we treated lv low with citric acid at varying temperatures from 120 to 280 c for durations of 0 5 2 h with up to five cycles as shown in fig 2b the desorption ratio of cs indeed increased significantly 47 4 75 5 with the increase in the treatment temperature from 120 to 250 c but at 280 c the ratio suddenly decreased to 52 4 this remarkable result might be attributable to the enhanced carboxyl ionization of citric acid at medium temperatures 20 250 c fig s2 and further its gradual decomposition or conversion into other lower molecular weight organic acids at relatively high temperature i e 280 c chu and clydesdale 1976 suggesting that not only the ionized h but also the free citrate played important roles in the desorption of cs similarly the cs desorption ratio hardly changed with the treatment duration 70 6 76 5 from the treatment duration of 0 5 2 h fig 2c but it increased greatly with the number of cycles of acid extraction 70 6 95 4 from the 1st to the 5th repetition fig 2d suggesting that the h was not the only factor controlling the cs desorption some other factors such as reducing concentration of desorbed cs built up in eluted solution could possibly promote the proceeding of the reversible cs extraction and gain its removal as a result the vast majority of the sorbed cs 95 4 could be easily removed from the lv low ensuring its negligible structural change suppl fig s3 by hydrothermal treatment with several cycles of lmwoas in good agreement with the aforementioned dominant cs binding on the various accessible sites i e planar edge un collapsed interlayer sites of lv low shown in fig 1b 3 3 inhibited cs removal from partially collapsed lv high by lmwoa extraction considering our finding that the structural alteration of the sorption of cs on vermiculite was strictly controlled by loading cs at different levels yin et al 2017a we further investigated the desorption of cs from lv with various initial cs loading amounts at 200 c as shown in fig 3 a the cs desorption ratio decreased significantly with the increase of the cs sorption amount specifically citric acid easily removed most of the cs 70 6 from the lvs loaded with cs to 10 8 mg g 28 5 of the saturation adsorption amount but it poorly extracted cs 13 2 from the lvs loaded with 27 4 mg g cs 72 3 of the saturation adsorption amount since a collective structural alteration of vermiculite generally occurred with the cs loading at 50 of the saturation level cornell 1993 the afore mentioned inhibition of cs desorption at high cs loading values was thus reasonably attributed to the partial interlayer collapse fig 1c verifying the great difficulty of removing trapped cs from a collapsed interlayer by directly extraction using an lmwoa we then systematically studied the cs extraction from lv high cs loading 37 9 mg g intercalating most of its sorbed cs in partially collapsed interlayers as the function of the extraction lmwoa species and the number of treatment cycles at 250 c for all of the lmwoas applied the cs desorption ratio achieved by one off treatment varied distinctly for the lmwoas in the following order acetic malonic pyruvic lactic itaconic succinic maleic malic citric acid fig 3b exhibiting a trend that is similar to that of their ability to extract cs from lv low fig 2a as such all of the cs desorption ratios reached for each lmwoa were somewhat low typically 24 6 even for the most efficient citric acid however this situation could be greatly turned around by increasing the total number of treatment cycles rather than the treating time as the cumulative ratio of cs desorption rose to 90 after five cycles of citric acid treatment but achieved negligible increase with extending treating time from 0 5 to 2 h fig 3c fig s4a nevertheless it should be noted that renewing the lmwoa treatment caused a weight loss of the treated specimens to a certain degree 25 wt after the fifth renewal which we speculate is a result of the lmwoas partial dissolution or decomposition in acid solutions suppl table s3 under the subcritical treating conditions to examine the structural dissolution more closely we recorded sem images for as prepared and cs desorbed lv highs at 10 to 200 μm magnification the sem images taken after citric acid treatment revealed poor porosity of the lv high samples but modified morphology as a plate like structure see details in suppl fig s5 e h we also measured the amounts of cations released from lv high in each cycle of treatment and the results verifying the main release of mg k and a minor release of al fe during citric acid extraction fig 3d similar results were obtained by the xrf analysis of the treated lv highs in different cycles which showed noticeable decreases in the relative contents of cs k and mg ca but increases in those of si al and fe fig 1e demonstrating the preferential removal of interlayer cations i e cs k and mg ca but the increasing residual removal of structural elements i e si al and fe in treated lv highs as the acid extractions proceeded in addition compared with the non treated lv high the xrd patterns of treated lv highs confirmed the shift of the partially cs collapsed peak from 11 6 å to 12 0 å and the reappearance of the regularly interstratified peak at 25 0 å after one off treatment plus the reappearance of the 14 3 å peak after five extractions fig 3f based on the above described observations of the composition and structural changes of lv high before and after treatment we speculate that these primarily dissolved structural components mainly mg note that mg exists as both structural and interlayer components and al fe probably entered both the mg ca cs co collapsed and k self collapsed interlayers for cationic exchange thus causing the expansion to the partially collapsed interlayers i e mg al fe in 14 3 å in fig 3f ensuring a back release of interlayer cs k and mg ca into the treated solutions fig 3d and the final increase in the residual of al fe in the treated solid samples fig 3e 3 4 minimal cs removal from thoroughly collapsed sv high by lmwoa extraction fig 4 provides the results of cs extraction from the sv high cs loading 55 1 mg g which fixed the sorbed cs dominantly into thoroughly collapsed interlayers by treatment with various lmwoas and different acid concentrations at 250 c the lmwoa extracted cs desorption varied widely for the three applied acids as follows acetic malic citric acid this desorption also increased steadily with the increase in the concentration of the acetic malic and citric acid from 0 05 to 0 5 m i e 11 1 15 8 15 6 33 5 and 17 8 43 7 respectively fig 4a however negligible increase of cs desorption 17 8 18 9 was found by extending time of citric acid extraction from 0 5 to 2 h fig s4b suggesting the heating time fairly played a marginal role in the process of cs removal and the cs removal would be limited by diffusion especially to or from the interlayer or frayed edge sites as the result citric acid thus provided the lowest ratio of cs desorption from sv high 17 8 compared to those from lv low 75 5 and lv high 24 6 under the same treatment conditions i e with 0 05 m citric acid at 250 c for 0 5 h again confirming the increasing difficulty of cs extraction from accessible external sites to partially and then to thoroughly collapsed interlayer sites yin et al 2017b we next explored the structural dissolutions of sv high by these three organic acids in light of their above observed distinct abilities for cs extraction the one off treatment of sv high with mono carboxylic acetic acid barely caused the release of all cations except partial mg at acid concentrations higher than 0 5 m fig 4b which suggested the negligible dissolution of sv high particles by this acid agreeing well with its insufficient cs extraction performances fig 4a similar results were revealed by the xrf analysis of the treated samples with acetic acid at different concentrations which presented a minimal change of the relative contents for both the structural components of al fe and the interlayered components of mg ca k compared to that of sv high fig 4e by contrast bi carboxylic malic acid and tri carboxylic citric acid separately induced the main release of mg fe 6 2 16 3 and 1 7 20 7 mm and mg and fe and k 7 2 27 2 0 4 4 9 and 1 0 5 3 mm from sv high to varying degrees with the increase in the treatment concentration from 0 05 to 0 5 m fig 4c and d which corresponded well with the relative content decreases of mg fe cs and mg ca fe k and cs in the malic and citric acid treated samples fig 4e these results imply the distinct approaches of these acids to dissolve the sv high particles with the resulting selective cationic removal we thus further conducted additional extractions of sv high by multiple cycles of continuous mineral and organic acid treatment we sought to distinguish the overall phyllosilicate dissolving processes by various organic acids against nitric acid as a reference interestingly the results revealed the poor removal of cs 20 from sv high with an insignificant digestion of the other main compositions e g si al fe mg k after triple repetitions of treatment with a high concentration of acetic acid 0 5m suppl figs s7 and s8 indicating the overall mild dissolving abilities of this acid for dissolving the sv high and that this is the main cause of the release of cs to the surface complexation in contrast the triple repetition of 0 5 m malic and citric acid treatments caused a significant removal of nearly all of the cs 90 and high amounts of mg fe but also accumulations of si and al in the final treated residuals suppl figs s7 and s8 suggesting the stronger abilities of these two acids for the preferential dissolving of octahedral rather than tetrahedral sheets of the vermiculite layer for the subsequent releases of cs and k indeed the sem imaging of the citric acid treated specimens revealed the disappearance of small particle clasts due to acid dissolution more cracks a layered structure and even honeycomb holes on the surface of the fine particles suppl figs s6e h to clarify the cs removal process from the vermiculite by lmwoa extractions we recorded the xrd patterns of treated sv highs at different acid concentrations and treatment cycles to compare the patterns with those of sv samples before and after cs adsorption as illustrated in fig 4f the single treatment of sv high even by the most efficient acid for cs desorption i e citric acid only slightly shifted the characteristic peak of cs interlayers 10 7 å to the left 10 9 å indicating that the primary cs removal during the first acid extraction was mainly from external sites rather than collapsed interlayer sites with the increasing in the acid concentration or number of treatment cycles the sv highs treated with acetic malic or citric acids all showed the complete disappearance of the cs peak 10 7 å but not the k peak 10 1 å and all of the characteristic peaks i e both the featured interlayer peaks at 14 0 14 3 å and their interstratified peaks at 24 8 25 4 11 8 12 0 å reappeared corresponding to the hydrous multivalent cation e g mg2 al3 and fe3 occupied interlayers confirming the diffusion of these cations into the cs interlayers better than the k interlayers to leave a multicomponent interstratified structure like that of the original sv figs 1d and 4f these results demonstrated that several repetitions of lmwoa extraction at low acid concentration under subcritical conditions e g three cycles of 0 05 m acid treatment at 250 c would not irreversibly destroy the crystal structure of even small fractions of phyllosilicates but may partially induce their dissolution on the edge side with the release of some structural ions more interestingly the released or solubilized cations such as mg2 al3 and fe3 might preferentially penetrate into cs rather than k thoroughly collapsed interlayers fig 4f thus promoting the prior removal of cs over k from clay minerals fig 4e suppl fig s7 this concept is entirely consistent with our previous observations of cs desorption by the hydrothermal treatment of cs sorbed clays in mg solutions yin et al 2019 noting the successive cs desorption from clays by multiple extraction cycles one may expect the complete removal of cs from contaminated soil by continuous leaching in a column reactor for the practical restoration application 3 5 the roles of lmwoas in cs desorption from different binding sites of clay minerals and the implications for soil restoration one of our main interests in this investigation was whether by controlling the cs loading amount on different sized particles of vermiculite the dominantly sorbed cs would be retained in three representative scenarios the un collapsed structure of lv low the partially collapsed structure of lv high and the thoroughly collapsed structure of sv high to mimic all of the types of cs that are bound to different binding sites i e accessible planar edge un collapsed interlayer sites frayed edge sites fess and collapsed interlayer sites of clay minerals in actual soils for a comprehensive desorption test we also sought to ascertain whether and how the fixed cs in different scenarios would be desorbed by ambient or hydrothermal treatment with various lmwoas our findings provide novel significant insights to the mobility bioavailability and fate of cs in cs contaminated soils and the removal of cs from these soils for environmental restoration in a general soil with extensive vegetation such as the fukushima forest regions abundant organic matter will be present in the soil rhizosphere as the result of exudates from plant roots and microorganisms e g fungi and bacteria or decomposed residuals of biomasses akai et al 2013 as key components of this organic matter the lmwoas could induce various actions in the weathering of the phyllosilicate clays as the main reactive solid phase for cs retention and further alter the interactions of cs with clays thus affecting the cs biological availability in the soil hazotte et al 2016 staunton et al 2002 several research groups have thus studied the various effects of lmwoas or exudates from living organisms on the adsorption and desorption of radionuclides and heavy metals to clay minerals or their direct uptake by plants sasaki et al 2012 wendling et al 2004 2005 for example wendling et al reported that the treatment of illite with bacterial exudates caused its partial al dissolution increased its weathering produced more frayed edge sites and significantly enhanced the cs desorption from the illite wendling et al 2005 huang et al observed that treatment with citric acid greatly increased the metal bioavailability in uranium contaminated soil and gave rise to a large increase in the uranium accumulation in selected plants huang et al 1998 together these past findings and our present results suggest phytoremediation as a plausible strategy for the effective remediation of cs contaminated soil lee 2013 however our present findings clearly suggested that the tested lmwoas could potentially extract most of the cs from the external planar and edge sites or un collapsed interlayer sites fig 2 but the lmwoas were greatly prohibited or minimal in the direct extraction of cs from the partially and thoroughly collapsed interlayers figs 3 and 4 even by a single overwhelming treatment in subcritical conditions the trace amounts of radiocesium that have been deposited in fukushima contaminated soils since 2011 were expected to be rapidly sorbed primarily by clay minerals initially on accessible external sites or fess however several recent studies indicated that the initially sorbed cs on these external sites or fess would not merely remain in the same position rather they would slowly penetrate into energetically favorable interlayer sites through a direct exchange with neighboring k in entirely collapsed interlayers even with no water over the long term comans et al 1991 de koning and comans 2004 fuller et al 2015 liu et al 2003b pestana et al 2017 if this is indeed the case since nearly 9 years have passed since the fukushima nuclear power plant accident in march 2011 a significant amount of accidently released radiocesium in the fukushima region would have been likely to be dominantly fixed into nonexchangeable cs k co collapsed interlayers via interlaminar diffusion which could also be supported by our previous observations that cs was negligibly removed from fukushima contaminated soils even by abundant extraction with h2o at 250 c or mg2 at 60 c yin et al 2018 2019 in light of our present findings the remediation of cs contaminated soils by phytoremediation might be the most feasible within the initial period of months after cs contamination accident and then gradually become inefficient with the passage of years regarding the mechanism of mineral weathering for the removal of cs induced by organic acids or living organism exudates different routes have been considered chiang et al 2011 wendling et al 2005 chiang et al suggested that the lmwoa extracted desorption of cs from contaminated soil can be ascribed to their complexation with al and fe of mineral edges or surfaces which resulted in mineral decomposition and a subsequent cs release chiang et al 2011 similarly robert et al attributed the weathering actions of lmwoas for soil minerals to acid dissolution hydrolysis and complexation drever and vance 1994 among these acid dissolution was speculated to be the primary factor as the extractions of mica by citric and oxalic acids led primarily to the destruction of the mica rather than both its destruction and interlayer expansion however our present results revealed the interlayer expansion of cs depleted lv high and sv high samples in addition to the above mentioned acid dissolution and complexation mechanisms following the hydrothermal treatment with lmwoas figs 3 and 4 the observed expansion of the collapsed interlayers in our samples compared to the un expanded mica in previous studies is likely to be due mainly to the accelerated weathering of lv high or sv high within a short time at elevated treatment temperatures in detail these ionized h from lmwoas can not only induce partial cs desorption from external sites by direct ion exchange but also promote mineral dissolution with the releasing of various cations mg2 ca2 al3 and fe3 etc in figs 3 and 4 which in turn initiates a marked cation exchange with interlayer cs for its back release under subcritical conditions and the expansion of the collapsed interlayers figs 3f and 4f based on the previous and present findings we propose that hydrothermal treatment with lmwoms will remove cs from all of the potential binding sites i e accessible planar and edge sites fess and collapsed interlayer sites on soil minerals through the accelerated clay weathering mechanism our findings may advance the application of hydrothermal treatment in the remediation of cs contaminated soils typically for the ones which are rich of both organic biomass and inorganic clay minerals as in the case of fukushima regions takatsuka et al 2016 4 conclusions in present study the adsorption and desorption of cs on a typical clay of contaminated soil were investigated by controlled cs binding to diverse sites of vermiculitized biotite and further its extraction with ambient or hydrothermal treatments in several low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas it was concluded that poorly sorbed cs on large particles of vermiculite caused the dominant cs binding to accessible sites planar edge expanded interlayer sites within un collapsed structure from which the cs was easily desorbed 70 6 by hydrothermal than ambient lmwoas extraction however saturated cs adsorption on large and small particles of vermiculite separately maintained the overwhelming cs binding to partially and thoroughly collapsed interlayer sites from which the cs desorption were greatly inhibited 24 6 and varied in accord with the lmwoa species applied notably the cs removal from these latter two cases were significantly improved 43 7 90 with the increase of extracted lmwoas concentration temperature and number of treating cycles the structural analysis of cs desorbed specimens confirmed their partial destruction and interlayer expansion which were explained as the mineral dissolution with releasing various cations mg2 ca2 al3 and fe3 and their subsequent cation exchange with interlayer cs for its selective back release suggesting the underlying mechanisms of cs removal to not only acid dissolution and complexation but also the accelerated weathering of clays in hydrothermal condition all these findings were expected to contribute novel insights into the mobility bioavailability and fate of cs in contaminated soils and its removal from these soils for environmental restorations notes the authors declare no

17951,the adsorption and desorption of cesium cs on clays of contaminated soil in a rhizosphere zone can be greatly affected by various biogeochemical processes the timespans of which are usually months to years herein we present several representative scenarios of the binding of cs on diverse sites of vermiculitized biotite by controlled cs adsorption to particles of different sizes we investigated whether and how the fixed cs in the different scenarios is desorbed by ambient and hydrothermal treatments with several low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas the results showed that the sorbed cs was discriminatively retained in the un collapsed partially collapsed and thoroughly collapsed structures of vermiculites the desorption of the sorbed cs by hydrothermal lmwoas extractions was easily realized in the un collapsed structure but was limited or minimal in the partially collapsed and thoroughly collapsed structures the cs desorption varied in accord with the lmwoa species applied and increased with the acid concentration temperature and number of treating cycles the analysis of cs desorbed specimens confirmed their partial destruction and interlayer expansion suggesting that the underlying mechanism of cs removal by lmwoas involves not only acid dissolution and complexation but also the accelerated weathering of clays within a short time under hydrothermal conditions our findings contribute novel insights into the mobility bioavailability and fate of cs in contaminated soils and its removal from these soils for environmental restorations

in the soil and coexisting organic matter om e g fungal secretions root exudates and their contents fan et al 2014 park et al 2019 staunton et al 2002 clay minerals especially micaceous phyllosilicates fractions have several types of potential binding sites with different affinities to cs these sites include external planar edge sites that coordinate cs by outer sphere complexation through the electrostatic sorption of positive cs on the negative surfaces and internal interlayer frayed edge sites that are associated with cs by engaging in inner sphere coordination fan et al 2014 the associated cs on the latter type of sites can readily give rise to the interlayer collapse of clays making the removal of cs rather difficult as cs could be safely trapped in the size compatible hexagonal cavities of tetrahedral planar sheets and closely shielded within two adjacent sheets dzene et al 2015 motokawa et al 2014 park et al 2019 yin et al 2017b regarding fukushima soils it has been repeatedly observed that one type of micaceous mineral weathered from the local granites called vermiculite or vermiculitized biotite can adsorb cs to a far greater extent than many other clays or even rob the sorbed cs from other coexisting cs sorbed clays in the same solution possibly contributing to the main fixation and deposition of radiocesium mukai et al 2016a 2016b okamoto et al 2014 organic matter is ubiquitous in soils and may play various significant roles in the mobility of cs due to its association with soil characteristics bondar et al 2003 fan et al 2014 staunton et al 2002 for example before cs is sorbed to clay fractions the existence of om in the soil could block the access of cs to specific internal sites i e frayed edge sites and interlayer sites thus maintaining the association with cs at highly exchangeable sites i e planar edge sites dumat and staunton 1999 once cs is sorbed at these specific sites the further interaction of the om with clay may prevent the release of sorbed cs while enhancing the trapping of cs on these poorly exchangeable sites fan et al 2014 roughly 70 of the contaminated region in fukushima is covered by forests which inevitably promotes the transfer of most of the cs released into the surface organic layers on the forest floor and finally presents the deposited cs within a system of interacted minerals and om in the soil akai et al 2013 several methods of cs separation have been tested for the remediation of cs contaminated soils including the physical separation of phyllosilicate clay by magnetic separation or foam flotation igarashi et al 2014 nishijima et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 electro phytoremediation eapen et al 2006 kim et al 2010 mao et al 2018 2019 sharma et al 2015 cs sublimation by heat treatment with mixed alkali salts honda et al 2017a 2017b acid salty solution elution mukai et al 2018 parajuli et al 2015 and supercritical co2 extraction leybros et al 2016 though much progress has been made with these methods the removal of cs from soil remains problematic due to the limited efficiency of cs removal high reagent energy consumption and or long processing times necessitating the continued development of more options see suppl table s1 notably the hydrothermal treatment of soil with cationic solutions under subcritical conditions was shown to provide effective cs extraction yin et al 2016 2017a 2017c 2018 this treatment efficiently desorbed cs from various types of binding sites especially high affinity binding sites of both micaceous clay and contaminated soil via enhanced cation exchange properties at elevated temperatures with the use of divalent rather than monovalent cations to be specific the divalent cations generally keep larger hydrated radius and higher hydration energy than monovalent ones their replacement for cs will induce an easier interlayer expansion which help to decrease more the migration barrier of interlayer cations and cause to achieve more cs removal yin et al 2017a nevertheless considering the complex composition of soils the effects of hydrothermal treatment of other components mainly oms or their by products on cs desorption are poorly understood generally the oms in soil include various low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas as the products of microbial secretions root exudates and the decomposition of plant animal residue the oms may alter the mobility and bioavailability of radionuclides or heavy metals on various clay minerals at ambient temperature hazotte et al 2016 lusa et al 2015 wendling et al 2005 under subcritical conditions oms may also be converted to lmwoas as a result of biomass hydrolysis liaw and wu 2013 we conducted the present study to assess the effects of the hydrothermal treatment of lmwoas on the desorption of cs from the various binding sites of vermiculitized biotite and we examined the cs removal mechanism the clarification of the effects of the various lmwoas will extend the feasibility of hydrothermal treatments for the whole soil components not only inorganic clay minerals but also oms contributing insights into cs remediation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials partially weathered natural vermiculite from biotite enriched with mg was purchased from vermitech co tokyo and used as the original material the details of its physiochemical and mineralogical properties have been described this material is classified as a 2 1 clay consisting of an octahedral sheet occupied mainly by mg fe and al sandwiched between two tetrahedral sheets occupied mainly by si and al kogure et al 2012 yin et al 2017a 2017b we prepared two fractions 0 100 and 100 800 μm for the cs sorption experiments by rinsing raw vermiculite in ethanol and distilled water to remove impurities drying in air at 40 c for 48 h and finally sieving of milled vermiculite particles with 150 grid mesh we selected particles of different sizes based on their varied binding site distributions dzene et al 2015 larger vermiculite lv particles 100 800 μm tend to have higher ratios of internal to total sorption sites promoting more cs adsorption to interlayer sites whereas smaller vermiculite sv particles 0 100 μm keep shorter diffusion paths from edge sides to the center of a particle facilitating an easier penetration of sorbed cs into whole interlayers kogure et al 2012 motokawa et al 2014 we used milli q grade distilled water and analytical grade reagents the lmwoas including acetic malonic pyruvic lactic itaconic succinic maleic malic and citric acids as received from wako pure chemical industries of japan without further purification unless specified otherwise 2 2 the preparation of cs adsorbed vermiculite at different cs loading levels given the diverse clay compositions in soils and the potential heterogeneous distribution of cs on various binding sites of different clays akai et al 2013 we prepared several cs adsorbed vermiculites with different cs adsorption amounts since the fixation of cs on vermiculite is controlled largely by the structural alteration of cs under cs sorption at various loading levels motokawa et al 2014 yin et al 2017a we conducted the adsorption experiments by using a batch wise approach at room temperature large and small vermiculite particles lvs and svs were suspended in cscl solution with an initial cs concentration of 30 100 300 or 1000 ppm mg l at a liquid to solid ratio of 100 ml g with continuous stirring after 1 week which was shown to be sufficient for reaching equilibrium with respect to similar sorption systems dzene et al 2015 kogure et al 2012 motokawa et al 2014 the mixtures were centrifuged and solid to liquid separation was performed by filtering the mixture through a 0 22 μm pore polypropylene membrane here we suggested such time used for cs adsorption would not be long enough to eliminate the diffusion path effect for large and small particles as the interlayer exchange process in situ had been reported to be linear in the square root of time and the larger particles could proceed with a longer slow tail of cs adsorption to timescale of months or years comans et al 1991 fuller et al 2015 pestana et al 2017 these cs adsorbed vermiculites lv cs and sv cs were dried in air at 40 c for 48 h followed by their characterization and cs desorption tests the filtered supernatant was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas spectraa 6200 shimadzu kyoto japan for the quantification of the residual cs concentration which was used to calculate the cs loading amounts with the following equation q c i c f v m where q mg g gives the cs loading amount per unit mass of vermiculite c i and c f ppm are the initial and final cs concentrations in solution before and after adsorption and v m ml g is the liquid to solid ratio used for the adsorption tests the vermiculites sorbed cs from solutions with initial cs concentrations of 100 and 1000 ppm which separately allows cs loading at low and high levels these vermiculites are hereafter referred to as lv low lv high sv high respectively here sv low is not included in the studied group due to its similar cs binding property with that of lv low at low cs loading levels 2 3 cs desorption by extraction with various lmwoas we conducted the lmwoa extracted desorption of cs from its loaded vermiculites by sequential extractions as described yin et al 2018 the desired mass of cs sorbed vermiculite lv low lv high and sv high were mixed with a specific volume of 0 05 0 1 0 3 or 0 5 mol l organic acid under the liquid to solid ratio of 100 ml g the resulting mixture was then subjected to ambient extraction in an end to end shaker for 3 days or to hydrothermal treatment in a temperature controlled 120 280 c cylinder reactor tpr 1 n2 120 taiatsu co tokyo for 0 5 2 h subsequently the solid to liquid separation the drying of the solid cs extracted vermiculites and the quantification of the cs concentration in filtered solution were all performed as described above for cs adsorption for the repetition experiments these treated vermiculites subjected to primary extractions were immediately subjected to the next treatment by their direct dispersion in the same newly prepared acid solution for a total of five cycles of treatment the amounts of the released cations k mg al and fe in addition to cs in each extract were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes finally the cs desorption ratio was determined on the basis of the transfer ratio of cs from the cs sorbed vermiculites to acid solutions as follows cs desorption ratio c e v 1000 m q where q mg g is the cs loading amount per unit mass of vermiculite c e ppm is the cs concentration in the extracted solutions and v m ml g is the liquid to solid ratio used for the desorption tests in present study all the runs of experiments were performed in duplicates and the reported results were the averages of two repetitions 2 4 sample analysis and characterization to observe the structural alterations of vermiculite induced by cs adsorption at different loading levels or desorption under lmwoa extractions we analyzed the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the original vermiculite specimens in two size fractions their cs sorbed vermiculites with different sorption amounts and the cs desorbed vermiculites after lmwoa extraction under various conditions these xrd patterns were recorded at 25 c by a diffractometer smartlab rigaku co tokyo with cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm from 2 to 12 2θ at a continuous scan rate of 1 2θ min and a step interval of 0 01 under 40 kv tube voltage and 30 ma current we used x ray fluorescence spectrometry xrf nex de u s to measure the chemical structural composition of the vermiculites i e the original and treated vermiculites before and after cs adsorption or desorption at the acceleration voltage of 20 kev xrf is a sensitive method for characterizing the cation exchange or dissolution processes involved in the interlayer or layered structure of clay minerals which can be easily measured by the change of the relative content of structural components e g si al constituting a tetrahedral sheet and fe mg al constituting an octahedral sheet and interlayer components e g mg k we carried out a scanning electron microscope sem analysis to discern the morphology changes of the treated specimens on a ve 9800 instrument keyence osaka japan with an accelerating voltage of 30 kev the specimens were ultrasonicated in ethanol solutions for dispersion before sem imaging 3 results and discussion 3 1 the nature of the sites for cs binding on vermiculite fractions of different particle sizes regarding the cs adsorption on the different sized vermiculites the measured loading amounts of cs were approx 10 8 37 9 and 55 1 mg g for lv low lv high and sv high respectively here the higher sorption capacity achieved for the smaller sized vermiculites would be partially attributed to their greater number of total sorption sites created on the planar and edge sides of the fine fraction particles see details in suppl fig s5 a d s6a d to confirm the specific sites for the binding of this sorbed cs we further explored the structural and composition changes of vermiculites after loading cs at different levels by combining xrd and xrf analyses as shown in fig 1 a d both fractions of the original vermiculites lv and sv exhibited similar xrd patterns that showed the featured peaks for a k interlayer 10 1 å and a mg2 interlayer 14 3 å coupled with their random 12 0 12 4 å or regular 25 0 å interstratifications achieving good agreement with previously detected results dzene et al 2015 kikuchi et al 2015 kogure et al 2012 motokawa et al 2014 since the main peaks of the lv and sv were located at 12 0 and 12 4 å corresponding to a random interstratification of mg k interlayers rather than their regular interstratification or their d values kogure et al 2012 this result clearly indicated the moderate weathering of our used vermiculites from biotite and the coexistence of a nearly equivalent number of biotite interlayers with the insertion of anhydrous k and vermiculite interlayers interlaminating hydrous mg2 right cartoons in fig 1a d in addition a minor ca2 impurity was detected for the lv and sv suppl fig s1 suggesting its partial occupation within mg2 interlayers for the cs sorbed vermiculites the xrd pattern of lv low remained nearly the same as that of the original lv fig 1b suppl fig s3 suggesting that cs adsorption at such low levels had insufficiently induced the structural alteration i e interlayer collapse or expansion due to cation exchange of lv and most of these sorbed cs could thus be on accessible external or un collapsed internal sites right cartoon in fig 1b however the xrd pattern of lv high totally disappeared the featured peak corresponding to mg2 interlayer i e 14 3 å but remained the characteristic peak associating with k interlayer i e 10 1 å coupling with its shift of the interstratified peak from 12 4 12 0 å to 11 6 å fig 1c this observation indicated that sorbed cs had preferably broken into the mg2 interlayers rather than k interlayers by an easier cation exchange with hydrous mg2 compared to anhydrous k which could be reasonably interpreted as the results of larger hydrated radius of mg2 in interlayer allowing its easier release from the surfaces hexagonal cavities and larger basal spacing of mg2 interlayer permitting easier migration of interlayer cations kikuchi et al 2015 kogure et al 2012 with the increase in the cs adsorption amounts these collectively sorbed cs would tend to accumulate in mg2 interlayers from the edge side inward in addition due to the relatively low hydration energy of cs the accumulated cs in mg2 interlayers would easily dehydrate and cause an interlayer collapse motokawa et al 2014 once this happens it might strongly prevent the subsequent cs adsorption and lead to the final residual of partial un exchanged mg2 in center regions of lv high particles based on these results we propose that the sorbed cs on lv high were immobilized mainly in wedge like interlayer zones 11 6 å between the edge collapsed cs interlayers and the center expanded mg2 interlayers fig 1c right cartoon in contrast the xrd pattern of sv high completely lost all of the characteristic peaks associated with mg2 interlayers i e not merely the featured peak at 14 3 å but also its interstratified peaks at 25 12 4 and 12 0 å but retained the k interlayer peak at 10 1 å along with appearance of a new peak at 10 7 å which corresponds well to the featured basal spacing of cs mica observed previously fig 1e fuller et al 2015 park et al 2019 with the decrease in the particle size the diffusion paths for cs adsorption from edge side to the center of a particle was shortened thus facilitating the easier penetration of sorbed cs through whole mg2 interlayers for thorough mg2 replacement and finally permitting the strongest fixation of most of the sorbed cs in the completely collapsed interlayers 10 7 å fig 1e right cartoon interestingly all the above mentioned cation exchange processes were further confirmed by our xrf analysis of lv and sv before and after cs adsorption suppl fig s1 demonstrating the negligible change of content for the structural elements of si al fe and interlayer k but the content decrease of interlayer mg and ca with the cs content increase this is in full accord with the cs adsorption amounts on lv low lv high and sv high revealed by the liquid solution analysis these results confirmed the main location of sorbed cs to different binding sites of vermiculites with changes in the cs loading amounts and particle size i e cs in the un collapsed structure of lv low the partially collapsed structure of lv high and the thoroughly collapsed structure of sv high we thus conducted desorption tests to evaluate the extraction abilities of lmwoas for the removal of cs in each of these scenarios 3 2 easy removal of cs from the un collapsed structure of lv low by lmwoa extraction we first investigated the cs desorption from lv low fig 2 a illustrates the cs extraction from lv low by ambient or hydrothermal treatment with various lmwoas in both the ambient and hydrothermal treatment conditions the ratio of cs desorption depended on the lmwoa species and it increased showing the following trend h2o acetic succinic malic citric acid a similar extraction trend was observed for these organic acids when they were used to extract radioactive 137cs from contaminated soils chiang et al 2011 these results can be plausibly explained as the results of the increase in the number of carboxyl groups from acetic to citric acid for which the latter one has a smaller or more negative value of pka a term used to express the logarithmic scale of acidity for different acids see suppl table s2 allowing its release of more protons h via carboxyl ionizing for the exchange of cs from various accessible binding sites of lv low nevertheless the cs desorption ratio produced by treatment with lmwoas at room temperature was considerably low prolonged extraction for 3 days removed only 8 of the cs even with the most efficient acid i e citric acid showing results that were similar to those obtained previously for the extraction of 137cs from contaminated soils 2 5 chiang et al 2011 notably in sharp contrast to the limited cs removal 4 8 by our ambient treatment the desorption of cs was greatly boosted under subcritical conditions in which the cs desorption ratio reached with the use of each specific acid increased 9 10 fold 30 70 when treated at 200 c even for 30 min indicating the important impact of the treatment temperature on the desorption of cs liu et al 2003a yin et al 2017c to further test the dependence of the cs extraction on the temperature treatment duration and number of treatment cycles we treated lv low with citric acid at varying temperatures from 120 to 280 c for durations of 0 5 2 h with up to five cycles as shown in fig 2b the desorption ratio of cs indeed increased significantly 47 4 75 5 with the increase in the treatment temperature from 120 to 250 c but at 280 c the ratio suddenly decreased to 52 4 this remarkable result might be attributable to the enhanced carboxyl ionization of citric acid at medium temperatures 20 250 c fig s2 and further its gradual decomposition or conversion into other lower molecular weight organic acids at relatively high temperature i e 280 c chu and clydesdale 1976 suggesting that not only the ionized h but also the free citrate played important roles in the desorption of cs similarly the cs desorption ratio hardly changed with the treatment duration 70 6 76 5 from the treatment duration of 0 5 2 h fig 2c but it increased greatly with the number of cycles of acid extraction 70 6 95 4 from the 1st to the 5th repetition fig 2d suggesting that the h was not the only factor controlling the cs desorption some other factors such as reducing concentration of desorbed cs built up in eluted solution could possibly promote the proceeding of the reversible cs extraction and gain its removal as a result the vast majority of the sorbed cs 95 4 could be easily removed from the lv low ensuring its negligible structural change suppl fig s3 by hydrothermal treatment with several cycles of lmwoas in good agreement with the aforementioned dominant cs binding on the various accessible sites i e planar edge un collapsed interlayer sites of lv low shown in fig 1b 3 3 inhibited cs removal from partially collapsed lv high by lmwoa extraction considering our finding that the structural alteration of the sorption of cs on vermiculite was strictly controlled by loading cs at different levels yin et al 2017a we further investigated the desorption of cs from lv with various initial cs loading amounts at 200 c as shown in fig 3 a the cs desorption ratio decreased significantly with the increase of the cs sorption amount specifically citric acid easily removed most of the cs 70 6 from the lvs loaded with cs to 10 8 mg g 28 5 of the saturation adsorption amount but it poorly extracted cs 13 2 from the lvs loaded with 27 4 mg g cs 72 3 of the saturation adsorption amount since a collective structural alteration of vermiculite generally occurred with the cs loading at 50 of the saturation level cornell 1993 the afore mentioned inhibition of cs desorption at high cs loading values was thus reasonably attributed to the partial interlayer collapse fig 1c verifying the great difficulty of removing trapped cs from a collapsed interlayer by directly extraction using an lmwoa we then systematically studied the cs extraction from lv high cs loading 37 9 mg g intercalating most of its sorbed cs in partially collapsed interlayers as the function of the extraction lmwoa species and the number of treatment cycles at 250 c for all of the lmwoas applied the cs desorption ratio achieved by one off treatment varied distinctly for the lmwoas in the following order acetic malonic pyruvic lactic itaconic succinic maleic malic citric acid fig 3b exhibiting a trend that is similar to that of their ability to extract cs from lv low fig 2a as such all of the cs desorption ratios reached for each lmwoa were somewhat low typically 24 6 even for the most efficient citric acid however this situation could be greatly turned around by increasing the total number of treatment cycles rather than the treating time as the cumulative ratio of cs desorption rose to 90 after five cycles of citric acid treatment but achieved negligible increase with extending treating time from 0 5 to 2 h fig 3c fig s4a nevertheless it should be noted that renewing the lmwoa treatment caused a weight loss of the treated specimens to a certain degree 25 wt after the fifth renewal which we speculate is a result of the lmwoas partial dissolution or decomposition in acid solutions suppl table s3 under the subcritical treating conditions to examine the structural dissolution more closely we recorded sem images for as prepared and cs desorbed lv highs at 10 to 200 μm magnification the sem images taken after citric acid treatment revealed poor porosity of the lv high samples but modified morphology as a plate like structure see details in suppl fig s5 e h we also measured the amounts of cations released from lv high in each cycle of treatment and the results verifying the main release of mg k and a minor release of al fe during citric acid extraction fig 3d similar results were obtained by the xrf analysis of the treated lv highs in different cycles which showed noticeable decreases in the relative contents of cs k and mg ca but increases in those of si al and fe fig 1e demonstrating the preferential removal of interlayer cations i e cs k and mg ca but the increasing residual removal of structural elements i e si al and fe in treated lv highs as the acid extractions proceeded in addition compared with the non treated lv high the xrd patterns of treated lv highs confirmed the shift of the partially cs collapsed peak from 11 6 å to 12 0 å and the reappearance of the regularly interstratified peak at 25 0 å after one off treatment plus the reappearance of the 14 3 å peak after five extractions fig 3f based on the above described observations of the composition and structural changes of lv high before and after treatment we speculate that these primarily dissolved structural components mainly mg note that mg exists as both structural and interlayer components and al fe probably entered both the mg ca cs co collapsed and k self collapsed interlayers for cationic exchange thus causing the expansion to the partially collapsed interlayers i e mg al fe in 14 3 å in fig 3f ensuring a back release of interlayer cs k and mg ca into the treated solutions fig 3d and the final increase in the residual of al fe in the treated solid samples fig 3e 3 4 minimal cs removal from thoroughly collapsed sv high by lmwoa extraction fig 4 provides the results of cs extraction from the sv high cs loading 55 1 mg g which fixed the sorbed cs dominantly into thoroughly collapsed interlayers by treatment with various lmwoas and different acid concentrations at 250 c the lmwoa extracted cs desorption varied widely for the three applied acids as follows acetic malic citric acid this desorption also increased steadily with the increase in the concentration of the acetic malic and citric acid from 0 05 to 0 5 m i e 11 1 15 8 15 6 33 5 and 17 8 43 7 respectively fig 4a however negligible increase of cs desorption 17 8 18 9 was found by extending time of citric acid extraction from 0 5 to 2 h fig s4b suggesting the heating time fairly played a marginal role in the process of cs removal and the cs removal would be limited by diffusion especially to or from the interlayer or frayed edge sites as the result citric acid thus provided the lowest ratio of cs desorption from sv high 17 8 compared to those from lv low 75 5 and lv high 24 6 under the same treatment conditions i e with 0 05 m citric acid at 250 c for 0 5 h again confirming the increasing difficulty of cs extraction from accessible external sites to partially and then to thoroughly collapsed interlayer sites yin et al 2017b we next explored the structural dissolutions of sv high by these three organic acids in light of their above observed distinct abilities for cs extraction the one off treatment of sv high with mono carboxylic acetic acid barely caused the release of all cations except partial mg at acid concentrations higher than 0 5 m fig 4b which suggested the negligible dissolution of sv high particles by this acid agreeing well with its insufficient cs extraction performances fig 4a similar results were revealed by the xrf analysis of the treated samples with acetic acid at different concentrations which presented a minimal change of the relative contents for both the structural components of al fe and the interlayered components of mg ca k compared to that of sv high fig 4e by contrast bi carboxylic malic acid and tri carboxylic citric acid separately induced the main release of mg fe 6 2 16 3 and 1 7 20 7 mm and mg and fe and k 7 2 27 2 0 4 4 9 and 1 0 5 3 mm from sv high to varying degrees with the increase in the treatment concentration from 0 05 to 0 5 m fig 4c and d which corresponded well with the relative content decreases of mg fe cs and mg ca fe k and cs in the malic and citric acid treated samples fig 4e these results imply the distinct approaches of these acids to dissolve the sv high particles with the resulting selective cationic removal we thus further conducted additional extractions of sv high by multiple cycles of continuous mineral and organic acid treatment we sought to distinguish the overall phyllosilicate dissolving processes by various organic acids against nitric acid as a reference interestingly the results revealed the poor removal of cs 20 from sv high with an insignificant digestion of the other main compositions e g si al fe mg k after triple repetitions of treatment with a high concentration of acetic acid 0 5m suppl figs s7 and s8 indicating the overall mild dissolving abilities of this acid for dissolving the sv high and that this is the main cause of the release of cs to the surface complexation in contrast the triple repetition of 0 5 m malic and citric acid treatments caused a significant removal of nearly all of the cs 90 and high amounts of mg fe but also accumulations of si and al in the final treated residuals suppl figs s7 and s8 suggesting the stronger abilities of these two acids for the preferential dissolving of octahedral rather than tetrahedral sheets of the vermiculite layer for the subsequent releases of cs and k indeed the sem imaging of the citric acid treated specimens revealed the disappearance of small particle clasts due to acid dissolution more cracks a layered structure and even honeycomb holes on the surface of the fine particles suppl figs s6e h to clarify the cs removal process from the vermiculite by lmwoa extractions we recorded the xrd patterns of treated sv highs at different acid concentrations and treatment cycles to compare the patterns with those of sv samples before and after cs adsorption as illustrated in fig 4f the single treatment of sv high even by the most efficient acid for cs desorption i e citric acid only slightly shifted the characteristic peak of cs interlayers 10 7 å to the left 10 9 å indicating that the primary cs removal during the first acid extraction was mainly from external sites rather than collapsed interlayer sites with the increasing in the acid concentration or number of treatment cycles the sv highs treated with acetic malic or citric acids all showed the complete disappearance of the cs peak 10 7 å but not the k peak 10 1 å and all of the characteristic peaks i e both the featured interlayer peaks at 14 0 14 3 å and their interstratified peaks at 24 8 25 4 11 8 12 0 å reappeared corresponding to the hydrous multivalent cation e g mg2 al3 and fe3 occupied interlayers confirming the diffusion of these cations into the cs interlayers better than the k interlayers to leave a multicomponent interstratified structure like that of the original sv figs 1d and 4f these results demonstrated that several repetitions of lmwoa extraction at low acid concentration under subcritical conditions e g three cycles of 0 05 m acid treatment at 250 c would not irreversibly destroy the crystal structure of even small fractions of phyllosilicates but may partially induce their dissolution on the edge side with the release of some structural ions more interestingly the released or solubilized cations such as mg2 al3 and fe3 might preferentially penetrate into cs rather than k thoroughly collapsed interlayers fig 4f thus promoting the prior removal of cs over k from clay minerals fig 4e suppl fig s7 this concept is entirely consistent with our previous observations of cs desorption by the hydrothermal treatment of cs sorbed clays in mg solutions yin et al 2019 noting the successive cs desorption from clays by multiple extraction cycles one may expect the complete removal of cs from contaminated soil by continuous leaching in a column reactor for the practical restoration application 3 5 the roles of lmwoas in cs desorption from different binding sites of clay minerals and the implications for soil restoration one of our main interests in this investigation was whether by controlling the cs loading amount on different sized particles of vermiculite the dominantly sorbed cs would be retained in three representative scenarios the un collapsed structure of lv low the partially collapsed structure of lv high and the thoroughly collapsed structure of sv high to mimic all of the types of cs that are bound to different binding sites i e accessible planar edge un collapsed interlayer sites frayed edge sites fess and collapsed interlayer sites of clay minerals in actual soils for a comprehensive desorption test we also sought to ascertain whether and how the fixed cs in different scenarios would be desorbed by ambient or hydrothermal treatment with various lmwoas our findings provide novel significant insights to the mobility bioavailability and fate of cs in cs contaminated soils and the removal of cs from these soils for environmental restoration in a general soil with extensive vegetation such as the fukushima forest regions abundant organic matter will be present in the soil rhizosphere as the result of exudates from plant roots and microorganisms e g fungi and bacteria or decomposed residuals of biomasses akai et al 2013 as key components of this organic matter the lmwoas could induce various actions in the weathering of the phyllosilicate clays as the main reactive solid phase for cs retention and further alter the interactions of cs with clays thus affecting the cs biological availability in the soil hazotte et al 2016 staunton et al 2002 several research groups have thus studied the various effects of lmwoas or exudates from living organisms on the adsorption and desorption of radionuclides and heavy metals to clay minerals or their direct uptake by plants sasaki et al 2012 wendling et al 2004 2005 for example wendling et al reported that the treatment of illite with bacterial exudates caused its partial al dissolution increased its weathering produced more frayed edge sites and significantly enhanced the cs desorption from the illite wendling et al 2005 huang et al observed that treatment with citric acid greatly increased the metal bioavailability in uranium contaminated soil and gave rise to a large increase in the uranium accumulation in selected plants huang et al 1998 together these past findings and our present results suggest phytoremediation as a plausible strategy for the effective remediation of cs contaminated soil lee 2013 however our present findings clearly suggested that the tested lmwoas could potentially extract most of the cs from the external planar and edge sites or un collapsed interlayer sites fig 2 but the lmwoas were greatly prohibited or minimal in the direct extraction of cs from the partially and thoroughly collapsed interlayers figs 3 and 4 even by a single overwhelming treatment in subcritical conditions the trace amounts of radiocesium that have been deposited in fukushima contaminated soils since 2011 were expected to be rapidly sorbed primarily by clay minerals initially on accessible external sites or fess however several recent studies indicated that the initially sorbed cs on these external sites or fess would not merely remain in the same position rather they would slowly penetrate into energetically favorable interlayer sites through a direct exchange with neighboring k in entirely collapsed interlayers even with no water over the long term comans et al 1991 de koning and comans 2004 fuller et al 2015 liu et al 2003b pestana et al 2017 if this is indeed the case since nearly 9 years have passed since the fukushima nuclear power plant accident in march 2011 a significant amount of accidently released radiocesium in the fukushima region would have been likely to be dominantly fixed into nonexchangeable cs k co collapsed interlayers via interlaminar diffusion which could also be supported by our previous observations that cs was negligibly removed from fukushima contaminated soils even by abundant extraction with h2o at 250 c or mg2 at 60 c yin et al 2018 2019 in light of our present findings the remediation of cs contaminated soils by phytoremediation might be the most feasible within the initial period of months after cs contamination accident and then gradually become inefficient with the passage of years regarding the mechanism of mineral weathering for the removal of cs induced by organic acids or living organism exudates different routes have been considered chiang et al 2011 wendling et al 2005 chiang et al suggested that the lmwoa extracted desorption of cs from contaminated soil can be ascribed to their complexation with al and fe of mineral edges or surfaces which resulted in mineral decomposition and a subsequent cs release chiang et al 2011 similarly robert et al attributed the weathering actions of lmwoas for soil minerals to acid dissolution hydrolysis and complexation drever and vance 1994 among these acid dissolution was speculated to be the primary factor as the extractions of mica by citric and oxalic acids led primarily to the destruction of the mica rather than both its destruction and interlayer expansion however our present results revealed the interlayer expansion of cs depleted lv high and sv high samples in addition to the above mentioned acid dissolution and complexation mechanisms following the hydrothermal treatment with lmwoas figs 3 and 4 the observed expansion of the collapsed interlayers in our samples compared to the un expanded mica in previous studies is likely to be due mainly to the accelerated weathering of lv high or sv high within a short time at elevated treatment temperatures in detail these ionized h from lmwoas can not only induce partial cs desorption from external sites by direct ion exchange but also promote mineral dissolution with the releasing of various cations mg2 ca2 al3 and fe3 etc in figs 3 and 4 which in turn initiates a marked cation exchange with interlayer cs for its back release under subcritical conditions and the expansion of the collapsed interlayers figs 3f and 4f based on the previous and present findings we propose that hydrothermal treatment with lmwoms will remove cs from all of the potential binding sites i e accessible planar and edge sites fess and collapsed interlayer sites on soil minerals through the accelerated clay weathering mechanism our findings may advance the application of hydrothermal treatment in the remediation of cs contaminated soils typically for the ones which are rich of both organic biomass and inorganic clay minerals as in the case of fukushima regions takatsuka et al 2016 4 conclusions in present study the adsorption and desorption of cs on a typical clay of contaminated soil were investigated by controlled cs binding to diverse sites of vermiculitized biotite and further its extraction with ambient or hydrothermal treatments in several low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas it was concluded that poorly sorbed cs on large particles of vermiculite caused the dominant cs binding to accessible sites planar edge expanded interlayer sites within un collapsed structure from which the cs was easily desorbed 70 6 by hydrothermal than ambient lmwoas extraction however saturated cs adsorption on large and small particles of vermiculite separately maintained the overwhelming cs binding to partially and thoroughly collapsed interlayer sites from which the cs desorption were greatly inhibited 24 6 and varied in accord with the lmwoa species applied notably the cs removal from these latter two cases were significantly improved 43 7 90 with the increase of extracted lmwoas concentration temperature and number of treating cycles the structural analysis of cs desorbed specimens confirmed their partial destruction and interlayer expansion which were explained as the mineral dissolution with releasing various cations mg2 ca2 al3 and fe3 and their subsequent cation exchange with interlayer cs for its selective back release suggesting the underlying mechanisms of cs removal to not only acid dissolution and complexation but also the accelerated weathering of clays in hydrothermal condition all these findings were expected to contribute novel insights into the mobility bioavailability and fate of cs in contaminated soils and its removal from these soils for environmental restorations notes the authors declare no

17952,in the 21st century sludge disposal and resource recycling are global issues titanium coagulation has received increasing attention due its strong coagulation capability and sludge recycling titanium coagulation is highly efficient for the treatment of algae laden micro polluted surface water however the safe disposal of titanium coagulated algae rich sludge remains a challenge here we report on the recycling of titanium coagulated algae rich sludge for the production of functional tio2 nanoflowers tnfs through a simple hydrothermal and calcination process anatase tnfs particle size of 10 15 nm with petal like structures mesoporous relatively high specific surface areas i e 299 4 m2g 1 and low band gaps i e 2 67 ev compared to p 25 were obtained additionally oxygen vacancy ov was generated on the surface of the recycled tnfs based on electron paramagnetic resonance epr results which were verified by the first principles calculations within density functional theory these tnfs display high photocatalytic performance for the degradation of diverse phenolic organic contaminants such as bisphenol a diphenyl phenol p tert butyl phenol and resorcinol i e 95 under mild ultraviolet light irradiation and without any sacrificial reagents formation of ov on tnfs not only efficiently inhibited the recombination of photo generated electrons and holes but also facilitated contaminant adsorption and photo generated electron transfer on the surface of the recycled tnfs thereby promoting the generation of holes and hydroxyl and superoxide radicals which were regarded as the reactive oxygen species for attacking contaminants in the reactions this study proposes a new perspective on recycling chemical coagulated sludge for producing functional nanomaterials as photocatalysts graphical abstract image 1 keywords polytitanium coagulation sludge recycling tio2 nanoflowers photocatalytic reaction density functional theory calculation 1 introduction conventional aluminium based and iron based salts have gained attention in research as universal coagulants for the purification of surface water rich in algae pei et al 2017a 2017b qi et al 2018 however the toxicity of residual aluminium and high effluent turbidity of iron based coagulants after coagulation pose a chronic threat to human health ferrari et al 2017 hufnagel et al 2018 chorghe et al 2017 moreover the quantity of algae rich coagulated sludge generated is high which poses further disposal problems jordan and paul 2015 fangzhou et al 2015 dumping sludge into the sea using sludge in agriculture and horticulture digesting sludge anaerobically and treating sludge with acid has resulted in high costs low utilisation rates and secondary pollution neither of making these options suitable for sludge disposal yi et al 2016 powell et al 2016 yang et al 2015 consequently not only is there an urgent need to develop efficient and innocuous coagulants for water treatment but the issue of safe disposal of algae rich coagulated sludge is increasingly perceived as one of the most severe environmental challenges with the development of the titanium industry researchers have begun to pay more attention to the utilisation of titanium based salts due to their abundant reserves and hypotoxicity jin et al 2018 moy et al 2016 walker 2017 novel polytitanium coagulants have recently been applied in the simultaneous removal of natural organic matter nom and algal organic matter aom due to their superior coagulation performance compared to conventional aluminium based and iron based coagulants wang et al 2017a 2018a jia et al 2017 loganathan et al 2018 one of the most prominent advantages of titanium based coagulation is its ability to recycle coagulated sludge producing functional tio2 nanoparticles shon et al 2010 huang et al 2015 it has been demonstrated that tio2 may be responsible for the degradation of organic contaminants as an outstanding semiconductor of photocatalytic materials in water treatment wang et al 2017b giordano et al 2016 hamandi et al 2017 peng et al 2017 therefore many researchers have improved the photocatalytic activity of tio2 by preparing different tio2 nanostructures such as nanosphere nanoflowers nanotubes nanowires and nanofibers from pristine tio2 using electrochemical solution chemical based and template based synthesis methods wang et al 2018b shaban et al 2018 wu et al 2017 gherardi et al 2018 yen et al 2017 the hydrothermal method is an efficient economic and simple synthetic method with few operational risks by controlling the ph of a solution during the hydrothermal process the nanoparticle morphology and structure can be easily adjusted moreover the tio2 nanoflowers tnfs produced by treating tio2 nanoparticles with a 10 n naoh aqueous solution in the hydrothermal environment were reportedly superior in photocatalysis compared with other tio2 nanostructures mali et al 2014 little research has been published concerning the development of cost effective and environmentally friendly methods for recycling the algae rich sludge this study was aimed at producing functional tnfs from algae rich titanium coagulated sludge through hydrothermal and calcination methods the photocatalytic performance of the tnfs was evaluated by the degradation of phenolic contaminants such as bisphenol a bpa diphenyl phenol dpp p tert butyl phenol ptbp and resorcinol the underlying mechanisms of degrading phenolic contaminants were included and particularly influenced by the density functional theory dft 2 experimental section 2 1 test water coagulants and coagulation microcystis aeruginosa fachb 905 purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china was selected for this study it was grown in bg11 media at a controlled temperature of 25 1 c with light emitting diode illumination in a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle and was harvested during the logarithmic phase 12 15 d rao et al 2017 before coagulation the simulated algae laden test water was prepared as follows the harvested suspension of algae was diluted with yellow river water which was then filtered using a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester mce membrane to remove original large particles to achieve an algae cell density of 106 cells ml polytitanium tetrachloride ptc prepared with a basicity value of 1 5 was applied as the coagulant coagulation tests were performed using a programmable jar tester my 3000 6m wuhan meiyu co ltd china details about the basic physicochemical parameters of the test water preparation of the coagulant and coagulation procedures are presented in the supporting information s1 2 2 sludge recovery the detailed preparation of tnfs and morphological changes of ti loaded sludge are shown in scheme 1 a after coagulation the ptc coagulated sludge was collected and dried at 105 c for 12 h the oven dried sludge was then grinded into powder size 0 154 mm scheme 1b and calcined at 600 c heating rate of 5 c min in a muffle furnace for 12 h to produce tio2 nanoparticles scheme 1c for improved crystallinity and product performance based on previous studies and our preliminary research shon et al 2010 saliby et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 the 1 5 g tio2 nanoparticles were then dispersed into 70 ml of naoh solution 10 m and magnetically stirred for 1 h followed by a hydrothermal reaction at 140 c for 24 h in a teflon reactor the resulting solution was centrifuged and the precipitates were washed in hcl 0 1 m and deionised di water to neutral conditions followed by oven drying at 80 c finally the dried sediments were calcined at 300 600 c at 100 c intervals in a muffle furnace for 2 h to obtain the tio2 nanomaterials which were named tnfs 300 nanorods tnfs 400 nanosheets tnfs 500 nanoflowers and tnfs 600 nanosheets schemes 1d 1e 1f and 1g respectively 2 3 characterisation of the tnfs the crystallinity and phase structure of the tnfs were measured using an x ray diffractometer xrd bruker d8 germany and the morphological features chemical bonds and elemental compositions were identified using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s2500 japan high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem jem 2100f japan energy disperse spectroscope eds ie250x max50 uk and x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps thermo escalab 250xi usa the tnf brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas and pore structures were monitored using a micromeritic instrument asap2460 usa the photoluminescence pl emission spectra and ultraviolet visible uv vis diffused reflectance spectrum drs measurements were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer fluoromax 4 japan and uv vis spectrophotometer pe lambda 750s usa respectively the electron paramagnetic resonance epr signals of radicals spin trapped by 5 5 dimethyl 1pyrroline n oxide dmpo and oxygen vacancies ovs were detected using the epr spectrometer bruker a300 germany 2 4 photocatalytic performance of the tnfs the degradation of bpa dpp ptbp and resorcinol in aqueous solutions were observed to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the tnfs first 50 mg of tnfs were added to the foulant bpa dpp ptbp or resorcinol water solution 50 ml at various concentrations followed by constant stirring for 30 min in the dark to achieve the equilibrium of adsorption desorption between the photocatalysts and contaminants prior to illumination the initial ph of the suspension was approximately 7 during the reaction then the solution was irradiated under a high pressure 400 w hg uv lamp ggz400 cn with a primary emission of 365 nm and the distance from the reactor to the illuminant was 17 cm finally the aliquot was withdrawn at the predetermined time intervals followed by measuring the residual contaminants after filtering the solution with the 0 45 μm mce membrane the residual concentration of bpa was measured with a high performance liquid chromatograph 1260 infinity ii agilent usa and dpp ptbp and resorcinol were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1810 persee detailed information regarding the analytical methods for the degradation of each foulant are shown in the supporting information s2 the degradation efficiency of the contaminants is expressed as 1 r c c 0 where c is the residual concentration and c0 is the initial concentration of the contaminants conditional experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of photocatalyst dosage initial ph contaminant concentration and nom on photocatalytic performance bpa was utilised as the representative contaminant and tnfs 500 was utilised as the representative photocatalyst the solution ph was adjusted using hcl 0 1 m or naoh 0 1 m and only one parameter was changed in each conditional experiment the experimental data were based on triplicate tests moreover to investigate the photocatalytic stability of the tnfs recycling experiments were designed and conducted as follows after the photocatalytic experiments the resulting tnfs were separated from the aqueous suspension through centrifugation followed by washing with ethanol and di water five times to completely remove the residual contaminants the tnfs were then oven dried at 80 c and used again for the degradation test this cycle was repeated seven times 2 5 dft calculations the first principles calculations within dft were implemented using the vienna ab initio simulation package kresse and hafner 1994 a generalised gradient approximation in the form of a perdew burke ernzerhof functional was adopted to describe the electron electron interactions perdew et al 1996 the energy cut off employed for the plane wave expansion of electron wavefunctions was set to 500 ev and the electron ion interactions were treated using projector augmented wave potentials kresse and joubert 1999 the dft d3 method was applied to include long range van der waals interactions for adsorption on substrate lattices grimme et al 2011 the substrate lattices were cut along the 100 direction while a vacuum region of approximately 15 å was applied along the z direction to avoid a mirror interaction between neighbouring images structural optimisation was carried out using a conjugate gradient method until the remaining force on each atom was less than 0 05 ev å 3 results and discussion 3 1 crystal and microstructure analysis the xrd patterns of the tnfs fig 1 exhibited a number of peaks at approximately 25 3 37 8 48 0 53 9 55 1 and 62 7 corresponding to the 101 004 200 105 211 and 204 planes of the anatase tio2 respectively min et al 2017 torralvo et al 2018 thus the tnfs presented the dominant anatase crystal phase specifically the crystal characteristics become more defined with an increase in incineration temperature characteristic rutile phase peaks rarely appeared which indicated that the transformation of the crystal structure did not even occur at 600 c of tnf calcination the tnfs 500 was selected as the representative concentration for measuring morphology due to its superior photocatalytic activity the sem images clearly depict the petaloid morphological structure of the tnfs 500 fig 2 a and b suggesting that the petal like sheets grow vertically on the original surface of the tio2 nanoparticles to form the tio2 nanoflowers from the tem and hrtem images fig 2c and d the lattice fringes of the tnfs 500 displayed the expected lattice spacing of 0 352 nm which matched sufficiently with the those of the 101 crystal plane of anatase tio2 ling et al 2017 li et al 2017a the results agree with the xrd pattern shown in fig 1 the eds mapping displayed a uniform distribution of both o and ti implying the existence of o and ti in tnfs 500 fig 2e f and 2g fig s1 the bet measurements examined the porous nature of the tnf samples generally the n2 adsorption isotherms corresponded to the international union of pure and applied chemistry type iv with a typical type of h2 hysteresis loop which indicated the existence of tnf mesoporous characteristics fig 3 a setvin et al 2017 the pore size distribution calculated according to the barrett joyner halenda method revealed that most of the mesopores fell into the size range of 2 nm 20 nm fig 3b which likely reflected the slit spaces between the small nanosheets huang et al 2019 the tnfs 500 possessed the smallest bet surface area of 83 4 m2g 1 and pore volume of 0 32 nm but it exhibited the largest average pore size of 14 9 nm out of the tnfs samples table s2 in general the photocatalytic performance of the photocatalysts can be facilitated by increasing the bet surface area through the adsorption of contaminants during the photocatalytic process therefore the bet surface area was probably not responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of tnfs 500 in this study 3 2 chemical composition and bonds analysis the representative tnfs 500 was utilised for xps measurements to gain an understanding of the chemical bonds and elemental compositions fig 4 the xps survey spectrum of the tnfs 500 reveals that ti o and c can be clearly detected by the main peaks of ti 2p o 1s and c 1s indicating the existence of c in addition to ti and o fig 4a which had already been demonstrated by previous the eds mapping results the high resolution spectra of ti 2p exhibited two peaks caused by the spinorbit splitting that were centred at 463 7 ev and 457 9 ev which can be ascribed to ti 2p1 2 and ti 2p3 2 respectively fig 4b duan et al 2017a the splitting energy between ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 is 5 8 ev indicating a normal state of ti4 which is the same result as previously reported ying et al 2015 the high resolution spectra of o 1s included three peaks at 529 2 ev 530 3 ev and 531 7 ev corresponding to the o2 ti o ti and ti o c bonds respectively fig 4c bharti et al 2016 li et al 2017b the high resolution spectra of c 1s can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 285 7 ev c o bond and 284 7 ev c c bond fig 4d yang et al 2018 thus c can exist in tnfs 500 but at a low percentage based on the lack of its distribution evidenced by the eds mapping fig 2e f and 2g in addition c was not doped into the tnfs 500 lattice as demonstrated by the lack of the characteristic peak of the ti c bond at approximately 282 0 ev and it can likely be doped into the tnfs 500 as interstitial carbon outside of the lattice moya et al 2015 the binding energies of the anatase tio2 were 464 3 ev ti 2p1 2 458 5 ev ti 2p3 2 529 8 ev ti o ti and 531 6 ev ti o c for ti 2p and o 1s as reported in previous literature liu et al 2018a li et al 2018a when comparing the tnfs 500 in this study and the anatase tio2 from previous literature with regard to both ti and o one unanticipated finding was that a non ignorable shift in binding energies for both ti and o probably demonstrated the formation of ov on the surface of tnfs 500 in addition the formation of ov which can be responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of tnfs fig 6a can be further confirmed by the results of the epr spectra fig 5 a and this finding is discussed in detail in section 3 3 3 3 epr spectra pl emission spectra and uv vis drs spectrum analysis the generation of ov on the surface of tnfs 300 tnfs 400 tnfs 500 and tnfs 600 was illustrated by the epr spectra with the conspicuous signal located at g 2 003 resulting from the ov captured electrons fig 5a li et al 2018b nath et al 2019 the existence of a ti3 site was not observed based on the absence of a epr spectroscopy signal at g 1 98 aristidou et al 2017 wang et al 2018c ovs had been previously reported to enhance the photocatalytic oxidation capability of anatase nano tio2 bharti et al 2016 of the four samples the highest ov signal intensity was detected in tnfs 500 illustrating that more ov was generated simply through the calcination on the surface of tnfs 500 this may be the reason for the superior photocatalytic activity of the tnfs in terms of bpa degradation fig 6 another key parameter influencing the photocatalytic capability is the photogenerated electron hole pair recombination rate which is typically evaluated by a pl spectrum duan et al 2017b chen et al 2017 generally the stronger the pl signal the higher the photogenerated electron hole recombination rate and therefore the lower the photocatalytic capability compared with the tnfs obtained at 300 c 400 c and 600 c tnfs 500 presented the weakest pl signal intensity fig 5b which indicated its stronger photocatalytic ability the tnfs 500 showed a higher ov intensity with a lower pl signal which indicated that the photocatalytic activity of tnfs 500 was probably enhanced by the lower recombination rate of the photogenerated electron hole pairs because of the increased ov formation liang et al 2018 additionally results from the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum measurement presented higher absorbance values in the uv region for tnfs 500 fig 5c which has been reported to facilitate photocatalytic reactions yen et al 2017 tnf band gaps originated from the corresponding uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum fig 5d in accordance with eq 2 2 α h v a h v e g n 2 where α ν h eg and n are the absorption coefficient optical frequency planck constant band gap and semiconductor transition characteristic respectively accordingly the band gaps of tnfs 300 tnfs 400 tnfs 500 and tnfs 600 were approximately 2 67 ev 2 58 ev 2 53 ev and 2 63 ev respectively which were smaller than that of the pure anatase tio2 semiconductor 3 2 ev generally c doping into the tio2 lattice and the formation of ov on the surface of tio2 can be considered responsible for the narrower band gaps of nano tio2 xu et al 2018 in this study c was not doped into the tio2 lattice as demonstrated by the lack of ti c bonds in the c 1s xps spectra results therefore c doping into the tio2 lattice can be ruled out implying that narrower band gaps of tnfs samples can be induced and probably ascribed to the formation of ovs 3 4 photocatalytic activity of the tnfs as a typical contaminant from the manufacturing industry bpa is commonly found in water due to its pervasive application in plastic packaging bpa is a potential risk to human health and water reuse wang et al 2019 photocatalysis has been proven to be an efficient method for degrading bpa in water purification processes abdelraheem et al 2019 in this study there was no decrease in bpa concentration without the presence of a photocatalyst in the bpa aqueous solution after uv light irradiation implying that the pure photolysis was not responsible for bpa degradation the tnfs displayed a strong capability to degrade bpa fig 6a specifically the degradation efficiency of bpa first significantly increased and then decreased with an increase in tnf calcination temperature as indicated by tnfs 500 achieving the highest bpa degradation efficiency of approximately 95 which was 25 and 17 higher than that of tnfs 300 and tnfs 600 after 2 h of uv light irradiation respectively although the tnf bet surface area decreased with an increase in calcination temperature from 300 to 500 c greater amounts of lattice oxygen fell off from the tio2 crystal lattice to form ov thereby resulting in an increase in ov on the surface of the tnfs based on the epr results fig 5a the tnfs 500 with the maximum ov showed the lowest recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs out of the four samples based on the pl results fig 5b according to these results it can be concluded that the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs can be inhibited by increasing the ovs on the surface of tnfs instead of the size of bet surface area thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity of tnfs which is in agreement with the pl and epr spectra results in addition possible pathways for bpa degradation are presented in the supporting information scheme s1 with the results showing its probable mineralisation into co2 and h2o as the final products through photogenerated holes superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals qiu et al 2012 liu et al 2018 tnfs 500 was used as the representative sample for the stability test after the photocatalytic experiments the resultant tnfs were separated from the aqueous suspension through centrifugation followed by washing with ethanol and di water five times to completely remove the residual contaminants the tnfs were then oven dried at 80 c and used again for the degradation this cycle was repeated seven times the results indicated that the photocatalytic activity of tnfs 500 remained nearly stable during the photocatalytic degradation of bpa as the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bpa was more than 80 even after being recycled seven times fig 6b in summary the reusable characteristic of tnfs recycled efficiently through an ethanol rinsing process that possess potential value for applications and generalisation in water treatment phenolic compounds with a benzene ring molecular structure similar to bpa such as dpp ptbp and resorcinol are ubiquitous in wastewater and removal are in urgent need due to their hypertoxicity and mutagenicity in water environments wang et al 2016 yan et al 2018 husøy et al 2019 to further evaluate the practical application value of tnfs in water purification tnfs 500 was applied for their degradation with the results suggesting up to 95 removal of dpp ptbp and resorcinol after 4 h of uv light irradiation fig 7 a similar to the bpa case the degradation of the other three contaminants was hardly observed without the addition of tnfs as photocatalysts fig s2 which implied that the pure photolysis did not degrade dpp ptbp or resorcinol the absorption peaks centred at 282 nm 274 nm and 273 nm were attributed to ptbp dpp and resorcinol respectively the results showed a gradual decrease in the peak intensity with increasing irradiation time followed by the complete degradation of these three phenolic compounds after 4 h of uv light irradiation fig 7b c and 7d the ring opening reactions were typically involved in the degradation process of the phenolic compounds and resorcinol possess the fewest benzene ring in the molecular structure of the four phenolic compounds karrer et al 2019 qi et al 2020 duan et al 2020 therefore tnfs 500 exhibited stronger photocatalytic activity related to the degradation of resorcinol than that of the other three phenolic compounds which can likely be attributed to the fact that the benzene ring in the molecular structure of resorcinol can be more easily broken down through ring opening reactions in summary tnfs have promising application prospects in the degradation of phenolic compounds which can be found in industrial wastewaters such as petrochemical dye and pesticide wastewaters it is commonly accepted that photocatalyst dosage plays a critical role in the photocatalytic process and the degradation efficiency of bpa by a photocatalyst under uv light is potentially affected by environmental factors including initial contaminant concentration ph and humic acid ha in water tan et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019 in this study tnfs 500 was applied to evaluate the effect of the variable reaction condition on bpa degradation including photocatalyst dosage fig 8 a initial bpa concentration fig 8b initial ph fig 8c and initial ha concentration fig 8d to better simulate the actual bpa and ha concentration conditions in surface water four varied bpa and ha concentrations in the ranges of 5 50 ppm and 5 30 ppm were utilised respectively the results demonstrated that 1 light quantity and particle aggregation can result in slight improvements in the degradation efficiency of bpa in addition to further increasing the photocatalyst dosage 2 few inhibitions of active sites on the surface of tnfs 500 occur in solutions with low bpa concentrations 3 electrostatic attraction is in favour of bpa adsorption leading to a higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency and 4 competition for photocatalytic active sites between ha and bpa molecules inhibited the photocatalytic activity of tnfs 500 in bpa degradation under uv light irradiation detailed information about the experimental conditions are presented in the supporting information s4 3 5 photocatalytic mechanism insight to investigate the interactions between bpa and the corresponding substrates fig 9 the adsorption energy was defined as follows 3 eads e sub bpa e sub e bpa where e sub bpa e sub and e bpa correspond to the total energies of the substrates and bpa an isolated substrate and bpa respectively the more negative value of the vacancy model 0 07 ev atom suggests a strong chemisorption and the spontaneous exothermic process of the reaction compared with the vacancy free model 0 05 ev atom to elucidate the interaction mechanism we further analysed the charge transfer which is defined as δq2 q sub bpa q sub q bpa where q sub bpa q sub and q bpa are the charge densities of the corresponding tio2 system with bpa adsorbed the clean corresponding tio2 system and the bpa system respectively as fig 10 shows charges are transferred from the tio2 surface and adsorbed intermediate bpa quantitatively the bader charge analysis reveals that the bpa gains 4 7 e with ov figs 10a and 3 7 e without ov fig 10b from the surrounding tio2 surfaces the amount of the charge transfer suggests that the vacancy model can provide a favourable environment for bpa degradation and its reorganisation of the geometric structure in a typical photocatalytic degradation process holes h vb hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radicals o 2 were considered to be the active species involved in the reactions based on previous literature wang et al 2018c to further investigate the degradation mechanism of bpa by tnfs 500 under uv light irradiation free radical quenching experiments were conducted using ammonium oxalate ao p benzoquinone bq and isopropyl alcohol ipa as the scavengers of h vb o 2 and oh respectively the photocatalytic degradation rate of bpa indicated a moderate decline as 63 2 of bpa can be degraded with the introduction of an ao scavenger which is 27 lower than that without any scavenger after 3 h of uv light irradiation fig 11 a in contrast a dramatic decrease in the bpa photocatalytic degradation rate can be observed as the photodegradation rate was only approximately 47 and 20 for bpa when ipa and bq were added respectively based on these results it can be concluded that h vb o 2 and oh are engaged in the photocatalytic reaction as the active species but the degradation of bpa was mainly subjected to o 2 and oh in the photocatalytic process which coincides with the electron spin resonance esr results as detailed below esr spectra were recorded to gain insight into the generated reactive oxidising species ros that participated in photocatalytic oxidation towards bpa degradation by tnfs 500 using dmpo as the trapping reagent as anticipated none of the esr signals can be observed in the dark revealing that almost no oh and o 2 are generated in the dark on the contrary the clear epr signal of the four characteristic quartet peaks of dmpo oh adducts fig 11b with a 1 2 2 1 intensity and dmpo o 2 adducts fig 11c with a 1 1 1 1 intensity can be detected after 5 min of uv illumination liu et al 2018b si et al 2019 indicating that the dominant ross generated by tnfs 500 upon uv light irradiation are oh and o 2 hence a possible reaction mechanism was proposed as illustrated in scheme 2 and the corresponding photocatalytic degradation process of bpa by tnfs 500 under uv light irradiation is as follows yang et al 2019 4 t o o 2 h v h v b e c b 5 h v b o h o h 6 o 2 e c b o 2 7 o 2 2 h e c b h

topic of society titanium salts as alternative coagulants in water treatment have gained extensive attention due to their superior performance in water purification and sludge recycling to produce functional nano tio2 particles many studies have reported the practical applicability of recycled tio2 nano materials shon et al 2007 hyun et al 2011 huang et al 2015 shon et al 2010 reported on the preparation of tio2 from sludge produced by the titanium tetrachloride ticl4 flocculation of wastewater with the resulting tio1 42c0 44p0 14 as superior photocatalyst to commercial tio2 p 25 in removing acetaldehyde gas tio2 nanoparticles 446 5 kg day can be obtained from a medium size 25000 m3 d wastewater treatment plant kima et al 2011 conducted a pilot scale ti flocculation for dye wastewater 1 2 m3 h treatment to produce titania which showed photocatalytic oxidation of acetaldehyde comparable to p 25 other applications of titania produced from sludge included the remediation of organic polluted soils gu et al 2012 and marine environments sendra et al 2017 potential usage in the construction industry and building applications such as self cleansing pavements walls tunnels curbs etc li et al 2013 additionally the aquatic toxicity evaluation of titania nanoparticles produced from titanium coagulated sludge was investigated lee et al 2009 a low mortality rate for titania particles with a barely observed lc50 indicated their environmental safety this study reports on the recycling of the titanium coagulated algae rich sludge to produce functional tnfs through a simple hydrothermal and calcination process compared with previous reports table s3 the recycled tnfs exhibited superior comparable photocatalytic capabilities and stability in the degradation of phenolic organic pollutants 95 humic acid is generally used as a representative nom in a real water matrix according to fig 8d the photocatalytic degradation of bpa by recycled tio2 nanoflowers reached 80 even in the presence of 20 ppm of humic acid which indicated the practical applicability of the recycled products for actual water treatment the mass balance analysis in scheme s2 shows that the polytitanium coagulation per litre of algae rich surface water can produce approximately 100 mg of dried ti loaded sludge approximately 60 of which was converted into functional titanium nanoflowers in addition one third of the actual cost can be saved in this process as the price of ptc and nano tio2 are 114 and 38 per tonne in the commercial market respectively in summary recycling functional titania nanoparticles from titanium coagulated algae rich sludge provides significant potential for sludge disposal protection of the environment and public health and yielding high efficient economically available byproducts 4 conclusions this study investigates titanium coagulated algae rich sludge recycling for functional tnf production through hydrothermal and calcination treatments the mesoporous tnfs exhibited petal like structures with the formation of ovs on the surface the photocatalytic activity of recycled tnfs towards the oxidation of bpa dpp ptbp and resorcinol was

17952,in the 21st century sludge disposal and resource recycling are global issues titanium coagulation has received increasing attention due its strong coagulation capability and sludge recycling titanium coagulation is highly efficient for the treatment of algae laden micro polluted surface water however the safe disposal of titanium coagulated algae rich sludge remains a challenge here we report on the recycling of titanium coagulated algae rich sludge for the production of functional tio2 nanoflowers tnfs through a simple hydrothermal and calcination process anatase tnfs particle size of 10 15 nm with petal like structures mesoporous relatively high specific surface areas i e 299 4 m2g 1 and low band gaps i e 2 67 ev compared to p 25 were obtained additionally oxygen vacancy ov was generated on the surface of the recycled tnfs based on electron paramagnetic resonance epr results which were verified by the first principles calculations within density functional theory these tnfs display high photocatalytic performance for the degradation of diverse phenolic organic contaminants such as bisphenol a diphenyl phenol p tert butyl phenol and resorcinol i e 95 under mild ultraviolet light irradiation and without any sacrificial reagents formation of ov on tnfs not only efficiently inhibited the recombination of photo generated electrons and holes but also facilitated contaminant adsorption and photo generated electron transfer on the surface of the recycled tnfs thereby promoting the generation of holes and hydroxyl and superoxide radicals which were regarded as the reactive oxygen species for attacking contaminants in the reactions this study proposes a new perspective on recycling chemical coagulated sludge for producing functional nanomaterials as photocatalysts graphical abstract image 1 keywords polytitanium coagulation sludge recycling tio2 nanoflowers photocatalytic reaction density functional theory calculation 1 introduction conventional aluminium based and iron based salts have gained attention in research as universal coagulants for the purification of surface water rich in algae pei et al 2017a 2017b qi et al 2018 however the toxicity of residual aluminium and high effluent turbidity of iron based coagulants after coagulation pose a chronic threat to human health ferrari et al 2017 hufnagel et al 2018 chorghe et al 2017 moreover the quantity of algae rich coagulated sludge generated is high which poses further disposal problems jordan and paul 2015 fangzhou et al 2015 dumping sludge into the sea using sludge in agriculture and horticulture digesting sludge anaerobically and treating sludge with acid has resulted in high costs low utilisation rates and secondary pollution neither of making these options suitable for sludge disposal yi et al 2016 powell et al 2016 yang et al 2015 consequently not only is there an urgent need to develop efficient and innocuous coagulants for water treatment but the issue of safe disposal of algae rich coagulated sludge is increasingly perceived as one of the most severe environmental challenges with the development of the titanium industry researchers have begun to pay more attention to the utilisation of titanium based salts due to their abundant reserves and hypotoxicity jin et al 2018 moy et al 2016 walker 2017 novel polytitanium coagulants have recently been applied in the simultaneous removal of natural organic matter nom and algal organic matter aom due to their superior coagulation performance compared to conventional aluminium based and iron based coagulants wang et al 2017a 2018a jia et al 2017 loganathan et al 2018 one of the most prominent advantages of titanium based coagulation is its ability to recycle coagulated sludge producing functional tio2 nanoparticles shon et al 2010 huang et al 2015 it has been demonstrated that tio2 may be responsible for the degradation of organic contaminants as an outstanding semiconductor of photocatalytic materials in water treatment wang et al 2017b giordano et al 2016 hamandi et al 2017 peng et al 2017 therefore many researchers have improved the photocatalytic activity of tio2 by preparing different tio2 nanostructures such as nanosphere nanoflowers nanotubes nanowires and nanofibers from pristine tio2 using electrochemical solution chemical based and template based synthesis methods wang et al 2018b shaban et al 2018 wu et al 2017 gherardi et al 2018 yen et al 2017 the hydrothermal method is an efficient economic and simple synthetic method with few operational risks by controlling the ph of a solution during the hydrothermal process the nanoparticle morphology and structure can be easily adjusted moreover the tio2 nanoflowers tnfs produced by treating tio2 nanoparticles with a 10 n naoh aqueous solution in the hydrothermal environment were reportedly superior in photocatalysis compared with other tio2 nanostructures mali et al 2014 little research has been published concerning the development of cost effective and environmentally friendly methods for recycling the algae rich sludge this study was aimed at producing functional tnfs from algae rich titanium coagulated sludge through hydrothermal and calcination methods the photocatalytic performance of the tnfs was evaluated by the degradation of phenolic contaminants such as bisphenol a bpa diphenyl phenol dpp p tert butyl phenol ptbp and resorcinol the underlying mechanisms of degrading phenolic contaminants were included and particularly influenced by the density functional theory dft 2 experimental section 2 1 test water coagulants and coagulation microcystis aeruginosa fachb 905 purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china was selected for this study it was grown in bg11 media at a controlled temperature of 25 1 c with light emitting diode illumination in a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle and was harvested during the logarithmic phase 12 15 d rao et al 2017 before coagulation the simulated algae laden test water was prepared as follows the harvested suspension of algae was diluted with yellow river water which was then filtered using a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose ester mce membrane to remove original large particles to achieve an algae cell density of 106 cells ml polytitanium tetrachloride ptc prepared with a basicity value of 1 5 was applied as the coagulant coagulation tests were performed using a programmable jar tester my 3000 6m wuhan meiyu co ltd china details about the basic physicochemical parameters of the test water preparation of the coagulant and coagulation procedures are presented in the supporting information s1 2 2 sludge recovery the detailed preparation of tnfs and morphological changes of ti loaded sludge are shown in scheme 1 a after coagulation the ptc coagulated sludge was collected and dried at 105 c for 12 h the oven dried sludge was then grinded into powder size 0 154 mm scheme 1b and calcined at 600 c heating rate of 5 c min in a muffle furnace for 12 h to produce tio2 nanoparticles scheme 1c for improved crystallinity and product performance based on previous studies and our preliminary research shon et al 2010 saliby et al 2012 zhao et al 2014 the 1 5 g tio2 nanoparticles were then dispersed into 70 ml of naoh solution 10 m and magnetically stirred for 1 h followed by a hydrothermal reaction at 140 c for 24 h in a teflon reactor the resulting solution was centrifuged and the precipitates were washed in hcl 0 1 m and deionised di water to neutral conditions followed by oven drying at 80 c finally the dried sediments were calcined at 300 600 c at 100 c intervals in a muffle furnace for 2 h to obtain the tio2 nanomaterials which were named tnfs 300 nanorods tnfs 400 nanosheets tnfs 500 nanoflowers and tnfs 600 nanosheets schemes 1d 1e 1f and 1g respectively 2 3 characterisation of the tnfs the crystallinity and phase structure of the tnfs were measured using an x ray diffractometer xrd bruker d8 germany and the morphological features chemical bonds and elemental compositions were identified using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s2500 japan high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem jem 2100f japan energy disperse spectroscope eds ie250x max50 uk and x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps thermo escalab 250xi usa the tnf brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas and pore structures were monitored using a micromeritic instrument asap2460 usa the photoluminescence pl emission spectra and ultraviolet visible uv vis diffused reflectance spectrum drs measurements were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer fluoromax 4 japan and uv vis spectrophotometer pe lambda 750s usa respectively the electron paramagnetic resonance epr signals of radicals spin trapped by 5 5 dimethyl 1pyrroline n oxide dmpo and oxygen vacancies ovs were detected using the epr spectrometer bruker a300 germany 2 4 photocatalytic performance of the tnfs the degradation of bpa dpp ptbp and resorcinol in aqueous solutions were observed to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the tnfs first 50 mg of tnfs were added to the foulant bpa dpp ptbp or resorcinol water solution 50 ml at various concentrations followed by constant stirring for 30 min in the dark to achieve the equilibrium of adsorption desorption between the photocatalysts and contaminants prior to illumination the initial ph of the suspension was approximately 7 during the reaction then the solution was irradiated under a high pressure 400 w hg uv lamp ggz400 cn with a primary emission of 365 nm and the distance from the reactor to the illuminant was 17 cm finally the aliquot was withdrawn at the predetermined time intervals followed by measuring the residual contaminants after filtering the solution with the 0 45 μm mce membrane the residual concentration of bpa was measured with a high performance liquid chromatograph 1260 infinity ii agilent usa and dpp ptbp and resorcinol were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer tu 1810 persee detailed information regarding the analytical methods for the degradation of each foulant are shown in the supporting information s2 the degradation efficiency of the contaminants is expressed as 1 r c c 0 where c is the residual concentration and c0 is the initial concentration of the contaminants conditional experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of photocatalyst dosage initial ph contaminant concentration and nom on photocatalytic performance bpa was utilised as the representative contaminant and tnfs 500 was utilised as the representative photocatalyst the solution ph was adjusted using hcl 0 1 m or naoh 0 1 m and only one parameter was changed in each conditional experiment the experimental data were based on triplicate tests moreover to investigate the photocatalytic stability of the tnfs recycling experiments were designed and conducted as follows after the photocatalytic experiments the resulting tnfs were separated from the aqueous suspension through centrifugation followed by washing with ethanol and di water five times to completely remove the residual contaminants the tnfs were then oven dried at 80 c and used again for the degradation test this cycle was repeated seven times 2 5 dft calculations the first principles calculations within dft were implemented using the vienna ab initio simulation package kresse and hafner 1994 a generalised gradient approximation in the form of a perdew burke ernzerhof functional was adopted to describe the electron electron interactions perdew et al 1996 the energy cut off employed for the plane wave expansion of electron wavefunctions was set to 500 ev and the electron ion interactions were treated using projector augmented wave potentials kresse and joubert 1999 the dft d3 method was applied to include long range van der waals interactions for adsorption on substrate lattices grimme et al 2011 the substrate lattices were cut along the 100 direction while a vacuum region of approximately 15 å was applied along the z direction to avoid a mirror interaction between neighbouring images structural optimisation was carried out using a conjugate gradient method until the remaining force on each atom was less than 0 05 ev å 3 results and discussion 3 1 crystal and microstructure analysis the xrd patterns of the tnfs fig 1 exhibited a number of peaks at approximately 25 3 37 8 48 0 53 9 55 1 and 62 7 corresponding to the 101 004 200 105 211 and 204 planes of the anatase tio2 respectively min et al 2017 torralvo et al 2018 thus the tnfs presented the dominant anatase crystal phase specifically the crystal characteristics become more defined with an increase in incineration temperature characteristic rutile phase peaks rarely appeared which indicated that the transformation of the crystal structure did not even occur at 600 c of tnf calcination the tnfs 500 was selected as the representative concentration for measuring morphology due to its superior photocatalytic activity the sem images clearly depict the petaloid morphological structure of the tnfs 500 fig 2 a and b suggesting that the petal like sheets grow vertically on the original surface of the tio2 nanoparticles to form the tio2 nanoflowers from the tem and hrtem images fig 2c and d the lattice fringes of the tnfs 500 displayed the expected lattice spacing of 0 352 nm which matched sufficiently with the those of the 101 crystal plane of anatase tio2 ling et al 2017 li et al 2017a the results agree with the xrd pattern shown in fig 1 the eds mapping displayed a uniform distribution of both o and ti implying the existence of o and ti in tnfs 500 fig 2e f and 2g fig s1 the bet measurements examined the porous nature of the tnf samples generally the n2 adsorption isotherms corresponded to the international union of pure and applied chemistry type iv with a typical type of h2 hysteresis loop which indicated the existence of tnf mesoporous characteristics fig 3 a setvin et al 2017 the pore size distribution calculated according to the barrett joyner halenda method revealed that most of the mesopores fell into the size range of 2 nm 20 nm fig 3b which likely reflected the slit spaces between the small nanosheets huang et al 2019 the tnfs 500 possessed the smallest bet surface area of 83 4 m2g 1 and pore volume of 0 32 nm but it exhibited the largest average pore size of 14 9 nm out of the tnfs samples table s2 in general the photocatalytic performance of the photocatalysts can be facilitated by increasing the bet surface area through the adsorption of contaminants during the photocatalytic process therefore the bet surface area was probably not responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of tnfs 500 in this study 3 2 chemical composition and bonds analysis the representative tnfs 500 was utilised for xps measurements to gain an understanding of the chemical bonds and elemental compositions fig 4 the xps survey spectrum of the tnfs 500 reveals that ti o and c can be clearly detected by the main peaks of ti 2p o 1s and c 1s indicating the existence of c in addition to ti and o fig 4a which had already been demonstrated by previous the eds mapping results the high resolution spectra of ti 2p exhibited two peaks caused by the spinorbit splitting that were centred at 463 7 ev and 457 9 ev which can be ascribed to ti 2p1 2 and ti 2p3 2 respectively fig 4b duan et al 2017a the splitting energy between ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 is 5 8 ev indicating a normal state of ti4 which is the same result as previously reported ying et al 2015 the high resolution spectra of o 1s included three peaks at 529 2 ev 530 3 ev and 531 7 ev corresponding to the o2 ti o ti and ti o c bonds respectively fig 4c bharti et al 2016 li et al 2017b the high resolution spectra of c 1s can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 285 7 ev c o bond and 284 7 ev c c bond fig 4d yang et al 2018 thus c can exist in tnfs 500 but at a low percentage based on the lack of its distribution evidenced by the eds mapping fig 2e f and 2g in addition c was not doped into the tnfs 500 lattice as demonstrated by the lack of the characteristic peak of the ti c bond at approximately 282 0 ev and it can likely be doped into the tnfs 500 as interstitial carbon outside of the lattice moya et al 2015 the binding energies of the anatase tio2 were 464 3 ev ti 2p1 2 458 5 ev ti 2p3 2 529 8 ev ti o ti and 531 6 ev ti o c for ti 2p and o 1s as reported in previous literature liu et al 2018a li et al 2018a when comparing the tnfs 500 in this study and the anatase tio2 from previous literature with regard to both ti and o one unanticipated finding was that a non ignorable shift in binding energies for both ti and o probably demonstrated the formation of ov on the surface of tnfs 500 in addition the formation of ov which can be responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of tnfs fig 6a can be further confirmed by the results of the epr spectra fig 5 a and this finding is discussed in detail in section 3 3 3 3 epr spectra pl emission spectra and uv vis drs spectrum analysis the generation of ov on the surface of tnfs 300 tnfs 400 tnfs 500 and tnfs 600 was illustrated by the epr spectra with the conspicuous signal located at g 2 003 resulting from the ov captured electrons fig 5a li et al 2018b nath et al 2019 the existence of a ti3 site was not observed based on the absence of a epr spectroscopy signal at g 1 98 aristidou et al 2017 wang et al 2018c ovs had been previously reported to enhance the photocatalytic oxidation capability of anatase nano tio2 bharti et al 2016 of the four samples the highest ov signal intensity was detected in tnfs 500 illustrating that more ov was generated simply through the calcination on the surface of tnfs 500 this may be the reason for the superior photocatalytic activity of the tnfs in terms of bpa degradation fig 6 another key parameter influencing the photocatalytic capability is the photogenerated electron hole pair recombination rate which is typically evaluated by a pl spectrum duan et al 2017b chen et al 2017 generally the stronger the pl signal the higher the photogenerated electron hole recombination rate and therefore the lower the photocatalytic capability compared with the tnfs obtained at 300 c 400 c and 600 c tnfs 500 presented the weakest pl signal intensity fig 5b which indicated its stronger photocatalytic ability the tnfs 500 showed a higher ov intensity with a lower pl signal which indicated that the photocatalytic activity of tnfs 500 was probably enhanced by the lower recombination rate of the photogenerated electron hole pairs because of the increased ov formation liang et al 2018 additionally results from the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum measurement presented higher absorbance values in the uv region for tnfs 500 fig 5c which has been reported to facilitate photocatalytic reactions yen et al 2017 tnf band gaps originated from the corresponding uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrum fig 5d in accordance with eq 2 2 α h v a h v e g n 2 where α ν h eg and n are the absorption coefficient optical frequency planck constant band gap and semiconductor transition characteristic respectively accordingly the band gaps of tnfs 300 tnfs 400 tnfs 500 and tnfs 600 were approximately 2 67 ev 2 58 ev 2 53 ev and 2 63 ev respectively which were smaller than that of the pure anatase tio2 semiconductor 3 2 ev generally c doping into the tio2 lattice and the formation of ov on the surface of tio2 can be considered responsible for the narrower band gaps of nano tio2 xu et al 2018 in this study c was not doped into the tio2 lattice as demonstrated by the lack of ti c bonds in the c 1s xps spectra results therefore c doping into the tio2 lattice can be ruled out implying that narrower band gaps of tnfs samples can be induced and probably ascribed to the formation of ovs 3 4 photocatalytic activity of the tnfs as a typical contaminant from the manufacturing industry bpa is commonly found in water due to its pervasive application in plastic packaging bpa is a potential risk to human health and water reuse wang et al 2019 photocatalysis has been proven to be an efficient method for degrading bpa in water purification processes abdelraheem et al 2019 in this study there was no decrease in bpa concentration without the presence of a photocatalyst in the bpa aqueous solution after uv light irradiation implying that the pure photolysis was not responsible for bpa degradation the tnfs displayed a strong capability to degrade bpa fig 6a specifically the degradation efficiency of bpa first significantly increased and then decreased with an increase in tnf calcination temperature as indicated by tnfs 500 achieving the highest bpa degradation efficiency of approximately 95 which was 25 and 17 higher than that of tnfs 300 and tnfs 600 after 2 h of uv light irradiation respectively although the tnf bet surface area decreased with an increase in calcination temperature from 300 to 500 c greater amounts of lattice oxygen fell off from the tio2 crystal lattice to form ov thereby resulting in an increase in ov on the surface of the tnfs based on the epr results fig 5a the tnfs 500 with the maximum ov showed the lowest recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs out of the four samples based on the pl results fig 5b according to these results it can be concluded that the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs can be inhibited by increasing the ovs on the surface of tnfs instead of the size of bet surface area thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity of tnfs which is in agreement with the pl and epr spectra results in addition possible pathways for bpa degradation are presented in the supporting information scheme s1 with the results showing its probable mineralisation into co2 and h2o as the final products through photogenerated holes superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals qiu et al 2012 liu et al 2018 tnfs 500 was used as the representative sample for the stability test after the photocatalytic experiments the resultant tnfs were separated from the aqueous suspension through centrifugation followed by washing with ethanol and di water five times to completely remove the residual contaminants the tnfs were then oven dried at 80 c and used again for the degradation this cycle was repeated seven times the results indicated that the photocatalytic activity of tnfs 500 remained nearly stable during the photocatalytic degradation of bpa as the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bpa was more than 80 even after being recycled seven times fig 6b in summary the reusable characteristic of tnfs recycled efficiently through an ethanol rinsing process that possess potential value for applications and generalisation in water treatment phenolic compounds with a benzene ring molecular structure similar to bpa such as dpp ptbp and resorcinol are ubiquitous in wastewater and removal are in urgent need due to their hypertoxicity and mutagenicity in water environments wang et al 2016 yan et al 2018 husøy et al 2019 to further evaluate the practical application value of tnfs in water purification tnfs 500 was applied for their degradation with the results suggesting up to 95 removal of dpp ptbp and resorcinol after 4 h of uv light irradiation fig 7 a similar to the bpa case the degradation of the other three contaminants was hardly observed without the addition of tnfs as photocatalysts fig s2 which implied that the pure photolysis did not degrade dpp ptbp or resorcinol the absorption peaks centred at 282 nm 274 nm and 273 nm were attributed to ptbp dpp and resorcinol respectively the results showed a gradual decrease in the peak intensity with increasing irradiation time followed by the complete degradation of these three phenolic compounds after 4 h of uv light irradiation fig 7b c and 7d the ring opening reactions were typically involved in the degradation process of the phenolic compounds and resorcinol possess the fewest benzene ring in the molecular structure of the four phenolic compounds karrer et al 2019 qi et al 2020 duan et al 2020 therefore tnfs 500 exhibited stronger photocatalytic activity related to the degradation of resorcinol than that of the other three phenolic compounds which can likely be attributed to the fact that the benzene ring in the molecular structure of resorcinol can be more easily broken down through ring opening reactions in summary tnfs have promising application prospects in the degradation of phenolic compounds which can be found in industrial wastewaters such as petrochemical dye and pesticide wastewaters it is commonly accepted that photocatalyst dosage plays a critical role in the photocatalytic process and the degradation efficiency of bpa by a photocatalyst under uv light is potentially affected by environmental factors including initial contaminant concentration ph and humic acid ha in water tan et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019 in this study tnfs 500 was applied to evaluate the effect of the variable reaction condition on bpa degradation including photocatalyst dosage fig 8 a initial bpa concentration fig 8b initial ph fig 8c and initial ha concentration fig 8d to better simulate the actual bpa and ha concentration conditions in surface water four varied bpa and ha concentrations in the ranges of 5 50 ppm and 5 30 ppm were utilised respectively the results demonstrated that 1 light quantity and particle aggregation can result in slight improvements in the degradation efficiency of bpa in addition to further increasing the photocatalyst dosage 2 few inhibitions of active sites on the surface of tnfs 500 occur in solutions with low bpa concentrations 3 electrostatic attraction is in favour of bpa adsorption leading to a higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency and 4 competition for photocatalytic active sites between ha and bpa molecules inhibited the photocatalytic activity of tnfs 500 in bpa degradation under uv light irradiation detailed information about the experimental conditions are presented in the supporting information s4 3 5 photocatalytic mechanism insight to investigate the interactions between bpa and the corresponding substrates fig 9 the adsorption energy was defined as follows 3 eads e sub bpa e sub e bpa where e sub bpa e sub and e bpa correspond to the total energies of the substrates and bpa an isolated substrate and bpa respectively the more negative value of the vacancy model 0 07 ev atom suggests a strong chemisorption and the spontaneous exothermic process of the reaction compared with the vacancy free model 0 05 ev atom to elucidate the interaction mechanism we further analysed the charge transfer which is defined as δq2 q sub bpa q sub q bpa where q sub bpa q sub and q bpa are the charge densities of the corresponding tio2 system with bpa adsorbed the clean corresponding tio2 system and the bpa system respectively as fig 10 shows charges are transferred from the tio2 surface and adsorbed intermediate bpa quantitatively the bader charge analysis reveals that the bpa gains 4 7 e with ov figs 10a and 3 7 e without ov fig 10b from the surrounding tio2 surfaces the amount of the charge transfer suggests that the vacancy model can provide a favourable environment for bpa degradation and its reorganisation of the geometric structure in a typical photocatalytic degradation process holes h vb hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radicals o 2 were considered to be the active species involved in the reactions based on previous literature wang et al 2018c to further investigate the degradation mechanism of bpa by tnfs 500 under uv light irradiation free radical quenching experiments were conducted using ammonium oxalate ao p benzoquinone bq and isopropyl alcohol ipa as the scavengers of h vb o 2 and oh respectively the photocatalytic degradation rate of bpa indicated a moderate decline as 63 2 of bpa can be degraded with the introduction of an ao scavenger which is 27 lower than that without any scavenger after 3 h of uv light irradiation fig 11 a in contrast a dramatic decrease in the bpa photocatalytic degradation rate can be observed as the photodegradation rate was only approximately 47 and 20 for bpa when ipa and bq were added respectively based on these results it can be concluded that h vb o 2 and oh are engaged in the photocatalytic reaction as the active species but the degradation of bpa was mainly subjected to o 2 and oh in the photocatalytic process which coincides with the electron spin resonance esr results as detailed below esr spectra were recorded to gain insight into the generated reactive oxidising species ros that participated in photocatalytic oxidation towards bpa degradation by tnfs 500 using dmpo as the trapping reagent as anticipated none of the esr signals can be observed in the dark revealing that almost no oh and o 2 are generated in the dark on the contrary the clear epr signal of the four characteristic quartet peaks of dmpo oh adducts fig 11b with a 1 2 2 1 intensity and dmpo o 2 adducts fig 11c with a 1 1 1 1 intensity can be detected after 5 min of uv illumination liu et al 2018b si et al 2019 indicating that the dominant ross generated by tnfs 500 upon uv light irradiation are oh and o 2 hence a possible reaction mechanism was proposed as illustrated in scheme 2 and the corresponding photocatalytic degradation process of bpa by tnfs 500 under uv light irradiation is as follows yang et al 2019 4 t o o 2 h v h v b e c b 5 h v b o h o h 6 o 2 e c b o 2 7 o 2 2 h e c b h

topic of society titanium salts as alternative coagulants in water treatment have gained extensive attention due to their superior performance in water purification and sludge recycling to produce functional nano tio2 particles many studies have reported the practical applicability of recycled tio2 nano materials shon et al 2007 hyun et al 2011 huang et al 2015 shon et al 2010 reported on the preparation of tio2 from sludge produced by the titanium tetrachloride ticl4 flocculation of wastewater with the resulting tio1 42c0 44p0 14 as superior photocatalyst to commercial tio2 p 25 in removing acetaldehyde gas tio2 nanoparticles 446 5 kg day can be obtained from a medium size 25000 m3 d wastewater treatment plant kima et al 2011 conducted a pilot scale ti flocculation for dye wastewater 1 2 m3 h treatment to produce titania which showed photocatalytic oxidation of acetaldehyde comparable to p 25 other applications of titania produced from sludge included the remediation of organic polluted soils gu et al 2012 and marine environments sendra et al 2017 potential usage in the construction industry and building applications such as self cleansing pavements walls tunnels curbs etc li et al 2013 additionally the aquatic toxicity evaluation of titania nanoparticles produced from titanium coagulated sludge was investigated lee et al 2009 a low mortality rate for titania particles with a barely observed lc50 indicated their environmental safety this study reports on the recycling of the titanium coagulated algae rich sludge to produce functional tnfs through a simple hydrothermal and calcination process compared with previous reports table s3 the recycled tnfs exhibited superior comparable photocatalytic capabilities and stability in the degradation of phenolic organic pollutants 95 humic acid is generally used as a representative nom in a real water matrix according to fig 8d the photocatalytic degradation of bpa by recycled tio2 nanoflowers reached 80 even in the presence of 20 ppm of humic acid which indicated the practical applicability of the recycled products for actual water treatment the mass balance analysis in scheme s2 shows that the polytitanium coagulation per litre of algae rich surface water can produce approximately 100 mg of dried ti loaded sludge approximately 60 of which was converted into functional titanium nanoflowers in addition one third of the actual cost can be saved in this process as the price of ptc and nano tio2 are 114 and 38 per tonne in the commercial market respectively in summary recycling functional titania nanoparticles from titanium coagulated algae rich sludge provides significant potential for sludge disposal protection of the environment and public health and yielding high efficient

17953,in the present study radiolabelled formate was used as a probe compound in order to gain mechanistic insight into the catalytic ozonation process using a commercially available iron oxide impregnated activated carbon catalyst we simultaneously analysed the adsorptive and oxidative removal of formate in order to determine the contribution of the catalyst to adsorption and oxidant generation processes respectively our results show that the presence of the catalyst enhanced ozone decay as well as the rate and extent of formate oxidation at ph 3 0 compared to that observed in the presence of ozone alone as a result of oxidant generation via o3 fe oxide interaction a reduction in rate and extent of formate oxidation on addition of t butanol and cl known hydroxyl radical oh scavengers under acidic conditions provides evidence that the oxidant generated during catalytic ozonation at ph 3 0 is oh moreover the oxidation of formate during catalytic ozonation mostly occurs at the solid liquid interface and or in bulk solution with adsorption playing no role in the overall oxidation process with this finding supported by the exceptionally high oxidation efficiency compared to the extent of adsorption observed when no o3 was added while catalytic ozonation was effective in formate oxidation at ph 3 0 the presence of the catalyst did not lead to an increase in either the rate or extent of formate oxidation at ph 7 3 and 8 5 suggesting that only protonated iron oxide surface sites generate strong oxidant s on interaction with o3 based on our understanding of the processes operating during the ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes a mathematical model has been developed that adequately describes the experimental results obtained here overall this study shows that systematic measurement of ozone decay removal of the parent compound as well as formation of the oxidized products under well controlled conditions are required for unequivocal elucidation of the mechanism of catalytic ozonation graphical abstract image 1 keywords catalytic ozonation activated carbon hydroxyl radicals adsorption iron oxides 1 introduction ozone is a relatively strong oxidant and has been widely used in the treatment of drinking waters and wastewaters however conventional ozonation technologies are usually constrained by poor mass transfer of ozone from the gas phase to liquid phase low ozone utilization efficiency and limited mineralization of organics beltrán 2003 janknecht et al 2001 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the addition of a catalyst has been proposed to overcome some of these problems with the catalyst purportedly enhancing the efficiency of the process as a result of increased generation of oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals oh on catalyst ozone interaction bing et al 2015 nawrocki 2013 oulton et al 2015 wei et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 2017 2018 the nature of the oxidant s generated in the catalytic ozonation systems appears to depend on the type of catalyst used beltrán et al 2006 biernacki et al 2019 bing et al 2015 fijołek et al 2019 ikhlaq et al 2012 2013 sánchez polo et al 2005 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 2017 for example sánchez polo et al 2005 demonstrated that interaction of ozone with carbon surfaces generated superoxide ho2 which enhanced the transformation of ozone to oh sánchez polo et al 2005 similar results were reported in the presence of alumina and goethite with formation of oh on catalyst o3 interaction determined to be responsible for enhanced organic oxidation ikhlaq et al 2012 2013 the formation of surface atomic oxygen was reported to occur in the presence of al2o3 and pdo bing et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 while singlet oxygen and ho2 were identified as the dominant oxidants when reduced graphene oxide was employed as the catalyst wang et al 2016 in addition to formation of reactive oxidants during catalytic ozonation stabilization of ozone by adsorption onto the catalyst surface and or adsorption of organics are also reported to enhance the oxidation efficiency in the catalytic ozonation process gao et al 2017 wei et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 yuan et al 2018 reported that futile aqueous ozone decay was reduced via adsorption of ozone onto amorphous iron silicate increasing the possibility of formation of oh on ozone catalyst interaction furthermore various earlier studies showed that the adsorption of organics including parent compound and or intermediates formed on oxidation on the catalyst surface increased the overall oxidation capacity during catalytic ozonation gao et al 2017 ikhlaq et al 2012 2013 2018 wei et al 2019 the results of investigations employing oxalate as the target organic suggested that formation of surface oxalate metal complexes was responsible for enhancement of the oxidation efficiency by catalytic ozonation zhang et al 2011 2012 in contrast some studies showed that adsorption of organics was not critical ernst et al 2004 and even decreased the performance of catalytic ozonation when employing alumina and clay based catalysts vel leitner et al 1999 and or carbon nanotubes as catalyst zhang et al 2017 as should be clear from the above brief review despite extensive studies on catalytic ozonation the role of the catalyst is not well understood there is continued controversy regarding the contribution of the catalyst to organics adsorption and oxidant s generation with the uncertainty in part ascribed to the use of complex organic compounds such as humic substances and aromatic compounds for which oxidation results in formation of a suite of intermediates and by products gao et al 2017 lee et al 2017 zhong et al 2018 while these organic contaminants may be representative of real wastewaters the coexistence of the formation of complex oxidized intermediates and their subsequent interaction with the catalyst and ozone makes it very difficult to clearly elucidate the mechanism responsible for contaminant degradation moreover ph is not well controlled in many of the reported studies which makes the comparison of conventional ozonation and catalytic ozonation difficult nawrocki 2013 to partially address the problems of previous studies radiolabelled formate and oxalate were chosen as the target compounds in the present study since they have well defined oxidation pathways and in both cases result in formation of co2 and h2o as the only products flyunt et al 2001 garoma and gurol 2005 by quantifying both the loss of formate oxalate and the generation of co2 over time we are able to explicitly differentiate removal of formate oxalate by the adsorption and oxidation processes additionally these short chain carboxylic acids are good target contaminants since they are recognized as important end products on ozonation of aromatic organics such as humic and fulvic acids kuo 1998 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in order to understand the influence of ph on organics removal by ozonation both conventional and catalytic we investigated the process performance under varying ph conditions in the ph range 3 0 8 5 a commercially available iron oxide impregnated activated carbon catalyst provided by beijing originwater technology co ltd china bow was used in all experiments we chose a carbon based catalyst for these studies since carbon materials are inexpensive and possess abundant surface sites based on our experimental results a mathematical model has been developed that satisfactorily describes the results of formate oxidation by both ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes we would like to highlight that even though the effect of various solution conditions such as ph ozone dosage and organic dosage on the overall efficiency of the ozonation process were determined in this study no attempt was made to optimise the operational parameters given that these will be very specific to the nature and concentration of the organics examined nevertheless the mathematical model developed here can be used to optimise process conditions such that the rate and extent of contaminant degradation is maximised 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all solutions were prepared in milli q mq water with 18 mω cm 1 resistivity unless stated otherwise all glassware was soaked in 5 v v nitric acid prior to use all experiments were conducted at room temperature of 22 0 1 0 c all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received unless stated otherwise all experiments were performed at ph 3 0 7 3 or 8 5 for ph 3 0 studies a 1 0 mm hno3 solution was used as the buffer while a 2 0 mm nahco3 air saturated solution was used for ph 8 5 experiments for ph 7 3 a 2 0 mm nahco3 solution in equilibrium with synthetic air containing 6000 ppm of co2 hiq certified calibration standards boc was used to allow equilibration of co2 between the solution and the gas phase solutions were sparged in dreschel bottles for 2 h prior to experiments 1 0 m hno3 and 1 0 m naoh stock solutions were used to adjust the ph of the reaction solution when required while the ph was well controlled in the ph 3 0 and 8 5 experiments with ph variations of 0 1 units the ph of the 7 3 system increased by 0 2 0 3 units over the course of the ozonation study with this ph increase most likely a result of the decrease in the co2 partial pressure since sparging with the synthetic co2 air mixture was not continued during the experiments stock solutions of radiolabelled and non radiolabelled sodium formate were prepared in mq water at concentrations of 0 2 mm and 1 8 mm and for sodium oxalate 0 3 and 2 7 mm respectively a 1 0 mm indigo stock solution was prepared by dissolving potassium indigo trisulfonate in 20 0 mm phosphate buffer at ph 2 0 and kept in the dark prior to use ozone was produced by an ozone generator t4000 5 0 g l 1 oxyzone pty ltd australia using pure oxygen gas flow rate of 650 0 ml min 1 as the gas source a 300 400 μm aqueous ozone stock solution was prepared by sparging the ozone and oxygen gas mixture into 120 ml of mq for 20 min with the aqueous ozone concentration determined using uv spectroscopy molar absorptivity of o3 is 3200 m 1 cm 1 at 260 nm von sonntag and von gunten 2012 an 83 3 μm stock solution of p chlorobenzoic acid p cba was prepared in mq and used as a probe compound for oh measurement all reagents were stored at 4 c prior to use since formate exists as both hcooh and hcoo in the ph range investigated here we use hcooh hcoo to represent total formate from hereon 2 2 catalyst characterization a commercial iron oxide impregnated carbon catalyst termed jbx and its activated carbon carrier referred to as the carrier from hereon were supplied by bow upon receipt the catalyst and the carrier were prewashed with mq water until the supernatant was clear and then dried before use the surface area and the pore size of the catalyst were acquired using n2 sorption isotherms and analysed by brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh models the samples were degassed at 150 c for 8 h prior to the test to further characterise the surface properties and composition of the catalyst and the carrier scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx fei nova nanosem 230 fe sem was performed on both the surface and core of jbx see si section s1 1 for more details to characterise the surface charge of the catalyst zeta potential measurements over a ph range of 3 0 10 0 were performed using a malvern nano zs zen3600 zetasizer the catalysts used here were in form of pellets with length of ca 5 mm and 3 mm diameter since the catalysts were in the form of relatively large particles the dosage of catalyst was set at 1 0 or 10 0 g l 1 to provide sufficient surface sites for ozone catalyst and formate oxalate catalyst interactions beltrán et al 2002 biernacki et al 2019 note that even though the overall dosage of the catalyst was high the active metal concentration was very low 0 1 of the total weight of the catalyst and comparable with the catalyst dosages used in various earlier studies faria et al 2008 nawrocki and fijołek 2013 sánchez polo et al 2006a wang et al 2019b we would also like to highlight that we used the activated carbon carrier as the control in all experiments to test the role of the iron oxide the active site in jbx as discussed later associated with the carrier rather than using well defined iron oxides since the exact nature of the iron oxide loaded on the carrier cannot be determined see section 3 1 for more details 2 3 experimental setup 2 3 1 formate degradation the experimental setup and method used for simultaneous measurement of adsorption and oxidation of hcooh hcoo on ozonation are described in detail in si section s1 2 briefly 1 0 μm formate consisting of 0 1 μm radiolabelled and 0 9 μm non radiolabelled formate and ozone 1 0 100 0 μm were added to ph 3 0 7 3 or 8 5 buffer solution in the absence and presence of 1 0 or 10 0 g l 1 catalyst or carrier the concentrations of h14cooh h14coo remaining and 14co2 formed following oxidation at various time intervals were measured to investigate the role of oh in the hcooh hcoo oxidation process t butanol tba and cl for ph 3 0 only were used as oh scavengers in order to investigate the importance of formate adsorption on its overall oxidation during catalytic ozonation pre adsorption of 1 0 μm formate was performed on 10 0 g l 1 jbx at ph 3 0 after 4 h when nearly 80 of the added formate was adsorbed on jbx the catalysts were withdrawn and re dispersed in fresh ph 3 0 buffer solution subsequently 10 0 μm of o3 was added to initiate the oxidation with the concentrations of h14cooh h14coo and 14co2 measured as described in si section s1 2 2 3 2 oxalate degradation in order to investigate the influence of the nature of the target organic on rate and extent of degradation the oxidation of oxalate was investigated at ph 7 3 while formate can be oxidized by both o3 and oh oxalate has low reactivity towards o3 k o3 0 04 m 1s 1 beltrán 2003 beltrán et al 2003 garoma and gurol 2005 with oxidation of oxalate mostly governed by its interaction with oh k oh 5 6 106 m 1s 1 garoma and gurol 2005 formed on o3 decay the experimental setup and procedure used for oxalate oxidation were identical to that described for formate degradation briefly 1 0 μm oxalate consisting of 0 1 μm radiolabelled and 0 9 μm non radiolabelled oxalate and ozone 10 0 μm were added to ph 7 3 buffer solution in the absence and presence of 10 0 g l 1 jbx with the concentrations of oxalate remaining and 14co2 formed continuously measured using the method described in si section s1 2 2 3 3 ozone decay investigation of aqueous ozone decay was performed in head space free gas tight syringe reactors fig s3 for measurement aqueous ozone 120 0 μm was added to ph 3 0 7 3 or 8 5 buffer solution in the absence and presence of 1 0 or 10 0 g l 1 jbx or carrier the aqueous ozone concentration was measured using the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 as described in detail in si section s1 3 we would like to highlight that even though the initial ozone concentration used in the formate oxalate degradation studies and ozone decay studies were different due to the constraints on the detection limit of the method used for ozone measurement the difference in initial ozone concentration has no impact on the interpretation of our results and conclusions made here since the measured half lifes of ozone were similar for various initial o3 concentrations t 1 2 11 7 and 10 5 min for initial o3 concentrations of 10 0 and 120 0 μm respectively at ph 8 5 2 3 4 hydroxyl radical measurement to evaluate the rate and extent of oh generation on ozone decay p cba was used as the oh probe since it has high reactivity towards oh k oh p cba 5 0 109 m 1s 1 but low reactivity towards ozone k o3 p cba 0 15 m 1s 1 park et al 2004 for measurement 1 0 μm p cba and ozone 10 0 100 0 μm were added to ph 3 0 7 3 or 8 5 buffer solution to initiate the reaction the p cba concentration was measured using high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1200 series usa using the method described in si section s1 4 due to the strong adsorption of p cba on jbx and the carrier oh measurement experiments were not conducted in the presence of the catalyst or carrier 2 4 kinetic modelling and statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using single tailed student s t test at the 5 significance level kinetic modelling of our experimental results was performed using the software package kintecus ianni 2020 kintecus is a simulation program that enables prediction of the concentration of reactants and products as a function of time based on numerical integration of the rate equations appropriate to a hypothesized reaction mechanism the rate constants used for the various reactions used in modelling were either obtained from literature and or measured experimentally agreement or lack thereof of the predicted concentrations of reactants and products with measured concentrations for the same entities provides a measure of the veracity of the hypothesized reaction set and or the rate constants used an analysis of the sensitivity of species concentrations to perturbations to various rate constants in the model was undertaken by principal component analysis ianni 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the surface areas of both jbx and its carrier are high with values of 1640 48 and 1499 36 m2 g 1 bet model respectively fig s4 the average pore sizes of jbx and the carrier are 2 8 0 1 and 2 6 0 1 nm bjh model respectively while the detailed synthesis procedure for jbx is commercially confidential it is purported that metals have been loaded onto the carbon to improve the catalytic activity in view of the similar surface areas and average pore sizes of jbx and its carrier we surmise that the metal loading process has little impact on the structural or textural properties of the carrier sem edx measurements were performed to determine the active metal s on the catalyst surface fig s5 it can be seen that fe peaks are more evident in the jbx spectrum compared to its carrier in addition to iron a variety of elements including sodium aluminium calcium potassium and magnesium were also present in both jbx and the carrier but at comparable abundances these ubiquitous earth metals are likely associated with the manufacturing process of the carbon carrier rather than addition of these metals for catalytic purposes nawrocki and fijołek 2013 as such we surmise that fe is the active element loaded onto to the carbon carrier with this element likely present as an iron oxide the sem edx measurement of the surface layer and the core shows that fe is present through the entirety of the catalyst figs s5 and s6 indicating that the catalyst is not of a core shell structure note that aluminium oxide present in jbx and the carrier may also exhibit catalytic activity as described in some earlier studies aghaeinejad meybodi et al 2019 kiadehi et al 2017 however iron oxide is expected to be a more reactive surface than alumina for the reaction with ozone as reported by mitchell and co workers mitchell et al 2007 and also supported by our experimental results discussed in detail in later sections wherein the presence of even a small amount of iron oxide as in jbx demonstrates higher catalytic ability than the aluminium containing carrier the point of zero charge phpzc of jbx is 8 3 slightly higher than that of the carrier 7 5 fig s7 suggesting that the presence of fe may alter the surface properties of the activated carbon note that further characterization of the nature of the iron oxides using techniques such as x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was not feasible since the loaded fe concentration was low 0 1 3 2 ozone decay in the absence and presence of catalyst as shown in fig 1 the rate of ozone decay in the absence of jbx and the carrier increases with increase in ph with nearly 12 40 and 85 ozone consumed within 30 min at ph 3 0 7 3 and 8 5 respectively this is in agreement with the mechanism that self decay of ozone is initiated by hydroxyl ions oh resulting in the formation of oh bezbarua and reckhow 2004 fábián 2006 gardoni et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 see eqs 1 7 the formation of oh on ozone decay is supported by results showing the oxidation of p cba at ph 3 0 7 3 and 8 5 fig s8 which is known to react rapidly with oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 but slowly with o 3 0 15 m 1 s 1 park et al 2004 the ph dependence of p cba oxidation supports the conclusion that o 3 decay to form oh increases with increase in ph 1 o 3 oh ho 4 2 ho 4 ho 2 o 2 3 ho 2 pk a 4 8 h o 2 4 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 5 ho 3 pk a 8 2 h o 3 6 ho 3 oh o 2 7 o h o 3 ho 2 o 2 the presence of jbx facilitates the decay of aqueous ozone with the impact of jbx much more pronounced at ph 3 0 than at 7 3 and 8 5 fig 1 furthermore our results show that the carrier also enhances the rate of ozone decay at ph 3 0 7 3 and 8 5 the overall rate of ozone decay measured here can be expressed as 8 d o 3 d t k oh k ac k fe o 3 where k oh k ac and k fe respectively represent the apparent pseudo first order rate constant of ozone reaction with oh i e self decay the activated carbon surface and iron oxide impregnated catalyst based on the measured ozone concentration under various conditions we calculated the values of k oh k ac and k fe under varying ph conditions see table s1 as shown in table s1 the value of k oh increases with increase in ph since the self decay of ozone is initiated by oh the value of k ac is similar at ph 3 0 7 3 and 8 5 which suggests that the interaction of ozone with the carbon surface is not dependent on ph this is in agreement with previous studies in which the catalytic activity of activated carbon was found to be not particularly sensitive to ph change kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 logemann and annee 1997 the value of k fe decreases with increase in ph from 3 0 to 8 5 which suggests that the protonated positively charged iron oxide surface sites interact with ozone much more rapidly than the negatively charged deprotonated sites this is in agreement with an earlier report in which only uncharged fe oh0 and or positively charged fe oh2 surface groups promote ozone decay when goethite was used as the catalyst sui et al 2010 3 3 formate oxidation by ozonation as shown in fig 2 the hcooh hcoo concentration decreases with concomitant formation of co2 in the absence of catalyst fig s9 with this result supporting the conclusion that the oxidation of hcooh hcoo occurs in the presence of ozone alone the rate and extent of hcooh hcoo oxidation increases with increase in ph for example nearly 28 8 57 7 and 70 5 hcooh hcoo were oxidized within 30 min at ph 3 0 7 3 and ph 8 5 respectively fig s9 as described in earlier studies reisz et al 2014 hcooh hcoo can be oxidized either by direct interaction with o3 and or oh formed on o3 decay eqs 9 12 the direct reaction of o3 can occur via hydride transfer eq 9 and or h abstraction eq 10 with the latter process resulting in formation of ho 3 which is a precursor for oh formation 9 hcoo o 3 co 2 ho 3 10 hcoo o 3 co 2 ho 3 11 hcoo o h co 2 h 2 o 12 co 2 o 2 co 2 o 2 the ph dependence of oxidation of hcooh hcoo should be related to the ph dependence of rate of generation and consumption of both oxidants as discussed earlier o3 undergoes decay initiated by oh resulting in the formation of oh eqs 1 7 bezbarua and reckhow 2004 fábián 2006 gardoni et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 leading to the expectation that oh mediated oxidation should be more important under alkaline conditions however as discussed above hcooh hcoo may also initiate o3 decay to form oh eqs 10 and 5 and as such the ph dependence of oh generation may not be entirely governed by o3 self decay in order to elucidate the contribution of oh to hcooh hcoo oxidation in ozonation we measured the impact of tba addition k oh tba 5 0 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 on hcooh hcoo oxidation it can be seen from fig 2 that addition of tba significantly inhibited 69 2 in 30 min hcooh hcoo oxidation at ph 8 5 however no impact of tba addition was observed at ph 7 3 and 3 0 these results support the conclusion that hcooh hcoo oxidation is governed by oh and o3 at ph 8 5 while only o3 is involved at ph 7 3 and 3 0 since oxidation of formate by o3 via h abstraction initiates oh formation eqs 10 and 5 no impact of tba addition further suggests that hcooh hcoo oxidation mostly occurs via hydride transfer eq 9 at ph 7 3 and 3 0 in agreement with the impact of tba addition we observed no impact of addition of cl fig 2 a known scavenger of oh under acidic conditions jayson et al 1973 on hcooh hcoo oxidation at ph 3 0 thus based on the observed impact of tba and cl we conclude that formate oxidation by conventional ozonation occurs via hydride transfer for ph 7 3 while under alkaline ph conditions direct o3 interaction via hydride transfer as well as oh formed via o3 self decay and or formate o3 interaction via h abstraction play a role the mechanism of formate oxidation by ozone determined here is in agreement with the mechanism reported by reisz et al 2014 however differs from that reported in an earlier study yapsakli and can 2004 the differences in the experimental conditions ph higher formate concentration etc employed in the two studies possibly contributes to the discrepancy in the mechanism which as shown here varies considerably with ph as well as formate concentration discussed in detail in later sections we would like to highlight that a significant fraction of the oh formed on o3 decay will be scavenged by bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions present in the buffer solution eq 13 the scavenging of oh by hco3 and co3 2 has been reported to result in a decrease in the ozone efficiency in various earlier studies liu et al 2016 masten et al 1996a zhao et al 2010 however the scavenging of oh by hco3 and co3 2 does not influence formate oxidation since the carbonate radical co3 formed from the reaction of oh with hco3 and co3 2 is able to oxidize formate eq 14 neta et al 1988 instead the scavenging of oh by hco3 and co3 2 prevents the futile consumption of ozone via o3 oh interaction eq 7 thereby stabilizing ozone zhao et al 2010 and increasing the efficiency of the ozonation process 13 hco 3 co 3 2 oh co 3 h 2 o 14 hcoo co 3 co 2 hco 3 3 4 formate removal by catalytic ozonation 3 4 1 formate oxidation by catalytic ozonation as can be clearly seen in fig 3 the hcooh hcoo concentration decreased on ozonation with concomitant formation of co2 in the presence of jbx and carrier the extent of oxidation of hcooh hcoo by ozonation in the presence of jbx or carrier was slightly lower than that obtained by conventional ozonation at ph 7 3 and 8 5 with this result indicating that the presence of the catalyst and or carrier does not improve the oxidation efficiency at least under the circumneutral ph conditions investigated here see table s2 in contrast the presence of jbx or carrier enhanced oxidative hcooh hcoo removal at ph 3 0 fig 3 and table s2 note that at all ph conditions investigated here hcooh hcoo removal via adsorption during catalytic ozonation was minor 20 table s2 our results further show that the impact of jbx on hcooh hcoo oxidation at ph 3 0 was more pronounced than that of the carrier at ph 3 0 this observation supports the conclusion that the presence of iron oxides at the jbx surface promotes ozone decay fig 1 and consequently oxidant generation and formate oxidation at ph 3 0 fig 3 note that the concentration of dissolved iron in the ozonated ph 3 0 suspension containing 10 g l 1 jbx was below the detection limit of the icp oes instrument 0 01 mg l 1 suggesting that homogeneous catalytic ozonation as a result of interaction with any leached iron from jbx was negligible the carrier also improved hcooh hcoo oxidation at ph 3 0 i e the interaction of o3 with activated carbon alone at this ph also results in formation of oxidants capable of oxidizing hcooh hcoo varying the catalyst dosage from 10 0 to 1 0 g l 1 decreases the rate and extent of ozone decay and formate oxidation at ph 3 0 however no significant p 0 05 using single tailed student s t test influence of varying the catalyst dosage was observed at ph 8 5 fig s10 this observation further supports the conclusion that jbx is active in initiating ozone decay and oxidant generation under acidic conditions at ph 8 5 however the catalyst is ineffectual with most of the ozone decay and formate oxidation observed under these conditions occurring via the conventional ozonation process only 3 4 2 nature of the oxidant generated during catalytic ozonation at ph 3 0 in order to gain insight into the nature of the oxidant s generated during catalytic ozonation at ph 3 0 we measured the impact of tba and cl addition on the oxidation of hcooh hcoo in the presence of jbx or carrier at ph 3 0 as shown in fig 4 and table s1 addition of tba and cl significantly inhibits catalytic oxidation of hcooh hcoo at ph 3 0 when jbx is used as the catalyst specifically in the presence of 3 0 mm tba and 50 0 mm cl the extent of hcooh hcoo oxidation decreased by 47 1 and 46 1 respectively this is in contrast with the observed impact of tba and cl during ozonation only fig 2 with this result supporting the conclusion that the oxidant involved in hcooh hcoo oxidation is different for the conventional and catalytic ozonation processes at ph 3 0 since tba and cl are both known to scavenge oh under acidic conditions jayson et al 1973 sun and pignatello 1995 it appears that the oxidant generated during catalytic ozonation using jbx as the catalyst is oh this hypothesis is in agreement with earlier studies which reported that interaction of o3 with the iron oxides generates oh bing et al 2015 sui et al 2010 yan et al 2016 based on the observed impact of cl we further envisage that the majority of the oxidation of hcooh hcoo occurs at the solid liquid interface and or in bulk solution legube and leitner 1999 masten 1991 rather than on the surface of the catalyst cl is unlikely to scavenge surface oxidant s as the short lifetime of oh largely excludes the possibility of diffusion into the bulk solution d 10 10 m2 s 1 with the thickness of diffusion boundary layer being 50 100 μm zhang et al 2017 we suggest that oxidation of hcooh hcoo occurs in the solid liquid interface with hcooh hcoo and oxidant concentrations near the surface determining the rate of hcooh hcoo oxidation the hypothesis that the majority of the oxidation occurs in the solid liquid interface rather than on the surface is also in agreement with the exceptionally high oxidation efficiency i e 55 within 5 min as shown in fig 3b compared to the extent of adsorption observed when no o3 was added i e 28 after 30 min as shown in fig s11a given that the majority of the oxidation likely occurs in the interfacial ozone it appears that adsorption is not a precursor step for oxidation at least for the catalyst and the experimental conditions investigated here this conclusion is further supported by the observation that negligible oxidation of hcooh hcoo was observed when formate was pre adsorbed onto the catalyst prior to addition of ozone fig s12 the mechanism of hcooh hcoo oxidation by catalytic ozonation in the presence of the activated carbon carrier appears to differ from that occurring in the presence of jbx since no impact of tba and cl addition on hcooh hcoo oxidation was observed at ph 3 0 in the presence of the carrier fig s13 the exact mechanism and the nature of the oxidant generated on activated carbon o3 interaction is not clear based on our results but may possibly include carbon based radicals that are not readily scavenged by tba and cl note that surface mediated hcooh hcoo oxidation is expected to be unimportant in the presence of the carrier since formate was found to adsorb minimally to the carrier at ph 3 0 fig s11 3 5 impact of nature of the organics on catalytic ozonation as discussed above the catalyst used here is not effective in promoting oxidation of hcooh hcoo under circumneutral ph conditions the ineffectiveness of the catalyst at alkaline ph is possibly related to i the inability of the catalyst to promote oxidant generation under circumneutral ph conditions and or ii rapid o3 formate interaction with formate oxidation not limited by oh or other strong oxidant s formation at these ph conditions as discussed previously formate can be effectively oxidized by ozone however for ozone resistant organic compounds oh formation via o3 self decay and or catalyst o3 interaction will be imperative to induce their oxidation to probe this issue further we measured the oxidation of oxalate an ozone resistant organic compound garoma and gurol 2005 during catalytic ozonation using jbx as the catalyst at ph 7 3 as shown in fig 5 no significant increase in oxalate oxidation was observed in the presence of jbx with this result supporting the conclusion that the inefficiency of the catalyst is not related to the nature of the organic compound but rather is due to its inability to generate oxidants under circumneutral ph conditions 3 6 mechanism of catalytic ozonation and kinetic modelling based on the results presented we draw the following conclusions regarding the mechanism underpinning hcooh hcoo oxidation during conventional and catalytic ozonation i the mechanism and rate of formate oxidation by ozonation are ph dependent direct oxidation of hcooh hcoo by o3 via hydride transfer is important at ph 3 0 and 7 3 while both o3 and oh are involved in hcooh hcoo oxidation under alkaline conditions ii for jbx iron oxide surface sites present on the activated carbon carrier are the main adsorption sites for hcoo with positively charged surface iron oxide sites playing a key role in hcoo uptake iii the activated carbon carrier interacts with o3 resulting in formation of surface oxidants capable of oxidizing hcooh hcoo near the carbon surface under acidic conditions iv iron oxides on the activated carbon surface enhance ozone decay with resultant formation of oxidants most likely oh under acidic conditions only v the rate and extent of oxidant generation increases with increase in the catalyst dosage under acidic conditions suggesting that the scavenging of oxidant by the catalyst surface is relatively unimportant at least over the catalyst concentration range investigated here vi impact of tba and cl oxidation during catalytic ozonation at ph 3 0 supports the hypothesis that oxidation of hcooh hcoo occurs in the solid liquid interfacial region and or bulk solution and hence is not limited by the extent of adsorption of the organics a schematic of the various reactions potentially involved in the catalytic ozonation mediated oxidation of hcooh hcoo is provided in fig 6 based on the reaction mechanism shown in fig 6 we have developed a reaction set and associated kinetic model to account for ozone decay and formate removal by conventional and catalytic ozonation table 1 the reactions used to explain self decay of ozone reactions 1 6 table 1 and formate oxidation reactions 11 15 table 1 by ozonation alone are obtained from the literature with reported rate constants for these reactions used in almost all cases furthermore as discussed earlier we have also included the scavenging of oh by bicarbonate carbonate ions and or h2o2 present reactions 7 10 in the experimental matrix since these reactions also have a significant influence on ozone self decay kinetics as well as oh availability for formate oxidation to explain the ozone decay and formate oxidation by catalytic ozonation we have developed the kinetic model based on the following key processes shown in reactions 16 27 i ozone present in the bulk solution diffuses rapidly into the solid liquid interfacial region a portion of which subsequently attaches to the iron oxide surface a portion of the surface ozone results in formation of oh on interaction with the catalyst which diffuses to the solid liquid interface reactions 16 20 table 1 ii formate present in the bulk solution rapidly diffuses to the solid liquid interface reaction 21 table 1 a portion of which subsequently attaches to the iron oxide surface reaction 22 table 1 iii rapid oxidation of formate present at the solid liquid interface and on the catalyst surface occurs via interaction with oh present in these zones reactions 23 and 24 table 1 we would like to highlight that while we have assumed oh is formed on the surface via catalyst o3 interaction an alternate pathway wherein superoxide is formed on the surface which subsequently diffuses into the bulk solution and results in formation of oh upon reaction with ozone as reported earlier is also a possibility sánchez polo et al 2005 while there is no direct experimental evidence to reject this mechanism of oh generation during the catalytic ozonation process we were not able to explain the rate and extent of formate oxidation observed in our experiments based on this mechanism and hence is not discussed further here furthermore the scavenging of oh generated by the catalyst surface was assumed to be unimportant in the kinetic model developed here given that increasing the catalyst dosage increased oh generation fig s10 note that for the catalytic ozonation process modelling of formate oxidation was only performed at ph 3 0 since the catalyst was determined to be active under this ph condition only detailed description of the reactions and justification of the rate constants used is provided in si section s3 it should be noted that the model predictions are not based on empirical fitting rather the model output is calculated by solving the rate equations obtained for a comprehensive reaction set that accounts for all key processes operating in the system of interest as shown in figs 1 4 s8 s10 s11 and s14 15 the kinetic model developed here provides good description of experimental results obtained at ph 3 0 7 3 and 8 5 the sensitivity analysis of the model table s4 using principal component analysis shows that the model output i e formate and ozone concentration is not sensitive to perturbations in the rate constant for reactions 3 4 9 14 and 19 table 1 with this result suggesting that these reactions are not critical to ozone degradation or formate oxidation while the rate constants used to account for formate oxidation by ozone only are well constrained based on the literature evidence the deduced rate constants for the dominant catalytic ozonation reactions i e reactions controlling o3 catalyst interaction reaction 17 and oh yield at the solid liquid interface reactions 18 19 and 20 are also well constrained as evidenced by the relatively deep and narrow minima observed in the plot of the relative residual values against a range of possible rate constant values fig s16 we have used the kinetic model to determine the efficiency of ozone usage in ozonation as a function of initial organic concentration and ph as shown in fig 7 a at low organic concentrations the ozone utilization efficiency is relatively low under alkaline ph conditions due to the rapid self decay of ozone and low selectivity of any oh formed however at higher organic concentrations a condition more representative of wastewaters the ozone utilization efficiency is nearly constant with ph since most of the ozone is consumed due to its interaction with the organics rather than self decay overall these results show that the impact of ph on the rate and extent of oxidation should be taken into consideration especially for wastewaters containing low organic concentrations when designing the premixing stage either as an integrated unit in catalytic ozonation or in a multi stage ozonation reactor in order to maximize ozone utilization during this treatment step since the ozone utilization efficiency increases with increase in organic concentration at all phs concentrating the organics in wastewaters prior to ozonation will significantly enhance the process efficiency as discussed earlier hcooh hcoo oxidation may occur via direct o3 interaction and or via reaction with oh note that hcooh hcoo oxidation by oh also includes the contribution from co3 which is formed on oh scavenging by bicarbonate carbonate ions we have used the kinetic model developed here to predict the contribution of o3 and oh over a range of organic concentrations and ph this will be useful in predicting the influence of the matrix on the performance of the ozonation process for example if the oxidation is driven by o3 only the influence of inorganic and organic entities capable of scavenging oh and resulting in formation of non reactive product will not be important in contrast entities impacting the stability of o3 such as carbonate as discussed earlier will be important for o3 driven oxidation of organic compounds as shown in fig 7b the extent of oxidation of formate occurring via a non radical pathway varies considerably as a function of ph and organic concentration as shown while increase in the formate concentration increases the contribution of the non radical pathway in formate oxidation the impact of ph on the contribution of the o3 mediated oxidation pathway is not straightforward at low ph i e 3 0 most of the oxidation occurs via a non radical pathway while at high ph i e 10 0 oxidation of formate occurs via interaction with oh and co3 but in the intermediate ph range the trend is variable the contribution of o3 oh and co3 to formate oxidation in the ph range 4 0 10 0 varies as result of the complex influence of carbonate concentration which varies with ph on o3 self decay and oh and co3 generation as well as due to variation in the rate constant for o3 formate reaction with variation in ph overall this result highlights that the mechanism of formate and possibly other organics oxidation by ozone varies markedly with ph and organic concentration 3 7 conclusions in the present study hcooh hcoo was used as a probe compound in order to gain mechanistic insight into the catalytic ozonation process using a commercially available carbon based catalyst we simultaneously analysed the adsorptive and oxidative removal of hcooh hcoo with results indicating that adsorption is not an important precursor step for the subsequent oxidation of this simple target compound experimentation and modelling results show that catalytic oxidation proceeds via both homogeneous oxidation in the bulk solution and heterogeneous oxidation at the solid liquid interface the solution ph also influences the catalytic ozonation performance as a result of changes in catalyst surface properties and surface iron oxide speciation that determines the extent of generation of surface oxidants the influence of jbx on ozonation performance determined in the present study is in contrast to the results obtained in various previous studies employing iron oxide and manganese oxide based catalysts andreozzi et al 1996 byun et al 2011 hsu and masten 1997 karnik et al 2005 2007 lim et al 2002 ma et al 2005 masten et al 1996b mitchell et al 2007 park et al 2012 the discrepancy in the role of iron oxides as catalyst in the present study and various earlier work is possibly related to i difference in the nature of the organics used most of the previous studies use complex organic target species karnik et al 2007 lim et al 2002 ma et al 2005 park et al 2012 which results in formation of a suite of intermediate products however only removal of the parent compound is typically measured in these studies the nature and influence of intermediate by products on ozone decay and oh formation is not investigated in these earlier studies karnik et al 2007 lim et al 2002 ma et al 2005 park et al 2012 furthermore the overall removal of parent compound is measured with no differentiation made regarding the removal of parent compound by adsorption and oxidation in most of these earlier studies karnik et al 2007 lim et al 2002 ma et al 2005 park et al 2012 in comparison here we use simple target compounds which do not form any intermediate products in both cases with direct oxidation to co2 with quantification of the proportions of the target compounds removed separately by adsorption and oxidation in the presence of ozone it is also possible that the difference in the adsorptive behaviour of formate and oxalate compared to the organics used in various earlier studies beltrán et al 2005 zhang and croué 2014 zhang et al 2008 contribute to the discrepancy in the results obtained regarding the influence of the catalyst ii difference in the nature of iron oxide it is possible that the nature and reactivity of the iron oxide used here differs to that of the iron oxides employed in various earlier studies lim et al 2002 mitchell et al 2007 park et al 2012 since the procedure used for jbx preparation is not available we are not able to determine the major factors influencing the difference in the nature of iron oxide though we would like to highlight that our preliminary work employing ferrihydrite and an fe silicate composite show similar results to those measured in the presence of jbx in the present study iii difference in ph and various other solution conditions in some of the earlier studies afzal et al 2019 ma et al 2005 orge et al 2011 wang et al 2019a yang and wu 2019 in which the ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes were compared ph was not well controlled and not the same for the ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes under investigation comparison of the performance of the ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes at different ph is likely to produce false results since the ozonation performance is strongly dependent on ph as depicted clearly in this work and various earlier studies beltrán 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 furthermore either no buffer or phosphate buffer was used in some earlier studies karnik et al 2005 yuan et al 2018 rather than the carbonate buffer used in this study the presence of a high phosphate concentration in the buffer solution enhances ozone decay ferre aracil et al 2015 thereby decreasing the efficiency of the ozone only process in contrast as mentioned here the presence of carbonate ions stabilizes ozone mizuno et al 2007 thereby increasing the efficiency of the ozone only process hence in this study the catalyst did not enhance oh generation beyond what was observed in the absence of catalyst which is already very rapid in bicarbonate buffered solution our results showed that effective formate oxidation occurs by ozonation alone with this result suggesting that conventional ozonation technologies may be effective for organic abatement in alkaline wastewaters conventional ozonation technologies are often limited by the mass transfer of gaseous ozone into the liquid phase and as such optimization of reactor design including the ozone injection system and reactor geometry should be the focus of future studies the kinetic model for formate oxidation developed here could be coupled with fluid dynamics models to predict the spatial concentration of organic compounds and oxidants which would assist in optimizing reactor design it is also worth noting that iron oxide impregnated activated carbon significantly enhanced formate oxidation at ph 3 0 suggesting that catalytic ozonation could be a potential solution for treatment of acidic wastewaters for treatment of acidic wastewaters fenton processes are often used however catalytic ozonation using iron oxide coated or impregnated activated carbon might be a cleaner option since no sludge would be produced however the cost of treatment for the two technologies needs to be compared under various scenarios prior to application of catalytic ozonation for treatment of acidic wastewaters furthermore even though leaching of fe from the catalyst was shown to be minimal at time scales investigated here it may become important during long term operation dissolved iron leached from the catalyst may contribute to homogeneous catalytic ozonation but this also inevitably will result in a decrease in the lifetime and effectiveness of the catalyst thus testing the long term performance of the catalyst under acidic conditions is necessary prior to its application for treatment of acidic wastewaters we would like to highlight that even though the current study presents results for a commercial carbon based catalyst which is not effective under ph conditions similar to most wastewaters the results of the present study provide important insights with regard to the influence of ph on formate oxidation by the conventional ozonation process furthermore the present study provides an approach to test the effectiveness of other catalysts commercial and or laboratory synthesized as shown here systematic measurement of ozone decay removal of the parent compound as well as formation of the oxidized product s under well controlled conditions are required for clearly elucidating the mechanism of catalytic ozonation ph has a significant influence on both the mechanism and rate of conventional ozonation and hence ph needs to be properly controlled when comparing the effectiveness of any catalytic ozonation process with ozonation only for example comparing the performance of a catalytic ozonation process at ph 8 5 with an ozone only process operating at ph 7 3 for formate removal see fig 3 would produce erroneous conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the catalyst overall the present study provides important insight into the formate removal mechanism during conventional and catalytic ozonation using iron oxide impregnated carbon catalysts under varying ph conditions we are of the view that there would be merit in investigating the mode of action of other catalysts with respect to their ability to enhance the ozone mediated oxidation of organic contaminants utilizing the methodology developed here additionally the influence of various matrix constituents such as dissolved organic matter and anions on the efficacy of conventional and catalytic ozonation processes for a range of target organics will be investigated in our future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

17953,in the present study radiolabelled formate was used as a probe compound in order to gain mechanistic insight into the catalytic ozonation process using a commercially available iron oxide impregnated activated carbon catalyst we simultaneously analysed the adsorptive and oxidative removal of formate in order to determine the contribution of the catalyst to adsorption and oxidant generation processes respectively our results show that the presence of the catalyst enhanced ozone decay as well as the rate and extent of formate oxidation at ph 3 0 compared to that observed in the presence of ozone alone as a result of oxidant generation via o3 fe oxide interaction a reduction in rate and extent of formate oxidation on addition of t butanol and cl known hydroxyl radical oh scavengers under acidic conditions provides evidence that the oxidant generated during catalytic ozonation at ph 3 0 is oh moreover the oxidation of formate during catalytic ozonation mostly occurs at the solid liquid interface and or in bulk solution with adsorption playing no role in the overall oxidation process with this finding supported by the exceptionally high oxidation efficiency compared to the extent of adsorption observed when no o3 was added while catalytic ozonation was effective in formate oxidation at ph 3 0 the presence of the catalyst did not lead to an increase in either the rate or extent of formate oxidation at ph 7 3 and 8 5 suggesting that only protonated iron oxide surface sites generate strong oxidant s on interaction with o3 based on our understanding of the processes operating during the ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes a mathematical model has been developed that adequately describes the experimental results obtained here overall this study shows that systematic measurement of ozone decay removal of the parent compound as well as formation of the oxidized products under well controlled conditions are required for unequivocal elucidation of the mechanism of catalytic ozonation graphical abstract image 1 keywords catalytic ozonation activated carbon hydroxyl radicals adsorption iron oxides 1 introduction ozone is a relatively strong oxidant and has been widely used in the treatment of drinking waters and wastewaters however conventional ozonation technologies are usually constrained by poor mass transfer of ozone from the gas phase to liquid phase low ozone utilization efficiency and limited mineralization of organics beltrán 2003 janknecht et al 2001 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the addition of a catalyst has been proposed to overcome some of these problems with the catalyst purportedly enhancing the efficiency of the process as a result of increased generation of oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals oh on catalyst ozone interaction bing et al 2015 nawrocki 2013 oulton et al 2015 wei et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 2017 2018 the nature of the oxidant s generated in the catalytic ozonation systems appears to depend on the type of catalyst used beltrán et al 2006 biernacki et al 2019 bing et al 2015 fijołek et al 2019 ikhlaq et al 2012 2013 sánchez polo et al 2005 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 2017 for example sánchez polo et al 2005 demonstrated that interaction of ozone with carbon surfaces generated superoxide ho2 which enhanced the transformation of ozone to oh sánchez polo et al 2005 similar results were reported in the presence of alumina and goethite with formation of oh on catalyst o3 interaction determined to be responsible for enhanced organic oxidation ikhlaq et al 2012 2013 the formation of surface atomic oxygen was reported to occur in the presence of al2o3 and pdo bing et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 while singlet oxygen and ho2 were identified as the dominant oxidants when reduced graphene oxide was employed as the catalyst wang et al 2016 in addition to formation of reactive oxidants during catalytic ozonation stabilization of ozone by adsorption onto the catalyst surface and or adsorption of organics are also reported to enhance the oxidation efficiency in the catalytic ozonation process gao et al 2017 wei et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 yuan et al 2018 reported that futile aqueous ozone decay was reduced via adsorption of ozone onto amorphous iron silicate increasing the possibility of formation of oh on ozone catalyst interaction furthermore various earlier studies showed that the adsorption of organics including parent compound and or intermediates formed on oxidation on the catalyst surface increased the overall oxidation capacity during catalytic ozonation gao et al 2017 ikhlaq et al 2012 2013 2018 wei et al 2019 the results of investigations employing oxalate as the target organic suggested that formation of surface oxalate metal complexes was responsible for enhancement of the oxidation efficiency by catalytic ozonation zhang et al 2011 2012 in contrast some studies showed that adsorption of organics was not critical ernst et al 2004 and even decreased the performance of catalytic ozonation when employing alumina and clay based catalysts vel leitner et al 1999 and or carbon nanotubes as catalyst zhang et al 2017 as should be clear from the above brief review despite extensive studies on catalytic ozonation the role of the catalyst is not well understood there is continued controversy regarding the contribution of the catalyst to organics adsorption and oxidant s generation with the uncertainty in part ascribed to the use of complex organic compounds such as humic substances and aromatic compounds for which oxidation results in formation of a suite of intermediates and by products gao et al 2017 lee et al 2017 zhong et al 2018 while these organic contaminants may be representative of real wastewaters the coexistence of the formation of complex oxidized intermediates and their subsequent interaction with the catalyst and ozone makes it very difficult to clearly elucidate the mechanism responsible for contaminant degradation moreover ph is not well controlled in many of the reported studies which makes the comparison of conventional ozonation and catalytic ozonation difficult nawrocki 2013 to partially address the problems of previous studies radiolabelled formate and oxalate were chosen as the target compounds in the present study since they have well defined oxidation pathways and in both cases result in formation of co2 and h2o as the only products flyunt et al 2001 garoma and gurol 2005 by quantifying both the loss of formate oxalate and the generation of co2 over time we are able to explicitly differentiate removal of formate oxalate by the adsorption and oxidation processes additionally these short chain carboxylic acids are good target contaminants since they are recognized as important end products on ozonation of aromatic organics such as humic and fulvic acids kuo 1998 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in order to understand the influence of ph on organics removal by ozonation both conventional and catalytic we investigated the process performance under varying ph conditions in the ph range 3 0 8 5 a commercially available iron oxide impregnated activated carbon catalyst provided by beijing originwater technology co ltd china bow was used in all experiments we chose a carbon based catalyst for these studies since carbon materials are inexpensive and possess abundant surface sites based on our experimental results a mathematical model has been developed that satisfactorily describes the results of formate oxidation by both ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes we would like to highlight that even though the effect of various solution conditions such as ph ozone dosage and organic dosage on the overall efficiency of the ozonation process were determined in this study no attempt was made to optimise the operational parameters given that these will be very specific to the nature and concentration of the organics examined nevertheless the mathematical model developed here can be used to optimise process conditions such that the rate and extent of contaminant degradation is maximised 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all solutions were prepared in milli q mq water with 18 mω cm 1 resistivity unless stated otherwise all glassware was soaked in 5 v v nitric acid prior to use all experiments were conducted at room temperature of 22 0 1 0 c all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received unless stated otherwise all experiments were performed at ph 3 0 7 3 or 8 5 for ph 3 0 studies a 1 0 mm hno3 solution was used as the buffer while a 2 0 mm nahco3 air saturated solution was used for ph 8 5 experiments for ph 7 3 a 2 0 mm nahco3 solution in equilibrium with synthetic air containing 6000 ppm of co2 hiq certified calibration standards boc was used to allow equilibration of co2 between the solution and the gas phase solutions were sparged in dreschel bottles for 2 h prior to experiments 1 0 m hno3 and 1 0 m naoh stock solutions were used to adjust the ph of the reaction solution when required while the ph was well controlled in the ph 3 0 and 8 5 experiments with ph variations of 0 1 units the ph of the 7 3 system increased by 0 2 0 3 units over the course of the ozonation study with this ph increase most likely a result of the decrease in the co2 partial pressure since sparging with the synthetic co2 air mixture was not continued during the experiments stock solutions of radiolabelled and non radiolabelled sodium formate were prepared in mq water at concentrations of 0 2 mm and 1 8 mm and for sodium oxalate 0 3 and 2 7 mm respectively a 1 0 mm indigo stock solution was prepared by dissolving potassium indigo trisulfonate in 20 0 mm phosphate buffer at ph 2 0 and kept in the dark prior to use ozone was produced by an ozone generator t4000 5 0 g l 1 oxyzone pty ltd australia using pure oxygen gas flow rate of 650 0 ml min 1 as the gas source a 300 400 μm aqueous ozone stock solution was prepared by sparging the ozone and oxygen gas mixture into 120 ml of mq for 20 min with the aqueous ozone concentration determined using uv spectroscopy molar absorptivity of o3 is 3200 m 1 cm 1 at 260 nm von sonntag and von gunten 2012 an 83 3 μm stock solution of p chlorobenzoic acid p cba was prepared in mq and used as a probe compound for oh measurement all reagents were stored at 4 c prior to use since formate exists as both hcooh and hcoo in the ph range investigated here we use hcooh hcoo to represent total formate from hereon 2 2 catalyst characterization a commercial iron oxide impregnated carbon catalyst termed jbx and its activated carbon carrier referred to as the carrier from hereon were supplied by bow upon receipt the catalyst and the carrier were prewashed with mq water until the supernatant was clear and then dried before use the surface area and the pore size of the catalyst were acquired using n2 sorption isotherms and analysed by brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh models the samples were degassed at 150 c for 8 h prior to the test to further characterise the surface properties and composition of the catalyst and the carrier scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx fei nova nanosem 230 fe sem was performed on both the surface and core of jbx see si section s1 1 for more details to characterise the surface charge of the catalyst zeta potential measurements over a ph range of 3 0 10 0 were performed using a malvern nano zs zen3600 zetasizer the catalysts used here were in form of pellets with length of ca 5 mm and 3 mm diameter since the catalysts were in the form of relatively large particles the dosage of catalyst was set at 1 0 or 10 0 g l 1 to provide sufficient surface sites for ozone catalyst and formate oxalate catalyst interactions beltrán et al 2002 biernacki et al 2019 note that even though the overall dosage of the catalyst was high the active metal concentration was very low 0 1 of the total weight of the catalyst and comparable with the catalyst dosages used in various earlier studies faria et al 2008 nawrocki and fijołek 2013 sánchez polo et al 2006a wang et al 2019b we would also like to highlight that we used the activated carbon carrier as the control in all experiments to test the role of the iron oxide the active site in jbx as discussed later associated with the carrier rather than using well defined iron oxides since the exact nature of the iron oxide loaded on the carrier cannot be determined see section 3 1 for more details 2 3 experimental setup 2 3 1 formate degradation the experimental setup and method used for simultaneous measurement of adsorption and oxidation of hcooh hcoo on ozonation are described in detail in si section s1 2 briefly 1 0 μm formate consisting of 0 1 μm radiolabelled and 0 9 μm non radiolabelled formate and ozone 1 0 100 0 μm were added to ph 3 0 7 3 or 8 5 buffer solution in the absence and presence of 1 0 or 10 0 g l 1 catalyst or carrier the concentrations of h14cooh h14coo remaining and 14co2 formed following oxidation at various time intervals were measured to investigate the role of oh in the hcooh hcoo oxidation process t butanol tba and cl for ph 3 0 only were used as oh scavengers in order to investigate the importance of formate adsorption on its overall oxidation during catalytic ozonation pre adsorption of 1 0 μm formate was performed on 10 0 g l 1 jbx at ph 3 0 after 4 h when nearly 80 of the added formate was adsorbed on jbx the catalysts were withdrawn and re dispersed in fresh ph 3 0 buffer solution subsequently 10 0 μm of o3 was added to initiate the oxidation with the concentrations of h14cooh h14coo and 14co2 measured as described in si section s1 2 2 3 2 oxalate degradation in order to investigate the influence of the nature of the target organic on rate and extent of degradation the oxidation of oxalate was investigated at ph 7 3 while formate can be oxidized by both o3 and oh oxalate has low reactivity towards o3 k o3 0 04 m 1s 1 beltrán 2003 beltrán et al 2003 garoma and gurol 2005 with oxidation of oxalate mostly governed by its interaction with oh k oh 5 6 106 m 1s 1 garoma and gurol 2005 formed on o3 decay the experimental setup and procedure used for oxalate oxidation were identical to that described for formate degradation briefly 1 0 μm oxalate consisting of 0 1 μm radiolabelled and 0 9 μm non radiolabelled oxalate and ozone 10 0 μm were added to ph 7 3 buffer solution in the absence and presence of 10 0 g l 1 jbx with the concentrations of oxalate remaining and 14co2 formed continuously measured using the method described in si section s1 2 2 3 3 ozone decay investigation of aqueous ozone decay was performed in head space free gas tight syringe reactors fig s3 for measurement aqueous ozone 120 0 μm was added to ph 3 0 7 3 or 8 5 buffer solution in the absence and presence of 1 0 or 10 0 g l 1 jbx or carrier the aqueous ozone concentration was measured using the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 as described in detail in si section s1 3 we would like to highlight that even though the initial ozone concentration used in the formate oxalate degradation studies and ozone decay studies were different due to the constraints on the detection limit of the method used for ozone measurement the difference in initial ozone concentration has no impact on the interpretation of our results and conclusions made here since the measured half lifes of ozone were similar for various initial o3 concentrations t 1 2 11 7 and 10 5 min for initial o3 concentrations of 10 0 and 120 0 μm respectively at ph 8 5 2 3 4 hydroxyl radical measurement to evaluate the rate and extent of oh generation on ozone decay p cba was used as the oh probe since it has high reactivity towards oh k oh p cba 5 0 109 m 1s 1 but low reactivity towards ozone k o3 p cba 0 15 m 1s 1 park et al 2004 for measurement 1 0 μm p cba and ozone 10 0 100 0 μm were added to ph 3 0 7 3 or 8 5 buffer solution to initiate the reaction the p cba concentration was measured using high performance liquid chromatography agilent 1200 series usa using the method described in si section s1 4 due to the strong adsorption of p cba on jbx and the carrier oh measurement experiments were not conducted in the presence of the catalyst or carrier 2 4 kinetic modelling and statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using single tailed student s t test at the 5 significance level kinetic modelling of our experimental results was performed using the software package kintecus ianni 2020 kintecus is a simulation program that enables prediction of the concentration of reactants and products as a function of time based on numerical integration of the rate equations appropriate to a hypothesized reaction mechanism the rate constants used for the various reactions used in modelling were either obtained from literature and or measured experimentally agreement or lack thereof of the predicted concentrations of reactants and products with measured concentrations for the same entities provides a measure of the veracity of the hypothesized reaction set and or the rate constants used an analysis of the sensitivity of species concentrations to perturbations to various rate constants in the model was undertaken by principal component analysis ianni 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the surface areas of both jbx and its carrier are high with values of 1640 48 and 1499 36 m2 g 1 bet model respectively fig s4 the average pore sizes of jbx and the carrier are 2 8 0 1 and 2 6 0 1 nm bjh model respectively while the detailed synthesis procedure for jbx is commercially confidential it is purported that metals have been loaded onto the carbon to improve the catalytic activity in view of the similar surface areas and average pore sizes of jbx and its carrier we surmise that the metal loading process has little impact on the structural or textural properties of the carrier sem edx measurements were performed to determine the active metal s on the catalyst surface fig s5 it can be seen that fe peaks are more evident in the jbx spectrum compared to its carrier in addition to iron a variety of elements including sodium aluminium calcium potassium and magnesium were also present in both jbx and the carrier but at comparable abundances these ubiquitous earth metals are likely associated with the manufacturing process of the carbon carrier rather than addition of these metals for catalytic purposes nawrocki and fijołek 2013 as such we surmise that fe is the active element loaded onto to the carbon carrier with this element likely present as an iron oxide the sem edx measurement of the surface layer and the core shows that fe is present through the entirety of the catalyst figs s5 and s6 indicating that the catalyst is not of a core shell structure note that aluminium oxide present in jbx and the carrier may also exhibit catalytic activity as described in some earlier studies aghaeinejad meybodi et al 2019 kiadehi et al 2017 however iron oxide is expected to be a more reactive surface than alumina for the reaction with ozone as reported by mitchell and co workers mitchell et al 2007 and also supported by our experimental results discussed in detail in later sections wherein the presence of even a small amount of iron oxide as in jbx demonstrates higher catalytic ability than the aluminium containing carrier the point of zero charge phpzc of jbx is 8 3 slightly higher than that of the carrier 7 5 fig s7 suggesting that the presence of fe may alter the surface properties of the activated carbon note that further characterization of the nature of the iron oxides using techniques such as x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was not feasible since the loaded fe concentration was low 0 1 3 2 ozone decay in the absence and presence of catalyst as shown in fig 1 the rate of ozone decay in the absence of jbx and the carrier increases with increase in ph with nearly 12 40 and 85 ozone consumed within 30 min at ph 3 0 7 3 and 8 5 respectively this is in agreement with the mechanism that self decay of ozone is initiated by hydroxyl ions oh resulting in the formation of oh bezbarua and reckhow 2004 fábián 2006 gardoni et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 see eqs 1 7 the formation of oh on ozone decay is supported by results showing the oxidation of p cba at ph 3 0 7 3 and 8 5 fig s8 which is known to react rapidly with oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 but slowly with o 3 0 15 m 1 s 1 park et al 2004 the ph dependence of p cba oxidation supports the conclusion that o 3 decay to form oh increases with increase in ph 1 o 3 oh ho 4 2 ho 4 ho 2 o 2 3 ho 2 pk a 4 8 h o 2 4 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 5 ho 3 pk a 8 2 h o 3 6 ho 3 oh o 2 7 o h o 3 ho 2 o 2 the presence of jbx facilitates the decay of aqueous ozone with the impact of jbx much more pronounced at ph 3 0 than at 7 3 and 8 5 fig 1 furthermore our results show that the carrier also enhances the rate of ozone decay at ph 3 0 7 3 and 8 5 the overall rate of ozone decay measured here can be expressed as 8 d o 3 d t k oh k ac k fe o 3 where k oh k ac and k fe respectively represent the apparent pseudo first order rate constant of ozone reaction with oh i e self decay the activated carbon surface and iron oxide impregnated catalyst based on the measured ozone concentration under various conditions we calculated the values of k oh k ac and k fe under varying ph conditions see table s1 as shown in table s1 the value of k oh increases with increase in ph since the self decay of ozone is initiated by oh the value of k ac is similar at ph 3 0 7 3 and 8 5 which suggests that the interaction of ozone with the carbon surface is not dependent on ph this is in agreement with previous studies in which the catalytic activity of activated carbon was found to be not particularly sensitive to ph change kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 logemann and annee 1997 the value of k fe decreases with increase in ph from 3 0 to 8 5 which suggests that the protonated positively charged iron oxide surface sites interact with ozone much more rapidly than the negatively charged deprotonated sites this is in agreement with an earlier report in which only uncharged fe oh0 and or positively charged fe oh2 surface groups promote ozone decay when goethite was used as the catalyst sui et al 2010 3 3 formate oxidation by ozonation as shown in fig 2 the hcooh hcoo concentration decreases with concomitant formation of co2 in the absence of catalyst fig s9 with this result supporting the conclusion that the oxidation of hcooh hcoo occurs in the presence of ozone alone the rate and extent of hcooh hcoo oxidation increases with increase in ph for example nearly 28 8 57 7 and 70 5 hcooh hcoo were oxidized within 30 min at ph 3 0 7 3 and ph 8 5 respectively fig s9 as described in earlier studies reisz et al 2014 hcooh hcoo can be oxidized either by direct interaction with o3 and or oh formed on o3 decay eqs 9 12 the direct reaction of o3 can occur via hydride transfer eq 9 and or h abstraction eq 10 with the latter process resulting in formation of ho 3 which is a precursor for oh formation 9 hcoo o 3 co 2 ho 3 10 hcoo o 3 co 2 ho 3 11 hcoo o h co 2 h 2 o 12 co 2 o 2 co 2 o 2 the ph dependence of oxidation of hcooh hcoo should be related to the ph dependence of rate of generation and consumption of both oxidants as discussed earlier o3 undergoes decay initiated by oh resulting in the formation of oh eqs 1 7 bezbarua and reckhow 2004 fábián 2006 gardoni et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 leading to the expectation that oh mediated oxidation should be more important under alkaline conditions however as discussed above hcooh hcoo may also initiate o3 decay to form oh eqs 10 and 5 and as such the ph dependence of oh generation may not be entirely governed by o3 self decay in order to elucidate the contribution of oh to hcooh hcoo oxidation in ozonation we measured the impact of tba addition k oh tba 5 0 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 on hcooh hcoo oxidation it can be seen from fig 2 that addition of tba significantly inhibited 69 2 in 30 min hcooh hcoo oxidation at ph 8 5 however no impact of tba addition was observed at ph 7 3 and 3 0 these results support the conclusion that hcooh hcoo oxidation is governed by oh and o3 at ph 8 5 while only o3 is involved at ph 7 3 and 3 0 since oxidation of formate by o3 via h abstraction initiates oh formation eqs 10 and 5 no impact of tba addition further suggests that hcooh hcoo oxidation mostly occurs via hydride transfer eq 9 at ph 7 3 and 3 0 in agreement with the impact of tba addition we observed no impact of addition of cl fig 2 a known scavenger of oh under acidic conditions jayson et al 1973 on hcooh hcoo oxidation at ph 3 0 thus based on the observed impact of tba and cl we conclude that formate oxidation by conventional ozonation occurs via hydride transfer for ph 7 3 while under alkaline ph conditions direct o3 interaction via hydride transfer as well as oh formed via o3 self decay and or formate o3 interaction via h abstraction play a role the mechanism of formate oxidation by ozone determined here is in agreement with the mechanism reported by reisz et al 2014 however differs from that reported in an earlier study yapsakli and can 2004 the differences in the experimental conditions ph higher formate concentration etc employed in the two studies possibly contributes to the discrepancy in the mechanism which as shown here varies considerably with ph as well as formate concentration discussed in detail in later sections we would like to highlight that a significant fraction of the oh formed on o3 decay will be scavenged by bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions present in the buffer solution eq 13 the scavenging of oh by hco3 and co3 2 has been reported to result in a decrease in the ozone efficiency in various earlier studies liu et al 2016 masten et al 1996a zhao et al 2010 however the scavenging of oh by hco3 and co3 2 does not influence formate oxidation since the carbonate radical co3 formed from the reaction of oh with hco3 and co3 2 is able to oxidize formate eq 14 neta et al 1988 instead the scavenging of oh by hco3 and co3 2 prevents the futile consumption of ozone via o3 oh interaction eq 7 thereby stabilizing ozone zhao et al 2010 and increasing the efficiency of the ozonation process 13 hco 3 co 3 2 oh co 3 h 2 o 14 hcoo co 3 co 2 hco 3 3 4 formate removal by catalytic ozonation 3 4 1 formate oxidation by catalytic ozonation as can be clearly seen in fig 3 the hcooh hcoo concentration decreased on ozonation with concomitant formation of co2 in the presence of jbx and carrier the extent of oxidation of hcooh hcoo by ozonation in the presence of jbx or carrier was slightly lower than that obtained by conventional ozonation at ph 7 3 and 8 5 with this result indicating that the presence of the catalyst and or carrier does not improve the oxidation efficiency at least under the circumneutral ph conditions investigated here see table s2 in contrast the presence of jbx or carrier enhanced oxidative hcooh hcoo removal at ph 3 0 fig 3 and table s2 note that at all ph conditions investigated here hcooh hcoo removal via adsorption during catalytic ozonation was minor 20 table s2 our results further show that the impact of jbx on hcooh hcoo oxidation at ph 3 0 was more pronounced than that of the carrier at ph 3 0 this observation supports the conclusion that the presence of iron oxides at the jbx surface promotes ozone decay fig 1 and consequently oxidant generation and formate oxidation at ph 3 0 fig 3 note that the concentration of dissolved iron in the ozonated ph 3 0 suspension containing 10 g l 1 jbx was below the detection limit of the icp oes instrument 0 01 mg l 1 suggesting that homogeneous catalytic ozonation as a result of interaction with any leached iron from jbx was negligible the carrier also improved hcooh hcoo oxidation at ph 3 0 i e the interaction of o3 with activated carbon alone at this ph also results in formation of oxidants capable of oxidizing hcooh hcoo varying the catalyst dosage from 10 0 to 1 0 g l 1 decreases the rate and extent of ozone decay and formate oxidation at ph 3 0 however no significant p 0 05 using single tailed student s t test influence of varying the catalyst dosage was observed at ph 8 5 fig s10 this observation further supports the conclusion that jbx is active in initiating ozone decay and oxidant generation under acidic conditions at ph 8 5 however the catalyst is ineffectual with most of the ozone decay and formate oxidation observed under these conditions occurring via the conventional ozonation process only 3 4 2 nature of the oxidant generated during catalytic ozonation at ph 3 0 in order to gain insight into the nature of the oxidant s generated during catalytic ozonation at ph 3 0 we measured the impact of tba and cl addition on the oxidation of hcooh hcoo in the presence of jbx or carrier at ph 3 0 as shown in fig 4 and table s1 addition of tba and cl significantly inhibits catalytic oxidation of hcooh hcoo at ph 3 0 when jbx is used as the catalyst specifically in the presence of 3 0 mm tba and 50 0 mm cl the extent of hcooh hcoo oxidation decreased by 47 1 and 46 1 respectively this is in contrast with the observed impact of tba and cl during ozonation only fig 2 with this result supporting the conclusion that the oxidant involved in hcooh hcoo oxidation is different for the conventional and catalytic ozonation processes at ph 3 0 since tba and cl are both known to scavenge oh under acidic conditions jayson et al 1973 sun and pignatello 1995 it appears that the oxidant generated during catalytic ozonation using jbx as the catalyst is oh this hypothesis is in agreement with earlier studies which reported that interaction of o3 with the iron oxides generates oh bing et al 2015 sui et al 2010 yan et al 2016 based on the observed impact of cl we further envisage that the majority of the oxidation of hcooh hcoo occurs at the solid liquid interface and or in bulk solution legube and leitner 1999 masten 1991 rather than on the surface of the catalyst cl is unlikely to scavenge surface oxidant s as the short lifetime of oh largely excludes the possibility of diffusion into the bulk solution d 10 10 m2 s 1 with the thickness of diffusion boundary layer being 50 100 μm zhang et al 2017 we suggest that oxidation of hcooh hcoo occurs in the solid liquid interface with hcooh hcoo and oxidant concentrations near the surface determining the rate of hcooh hcoo oxidation the hypothesis that the majority of the oxidation occurs in the solid liquid interface rather than on the surface is also in agreement with the exceptionally high oxidation efficiency i e 55 within 5 min as shown in fig 3b compared to the extent of adsorption observed when no o3 was added i e 28 after 30 min as shown in fig s11a given that the majority of the oxidation likely occurs in the interfacial ozone it appears that adsorption is not a precursor step for oxidation at least for the catalyst and the experimental conditions investigated here this conclusion is further supported by the observation that negligible oxidation of hcooh hcoo was observed when formate was pre adsorbed onto the catalyst prior to addition of ozone fig s12 the mechanism of hcooh hcoo oxidation by catalytic ozonation in the presence of the activated carbon carrier appears to differ from that occurring in the presence of jbx since no impact of tba and cl addition on hcooh hcoo oxidation was observed at ph 3 0 in the presence of the carrier fig s13 the exact mechanism and the nature of the oxidant generated on activated carbon o3 interaction is not clear based on our results but may possibly include carbon based radicals that are not readily scavenged by tba and cl note that surface mediated hcooh hcoo oxidation is expected to be unimportant in the presence of the carrier since formate was found to adsorb minimally to the carrier at ph 3 0 fig s11 3 5 impact of nature of the organics on catalytic ozonation as discussed above the catalyst used here is not effective in promoting oxidation of hcooh hcoo under circumneutral ph conditions the ineffectiveness of the catalyst at alkaline ph is possibly related to i the inability of the catalyst to promote oxidant generation under circumneutral ph conditions and or ii rapid o3 formate interaction with formate oxidation not limited by oh or other strong oxidant s formation at these ph conditions as discussed previously formate can be effectively oxidized by ozone however for ozone resistant organic compounds oh formation via o3 self decay and or catalyst o3 interaction will be imperative to induce their oxidation to probe this issue further we measured the oxidation of oxalate an ozone resistant organic compound garoma and gurol 2005 during catalytic ozonation using jbx as the catalyst at ph 7 3 as shown in fig 5 no significant increase in oxalate oxidation was observed in the presence of jbx with this result supporting the conclusion that the inefficiency of the catalyst is not related to the nature of the organic compound but rather is due to its inability to generate oxidants under circumneutral ph conditions 3 6 mechanism of catalytic ozonation and kinetic modelling based on the results presented we draw the following conclusions regarding the mechanism underpinning hcooh hcoo oxidation during conventional and catalytic ozonation i the mechanism and rate of formate oxidation by ozonation are ph dependent direct oxidation of hcooh hcoo by o3 via hydride transfer is important at ph 3 0 and 7 3 while both o3 and oh are involved in hcooh hcoo oxidation under alkaline conditions ii for jbx iron oxide surface sites present on the activated carbon carrier are the main adsorption sites for hcoo with positively charged surface iron oxide sites playing a key role in hcoo uptake iii the activated carbon carrier interacts with o3 resulting in formation of surface oxidants capable of oxidizing hcooh hcoo near the carbon surface under acidic conditions iv iron oxides on the activated carbon surface enhance ozone decay with resultant formation of oxidants most likely oh under acidic conditions only v the rate and extent of oxidant generation increases with increase in the catalyst dosage under acidic conditions suggesting that the scavenging of oxidant by the catalyst surface is relatively unimportant at least over the catalyst concentration range investigated here vi impact of tba and cl oxidation during catalytic ozonation at ph 3 0 supports the hypothesis that oxidation of hcooh hcoo occurs in the solid liquid interfacial region and or bulk solution and hence is not limited by the extent of adsorption of the organics a schematic of the various reactions potentially involved in the catalytic ozonation mediated oxidation of hcooh hcoo is provided in fig 6 based on the reaction mechanism shown in fig 6 we have developed a reaction set and associated kinetic model to account for ozone decay and formate removal by conventional and catalytic ozonation table 1 the reactions used to explain self decay of ozone reactions 1 6 table 1 and formate oxidation reactions 11 15 table 1 by ozonation alone are obtained from the literature with reported rate constants for these reactions used in almost all cases furthermore as discussed earlier we have also included the scavenging of oh by bicarbonate carbonate ions and or h2o2 present reactions 7 10 in the experimental matrix since these reactions also have a significant influence on ozone self decay kinetics as well as oh availability for formate oxidation to explain the ozone decay and formate oxidation by catalytic ozonation we have developed the kinetic model based on the following key processes shown in reactions 16 27 i ozone present in the bulk solution diffuses rapidly into the solid liquid interfacial region a portion of which subsequently attaches to the iron oxide surface a portion of the surface ozone results in formation of oh on interaction with the catalyst which diffuses to the solid liquid interface reactions 16 20 table 1 ii formate present in the bulk solution rapidly diffuses to the solid liquid interface reaction 21 table 1 a portion of which subsequently attaches to the iron oxide surface reaction 22 table 1 iii rapid oxidation of formate present at the solid liquid interface and on the catalyst surface occurs via interaction with oh present in these zones reactions 23 and 24 table 1 we would like to highlight that while we have assumed oh is formed on the surface via catalyst o3 interaction an alternate pathway wherein superoxide is formed on the surface which subsequently diffuses into the bulk solution and results in formation of oh upon reaction with ozone as reported earlier is also a possibility sánchez polo et al 2005 while there is no direct experimental evidence to reject this mechanism of oh generation during the catalytic ozonation process we were not able to explain the rate and extent of formate oxidation observed in our experiments based on this mechanism and hence is not discussed further here furthermore the scavenging of oh generated by the catalyst surface was assumed to be unimportant in the kinetic model developed here given that increasing the catalyst dosage increased oh generation fig s10 note that for the catalytic ozonation process modelling of formate oxidation was only performed at ph 3 0 since the catalyst was determined to be active under this ph condition only detailed description of the reactions and justification of the rate constants used is provided in si section s3 it should be noted that the model predictions are not based on empirical fitting rather the model output is calculated by solving the rate equations obtained for a comprehensive reaction set that accounts for all key processes operating in the system of interest as shown in figs 1 4 s8 s10 s11 and s14 15 the kinetic model developed here provides good description of experimental results obtained at ph 3 0 7 3 and 8 5 the sensitivity analysis of the model table s4 using principal component analysis shows that the model output i e formate and ozone concentration is not sensitive to perturbations in the rate constant for reactions 3 4 9 14 and 19 table 1 with this result suggesting that these reactions are not critical to ozone degradation or formate oxidation while the rate constants used to account for formate oxidation by ozone only are well constrained based on the literature evidence the deduced rate constants for the dominant catalytic ozonation reactions i e reactions controlling o3 catalyst interaction reaction 17 and oh yield at the solid liquid interface reactions 18 19 and 20 are also well constrained as evidenced by the relatively deep and narrow minima observed in the plot of the relative residual values against a range of possible rate constant values fig s16 we have used the kinetic model to determine the efficiency of ozone usage in ozonation as a function of initial organic concentration and ph as shown in fig 7 a at low organic concentrations the ozone utilization efficiency is relatively low under alkaline ph conditions due to the rapid self decay of ozone and low selectivity of any oh formed however at higher organic concentrations a condition more representative of wastewaters the ozone utilization efficiency is nearly constant with ph since most of the ozone is consumed due to its interaction with the organics rather than self decay overall these results show that the impact of ph on the rate and extent of oxidation should be taken into consideration especially for wastewaters containing low organic concentrations when designing the premixing stage either as an integrated unit in catalytic ozonation or in a multi stage ozonation reactor in order to maximize ozone utilization during this treatment step since the ozone utilization efficiency increases with increase in organic concentration at all phs concentrating the organics in wastewaters prior to ozonation will significantly enhance the process efficiency as discussed earlier hcooh hcoo oxidation may occur via direct o3 interaction and or via reaction with oh note that hcooh hcoo oxidation by oh also includes the contribution from co3 which is formed on oh scavenging by bicarbonate carbonate ions we have used the kinetic model developed here to predict the contribution of o3 and oh over a range of organic concentrations and ph this will be useful in predicting the influence of the matrix on the performance of the ozonation process for example if the oxidation is driven by o3 only the influence of inorganic and organic entities capable of scavenging oh and resulting in formation of non reactive product will not be important in contrast entities impacting the stability of o3 such as carbonate as discussed earlier will be important for o3 driven oxidation of organic compounds as shown in fig 7b the extent of oxidation of formate occurring via a non radical pathway varies considerably as a function of ph and organic concentration as shown while increase in the formate concentration increases the contribution of the non radical pathway in formate oxidation the impact of ph on the contribution of the o3 mediated oxidation pathway is not straightforward at low ph i e 3 0 most of the oxidation occurs via a non radical pathway while at high ph i e 10 0 oxidation of formate occurs via interaction with oh and co3 but in the intermediate ph range the trend is variable the contribution of o3 oh and co3 to formate oxidation in the ph range 4 0 10 0 varies as result of the complex influence of carbonate concentration which varies with ph on o3 self decay and oh and co3 generation as well as due to variation in the rate constant for o3 formate reaction with variation in ph overall this result highlights that the mechanism of formate and possibly other organics oxidation by ozone varies markedly with ph and organic concentration 3 7 conclusions in the present study hcooh hcoo was used as a probe compound in order to gain mechanistic insight into the catalytic ozonation process using a commercially available carbon based catalyst we simultaneously analysed the adsorptive and oxidative removal of hcooh hcoo with results indicating that adsorption is not an important precursor step for the subsequent oxidation of this simple target compound experimentation and modelling results show that catalytic oxidation proceeds via both homogeneous oxidation in the bulk solution and heterogeneous oxidation at the solid liquid interface the solution ph also influences the catalytic ozonation performance as a result of changes in catalyst surface properties and surface iron oxide speciation that determines the extent of generation of surface oxidants the influence of jbx on ozonation performance determined in the present study is in contrast to the results obtained in various previous studies employing iron oxide and manganese oxide based catalysts andreozzi et al 1996 byun et al 2011 hsu and masten 1997 karnik et al 2005 2007 lim et al 2002 ma et al 2005 masten et al 1996b mitchell et al 2007 park et al 2012 the discrepancy in the role of iron oxides as catalyst in the present study and various earlier work is possibly related to i difference in the nature of the organics used most of the previous studies use complex organic target species karnik et al 2007 lim et al 2002 ma et al 2005 park et al 2012 which results in formation of a suite of intermediate products however only removal of the parent compound is typically measured in these studies the nature and influence of intermediate by products on ozone decay and oh formation is not investigated in these earlier studies karnik et al 2007 lim et al 2002 ma et al 2005 park et al 2012 furthermore the overall removal of parent compound is measured with no differentiation made regarding the removal of parent compound by adsorption and oxidation in most of these earlier studies karnik et al 2007 lim et al 2002 ma et al 2005 park et al 2012 in comparison here we use simple target compounds which do not form any intermediate products in both cases with direct oxidation to co2 with quantification of the proportions of the target compounds removed separately by adsorption and oxidation in the presence of ozone it is also possible that the difference in the adsorptive behaviour of formate and oxalate compared to the organics used in various earlier studies beltrán et al 2005 zhang and croué 2014 zhang et al 2008 contribute to the discrepancy in the results obtained regarding the influence of the catalyst ii difference in the nature of iron oxide it is possible that the nature and reactivity of the iron oxide used here differs to that of the iron oxides employed in various earlier studies lim et al 2002 mitchell et al 2007 park et al 2012 since the procedure used for jbx preparation is not available we are not able to determine the major factors influencing the difference in the nature of iron oxide though we would like to highlight that our preliminary work employing ferrihydrite and an fe silicate composite show similar results to those measured in the presence of jbx in the present study iii difference in ph and various other solution conditions in some of the earlier studies afzal et al 2019 ma et al 2005 orge et al 2011 wang et al 2019a yang and wu 2019 in which the ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes were compared ph was not well controlled and not the same for the ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes under investigation comparison of the performance of the ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes at different ph is likely to produce false results since the ozonation performance is strongly dependent on ph as depicted clearly in this work and various earlier studies beltrán 2003 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 furthermore either no buffer or phosphate buffer was used in some earlier studies karnik et al 2005 yuan et al 2018 rather than the carbonate buffer used in this study the presence of a high phosphate concentration in the buffer solution enhances ozone decay ferre aracil et al 2015 thereby decreasing the efficiency of the ozone only process in contrast as mentioned here the presence of carbonate ions stabilizes ozone mizuno et al 2007 thereby increasing the efficiency of the ozone only process hence in this study the catalyst did not enhance oh generation beyond what was observed in the absence of catalyst which is already very rapid in bicarbonate buffered solution our results showed that effective formate oxidation occurs by ozonation alone with this result suggesting that conventional ozonation technologies may be effective for organic abatement in alkaline wastewaters conventional ozonation technologies are often limited by the mass transfer of gaseous ozone into the liquid phase and as such optimization of reactor design including the ozone injection system and reactor geometry should be the focus of future studies the kinetic model for formate oxidation developed here could be coupled with fluid dynamics models to predict the spatial concentration of organic compounds and oxidants which would assist in optimizing reactor design it is also worth noting that iron oxide impregnated activated carbon significantly enhanced formate oxidation at ph 3 0 suggesting that catalytic ozonation could be a potential solution for treatment of acidic wastewaters for treatment of acidic wastewaters fenton processes are often used however catalytic ozonation using iron oxide coated or impregnated activated carbon might be a cleaner option since no sludge would be produced however the cost of treatment for the two technologies needs to be compared under various scenarios prior to application of catalytic ozonation for treatment of acidic wastewaters furthermore even though leaching of fe from the catalyst was shown to be minimal at time scales investigated here it may become important during long term operation dissolved iron leached from the catalyst may contribute to homogeneous catalytic ozonation but this also inevitably will result in a decrease in the lifetime and effectiveness of the catalyst thus testing the long term performance of the catalyst under acidic conditions is necessary prior to its application for treatment of acidic wastewaters we would like to highlight that even though the current study presents results for a commercial carbon based catalyst which is not effective under ph conditions similar to most wastewaters the results of the present study provide important insights with regard to the influence of ph on formate oxidation by the conventional ozonation process furthermore the present study provides an approach to test the effectiveness of other catalysts commercial and or laboratory synthesized as shown here systematic measurement of ozone decay removal of the parent compound as well as formation of the oxidized product s under well controlled conditions are required for clearly elucidating the mechanism of catalytic ozonation ph has a significant influence on both the mechanism and rate of conventional ozonation and hence ph needs to be properly controlled when comparing the effectiveness of any catalytic ozonation process with ozonation only for example comparing the performance of a catalytic ozonation process at ph 8 5 with an ozone only process operating at ph 7 3 for formate removal see fig 3 would produce erroneous conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the catalyst overall the present study provides important insight into the formate removal mechanism during conventional and catalytic ozonation using iron oxide impregnated carbon catalysts under varying ph conditions we are of the view that there would be merit in investigating the mode of action of other catalysts with respect to their ability to enhance the ozone mediated oxidation of organic contaminants utilizing the methodology developed here additionally the influence of various matrix constituents such as dissolved organic matter and anions on the efficacy of conventional and catalytic ozonation processes for a range of target organics will be

previous studies also showed that orthophosphate can mitigate lead release even without forming pb p containing solids wasserstrom et al 2017 found that pipes receiving water treated with a blended phosphate a mixture of orthophosphate and polyphosphate had non lead containing phosphate solids forming on layers of scale this layer of phosphate rich solids can limit lead release by acting as a barrier to transport of lead from lead rich underlying layers of the scale tully et al 2019 found that not all lead pipe systems in midwestern areas i e illinois michigan and wisconsin that had received phosphate i e blended and orthophosphate had detectable amounts of lead phosphate solids on the surfaces of their lsls when analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd x ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy sem with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds orthophosphate addition is a recognized and recommended corrosion control approach for ph below 7 8 mcneill and edwards 2002 u s epa 2016 but it has not been widely considered for water systems with higher ph noel et al 2014 found that orthophosphate addition 4 mg l as p decreased the rate of lead release from hydrocerussite by two orders of magnitude in waters with ph of 8 5 and 10 0 a pilot scale study in providence with water at ph 10 3 did observe benefits of orthophosphate addition welter et al 2015 despite existing evidence of its advantages through multiple routes there were several knowledge gaps regarding orthophosphate addition and its effects on lead pipe systems with high ph characterization of the solids on lead pipe surfaces was needed to yield insights into the underlying mechanisms controlling lead release the objectives of this study were to determine the impact of orthophosphate addition on lead release from lsls that deliver low alkalinity high ph water and to elucidate the mechanism of limitation of lead release we pursued these objectives using harvested lead pipes from providence ri in experiments in which we were able to track changes in both total and dissolved lead concentrations and the characteristics of the pipe scales following orthophosphate addition 2 materials and methods 2 1 harvested pipe selection and pilot scale loop reactor set up a set of lead pipe systems was established with harvested lead pipes acquired from providence ri section s1 each lead pipe assembly was comprised of a single 60 cm long 24 inch section of lead pipe containing four removable 7 5 cm 3 inch lead pipe segments section s2 these short segments were included in the pipe assemblies to enable rapid removal for pipe scale analysis at different stages in the experiment without having to cut any pipe in situ before conditioning the pipes in a recirculating flow mode the ten pipe assemblies were first conditioned in a static fill and dump approach for approximately five months using water with a composition similar to that in the current providence distribution system table 1 the water collected from the pipe assemblies was measured for ph chlorine concentrations and total lead concentrations after the fill and dump stage of conditioning the six assemblies with the lowest and most stable lead concentrations were selected for conditioning in a test system with periods of recirculating flow such pipe loop systems were fig 1 constructed and operated similarly to those used at different water chemistry conditions and discussed in our previous work bae et al 2020 2 2 conditioning of providence pipes the pipe loops were operated in a recirculating flow mode with daily periods of flow 16 h and stagnation 8 h using water prepared to match the composition in the current providence distribution system table 1 the finished water in providence has a high ph ph 10 3 with a low alkalinity 15 0 mg l as caco3 information about the chemicals used for fabricating the artificial water and for other purposes is provided in section s3 water for each pipe loop was prepared 10 5 l and exchanged weekly samples for analysis of dissolved or total lead were collected from 1 the freshly prepared water 0 h samples 2 the water that had resided in the pipes during the first 8 h stagnation period 8 h samples and 3 the water from the entire system at the end of each week 168 h samples the ph and chlorine concentrations were measured daily and the chlorine concentration was adjusted back to its target value 1 mg l cl2 on each weekday of operation specific procedures of monitoring chlorine concentration and ph are shown in section s4 the pipe loops were conditioned without orthophosphate until week 45 when the dissolved lead concentrations for all pipe assemblies became consistently below 100 μg l pb and demonstrated little variation the total lead concentrations of the 0 h samples from the six pipe loops were almost always below 5 μg l 2 3 response of pipe reactors to orthophosphate addition in week 46 orthophosphate was added to three i e p1 p2 and p3 of the six pipe loops we chose these loops since they had relatively high lead levels compared with the others and these pipe loops would therefore be the ones most likely to exhibit an observable impact from orthophosphate addition there is pipe to pipe variation of total lead concentrations during the conditioning period for the six pipe loops because each lead pipe assembly is not an exact replicate of the others these were harvested lsls that had been in use for more than 90 years and variations in each individual pipe s history can result in inherent variability the selected concentration of 3 0 mg l as po4 orthophosphate is near the high end of the range typically used in normal operations but it is a concentration often used during the initial stage of orthophosphate addition there was appreciable loss of orthophosphate from the water each day consequently we measured and readjusted the orthophosphate concentration 3 4 times each week 2 4 batch experiments to support our pipe loop experiments we performed simple batch experiments investigating how ca p solid precipitation was promoted in the providence pipe loop systems in these experiments lead containing solids of either hydrocerussite or plattnerite β pbo2 s were mixed with the providence water containing orthophosphate we then monitored dissolved ca and p concentrations over time specifically in 200 ml glass bottles 0 1 g of each hydrocerussite and plattnerite powder was filled with 200 ml of synthetic providence tap water orthophosphate 3 mg l as po4 and free chlorine 1 mg l as cl2 in control experiments in these same glass bottles with orthophosphate and synthetic providence water but no added lead containing solids we observed almost no loss of calcium or phosphate from solution each conditioned batch was prepared in duplicate for the reaction the batches were stirred and samples were taken after certain times had elapsed the samples were filtered and dissolved ca and p were measured 2 5 analysis of water samples concentrations of lead and other elements were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms elan drc ii perkinelmer free chlorine and orthophosphate concentrations were measured by the dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method 4500 cl g standard method apha 1999 and the modified molybdate colorimetric method method 365 3 epa u s epa 1978 respectively the solution ph was measured with a ph meter ab150 fisher scientific and electrode accumet fisher scientific specific procedures for collecting 8 h and 168 h samples sample preparation for dissolved and total lead and other elemental concentrations and further information about other water samples analyses ph dic and quality control procedures for icp ms measurements are provided in section s4 2 6 analysis of pipe scales materials preparation and solid characterization scale analysis involved the collection of both cross section disks and half cylinders cut from pipe samples the specific procedures are described in section s5 the cross sectional disks provided information regarding the thickness and variation in scale composition between different layers as observed using field emission sem jeol 7001lvf jeol with sem eds we gathered semi quantitative information on the elemental composition of the scale as a function of distance from the inner pipe wall the half cylinders had their exposed inner surfaces probed by raman spectroscopy at specific points with a fiber optically coupled raman microprobe hololab series 5000 raman microprobe kaiser optical systems inc raman spectroscopy was particularly valuable for identifying non crystalline phases because it is sensitive to the local chemical environment of carbonate phosphate hydroxide and other molecular species in both amorphous and crystalline solid phases for additional crystalline compound identification and quantitative elemental analysis the scale was scraped from the surface with a spatula to get scale powders for xrd d8 advance bruker analysis and for complete digestion in aqua regia whose specific procedure is illustrated in section s6 the specific procedure of each characterization method is described in bae et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 free chlorine monitoring results during the 46 week conditioning period the residual free chlorine concentrations after one day of contact were often below or close to detection limits 0 05 mg l cl2 fig 2 a indicating extensive daily free chlorine consumption by the pipe loops for a few days in the period after orthophosphate addition we mistakenly added free chlorine to doses that exceeded the target of 1 mg l cl2 which resulted in concentrations above that target for samples collected at periods shorter than 24 h more than 90 of the free chlorine was lost within 6 h of recirculation the pipe loop experiments as well as simple batch tests showed that free chlorine rapidly decreased when materials from lead pipe systems were reacted with the high ph low alkalinity water after orthophosphate addition began in week 46 chlorine consumption of the pipe loops dropped by approximately 0 3 mg l day 3 2 ph monitoring results without orthophosphate addition the ph decreased from an initial value of 10 2 10 5 to about 9 0 9 9 over one week of conditioning fig 2b the extensive free chlorine consumption and the direction of the ph decrease could have several causes one explanation could be co2 uptake from the atmosphere efforts were made to keep the water in the recirculating pipe loop closed with respect to the atmosphere however the waters were at high ph and low dic conditions which created a strong driving force for uptake of atmospheric co2 if the loops were not completely sealed off from the atmosphere such co2 uptake would result in a ph decrease another possibility for the chlorine consumption and ph decrease would be pbo2 s formation from hydrocerussite specifically during the oxidation process of hydrocerussite free chlorine is consumed and hydrogen ions are produced reaction 3 1 3 1 pb3 co3 2 oh 2 s 3ocl h2o 3pbo2 s 2hco3 3cl 2h reaction 3 1 is written with each component indicated as the dominant species present at the ph conditions of the experiment to illustrate the impact on ph after orthophosphate addition was initiated for half of the pipe loops the loops receiving orthophosphate experienced further drops in ph this ph drop was not associated with the timing of changes of the water reservoir as carboys with freshly prepared water were introduced in fact when orthophosphate was added to the artificial providence water the ph dropped by only 0 1 0 2 ph units it appears that the measured ph change in the pipe water is the result of a process occurring within the lead pipes after week 70 the ph values of loops p1 p3 were readjusted back to ph 10 3 at the middle of the weekly recirculation i e 3 4 days after exchanging the carboys 3 3 orthophosphate concentrations the providence pipe loops consumed appreciable amounts of orthophosphate fig 2c daily phosphorus consumption was 0 4 1 0 mg l and the extent of consumption varied among the pipe loops and with time in 8 h samples total and dissolved p concentrations decreased as the experiment progressed fig s2 this increase in p consumption was probably caused by the gradual transformation of scale on the surface of the lead pipe in which reaction with the aqueous orthophosphate yielded phosphate bearing solids such reactions depleted orthophosphate in the solution based on dosages during weekly recirculation and concentrations in 168 h samples the amounts of orthophosphate added to the scale were calculated to be approximately 36 8 47 2 mg of p per week as will be discussed further below the orthophosphate consumption is also related to consumption of calcium likely through the formation of calcium bearing phosphate solids through the entire period of orthophosphate addition the gap between total and dissolved p was small indicating that most of the overall p lost from solution was accounted for by deposits on the pipe surface rather than in suspended particles in 8 h samples the gap between total and dissolved p was higher than in 168 h samples this may be because a certain length of time is required for p containing particles to stably attach on the lead pipe surface 3 4 lead concentrations before adding orthophosphate during the entire conditioning period before addition of orthophosphate the total lead concentrations in the pipe assemblies were high and noisy the lead concentrations had an average of 133 2 μg l and a standard deviation of 142 9 μg l fig 3 a these lead concentrations are provided for five of the original six pipe assemblies tested a sixth pipe assembly c3 had behavior much different than the other five and so we have not included it in our further examination of the lead results pipe assembly c3 had consistently lower lead concentrations than the other loops which we subsequently determined to be associated with its higher antimony content as is discussed in more detail in section 3 8 experiments were moved to the stage of orthophosphate addition on the basis of stable dissolved lead concentrations despite the higher variation in total lead concentrations that persisted we performed the conditioning until the dissolved lead concentration became consistently lower than 100 μg l the predicted dissolved lead concentration in equilibrium with hydrocerussite was calculated to be 40 70 μg l for the range of ph values observed experimentally as will be discussed in the later section on scale analysis hydrocerussite was indeed a dominant phase in the scales after more than 25 weeks of conditioning the dissolved pb concentrations became slightly lower than the predicted solubility of hydrocerussite and as noted later this may have been due to the formation of some low solubility pbo2 s solids from the sustained addition of free chlorine 3 5 lead concentrations after adding orthophosphate orthophosphate addition had an almost immediate impact on dissolved lead concentrations the large gap between total and dissolved lead concentrations during the first 15 weeks of orthophosphate addition indicates that particulate lead was still abundant in the water samples even after orthophosphate addition fig 2c the large pb concentration gap was also observed in welter et al 2015 the gap between dissolved and total lead and the random nature of the spikes in total lead concentrations suggest that lead containing particles were being released from the lead pipe surface over most of the conditioning period until week 50 the dissolved lead concentrations in 168 h samples were in general agreement with the solubility of hydroxylpyromorphite at the ph that was encountered at the end each week from weeks 52 75 in loops p1 p2 and p3 the ph values after 168 h were 7 94 9 96 at these ph values and with the dic of the water the lead solubility in equilibrium with hydroxylpyromorphite would be 2 0 17 5 μg l fig s1 dissolved lead concentrations ranged from non detectable to 5 9 μg l had the ph been more constant at ph 10 3 as might occur with more careful readjustment of the ph or an influx of new water then the dissolved lead concentration in equilibrium with hydroxylpyromorphite would have been higher the calculated solubility of hydroxylpyromorphite is 70 μg l at ph 10 3 for water with these concentrations of orthophosphate and dic after week 54 the dissolved lead concentrations dropped far below 15 μg l in all pipe reactors i e both with and without orthophosphate addition suggesting that a solid other than hydrocerussite or hydroxylpyromorphite was controlling the dissolved lead levels based on the dissolved lead concentration results and scale characterization discussed later the low lead concentrations were probably caused by the formation of the low solubility solid pbo2 s we note that between weeks 54 and 75 the dissolved pb levels from the loops receiving orthophosphate were still lower 1 0 1 3 μg l than those in the loops without orthophosphate 4 0 3 8 μg l there are two possible reasons for why orthophosphate retarded the release of dissolved pb from the scale the first is that orthophosphate helps sustain the free chlorine and the higher residual free chlorine concentrations enable greater development of pbo2 s in the scale the other is that orthophosphate adsorption onto pbo2 s in the scale might retard its dissolution while dissolved lead concentrations decreased almost immediately after orthophosphate addition total lead concentrations took more time to decrease total lead levels of the three loops with orthophosphate dropped consistently below 100 μg l after 12 weeks of orthophosphate addition fig 3a c for the next four weeks the average total lead level of pipe loops with orthophosphate was 34 0 24 1 μg l pb while that of pipe loops without orthophosphate was still high and highly variable at 149 6 148 2 μg l pb from 17 weeks after orthophosphate addition until the end of the experiment 30 weeks after orthophosphate addition the total lead levels of all three pipe loops with orthophosphate were almost always less than 15 μg l average 8 0 μg l median 7 2 μg l standard deviation 4 6 μg l these results demonstrate that long term continuous orthophosphate addition can effectively control total lead release in high ph water moreover our overall results show that pb levels remained low even when the ph decreased below 9 7 fig 2b high particulate lead concentrations persisted over the entire experiment duration for loops not receiving orthophosphate particulate lead release can be associated with the detachment of other metal oxides e g iron oxides within the scale masters and edwards 2015 the loops having high particulate lead levels also had higher fe levels than other loops which would be consistent with detachment of iron rich particles of scale table s1 additionally 8 h samples were collected and their total and dissolved concentrations are provided in section s7 3 6 potential precipitation of phosphate with calcium calcium is one of the major dissolved species in providence water and the potential formation of calcium phosphate solids was evaluated after adding orthophosphate in week 46 the calcium concentration decreased in the loops receiving orthophosphate fig 4 the greater decrease in calcium that occurred when the water was kept in the pipe loops than in the carboys indicates that most of the decrease in dissolved calcium was associated with the accumulation of calcium containing solids on the lead pipe surfaces in 8 h samples for weeks 47 78 the average dissolved and total calcium concentrations were 10 7 1 0 mg l and 11 1 1 4 mg l respectively fig s4 these results indicated a total calcium concentration decrease of about 4 mg l in the water stagnating in the pipes in the first 8 h of each week similarity between the total and dissolved ca concentrations in the 168 h and 8 h samples indicates that ca p containing solids deposited on the inner surfaces of the lead pipes and did not remain in the water as suspended particles to assess what ca p containing solids might have formed the final dissolved calcium and orthophosphate concentrations were examined along with the measured ph to calculate the saturation of the solution with respect to two possible solids hydroxylapatite ca5 po4 3oh s and octacalcium phosphate ca po4 0 74oh0 22 s the calculations were done using samples collected during week 57 section s8 the results indicate that the solution was supersaturated with respect to both hydroxylapatite and octacalcium phosphate by looking at the amounts of calcium and phosphorus lost from solution the molar ratio of calcium to phosphorus in the solids that formed can be estimated for the 8 h samples the calculated ca p molar ratio of the solids is 3 0 and for the 168 h samples the ratio is 1 0 section s9 which is not too different from that of octacalcium phosphate 1 35 1 or hydroxylapatite 1 66 1 the ratio of calcium to phosphorus lost from solution would be lower if any of the phosphorus was also lost from solution through precipitation with lead which is quite likely 3 7 hydrocerussite influence on dissolved calcium consumption because the fact that less than 10 of dissolved ca was lost 1 0 mg l when orthophosphate was added to artificial providence water in a carboy but not yet circulated through the lead pipes strongly suggests that the interactions of the phosphate containing water with the scales on the lead pipes are responsible for most of the orthophosphate loss from the water we hypothesize that hydrocerussite on the lead pipe surface promotes the initial nucleation of calcium phosphate solids that then precipitate further and consume dissolved calcium and orthophosphate we performed a simple batch experiment to test this hypothesis the results show fig 5 a that the dissolved ca concentration dropped much more in the batch experiment having hydrocerussite than in ones with either no solid or with pbo2 s this confirms that hydrocerussite does have the ability to promote precipitation of a solid that contains calcium and orthophosphate 3 8 antimony in a lead service line and impacts on lead release as mentioned in section 2 1 we found that one pipe loop c3 in fig s6 had lead concentrations that were consistently much lower than in the other loops specifically loop c3 was the only one that stabilized early in the conditioning process it became stable below 100 μg l after week 10 in the investigation of causes of this different behavior the analysis of elements in our samples was expanded we determined that antimony sb was constantly being released from loop c3 the 8 h or 168 h samples from c3 contained 5 10 μg l of sb figs s7 and s8 due to greater strength hardness and durability sb has been widely used as an alloying element with lead for products that include pipes storage battery grids and sheets thornton et al 2001 total materia 2001 released sb was mostly in the dissolved phase we speculate that the presence of sb in the lead pipes may have provided a long term control of lead release the dominant form of sb expected in water is antimonate sbo4 3 which has some chemical similarities to orthophosphate 3 9 solid characterization before adding orthophosphate scales of as harvested lead pipes were 30 80 μm thick results not shown their compositions as determined by eds were predominantly c o and pb indicating that compounds in the scale would be lead carbonates or lead ii iv oxides xrd patterns and raman spectra indicate that one of the main compounds in the scale is hydrocerussite the study of wang et al 2012 also observed that hydrocerussite was one of the dominant solids in the scales of providence pipes by conditioning the pipe loops substantial amounts of pbo2 s were formed pbo2 s was relatively abundant in the outer crust of the scale whereas hydrocerussite was abundant in the scale closer to the unaltered lead pipe at week 45 a 50 μm thick coarse outer scale with pb and o was observed fig 6 peaks belonging to pbo2 s were dominant in xrd patterns of the outer layer of the scale fig 7 a red line while peaks for hydrocerussite were detected as well as those for pbo2 s in the middle and bottom layer the formation of pbo2 on the scale is consistent with observed trends in free chlorine concentrations the free chlorine might have been consumed by the oxidation of pb ii to pb iv in pbo2 s in the pipe loops the daily free chlorine consumption rate was extremely high fig 2 no pbo2 s was observed in the scale from the actual as harvested lsls from providence although the water in providence leaves the treatment plant with about 1 0 mg l cl2 free chlorine the recirculation with daily replenishment of free chlorine may explain why pbo2 s became the dominant phase in the scale of the laboratory pipe loops while it was not observed in the harvested providence pipes where free chlorine residual will not always be maintained especially during periods of stagnation within in use pipes this observation further suggests that the low dissolved pb concentrations observed for all of the pipe loops with and without orthophosphate might have been promoted by the newly formed pbo2 s although the pipes without orthophosphate had low dissolved lead concentrations resulting from pbo2 formation they still had higher total lead concentrations than orthophosphate treated pipes because the pbo2 did not help prevent detachment of lead containing particles in the way that orthophosphate addition was able to 3 10 solid characterization after adding orthophosphate after adding orthophosphate solids that contained both ca and p formed on and within the scale the elemental mapping images of the cross section of a pipe segment collected at after 7 weeks of orthophosphate addition show ca and p co located in the layer near the unaltered lead fig 6 through optical images fig 8 a white precipitate was observed on the scale surface of 7 weeks after orthophosphate addition while the scale was dark red mainly plattnerite before orthophosphate addition fig 7a red line the xrd patterns did not show clear evidence that these white precipitates were calcium phosphate however for the inner scale fig 7b black line peaks that match those of phosphohedyphane ca2pb3 po4 3 cl f oh s were detected suggesting that the 10 μm thick ca pb p containing scale next to the unaltered lead might be poorly crystalline phosphohedyphane the continuous orthophosphate addition for 30 weeks made the outer ca p containing scale more extensive the optical images show that the outer scale became whiter through the long term recirculation fig 8 the outer white scale was easily detached during the cutting of the pipe segments indicating that it is coarse and not strongly adhered to the underlying scale on pipe sem mapping images show that the coarse outer scale is mainly composed of ca and p while having little pb suggesting that the solid in the scale might be more similar to an apatite or octacalcium phosphate than to a lead containing phosphate solid such as pyromorphite or phosphohedyphane at 29 weeks after orthophosphate addition i e week 75 elemental compositions by semi quantitative analyses from the outer scale obtained by eds section s10 fig s9 showed that the atomic ratio among ca p and f is 5 3 to 1 suggesting that the outer scale possibly contains fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f s this semi quantitative information was used to provide relative abundances of elements and overall compositions and was not used to gain precise quantitative information xrd patterns suggest that the outer scale possibly contains either fluorapatite or hydroxyapatite fig 7 magnified figure is presented in fig s10 the relative intensities of fluorapatite or hydroxyapatite patterns were low suggesting that the ca p containing scales might have low phase concentrations raman spectra show that the outer scale is mainly fluorapatite and hydroxyapatite fig 9 acid digestion results showed that the molar quantity of the calcium is higher than that of lead on the outer scale table 2 indicating the white matter contains more calcium than lead the formation of the ca p pb compounds in the inner scale was probably promoted by the hydrocerussite in the scale xrd patterns indicate that hydrocerussite is more abundant closer to the unaltered lead because hydrocerussite tends to promote ca p solid formation fig 5 the ca pb p containing scale was formed near the unaltered lead where the hydrocerussite is abundant on the other hand it is hard to conclude that the formation of the ca p compounds in the outer scale was promoted by hydrocerussite even though the average total ca consumption amount in 3 pipe loops was 129 3 16 3 mg for 6 weeks after orthophosphate addition i e week 52 fig 4 the ca p containing solid was not detected at week 52 fig 6 furthermore little hydrocerussite was detected in the outer scale fig 7 3 11 pbo2 s formation by continuous free chlorine supply long term conditioning of pipes with hydrocerussite and a continuous supply of free chlorine can transform the hydrocerussite into pbo2 for the scales from the pipes that had not received orthophosphate the xrd patterns fig 7d show the presence of pbo2 and almost the complete disappearance of hydrocerussite notably the harvested pipes from providence ri only had hydrocerussite with no detectable pbo2 s in the xrd patterns this is probably because of low residual free chlorine 0 5 mg l cl2 pw 2015 in the actual lsls and low reactivity of ocl the free chlorine species dominant at ph 10 the pbo2 s formation on outer scale fig 7 probably controlled the overall dissolved lead at the low levels observed fig 3b d while it was not a primary objective of this study the experimental results indicate that the promotion of conditions in a distribution system and lsls that can maintain a stable free chlorine residual may be effective for controlling lead concentrations similar conclusions were reached in a previous study of lead concentrations from lsls in several cities triantafyllidou et al 2015 3 12 the role of the calcium phosphorus containing solids on outer scale total pb concentrations dropped below 15 μg l after 15 weeks of orthophosphate addition the coarse ca p containing solids that were observed on the outer scale might have played a role in limiting total pb levels their formation could have acted as a physical barrier to pb release from the inner scale this observation indicates that orthophosphate addition could decrease pb release to water even without forming pb p solids although for a different overall water composition a recent study found that several midwestern utilities that use orthophosphate for lead corrosion control did not have any lead phosphate solids observed in the pipe scales tully et al 2019 the outer ca p containing scale that formed on the pipe surfaces may have limited lead release by acting as a physical barrier it could have been a barrier to both the release of dissolved lead from the underlying pb rich inner scale and the detachment of pb containing particles that also included other metals sem results fig 10 show that the outer ca p solids cover the outer scale that contains fe and mn oxides which could be a potential source for particulate lead release fe oxide in the scale can potentially promote detachment of pb containing particles masters and edwards 2015 trueman and gagnon 2016 consequently increasing total lead concentrations of 168 h samples the evidence from the mapping images is consistent with our observations of particulate fe and pb releases to the water from the pipes table s1 4 conclusions this study investigated the impacts of orthophosphate addition on lead release from lead pipes to water at a much higher ph than that for which orthophosphate has typically been used for corrosion control continuous orthophosphate addition for 15 weeks lowered total pb levels below 15 μg l the limitation on pb level was related to the formation of solids in the pipe scale that contained calcium and phosphorus the ca p containing solids were found both as a pb containing inner scale phosphohedyphane or a similar phase and as a coarse outer scale without lead possibly as fluorapatite it appears that hydrocerussite promotes the formation of the calcium phosphate solids in high ph low alkalinity water pbo2 s formed due to the daily resupply of free chlorine and the nature of the laboratory scale experiment orthophosphate addition was able to limit the release of both dissolved lead and lead containing particles while pbo2 s containing scale only limited dissolved lead concentrations the formation of ca p solids appears to have stabilized an iron rich layer of the scale whose attachment could contribute to release of particulate lead control of particulate lead release by orthophosphate addition is valuable because such release can occur sporadically and is difficult to anticipate deshommes et al 2010 triantafyllidou et al 2007 for the successful application of orthophosphate to lsls delivering high ph water the effects of orthophosphate at more diverse conditions need to be tested one condition to test would be temperature in order to assess seasonal variation it is useful to test the change in solubility of ca p pb containing solids depending on temperature fluctuation in order to assess to what extent ca p pb containing solids will release particulate pb as a function of temperature another important potential future study would be on the effects of stagnation or flushing declaration of

17954,this study explored the ability of orthophosphate addition to limit lead release from lead service lines delivering high ph low alkalinity water we built pipe loop reactors with lead pipes harvested from providence ri and we operated them with high ph and low alkalinity water of a composition similar to that in providence orthophosphate addition decreased the release of both dissolved and particulate lead to the water the most substantial decreases in total lead concentrations occurred after 15 weeks of orthophosphate addition which was associated with the formation of calcium lead phosphorus ca pb p solids as part of the pipe scale pre existing hydrocerussite pb3 co3 2 oh 2 s in the scale of the lead pipe appeared to promote the formation of a ca pb p solid similar to phosphohedyphane ca2pb3 po4 3 cl f oh s continuous orthophosphate addition was also associated with the formation of a calcium phosphate solid with features like those of fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f s on the outermost layer of the scale through promoting the formation of these new solids within and on top of the scales orthophosphate addition limited release of dissolved and particulate lead these results demonstrate the ability of orthophosphate to control lead release at higher ph conditions than those for which it has typically been used in addition to the formation of phosphate solids pbo2 s which was not present on the as received pipes was formed due to the constant supply of free chlorine in the laboratory scale experiment graphical abstract image 1 keywords lead corrosion control

previous studies also showed that orthophosphate can mitigate lead release even without forming pb p containing solids wasserstrom et al 2017 found that pipes receiving water treated with a blended phosphate a mixture of orthophosphate and polyphosphate had non lead containing phosphate solids forming on layers of scale this layer of phosphate rich solids can limit lead release by acting as a barrier to transport of lead from lead rich underlying layers of the scale tully et al 2019 found that not all lead pipe systems in midwestern areas i e illinois michigan and wisconsin that had

2002 u s epa 2016 but it has not been widely considered for water systems with higher ph noel et al 2014 found that orthophosphate addition 4 mg l as p decreased the rate of lead release from hydrocerussite by two orders of magnitude in waters with ph of 8 5 and 10 0 a pilot scale study in providence with water at ph 10 3 did observe benefits of orthophosphate addition welter et al 2015 despite existing evidence of its advantages through multiple routes there were several knowledge gaps regarding orthophosphate addition and its effects on lead pipe systems with high ph characterization of the solids on lead pipe surfaces was needed to yield insights into the underlying mechanisms controlling lead release the objectives of this study were to determine the impact of orthophosphate addition on lead release from lsls that deliver low alkalinity high ph water and to elucidate the mechanism of limitation of lead release we pursued these objectives using harvested lead pipes from providence ri in experiments in which we were able to track changes in both total and dissolved lead concentrations and the characteristics of the pipe scales following orthophosphate addition 2 materials and methods 2 1 harvested pipe selection and pilot scale loop reactor set up a set of lead pipe systems was established with harvested lead pipes acquired from providence ri section s1 each lead pipe assembly was comprised of a single 60 cm long 24 inch section of lead pipe containing four removable 7 5 cm 3 inch lead pipe segments section s2 these short segments were included in the pipe assemblies to enable rapid removal for pipe scale analysis at different stages in the experiment without having to cut any pipe in situ before conditioning the pipes in a recirculating flow mode the ten pipe assemblies were first conditioned in a static fill and dump approach for approximately five months using water with a composition similar to that in the current providence distribution system table 1 the water collected from the pipe assemblies was measured for ph chlorine concentrations and total lead concentrations after the fill and dump stage of conditioning the six assemblies with the lowest and most stable lead concentrations were selected for conditioning in a test system with periods of recirculating flow such pipe loop systems were fig 1 constructed and operated similarly to those used at different water chemistry conditions and discussed in our previous work bae et al 2020 2 2 conditioning of providence pipes the pipe loops were operated in a recirculating flow mode with daily periods of flow 16 h and stagnation 8 h using water prepared to match the composition in the current providence distribution system table 1 the finished water in providence has a high ph ph 10 3 with a low alkalinity 15 0 mg l as caco3 information about the chemicals used for fabricating the artificial water and for other purposes is provided in section s3 water for each pipe loop was prepared 10 5 l and exchanged weekly samples for analysis of dissolved or total lead were collected from 1 the freshly prepared water 0 h samples 2 the water that had resided in the pipes during the first 8 h stagnation period 8 h samples and 3 the water from the entire system at the end of each week 168 h samples the ph and chlorine concentrations were measured daily and the chlorine concentration was adjusted back to its target value 1 mg l cl2 on each weekday of operation specific procedures of monitoring chlorine concentration and ph are shown in section s4 the pipe loops were conditioned without orthophosphate until week 45 when the dissolved lead concentrations for all pipe assemblies became consistently below 100 μg l pb and demonstrated little variation the total lead concentrations of the 0 h samples from the six pipe loops were almost always below 5 μg l 2 3 response of pipe reactors to orthophosphate addition in week 46 orthophosphate was added to three i e p1 p2 and p3 of the six pipe loops we chose these loops since they had relatively high lead levels compared with the others and these pipe loops would therefore be the ones most likely to exhibit an observable impact from orthophosphate addition there is pipe to pipe variation of total lead concentrations during the conditioning period for the six pipe loops because each lead pipe assembly is not an exact replicate of the others these were harvested lsls that had been in use for more than 90 years and variations in each individual pipe s history can result in inherent variability the selected concentration of 3 0 mg l as po4 orthophosphate is near the high end of the range typically used in normal operations but it is a concentration often used during the initial stage of orthophosphate addition there was appreciable loss of orthophosphate from the water each day consequently we measured and readjusted the orthophosphate concentration 3 4 times each week 2 4 batch experiments to support our pipe loop experiments we performed simple batch experiments investigating how ca p solid precipitation was promoted in the providence pipe loop systems in these experiments lead containing solids of either hydrocerussite or plattnerite β pbo2 s were mixed with the providence water containing orthophosphate we then monitored dissolved ca and p concentrations over time specifically in 200 ml glass bottles 0 1 g of each hydrocerussite and plattnerite powder was filled with 200 ml of synthetic providence tap water orthophosphate 3 mg l as po4 and free chlorine 1 mg l as cl2 in control experiments in these same glass bottles with orthophosphate and synthetic providence water but no added lead containing solids we observed almost no loss of calcium or phosphate from solution each conditioned batch was prepared in duplicate for the reaction the batches were stirred and samples were taken after certain times had elapsed the samples were filtered and dissolved ca and p were measured 2 5 analysis of water samples concentrations of lead and other elements were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms elan drc ii perkinelmer free chlorine and orthophosphate concentrations were measured by the dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method 4500 cl g standard method apha 1999 and the modified molybdate colorimetric method method 365 3 epa u s epa 1978 respectively the solution ph was measured with a ph meter ab150 fisher scientific and electrode accumet fisher scientific specific procedures for collecting 8 h and 168 h samples sample preparation for dissolved and total lead and other elemental concentrations and further information about other water samples analyses ph dic and quality control procedures for icp ms measurements are provided in section s4 2 6 analysis of pipe scales materials preparation and solid characterization scale analysis involved the collection of both cross section disks and half cylinders cut from pipe samples the specific procedures are described in section s5 the cross sectional disks provided information regarding the thickness and variation in scale composition between different layers as observed using field emission sem jeol 7001lvf jeol with sem eds we gathered semi quantitative information on the elemental composition of the scale as a function of distance from the inner pipe wall the half cylinders had their exposed inner surfaces probed by raman spectroscopy at specific points with a fiber optically coupled raman microprobe hololab series 5000 raman microprobe kaiser optical systems inc raman spectroscopy was particularly valuable for identifying non crystalline phases because it is sensitive to the local chemical environment of carbonate phosphate hydroxide and other molecular species in both amorphous and crystalline solid phases for additional crystalline compound identification and quantitative elemental analysis the scale was scraped from the surface with a spatula to get scale powders for xrd d8 advance bruker analysis and for complete digestion in aqua regia whose specific procedure is illustrated in section s6 the specific procedure of each characterization method is described in bae et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 free chlorine monitoring results during the 46 week conditioning period the residual free chlorine concentrations after one day of contact were often below or close to detection limits 0 05 mg l cl2 fig 2 a indicating extensive daily free chlorine consumption by the pipe loops for a few days in the period after orthophosphate addition we mistakenly added free chlorine to doses that exceeded the target of 1 mg l cl2 which resulted in concentrations above that target for samples collected at periods shorter than 24 h more than 90 of the free chlorine was lost within 6 h of recirculation the pipe loop experiments as well as simple batch tests showed that free chlorine rapidly decreased when materials from lead pipe systems were reacted with the high ph low alkalinity water after orthophosphate addition began in week 46 chlorine consumption of the pipe loops dropped by approximately 0 3 mg l day 3 2 ph monitoring results without orthophosphate addition the ph decreased from an initial value of 10 2 10 5 to about 9 0 9 9 over one week of conditioning fig 2b the extensive free chlorine consumption and the direction of the ph decrease could have several causes one explanation could be co2 uptake from the atmosphere efforts were made to keep the water in the recirculating pipe loop closed with respect to the atmosphere however the waters were at high ph and low dic conditions which created a strong driving force for uptake of atmospheric co2 if the loops were not completely sealed off from the atmosphere such co2 uptake would result in a ph decrease another possibility for the chlorine consumption and ph decrease would be pbo2 s formation from hydrocerussite specifically during the oxidation process of hydrocerussite free chlorine is consumed and hydrogen ions are produced reaction 3 1 3 1 pb3 co3 2 oh 2 s 3ocl h2o 3pbo2 s 2hco3 3cl 2h reaction 3 1 is written with each component indicated as the dominant species present at the ph conditions of the experiment to illustrate the impact on ph after orthophosphate addition was initiated for half of the pipe loops the loops receiving orthophosphate experienced further drops in ph this ph drop was not associated with the timing of changes of the water reservoir as carboys with freshly prepared water were introduced in fact when orthophosphate was added to the artificial providence water the ph dropped by only 0 1 0 2 ph units it appears that the measured ph change in the pipe water is the result of a process occurring within the lead pipes after week 70 the ph values of loops p1 p3 were readjusted back to ph 10 3 at the middle of the weekly recirculation i e 3 4 days after exchanging the carboys 3 3 orthophosphate concentrations the providence pipe loops consumed appreciable amounts of orthophosphate fig 2c daily phosphorus consumption was 0 4 1 0 mg l and the extent of consumption varied among the pipe loops and with time in 8 h samples total and dissolved p concentrations decreased as the experiment progressed fig s2 this increase in p consumption was probably caused by the gradual transformation of scale on the surface of the lead pipe in which reaction with the aqueous orthophosphate yielded phosphate bearing solids such reactions depleted orthophosphate in the solution based on dosages during weekly recirculation and concentrations in 168 h samples the amounts of orthophosphate added to the scale were calculated to be approximately 36 8 47 2 mg of p per week as will be discussed further below the orthophosphate consumption is also related to consumption of calcium likely through the formation of calcium bearing phosphate solids through the entire period of orthophosphate addition the gap between total and dissolved p was small indicating that most of the overall p lost from solution was accounted for by deposits on the pipe surface rather than in suspended particles in 8 h samples the gap between total and dissolved p was higher than in 168 h samples this may be because a certain length of time is required for p containing particles to stably attach on the lead pipe surface 3 4 lead concentrations before adding orthophosphate during the entire conditioning period before addition of orthophosphate the total lead concentrations in the pipe assemblies were high and noisy the lead concentrations had an average of 133 2 μg l and a standard deviation of 142 9 μg l fig 3 a these lead concentrations are provided for five of the original six pipe assemblies tested a sixth pipe assembly c3 had behavior much different than the other five and so we have not included it in our further examination of the lead results pipe assembly c3 had consistently lower lead concentrations than the other loops which we subsequently determined to be associated with its higher antimony content as is discussed in more detail in section 3 8 experiments were moved to the stage of orthophosphate addition on the basis of stable dissolved lead concentrations despite the higher variation in total lead concentrations that persisted we performed the conditioning until the dissolved lead concentration became consistently lower than 100 μg l the predicted dissolved lead concentration in equilibrium with hydrocerussite was calculated to be 40 70 μg l for the range of ph values observed experimentally as will be discussed in the later section on scale analysis hydrocerussite was indeed a dominant phase in the scales after more than 25 weeks of conditioning the dissolved pb concentrations became slightly lower than the predicted solubility of hydrocerussite and as noted later this may have been due to the formation of some low solubility pbo2 s solids from the sustained addition of free chlorine 3 5 lead concentrations after adding orthophosphate orthophosphate addition had an almost immediate impact on dissolved lead concentrations the large gap between total and dissolved lead concentrations during the first 15 weeks of orthophosphate addition indicates that particulate lead was still abundant in the water samples even after orthophosphate addition fig 2c the large pb concentration gap was also observed in welter et al 2015 the gap between dissolved and total lead and the random nature of the spikes in total lead concentrations suggest that lead containing particles were being released from the lead pipe surface over most of the conditioning period until week 50 the dissolved lead concentrations in 168 h samples were in general agreement with the solubility of hydroxylpyromorphite at the ph that was encountered at the end each week from weeks 52 75 in loops p1 p2 and p3 the ph values after 168 h were 7 94 9 96 at these ph values and with the dic of the water the lead solubility in equilibrium with hydroxylpyromorphite would be 2 0 17 5 μg l fig s1 dissolved lead concentrations ranged from non detectable to 5 9 μg l had the ph been more constant at ph 10 3 as might occur with more careful readjustment of the ph or an influx of new water then the dissolved lead concentration in equilibrium with hydroxylpyromorphite would have been higher the calculated solubility of hydroxylpyromorphite is 70 μg l at ph 10 3 for water with these concentrations of orthophosphate and dic after week 54 the dissolved lead concentrations dropped far below 15 μg l in all pipe reactors i e both with and without orthophosphate addition suggesting that a solid other than hydrocerussite or hydroxylpyromorphite was controlling the dissolved lead levels based on the dissolved lead concentration results and scale characterization discussed later the low lead concentrations were probably caused by the formation of the low solubility solid pbo2 s we note that between weeks 54 and 75 the dissolved pb levels from the loops receiving orthophosphate were still lower 1 0 1 3 μg l than those in the loops without orthophosphate 4 0 3 8 μg l there are two possible reasons for why orthophosphate retarded the release of dissolved pb from the scale the first is that orthophosphate helps sustain the free chlorine and the higher residual free chlorine concentrations enable greater development of pbo2 s in the scale the other is that orthophosphate adsorption onto pbo2 s in the scale might retard its dissolution while dissolved lead concentrations decreased almost immediately after orthophosphate addition total lead concentrations took more time to decrease total lead levels of the three loops with orthophosphate dropped consistently below 100 μg l after 12 weeks of orthophosphate addition fig 3a c for the next four weeks the average total lead level of pipe loops with orthophosphate was 34 0 24 1 μg l pb while that of pipe loops without orthophosphate was still high and highly variable at 149 6 148 2 μg l pb from 17 weeks after orthophosphate addition until the end of the experiment 30 weeks after orthophosphate addition the total lead levels of all three pipe loops with orthophosphate were almost always less than 15 μg l average 8 0 μg l median 7 2 μg l standard deviation 4 6 μg l these results demonstrate that long term continuous orthophosphate addition can effectively control total lead release in high ph water moreover our overall results show that pb levels remained low even when the ph decreased below 9 7 fig 2b high particulate lead concentrations persisted over the entire experiment duration for loops not receiving orthophosphate particulate lead release can be associated with the detachment of other metal oxides e g iron oxides within the scale masters and edwards 2015 the loops having high particulate lead levels also had higher fe levels than other loops which would be consistent with detachment of iron rich particles of scale table s1 additionally 8 h samples were collected and their total and dissolved concentrations are provided in section s7 3 6 potential precipitation of phosphate with calcium calcium is one of the major dissolved species in providence water and the potential formation of calcium phosphate solids was evaluated after adding orthophosphate in week 46 the calcium concentration decreased in the loops receiving orthophosphate fig 4 the greater decrease in calcium that occurred when the water was kept in the pipe loops than in the carboys indicates that most of the decrease in dissolved calcium was associated with the accumulation of calcium containing solids on the lead pipe surfaces in 8 h samples for weeks 47 78 the average dissolved and total calcium concentrations were 10 7 1 0 mg l and 11 1 1 4 mg l respectively fig s4 these results indicated a total calcium concentration decrease of about 4 mg l in the water stagnating in the pipes in the first 8 h of each week similarity between the total and dissolved ca concentrations in the 168 h and 8 h samples indicates that ca p containing solids deposited on the inner surfaces of the lead pipes and did not remain in the water as suspended particles to assess what ca p containing solids might have formed the final dissolved calcium and orthophosphate concentrations were examined along with the measured ph to calculate the saturation of the solution with respect to two possible solids hydroxylapatite ca5 po4 3oh s and octacalcium phosphate ca po4 0 74oh0 22 s the calculations were done using samples collected during week 57 section s8 the results indicate that the solution was supersaturated with respect to both hydroxylapatite and octacalcium phosphate by looking at the amounts of calcium and phosphorus lost from solution the molar ratio of calcium to phosphorus in the solids that formed can be estimated for the 8 h samples the calculated ca p molar ratio of the solids is 3 0 and for the 168 h samples the ratio is 1 0 section s9 which is not too different from that of octacalcium phosphate 1 35 1 or hydroxylapatite 1 66 1 the ratio of calcium to phosphorus lost from solution would be lower if any of the phosphorus was also lost from solution through precipitation with lead which is quite likely 3 7 hydrocerussite influence on dissolved calcium consumption because the fact that less than 10 of dissolved ca was lost 1 0 mg l when orthophosphate was added to artificial providence water in a carboy but not yet circulated through the lead pipes strongly suggests that the interactions of the phosphate containing water with the scales on the lead pipes are responsible for most of the orthophosphate loss from the water we hypothesize that hydrocerussite on the lead pipe surface promotes the initial nucleation of calcium phosphate solids that then precipitate further and consume dissolved calcium and orthophosphate we performed a simple batch experiment to test this hypothesis the results show fig 5 a that the dissolved ca concentration dropped much more in the batch experiment having hydrocerussite than in ones with either no solid or with pbo2 s this confirms that hydrocerussite does have the ability to promote precipitation of a solid that contains calcium and orthophosphate 3 8 antimony in a lead service line and impacts on lead release as mentioned in section 2 1 we found that one pipe loop c3 in fig s6 had lead concentrations that were consistently much lower than in the other loops specifically loop c3 was the only one that stabilized early in the conditioning process it became stable below 100 μg l after week 10 in the investigation of causes of this different behavior the analysis of elements in our samples was expanded we determined that antimony sb was constantly being released from loop c3 the 8 h or 168 h samples from c3 contained 5 10 μg l of sb figs s7 and s8 due to greater strength hardness and durability sb has been widely used as an alloying element with lead for products that include pipes storage battery grids and sheets thornton et al 2001 total materia 2001 released sb was mostly in the dissolved phase we speculate that the presence of sb in the lead pipes may have provided a long term control of lead release the dominant form of sb expected in water is antimonate sbo4 3 which has some chemical similarities to orthophosphate 3 9 solid characterization before adding orthophosphate scales of as harvested lead pipes were 30 80 μm thick results not shown their compositions as determined by eds were predominantly c o and pb indicating that compounds in the scale would be lead carbonates or lead ii iv oxides xrd patterns and raman spectra indicate that one of the main compounds in the scale is hydrocerussite the study of wang et al 2012 also observed that hydrocerussite was one of the dominant solids in the scales of providence pipes by conditioning the pipe loops substantial amounts of pbo2 s were formed pbo2 s was relatively abundant in the outer crust of the scale whereas hydrocerussite was abundant in the scale closer to the unaltered lead pipe at week 45 a 50 μm thick coarse outer scale with pb and o was observed fig 6 peaks belonging to pbo2 s were dominant in xrd patterns of the outer layer of the scale fig 7 a red line while peaks for hydrocerussite were detected as well as those for pbo2 s in the middle and bottom layer the formation of pbo2 on the scale is consistent with observed trends in free chlorine concentrations the free chlorine might have been consumed by the oxidation of pb ii to pb iv in pbo2 s in the pipe loops the daily free chlorine consumption rate was extremely high fig 2 no pbo2 s was observed in the scale from the actual as harvested lsls from providence although the water in providence leaves the treatment plant with about 1 0 mg l cl2 free chlorine the recirculation with daily replenishment of free chlorine may explain why pbo2 s became the dominant phase in the scale of the laboratory pipe loops while it was not observed in the harvested providence pipes where free chlorine residual will not always be maintained especially during periods of stagnation within in use pipes this observation further suggests that the low dissolved pb concentrations observed for all of the pipe loops with and without orthophosphate might have been promoted by the newly formed pbo2 s although the pipes without orthophosphate had low dissolved lead concentrations resulting from pbo2 formation they still had higher total lead concentrations than orthophosphate treated pipes because the pbo2 did not help prevent detachment of lead containing particles in the way that orthophosphate addition was able to 3 10 solid characterization after adding orthophosphate after adding orthophosphate solids that contained both ca and p formed on and within the scale the elemental mapping images of the cross section of a pipe segment collected at after 7 weeks of orthophosphate addition show ca and p co located in the layer near the unaltered lead fig 6 through optical images fig 8 a white precipitate was observed on the scale surface of 7 weeks after orthophosphate addition while the scale was dark red mainly plattnerite before orthophosphate addition fig 7a red line the xrd patterns did not show clear evidence that these white precipitates were calcium phosphate however for the inner scale fig 7b black line peaks that match those of phosphohedyphane ca2pb3 po4 3 cl f oh s were detected suggesting that the 10 μm thick ca pb p containing scale next to the unaltered lead might be poorly crystalline phosphohedyphane the continuous orthophosphate addition for 30 weeks made the outer ca p containing scale more extensive the optical images show that the outer scale became whiter through the long term recirculation fig 8 the outer white scale was easily detached during the cutting of the pipe segments indicating that it is coarse and not strongly adhered to the underlying scale on pipe sem mapping images show that the coarse outer scale is mainly composed of ca and p while having little pb suggesting that the solid in the scale might be more similar to an apatite or octacalcium phosphate than to a lead containing phosphate solid such as pyromorphite or phosphohedyphane at 29 weeks after orthophosphate addition i e week 75 elemental compositions by semi quantitative analyses from the outer scale obtained by eds section s10 fig s9 showed that the atomic ratio among ca p and f is 5 3 to 1 suggesting that the outer scale possibly contains fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f s this semi quantitative information was used to provide relative abundances of elements and overall compositions and was not used to gain precise quantitative information xrd patterns suggest that the outer scale possibly contains either fluorapatite or hydroxyapatite fig 7 magnified figure is presented in fig s10 the relative intensities of fluorapatite or hydroxyapatite patterns were low suggesting that the ca p containing scales might have low phase concentrations raman spectra show that the outer scale is mainly fluorapatite and hydroxyapatite fig 9 acid digestion results showed that the molar quantity of the calcium is higher than that of lead on the outer scale table 2 indicating the white matter contains more calcium than lead the formation of the ca p pb compounds in the inner scale was probably promoted by the hydrocerussite in the scale xrd patterns indicate that hydrocerussite is more abundant closer to the unaltered lead because hydrocerussite tends to promote ca p solid formation fig 5 the ca pb p containing scale was formed near the unaltered lead where the hydrocerussite is abundant on the other hand it is hard to conclude that the formation of the ca p compounds in the outer scale was promoted by hydrocerussite even though the average total ca consumption amount in 3 pipe loops was 129 3 16 3 mg for 6 weeks after orthophosphate addition i e week 52 fig 4 the ca p containing solid was not detected at week 52 fig 6 furthermore little hydrocerussite was detected in the outer scale fig 7 3 11 pbo2 s formation by continuous free chlorine supply long term conditioning of pipes with hydrocerussite and a continuous supply of free chlorine can transform the hydrocerussite into pbo2 for the scales from the pipes that had not received orthophosphate the xrd patterns fig 7d show the presence of pbo2 and almost the complete disappearance of hydrocerussite notably the harvested pipes from providence ri only had hydrocerussite with no detectable pbo2 s in the xrd patterns this is probably because of low residual free chlorine 0 5 mg l cl2 pw 2015 in the actual lsls and low reactivity of ocl the free chlorine species dominant at ph 10 the pbo2 s formation on outer scale fig 7 probably controlled the overall dissolved lead at the low levels observed fig 3b d while it was not a primary objective of this study the experimental results indicate that the promotion of conditions in a distribution system and lsls that can maintain a stable free chlorine residual may be effective for controlling lead concentrations similar conclusions were reached in a previous study of lead concentrations from lsls in several cities triantafyllidou et al 2015 3 12 the role of the calcium phosphorus containing solids on outer scale total pb concentrations dropped below 15 μg l after 15 weeks of orthophosphate addition the coarse ca p containing solids that were observed on the outer scale might have played a role in limiting total pb levels their formation could have acted as a physical barrier to pb release from the inner scale this observation indicates that orthophosphate addition could decrease pb release to water even without forming pb p solids although for a different overall water composition a recent study found that several midwestern utilities that use orthophosphate for lead corrosion control did not have any lead phosphate solids observed in the pipe scales tully et al 2019 the outer ca p containing scale that formed on the pipe surfaces may have limited lead release by acting as a physical barrier it could have been a barrier to both the release of dissolved lead from the underlying pb rich inner scale and the detachment of pb containing particles that also included other metals sem results fig 10 show that the outer ca p solids cover the outer scale that contains fe and mn oxides which could be a potential source for particulate lead release fe oxide in the scale can potentially promote detachment of pb containing particles masters and edwards 2015 trueman and gagnon 2016 consequently increasing total lead concentrations of 168 h samples the evidence from the mapping images is consistent with our observations of particulate fe and pb releases to the water from the pipes table s1 4 conclusions this study investigated the impacts of orthophosphate addition on lead release from lead pipes to water at a much higher ph than that for which orthophosphate has typically been used for corrosion control continuous orthophosphate addition for 15 weeks lowered total pb levels below 15 μg l the limitation on pb level was related to the formation of solids in the pipe scale that contained calcium and phosphorus the ca p containing solids were found both as a pb containing inner scale phosphohedyphane or a similar phase and as a coarse outer scale without lead possibly as fluorapatite it appears that hydrocerussite promotes the formation of the calcium phosphate solids in high ph low alkalinity water pbo2 s formed due to the daily resupply of free chlorine and the nature of the laboratory scale experiment orthophosphate addition was able to limit the release of both dissolved lead and lead containing particles while pbo2 s containing scale only limited dissolved lead concentrations the formation of ca p solids appears to have stabilized an iron rich layer of the scale whose attachment could contribute to release of particulate lead control of particulate lead release by orthophosphate addition is valuable because such release can occur sporadically and is difficult to anticipate deshommes et al 2010 triantafyllidou et al 2007 for the successful application of orthophosphate to lsls delivering high ph water the effects of orthophosphate at more diverse conditions need to be tested one condition to test would be temperature in order to assess seasonal variation it is useful to test the change in solubility of ca p pb containing solids depending on temperature fluctuation in order to assess to what extent ca p pb containing solids will release particulate pb as a function of temperature another important potential future study would be on the effects of stagnation or flushing declaration of
