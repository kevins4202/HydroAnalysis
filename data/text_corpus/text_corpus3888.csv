19440,the influence of proteins on bacterial transport and deposition behaviors in quartz sand was examined in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 solutions 1 2 and 5 mm bovine serum albumin bsa and bovine trypsin were used to represent negatively and positively charged proteins in natural aquatic systems respectively the presence of negatively charged bsa in suspensions increased the transport and decreased bacterial deposition in quartz sand regardless of the ionic strength and ion types whereas positively charged trypsin inhibited the transport and enhanced bacterial deposition under all experimental conditions the potential mechanisms controlling the changes of bacterial transport behaviors varied for different charged proteins the steric repulsion resulting from bsa adsorption onto both bacteria and quartz sand was found to play a dominant role in the transport and deposition of bacteria in porous media with bsa copresent in suspension bsa adsorption onto bacterial surfaces and competition for deposition sites onto sand surfaces adsorption of quartz sand surfaces contributed to the increased cell transport with bsa in suspension in contrast the attractive patch charged interaction induced by the adsorption of trypsin onto both bacteria and quartz sand had great contribution to the decreased bacterial transport in porous media with trypsin copresent in suspension the increase in bacteria size and the adsorption of trypsin onto cell surfaces resulting in less negative cell surface charge and quartz sand surfaces providing extra deposition sites were found to be the main contributors to the decreased transport and increased deposition of bacteria in quartz sand with trypsin in suspension graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacteria transport proteins site competition steric interaction patch charged interaction 1 introduction the fate and transport of bacteria in porous media are essential for various processes such as in situ bioremediation sayler and ripp 2000 weiss et al 2005 and protection of drinking water supplies from bacteria contamination kilb et al 2003 schets et al 2005 hence great efforts have been undertaken to investigate the factors affecting bacterial transport and deposition in porous media over past decades specifically factors such as grain shape and size bradford et al 2007 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2012 fluid condition syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2012 solution ionic strength and composition kim et al 2009 wang et al 2011 nutrient conditions han et al 2013 haznedaroglu et al 2008 and macromolecules on cell surfaces kim et al 2009 liu et al 2007 tong et al 2010 that could affect bacterial transport behaviors have been widely investigated recently substances present in natural water such as clay particles vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 yang et al 2012a zhao et al 2012 and hematite yang et al 2016 as well as nanoparticles released into the environment such as carbon nanotubes yang et al 2013 and tio2 battin et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2012a have also been investigated and were shown to affect bacterial transport behaviors in porous media dissolved organic materials dom are ubiquitously present in aquatic ecosystems depending on biogeochemical conditions and climate the concentration of dom in the natural environment typically ranges from 0 1 to 10 mg l nebbioso and piccolo 2013 dom has been demonstrated to be involved in the formation of colloidal particles and alteration of their surface area nutrient cycling and availability and ph buffering as well as in the transport of organic pollutants nebbioso and piccolo 2013 many previous studies foppen et al 2008 yang et al 2012b zhao et al 2014 have found that humic acid a major type of natural dom would influence bacterial transport behavior in porous media very recent studies also reported that low concentration 100 μg l of perfluorooctanoic acid wu et al 2016 and bisphenol a wu et al 2017 representative of emerging organic pollutants could alter bacterial transport and deposition in quartz sand protein is one of the three most important components of dom in the aquatic system nebbioso and piccolo 2013 schulze 2005 many previous studies have found that proteins would interact with colloids and thus affected the surface properties of colloids such as nano colloids lin et al 2017 lynch and dawson 2008 mahmoudi et al 2011 and biocolloids hou et al 2015 xing et al 2015 for instance lin et al 2017 found that extracellular polymeric substances with the major component being protein would interact with tio2 particles by adsorption onto their surfaces and modified the colloidal stability of tio2 nanoparticles xing et al 2015 revealed that exogenous d tyrosine contributed to the repulsive nature of the cell and ultimately led to the inhibition of bacterial adhesion a previous study hou et al 2015 found that amino acid composition and secondary structure analyses of proteins could influence the interactions between bacteria therefore it is likely that the co presence of proteins in natural aquatic systems will highly influence the transport behavior of biological colloids such as pathogens in the natural environment moreover the different surface properties of proteins may result in diverse bacterial transport behaviors in porous media however to the best of our knowledge the effects of proteins particularly with different surface properties on bacterial transport and deposition in porous media has not been explored and thus requires investigation therefore the present study was designed to systematically investigate the influence and associated mechanisms of proteins with different surface properties negative and positive surface charges on bacterial transport and deposition behaviors in packed porous media under environmentally relevant solution conditions bovine serum albumin bsa iep 4 7 has been widely employed as model protein in many previous studies lynch and dawson 2008 sheng et al 2016 due to the stability and strong activity under harsh conditions such as wide range of temperatures 10 70 c battin et al 2009 khangembam and chakrabarti 2015 liu et al 2007 and ph values 7 11 bougatef et al 2007 hau and benjakul 2006 bovine trypsin iep 10 1 is widely utilized in biomedicine biotechnology and food industry as well as in protein analysis khantaphant and benjakul 2010 momeni et al 2016 the wide application of bovine trypsin thus would definitely release the positive charged proteins into natural environments which may affect the fate and transport of bacteria in porous media thus bsa and bovine trypsin were utilized to represent the negatively and positively charged proteins under environmentally relevant solution conditions respectively escherichia coli was chosen as the model cell bacterial transport experiments were conducted both with and without proteins in cell suspensions at different ionic strengths conditions in both monovalent nacl and divalent salt cacl2 solutions the breakthrough curves and retained bacterial profiles with and without proteins in suspensions were compared under all experimental conditions the possible mechanisms by which proteins influence bacterial transport are proposed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 cell and protein suspension preparation the motile e coli bl21 gram negative bacteria was utilized as model strains in this study luria broth growth medium was utilized to cultivate e coli at 37 c while shaking at 200 rpm for 16 h until it reached the stationary growth phase the cells were harvested by centrifugation 5000 g for 8 min at 4 c more details regarding the cell harvest protocols and concentration determination are available in the supplementary materials the stock concentration was typically approximately 109 1010 cells ml the solution was diluted to obtain the target influent concentration of 1 5 107 10 cells ml the bovine serum albumin solarbio science technology co ltd beijing p r china 98 protein and bovine trypsin sigma aldrich st louis usa 90 100 protein stock solutions were prepared before each experiment by dissolving 5 mg of powder in 20 ml milli q water respectively the concentration of bsa and trypsin solutions were determined using a multi toc tn 3000 the experimental concentrations of bsa and trypsin were set to be 1 mg l toc the zeta potentials and the sizes of bacteria both in the absence and presence of two types of proteins in nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 solutions 1 2 and 5 mm at ph 6 4 were determined by a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk and the results were provided in table s1 the detailed procedure was provided in the supplementary materials 2 2 porous media and column experiments the porous media used for bacteria transport experiments were quartz sand ultrapure with 99 80 sio2 hebeizhensheng mining ltd shijiazhuang p r china with sizes ranging from 417 to 600 μm the clean quartz sand was wet packed into cylindrical plexiglass columns 10 cm length and 2 cm inner diameter the detailed information about sand cleaning protocol and the column packing procedure is provided in the supplementary materials the final porosity of the packed column was approximately 0 42 after packing 20 pv of milli q water was firstly injected into the packed columns which was followed by 10 pv of salt solutions at desired ionic strength and ph same as the bacteria transport experiments to avoid potential ion flux at the quartz sand surfaces subsequently 3 pv bacteria suspensions with and without protein suspensions were injected into the column followed by elution with 5 pv bacteria free salt solutions at the same ionic strength and ph for selected experiments prior to the injection of bacteria solutions the columns were pre equilibrated with 3 pv of bacteria free protein suspension at desired ionic strength to allow the deposition sites pre covered by proteins and followed by introduction of 2 pv of salt solution at the same ionic strength to release the unattached proteins the suspension and salt solutions were injected in an up flow orientation at 4 m day 0 43 ml min using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 harvard apparatus inc holliston usa the concentrations of monovalent ions such as na are typical around several to around hundred mm while the concentration of divalent ions such as ca2 was below a few mm in natural aquatic environment atekwana and richardson 2004 vengosh et al 2005 different salt concentrations thus were selected for nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 solutions 1 2 and 5 mm 10 ml centrifuge tubes were utilized to collect the effluent samples from column at the desired time intervals after the transport experiment the sediment was extruded from the column under gravity and dissected into 10 segments each 1 cm long for sample concentration analysis the overall recovery mass balance of cells for each transport experiment is provided in table s2 more details are provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 the calculation of interaction force the classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory which considers both lifshitz van der waals lw and electrostatic double layer forces interactions el is commonly employed to derive the interaction energies between colloids biotic and abiotic and surfaces elimelech et al 2013 hermansson 1999 lin et al 2012 tufenkji and elimelech 2004b van oss 1993 vanloosdrecht et al 1989 unlike abiotic colloids the transport behaviors of biotic colloids such as bacteria in porous media was not always consistent with dlvo theory prediction azeredo et al 1999 rijnaarts et al 1999 extended dlvo theory xdlvo proposed by van oss and co workers van oss et al 1988 which incorporates lewis acid and base force ab one type of non dlvo forces was employed to address the interactions between biotic colloids and collector grasso et al 2002 except for lewis acid and base force steric repulsion another type of non dlvo interaction resulted from the brush layers present on surfaces of bacteria collector or both has also been incorporated to determine the interactions between bacteria and collector tong et al 2005 walker et al 2005 wang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 in present study lw el and ab interactions were calculated to derive the total interactions between bacteria and quartz sand without proteins in suspensions while in addition to lw el and ab interactions steric interaction was also included when proteins were copresent in cell suspensions the following equations were utilized to calculate the lw el and ab interactions by treating bacteria and quartz sand as a sphere plate geometry system 1 δ g l w a 132 r 6 h 1 14 h λ 1 2 δ g e l π r ε ε 0 2 ζ p ζ s l n 1 e x p κ h 1 e x p κ h ζ p 2 ζ s 2

materials the steric interactions under two scenarios were calculated by using different equations particularly when both bacteria and quartz sand containing the brush layer of proteins the steric interaction was calculated by using eqs 4 and 5 strauss et al 2009 while when only bacteria have brush layer of proteins the steric interaction was calculated following eqs 6 and 7 butt et al 2005 4 f

nacl 40 mm cacl2 8 mm sheng et al 2016 while s is calculated through the method provided in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of bsa on transport and deposition of cells to examine the effect of bsa on the transport and deposition of bacteria in porous media the transport behaviors of e coli in packed quartz sand with and without 1 mg l toc bsa present in suspensions were investigated in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions fig 1 despite the presence or absence of bsa breakthrough plateaus at low ionic strength were higher relative to those at high ionic strength in both monovalent and divalent salt solutions fig 1 left open symbols which was consistent with the relatively more negative zeta potential at lower ionic strength table s1 many previous studies also found that bacteria transport decreased with the increase of ionic strength kim et al 2010 wang et al 2014 more importantly at the same solution conditions the breakthrough curves of e coli with bsa present in suspensions fig 1a solid symbols were higher than those without bsa fig 1a open symbols the observations held true under all examined ionic strength conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions for example in the absence of bsa 55 80 and 53 35 of e coli broke through the column in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively whereas when bsa was present 80 31 and 72 34 of e coli passed through the porous media in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 respectively the observations clearly demonstrated that the presence of bsa in suspensions increased e coli transport in packed quartz sand under all the examined solution conditions regardless of ion types and ionic strengths regardless of the absence or presence of bsa in suspensions the retained cell concentrations at low ionic strengths fig 1 right squares and circles were less than those at high ionic strength fig 1 right upward and leftward triangles in both nacl and cacl2 solutions which were consistent with the mass balance table s2 more importantly the amounts of bacteria retained in porous media with bsa in suspensions fig 1 solid symbols were lower than those without bsa in suspensions fig 1 open symbols regardless of the ion types and ionic strengths moreover the overall shapes of the retained profiles for bacteria with bsa were found to be similar to those without bsa in both nacl and cacl2 solutions clearly under all examined conditions although the copresence of bsa decreased the cell deposition in quartz sand yet the shape of cell retained profiles was not obviously affected by bsa previous studies found the alteration of colloid size would have significant influence on colloid transport cai et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2012b tufenkji and elimelech 2004a to determine whether the bacterial sizes would be altered by the presence of bsa in suspensions cell sizes both in the absence and presence of bsa in suspensions were measured by using dynamic light scattering dls zetasizer nano zs90 dls results showed that the cell sizes in the absence of bsa were equivalent with those in the presence of bsa table s1 clearly the increased cell transport obtained when bsa was present in suspensions thus was not driven by changes in sizes of bacteria many previous studies chowdhury et al 2012a jiang et al 2012 johnson and logan 1996 yang et al 2016 have shown that the adsorption of dom e g humic acid could change the surface properties of colloids and thus affected their transport behaviors in quartz sand therein the zeta potentials of bacteria with and without bsa present in suspensions were examined under all experimental ionic strength conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions at the same solution conditions cell zeta potentials with the presence of bsa were less negative relative to those in the absence of bsa table s1 which was true under all examined conditions the adsorption of bsa onto bacterial surfaces might lead to the change of cell zeta potentials to testify whether bsa would adsorb onto cell surfaces adsorption experiments of bsa onto bacteria surfaces were conducted the more details of adsorption experiments were provided in supplementary materials fig s1 showed that bsa did adsorb onto cell surfaces specifically approximate 25 of bsa adsorbed onto cell surfaces 16 of bacterial surface area thus was covered by bsa according to the coating percentage calculation detailed calculation was provided in the si the incomplete coverage of bacteria surfaces by bsa resulted in the decrease of the absolute value of cell zeta potentials which theoretically would predict a decreased cell transport due to the decreased electrostatic repulsion however as stated above increased cell transport with bsa co present in suspensions was observed under all examined conditions regardless of ion types and ion valence obviously the change of cell zeta potentials due to the adsorption of bsa on cell surfaces could not explain the increased cell transport behaviors the presence of organic matter components such as perfluoroalkyl acids wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 and humic acid yang et al 2012b would change the zeta potentials of quartz sand by the adsorption of organic matter onto sand surfaces the zeta potentials of quartz sand both with and without bsa in suspensions thus were determined less negatively charged quartz sand with the presence of bsa in suspensions relative to those without bsa in suspensions was obtained table s1 this was true for all examined ionic strengths in both nacl and cacl2 solutions the less negative zeta potentials of quartz sand might result from the adsorption of bsa onto sand surfaces to verify bsa transport experiments were conducted by choosing 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 salt solution as representative conditions fig s2 adsorption of bsa onto sand surfaces did occur for example around 32 of bsa was found to adsorb onto quartz sand surfaces in 25 mm nacl solutions fig s2 which occupied about 6 quartz sand surface area fig s3 nevertheless less negatively charged quartz sand due to the adsorption of bsa would lead to the less repulsive interaction between cell and quartz sand theoretically greater deposition of bacteria under all the experimental conditions would be expected which yet was opposite to the enhanced transport of bacteria observed in present study the enhanced transport of bacteria obtained with bsa co present in cell suspensions could not be attributed to the alteration in the zeta potentials of quartz sand as stated above the attachment of bsa onto cell surfaces occurred when bsa was present in cell suspensions although the change of cell zeta potentials due to the adsorption of bsa on cell surfaces could not explain the increased cell transport with bsa co present in suspensions we presume the attachment adsorption of bsa onto cell surfaces yet would affect the transport behaviors of bacteria to verify the hypothesis the transport experiments with bacteria suspension premixed with 1 mg l toc bsa yet from which the suspended un adsorbed bsa was removed via filtration with 0 22 μm nylon membranes under vacuum were conducted by choosing 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions as representative conditions the breakthrough curves of bacteria pre mixed with bsa yet with the removal of suspended bsa were higher than those in the absence of bsa in cell suspensions cells without bsa pre mixed fig 2 left open squares versus open triangles accordingly the retained profiles of bacteria with adsorbed bsa present on cell surfaces yet without bsa suspended in solutions were lower than those without bsa either present in cell surfaces or in suspensions fig 2 right open triangles versus open squares the observations held true in both 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions obviously the adsorption of bsa onto bacterial surface enhanced bacteria transport in porous media the increased cell transport due to the adsorption of pfoa onto cell surfaces has also been reported previously wu et al 2016 it should be noted that under all examined conditions the breakthrough curves for bacteria with bsa adsorbed on surfaces yet without the presence of bsa in suspensions fig 2 left open triangles were lower than those for columns with bsa in cell suspensions fig 2 left solid squares the results showed that although the adsorption of bsa onto bacterial surface could increase bacteria transport in porous media yet it was not the sole contributor other mechanism would also contribute to the increased cell transport with bsa present in suspensions previous studies found the co presence of colloids or organic matters would compete the deposition sites on quartz sand thus increased cell transport in porous media wu et al 2016 2017 yang et al 2012b to determine whether the bsa adsorbed on quartz sand surfaces would affect the transport behavior of bacteria additional transport experiments that involved pre covering the deposition sites on the quartz sand with bsa pretreating the columns with three pore volumes of 1 mg l toc bsa solution at experimental ionic strength were conducted by choosing 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions as representative conditions higher cell breakthrough curves were observed for columns pretreated with bsa yet without bsa in cell suspensions fig 2 left solid triangles relative to those without any bsa pretreatment and addition of bsa in suspensions fig 2 left open squares accordingly the retained profiles of quartz sand pre covering with bsa were lower relative to those without bsa treatment the observation was true in both 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions clearly sites competition by bsa contributed to the enhanced transport and decreased deposition with the presence of bsa in cell suspensions it should be pointed out that under all examined conditions the breakthrough curves for columns pretreated with bsa yet without bsa present in suspensions fig 2 left solid triangles were lower than those for columns without pretreatment yet with bsa in cell suspensions fig 2 left solid squares the observation indicated that although competition for deposition sites on quartz sand surfaces by bsa increased the cell transport yet it was not the sole contributor the presence of bsa in cell suspensions would affect the surface charges of bacteria and quartz sand as well as the contact angle and hamaker constant which would influence the interaction energy between bacteria and quartz sand the classical dlvo forces including lw and el fig s5 yet could not explain the transport behaviors of bacteria with the co presence of bsa lower repulsive force yet enhanced transport with bsa xdlvo forces including lw el and ab both with and without bsa co present in suspensions thus were calculated fig s6 under all examined solution conditions the total interaction energy between cell and sand in the presence of bsa solid lines was also lower than those in the absence of bsa dash lines which would expect a decreased transport of bacteria with bsa in suspensions yet increased cell transport was obtained with bsa in suspensions under all examined solution conditions clearly similar as dlvo interaction force the xdlvo interaction energy with the incorporation of lewis acid base interaction could not explain the increased transport behavior of bacteria observed with bsa in suspensions many previous studies found that the presence of macromolecules on bacteria surface would result in steric repulsion which would affect the transport and deposition behavior of bacteria in porous media camesano and logan 2000 kretzschmar et al 1997 tong et al 2005 walker et al 2005 since adsorption of bsa onto cell surfaces occurred single layer steric interaction between bacteria and quartz sand was then derived the calculated single layer steric interaction fig 3 a and b between bacteria and quartz sand with bsa adsorption only on bacteria surfaces confirmed that steric repulsion did exist with the adsorption of bsa onto bacterial surface the total interaction energies with the incorporation of single layer steric repulsion in xdlvo forces with the presence of bsa were found to be more repulsive relative to those without bsa in suspensions fig 3c and d which could theoretically explain the enhanced transport of bacteria obtained with bsa pre adsorbed onto cell surfaces yet with the removal of suspended bsa as stated above in addition to the adsorption of cell surfaces bsa would also adsorb onto quartz sand surfaces when bsa was present in cell suspensions double layer steric interaction between cell and sand since bsa would adsorb onto both bacteria and quartz sand surfaces the double layer steric repulsion with bsa adsorbed on both bacteria and quartz sand was larger than single layer steric repulsion fig 3 a and b which resulted in more repulsive total interaction energies by the incorporation of double layer steric repulsion relative to that of single layer steric repulsive the greater cell transport with bsa present in suspensions bsa adsorbed onto both cell and sand surfaces relative to that of bacteria with bsa adsorbed on surfaces yet without the presence of bsa in suspensions thus was obtained the observation indicated that the incorporation of steric repulsion into total interaction force calculation could theoretically explain the observation that the greater cell transport with bsa present in suspensions obviously in addition to lw el and ab steric interaction was also a major interaction controlling the transport and deposition behaviors of bacteria with bsa present in cell suspensions 3 2 influence of bovine trypsin on transport and deposition of cells different types of proteins contain different orders of amino acids in the polymeric sequence resulting in diverse structures and surface properties different charged groups in the structure of proteins would lead to the various electric properties under natural aquatic systems the above observations showed that the presence of negatively charged bsa would affect the transport behaviors of bacteria in porous media to understand whether the presence of positively charged protein would also influence the transport of bacteria in porous media e coli transport experiments in packed quartz sand with and without 1 mg l toc trypsin co present in suspensions were conducted in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions fig 4 regardless of the absence or presence of trypsin the breakthrough curves at low ionic strength were higher relative to those at high ionic strength at the same solution ionic strength conditions the breakthrough plateaus of bacteria with the presence of trypsin fig 4 solid symbols were lower relative to those with the absence of trypsin fig 4 open symbols this held true at all examined ionic strength conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions for instance the amounts of bacteria broke through the column decreased from 83 98 to 53 24 and 53 35 to 23 21 with the addition of trypsin in 1 2 mm and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively the observations indicated that unlike the observation obtained with the presence of bsa in suspensions the presence of positively charged trypsin decreased the transport of bacteria in porous media under all examined solution conditions the inhibition of bacteria transport in quartz sand by the presence of positively charged matters has also been reported previously gentile and de cortalezzi 2016 yang et al 2016 regardless of the absence or presence of trypsin in suspensions the retained cell concentrations at low ionic strengths were less than those at high ionic strengths in both nacl and cacl2 solutions fig 4 right which was consistent with mass balance consideration table s2 moreover under all experimental conditions the amounts of bacteria retained in the porous media with trypsin in suspensions were greater than those without trypsin in suspensions fig 4 right indicating the presence of trypsin in suspensions increased the deposition of bacteria in porous media interestingly at the same solution condition the shapes of the retained profiles for bacteria with trypsin copresent in suspensions were different from those without trypsin in suspensions the observation held true at all examined ionic strength conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions particularly the retained profiles of bacteria with the presence of trypsin were steeper relative to that without trypsin in suspensions to understand the mechanisms controlling the change of transport and deposition behaviors of bacteria by the presence of trypsin in suspensions the sizes and zeta potentials of bacteria zeta potentials of quartz sand as well as the interaction between bacteria and sand both with and without trypsin in suspensions were determined the sizes of bacteria with the presence of trypsin were found to be lager relative to those without trypsin table s1 which indicated that the addition of trypsin in suspensions had an influence on the alteration of bacteria sizes as stated above many previous studies found that increasing colloid size would decrease the colloid transport cai et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2012a yang et al 2012a therefore the inhibition transport behavior of bacteria with the presence of trypsin might be due to the increased sizes of bacteria bacterial zeta potential measurements showed that at the same solution conditions the addition of positively charged trypsin in cell suspensions at ph 6 4 resulted in the less negatively charged bacteria regardless of ion valence and ionic strengths table s1 moreover to verify whether trypsin would adsorb onto cell surfaces adsorption experiments of trypsin in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions were conducted fig s1 showed 38 and 26 of trypsin absorbed onto bacterial surfaces in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively the observation confirmed the adsorption of trypsin did occur on cell surfaces with the presence of trypsin the decreased absolute value of cell zeta potentials due to the adsorption of trypsin theoretically predicts a decreased repulsive interaction between bacteria and quartz sand clearly the inhibited transport behavior of bacteria obtained with the presence of trypsin was consistent with the theoretical prediction herein the surface property alteration by trypsin adsorption onto cell surfaces also contributed to the decreased cell transport behavior except for the alteration of cell surface property the presence of trypsin also changed the zeta potentials of quartz sand specifically the zeta potentials of quartz sand with the presence of trypsin was less negative relative to those without trypsin under all examined solution conditions table s1 the zeta potential alteration of quartz sand surfaces could be attributed to the adsorption of positively charged trypsin onto sand surfaces the transport experiment of trypsin in quartz sand figs s2 and b in representative conditions 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 confirmed the adsorption of trypsin onto quartz sand specifically almost 30 and 40 of trypsin were found to adsorb on quartz sand surface in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively fig s2 furthermore the less negatively charged quartz sand would lead to the decreased repulsive interaction between bacteria and quartz sand which theoretically supported the observed greater deposition of bacteria under all the experimental conditions to fully understand the interaction forces between cell and quartz sand the classical dlvo forces both in the absence and presence of trypsin in suspensions were determined fig 5 under all the experimental conditions the total interaction energies between bacteria and quartz sand were less repulsive with presence of trypsin fig 5 solid lines relative to those without trypsin in suspensions fig 5 dash lines according to the calculation profiles under all the experimental conditions increased cell deposition would be theoretically expected due to the less repulsive interaction between cell and quartz sand as stated above the inhibited bacteria transport was observed with trypsin copresent in suspensions fig 4 which was consistent with the theoretically prediction fig 5 obviously the classical dlvo forces including lw and el could explain the transport behaviors of bacteria with the co presence of trypsin the negative zeta potentials of both bacteria and quartz sand with the copresence of positively charged trypsin in suspensions table s1 indicated both surfaces of bacteria and quartz sand were not fully covered by trypsin for example in 5 mm cacl2 solutions approximately 5 4 of bacteria surfaces were covered by trypsin while 5 17 of quartz sand surfaces were covered by the adsorbed trypsin after 3 pv of injection fig s3 detailed calculation method was provided in supplementary materials clearly chemical heterogeneity was present both on the surfaces of bacteria and quartz sand which would result in the presence of attractive patch charge interaction among bacteria as well as between bacteria and quartz sand previous study sheng et al 2016 reported that the attractive patch charge interaction was the dominant force controlling the interaction among colloids with the presence of chemical heterogeneity the attractive patch charge interaction between bacteria and quartz sand resulted from the chemical heterogeneity on both surfaces of bacteria and quartz sand would have contribution to the altered transport behaviors of bacteria in quartz sand with copresence of trypsin many previous studies found that the transport behavior of colloids would be changed by the presence of chemical heterogeneity of colloids and porous media bradford and torkzaban 2012 2013 2015 to testify whether the alteration in transport behavior of bacteria with the presence of trypsin was caused by the presence of chemical heterogeneity on cell surfaces due to the adsorption of trypsin onto cell surfaces additional transport experiments of bacteria pre mixed with trypsin yet with the removal of suspended trypsin were conducted under representative conditions 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 fig 6 the pretreatment processes of trypsin on bacteria were the same as those with the pretreatment of bsa the breakthrough curves of bacteria pre mixed with trypsin yet with the removal of suspended trypsin were found to be lower than those in the absence of trypsin in cell suspensions fig 6 open triangles versus open squares accordingly the retained profiles of bacteria with adsorbed trypsin present on cell surfaces yet without trypsin suspended in solutions were higher than those without trypsin in suspensions fig 6 right open triangles versus open squares the observations held true in both 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions the observation indicated that adsorption of trypsin onto bacterial surfaces decreased bacteria transport in porous media clearly the alteration in chemical heterogeneity of bacterial surfaces did contribute to the change of bacteria transport behaviors with the presence of trypsin in suspensions it should be noted that under all examined conditions the breakthrough curves for bacteria with trypsin adsorbed on surfaces yet without the presence of trypsin in suspensions fig 6 left open triangles were slightly higher than those with trypsin in cell suspensions fig 6 left solid squares the results showed that although the adsorption of trypsin onto bacterial surfaces could decrease bacteria transport in porous media yet it was not the sole contributor the adsorption of colloids or organic matters onto porous media has been reported to provide additional deposition sites on quartz sand leading to the increased cell deposition in porous media dong et al 2014 kim et al 2008 to determine whether the positively charged trypsin adsorbed on quartz sand surfaces chemical heterogeneity present on quartz sand surfaces would affect the transport behavior of bacteria transport experiments that involved pre covering the deposition sites on the quartz sand with trypsin pretreating the columns with three pore volumes of 1 mg l toc trypsin solution at experimental ionic strength were conducted under representative conditions 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions the breakthrough curves of bacteria for columns pretreated with trypsin yet without trypsin in cell suspensions fig 6 left solid triangles were lower relative to those without pretreatment of trypsin and addition of trypsin in suspensions fig 6 left open squares the observations indicated that the adsorbed trypsin on quartz sand surface did provide extra sites for bacteria deposition which lead to the enhanced deposition of bacteria on quartz sand surfaces obviously chemical heterogeneity present on quartz sand surfaces due to the trypsin also have contribution to the decreased bacteria transport with the presence of trypsin in suspensions 4 conclusion this study systematically investigated the influence of negatively bsa as representative and positively bovine trypsin as representative charged proteins which are important components of natural dom on bacterial transport under different aquatic conditions ion valence and ionic strength we found that negatively charged bsa increased the transport and decreased bacterial deposition in quartz sand under the experimental conditions examined in the present study regardless of ionic strength and ion valence whereas the presence of positively charged trypsin inhibited the transport and enhanced bacterial deposition under all experimental conditions bsa competed with bacteria for the deposition sites on the quartz sand surfaces moreover the presence of bsa in cell suspensions led to the presence of steric repulsion interaction between bacteria and quartz sand as a result the enhanced transport behaviors of bacteria were observed under all experimental conditions when bsa was co present in cell suspensions less negatively charged bacteria and quartz sand as well as increase in bacteria size obtained with the copresence of trypsin was found to have significant influence on the inhibition of bacterial transport behavior the attractive patch charged interaction induced by the chemical heterogeneity on both surfaces of cell and quartz sand due to the adsorption of trypsin had great contribution to the decreased bacterial transport in porous media the results showed that different charged proteins would induce different transport behaviors of bacteria in porous media the mechanisms controlling the changes of bacterial transport behaviors varied for different charged proteins obviously the bacterial transport would be enhanced with the copresence of negatively charged proteins while it would be decreased with the copresence of positive charged proteins acknowledgments this work was supported by the national nature science foundation of china under grants no 51779001 and fund for

19440,the influence of proteins on bacterial transport and deposition behaviors in quartz sand was examined in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 solutions 1 2 and 5 mm bovine serum albumin bsa and bovine trypsin were used to represent negatively and positively charged proteins in natural aquatic systems respectively the presence of negatively charged bsa in suspensions increased the transport and decreased bacterial deposition in quartz sand regardless of the ionic strength and ion types whereas positively charged trypsin inhibited the transport and enhanced bacterial deposition under all experimental conditions the potential mechanisms controlling the changes of bacterial transport behaviors varied for different charged proteins the steric repulsion resulting from bsa adsorption onto both bacteria and quartz sand was found to play a dominant role in the transport and deposition of bacteria in porous media with bsa copresent in suspension bsa adsorption onto bacterial surfaces and competition for deposition sites onto sand surfaces adsorption of quartz sand surfaces contributed to the increased cell transport with bsa in suspension in contrast the attractive patch charged interaction induced by the adsorption of trypsin onto both bacteria and quartz sand had great contribution to the decreased bacterial transport in porous media with trypsin copresent in suspension the increase in bacteria size and the adsorption of trypsin onto cell surfaces resulting in less negative cell surface charge and quartz sand surfaces providing extra deposition sites were found to be the main contributors to the decreased transport and increased deposition of bacteria in quartz sand with trypsin in suspension graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacteria transport proteins site competition steric interaction patch charged interaction 1 introduction the fate and transport of bacteria in porous media are essential for various processes such as in situ bioremediation sayler and ripp 2000 weiss et al 2005 and protection of drinking water supplies from bacteria contamination kilb et al 2003 schets et al 2005 hence great efforts have been undertaken to investigate the factors affecting bacterial transport and deposition in porous media over past decades specifically factors such as grain shape and size bradford et al 2007 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2012 fluid condition syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2012 solution ionic strength and composition kim et al 2009 wang et al 2011 nutrient conditions han et al 2013 haznedaroglu et al 2008 and macromolecules on cell surfaces kim et al 2009 liu et al 2007 tong et al 2010 that could affect bacterial transport behaviors have been widely investigated recently substances present in natural water such as clay particles vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 yang et al 2012a zhao et al 2012 and hematite yang et al 2016 as well as nanoparticles released into the environment such as carbon nanotubes yang et al 2013 and tio2 battin et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2012a have also been investigated and were shown to affect bacterial transport behaviors in porous media dissolved organic materials dom are ubiquitously present in aquatic ecosystems depending on biogeochemical conditions and climate the concentration of dom in the natural environment typically ranges from 0 1 to 10 mg l nebbioso and piccolo 2013 dom has been demonstrated to be involved in the formation of colloidal particles and alteration of their surface area nutrient cycling and availability and ph buffering as well as in the transport of organic pollutants nebbioso and piccolo 2013 many previous studies foppen et al 2008 yang et al 2012b zhao et al 2014 have found that humic acid a major type of natural dom would influence bacterial transport behavior in porous media very recent studies also reported that low concentration 100 μg l of perfluorooctanoic acid wu et al 2016 and bisphenol a wu et al 2017 representative of emerging organic pollutants could alter bacterial transport and deposition in quartz sand protein is one of the three most important components of dom in the aquatic system nebbioso and piccolo 2013 schulze 2005 many previous studies have found that proteins would interact with colloids and thus affected the surface properties of colloids such as nano colloids lin et al 2017 lynch and dawson 2008 mahmoudi et al 2011 and biocolloids hou et al 2015 xing et al 2015 for instance lin et al 2017 found that extracellular polymeric substances with the major component being protein would interact with tio2 particles by adsorption onto their surfaces and modified the colloidal stability of tio2 nanoparticles xing et al 2015 revealed that exogenous d tyrosine contributed to the repulsive nature of the cell and ultimately led to the inhibition of bacterial adhesion a previous study hou et al 2015 found that amino acid composition and secondary structure analyses of proteins could influence the interactions between bacteria therefore it is likely that the co presence of proteins in natural aquatic systems will highly influence the transport behavior of biological colloids such as pathogens in the natural environment moreover the different surface properties of proteins may result in diverse bacterial transport behaviors in porous media however to the best of our knowledge the effects of proteins particularly with different surface properties on bacterial transport and deposition in porous media has not been explored and thus requires investigation therefore the present study was designed to systematically investigate the influence and associated mechanisms of proteins with different surface properties negative and positive surface charges on bacterial transport and deposition behaviors in packed porous media under environmentally relevant solution conditions bovine serum albumin bsa iep 4 7 has been widely employed as model protein in many previous studies lynch and dawson 2008 sheng et al 2016 due to the stability and strong activity under harsh conditions such as wide range of temperatures 10 70 c battin et al 2009 khangembam and chakrabarti 2015 liu et al 2007 and ph values 7 11 bougatef et al 2007 hau and benjakul 2006 bovine trypsin iep 10 1 is widely utilized in biomedicine biotechnology and food industry as well as in protein analysis khantaphant and benjakul 2010 momeni et al 2016 the wide application of bovine trypsin thus would definitely release the positive charged proteins into natural environments which may affect the fate and transport of bacteria in porous media thus bsa and bovine trypsin were utilized to represent the negatively and positively charged proteins under environmentally relevant solution conditions respectively escherichia coli was chosen as the model cell bacterial transport experiments were conducted both with and without proteins in cell suspensions at different ionic strengths conditions in both monovalent nacl and divalent salt cacl2 solutions the breakthrough curves and retained bacterial profiles with and without proteins in suspensions were compared under all experimental conditions the possible mechanisms by which proteins influence bacterial transport are proposed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 cell and protein suspension preparation the motile e coli bl21 gram negative bacteria was utilized as model strains in this study luria broth growth medium was utilized to cultivate e coli at 37 c while shaking at 200 rpm for 16 h until it reached the stationary growth phase the cells were harvested by centrifugation 5000 g for 8 min at 4 c more details regarding the cell harvest protocols and concentration determination are available in the supplementary materials the stock concentration was typically approximately 109 1010 cells ml the solution was diluted to obtain the target influent concentration of 1 5 107 10 cells ml the bovine serum albumin solarbio science technology co ltd beijing p r china 98 protein and bovine trypsin sigma aldrich st louis usa 90 100 protein stock solutions were prepared before each experiment by dissolving 5 mg of powder in 20 ml milli q water respectively the concentration of bsa and trypsin solutions were determined using a multi toc tn 3000 the experimental concentrations of bsa and trypsin were set to be 1 mg l toc the zeta potentials and the sizes of bacteria both in the absence and presence of two types of proteins in nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 solutions 1 2 and 5 mm at ph 6 4 were determined by a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk and the results were provided in table s1 the detailed procedure was provided in the supplementary materials 2 2 porous media and column experiments the porous media used for bacteria transport experiments were quartz sand ultrapure with 99 80 sio2 hebeizhensheng mining ltd shijiazhuang p r china with sizes ranging from 417 to 600 μm the clean quartz sand was wet packed into cylindrical plexiglass columns 10 cm length and 2 cm inner diameter the detailed information about sand cleaning protocol and the column packing procedure is provided in the supplementary materials the final porosity of the packed column was approximately 0 42 after packing 20 pv of milli q water was firstly injected into the packed columns which was followed by 10 pv of salt solutions at desired ionic strength and ph same as the bacteria transport experiments to avoid potential ion flux at the quartz sand surfaces subsequently 3 pv bacteria suspensions with and without protein suspensions were injected into the column followed by elution with 5 pv bacteria free salt solutions at the same ionic strength and ph for selected experiments prior to the injection of bacteria solutions the columns were pre equilibrated with 3 pv of bacteria free protein suspension at desired ionic strength to allow the deposition sites pre covered by proteins and followed by introduction of 2 pv of salt solution at the same ionic strength to release the unattached proteins the suspension and salt solutions were injected in an up flow orientation at 4 m day 0 43 ml min using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 harvard apparatus inc holliston usa the concentrations of monovalent ions such as na are typical around several to around hundred mm while the concentration of divalent ions such as ca2 was below a few mm in natural aquatic environment atekwana and richardson 2004 vengosh et al 2005 different salt concentrations thus were selected for nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 solutions 1 2 and 5 mm 10 ml centrifuge tubes were utilized to collect the effluent samples from column at the desired time intervals after the transport experiment the sediment was extruded from the column under gravity and dissected into 10 segments each 1 cm long for sample concentration analysis the overall recovery mass balance of cells for each transport experiment is provided in table s2 more details are provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 the calculation of interaction force the classical derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory which considers both lifshitz van der waals lw and electrostatic double layer forces interactions el is commonly employed to derive the interaction energies between colloids biotic and abiotic and surfaces elimelech et al 2013 hermansson 1999 lin et al 2012 tufenkji and elimelech 2004b van oss 1993 vanloosdrecht et al 1989 unlike abiotic colloids the transport behaviors of biotic colloids such as bacteria in porous media was not always consistent with dlvo theory prediction azeredo et al 1999 rijnaarts et al 1999 extended dlvo theory xdlvo proposed by van oss and co workers van oss et al 1988 which incorporates lewis acid and base force ab one type of non dlvo forces was employed to address the interactions between biotic colloids and collector grasso et al 2002 except for lewis acid and base force steric repulsion another type of non dlvo interaction resulted from the brush layers present on surfaces of bacteria collector or both has also been incorporated to determine the interactions between bacteria and collector tong et al 2005 walker et al 2005 wang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 in present study lw el and ab interactions were calculated to derive the total interactions between bacteria and quartz sand without proteins in suspensions while in addition to lw el and ab interactions steric interaction was also included when proteins were copresent in cell suspensions the following equations were utilized to calculate the lw el and ab interactions by treating bacteria and quartz sand as a sphere plate geometry system 1 δ g l w a 132 r 6 h 1 14 h λ 1 2 δ g e l π r ε ε 0 2 ζ p ζ s l n 1 e x p κ h 1 e x p κ h ζ p 2 ζ s 2

materials the steric interactions under two scenarios were calculated by using different equations particularly when both bacteria and quartz sand containing the brush layer of proteins the steric interaction was calculated by using eqs 4 and 5 strauss et al 2009 while when only bacteria have brush layer of proteins the steric interaction was calculated following eqs 6 and 7 butt et al 2005 4 f

nacl 40 mm cacl2 8 mm sheng et al 2016 while s is calculated through the method provided in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of bsa on transport and deposition of cells to examine the effect of bsa on the transport and deposition of bacteria in porous media the transport behaviors of e coli in packed quartz sand with and without 1 mg l toc bsa present in suspensions were investigated in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions fig 1 despite the presence or absence of bsa breakthrough plateaus at low ionic strength were higher relative to those at high ionic strength in both monovalent and divalent salt solutions fig 1 left open symbols which was consistent with the relatively more negative zeta potential at lower ionic strength table s1 many previous studies also found that bacteria transport decreased with the increase of ionic strength kim et al 2010 wang et al 2014 more importantly at the same solution conditions the breakthrough curves of e coli with bsa present in suspensions fig 1a solid symbols were higher than those without bsa fig 1a open symbols the observations held true under all examined ionic strength conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions for example in the absence of bsa 55 80 and 53 35 of e coli broke through the column in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively whereas when bsa was present 80 31 and 72 34 of e coli passed through the porous media in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 respectively the observations clearly demonstrated that the presence of bsa in suspensions increased e coli transport in packed quartz sand under all the examined solution conditions regardless of ion types and ionic strengths regardless of the absence or presence of bsa in suspensions the retained cell concentrations at low ionic strengths fig 1 right squares and circles were less than those at high ionic strength fig 1 right upward and leftward triangles in both nacl and cacl2 solutions which were consistent with the mass balance table s2 more importantly the amounts of bacteria retained in porous media with bsa in suspensions fig 1 solid symbols were lower than those without bsa in suspensions fig 1 open symbols regardless of the ion types and ionic strengths moreover the overall shapes of the retained profiles for bacteria with bsa were found to be similar to those without bsa in both nacl and cacl2 solutions clearly under all examined conditions although the copresence of bsa decreased the cell deposition in quartz sand yet the shape of cell retained profiles was not obviously affected by bsa previous studies found the alteration of colloid size would have significant influence on colloid transport cai et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2012b tufenkji and elimelech 2004a to determine whether the bacterial sizes would be altered by the presence of bsa in suspensions cell sizes both in the absence and presence of bsa in suspensions were measured by using dynamic light scattering dls zetasizer nano zs90 dls results showed that the cell sizes in the absence of bsa were equivalent with those in the presence of bsa table s1 clearly the increased cell transport obtained when bsa was present in suspensions thus was not driven by changes in sizes of bacteria many previous studies chowdhury et al 2012a jiang et al 2012 johnson and logan 1996 yang et al 2016 have shown that the adsorption of dom e g humic acid could change the surface properties of colloids and thus affected their transport behaviors in quartz sand therein the zeta potentials of bacteria with and without bsa present in suspensions were examined under all experimental ionic strength conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions at the same solution conditions cell zeta potentials with the presence of bsa were less negative relative to those in the absence of bsa table s1 which was true under all examined conditions the adsorption of bsa onto bacterial surfaces might lead to the change of cell zeta potentials to testify whether bsa would adsorb onto cell surfaces adsorption experiments of bsa onto bacteria surfaces were conducted the more details of adsorption experiments were provided in supplementary materials fig s1 showed that bsa did adsorb onto cell surfaces specifically approximate 25 of bsa adsorbed onto cell surfaces 16 of bacterial surface area thus was covered by bsa according to the coating percentage calculation detailed calculation was provided in the si the incomplete coverage of bacteria surfaces by bsa resulted in the decrease of the absolute value of cell zeta potentials which theoretically would predict a decreased cell transport due to the decreased electrostatic repulsion however as stated above increased cell transport with bsa co present in suspensions was observed under all examined conditions regardless of ion types and ion valence obviously the change of cell zeta potentials due to the adsorption of bsa on cell surfaces could not explain the increased cell transport behaviors the presence of organic matter components such as perfluoroalkyl acids wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 and humic acid yang et al 2012b would change the zeta potentials of quartz sand by the adsorption of organic matter onto sand surfaces the zeta potentials of quartz sand both with and without bsa in suspensions thus were determined less negatively charged quartz sand with the presence of bsa in suspensions relative to those without bsa in suspensions was obtained table s1 this was true for all examined ionic strengths in both nacl and cacl2 solutions the less negative zeta potentials of quartz sand might result from the adsorption of bsa onto sand surfaces to verify bsa transport experiments were conducted by choosing 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 salt solution as representative conditions fig s2 adsorption of bsa onto sand surfaces did occur for example around 32 of bsa was found to adsorb onto quartz sand surfaces in 25 mm nacl solutions fig s2 which occupied about 6 quartz sand surface area fig s3 nevertheless less negatively charged quartz sand due to the adsorption of bsa would lead to the less repulsive interaction between cell and quartz sand theoretically greater deposition of bacteria under all the experimental conditions would be expected which yet was opposite to the enhanced transport of bacteria observed in present study the enhanced transport of bacteria obtained with bsa co present in cell suspensions could not be attributed to the alteration in the zeta potentials of quartz sand as stated above the attachment of bsa onto cell surfaces occurred when bsa was present in cell suspensions although the change of cell zeta potentials due to the adsorption of bsa on cell surfaces could not explain the increased cell transport with bsa co present in suspensions we presume the attachment adsorption of bsa onto cell surfaces yet would affect the transport behaviors of bacteria to verify the hypothesis the transport experiments with bacteria suspension premixed with 1 mg l toc bsa yet from which the suspended un adsorbed bsa was removed via filtration with 0 22 μm nylon membranes under vacuum were conducted by choosing 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions as representative conditions the breakthrough curves of bacteria pre mixed with bsa yet with the removal of suspended bsa were higher than those in the absence of bsa in cell suspensions cells without bsa pre mixed fig 2 left open squares versus open triangles accordingly the retained profiles of bacteria with adsorbed bsa present on cell surfaces yet without bsa suspended in solutions were lower than those without bsa either present in cell surfaces or in suspensions fig 2 right open triangles versus open squares the observations held true in both 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions obviously the adsorption of bsa onto bacterial surface enhanced bacteria transport in porous media the increased cell transport due to the adsorption of pfoa onto cell surfaces has also been reported previously wu et al 2016 it should be noted that under all examined conditions the breakthrough curves for bacteria with bsa adsorbed on surfaces yet without the presence of bsa in suspensions fig 2 left open triangles were lower than those for columns with bsa in cell suspensions fig 2 left solid squares the results showed that although the adsorption of bsa onto bacterial surface could increase bacteria transport in porous media yet it was not the sole contributor other mechanism would also contribute to the increased cell transport with bsa present in suspensions previous studies found the co presence of colloids or organic matters would compete the deposition sites on quartz sand thus increased cell transport in porous media wu et al 2016 2017 yang et al 2012b to determine whether the bsa adsorbed on quartz sand surfaces would affect the transport behavior of bacteria additional transport experiments that involved pre covering the deposition sites on the quartz sand with bsa pretreating the columns with three pore volumes of 1 mg l toc bsa solution at experimental ionic strength were conducted by choosing 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions as representative conditions higher cell breakthrough curves were observed for columns pretreated with bsa yet without bsa in cell suspensions fig 2 left solid triangles relative to those without any bsa pretreatment and addition of bsa in suspensions fig 2 left open squares accordingly the retained profiles of quartz sand pre covering with bsa were lower relative to those without bsa treatment the observation was true in both 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions clearly sites competition by bsa contributed to the enhanced transport and decreased deposition with the presence of bsa in cell suspensions it should be pointed out that under all examined conditions the breakthrough curves for columns pretreated with bsa yet without bsa present in suspensions fig 2 left solid triangles were lower than those for columns without pretreatment yet with bsa in cell suspensions fig 2 left solid squares the observation indicated that although competition for deposition sites on quartz sand surfaces by bsa increased the cell transport yet it was not the sole contributor the presence of bsa in cell suspensions would affect the surface charges of bacteria and quartz sand as well as the contact angle and hamaker constant which would influence the interaction energy between bacteria and quartz sand the classical dlvo forces including lw and el fig s5 yet could not explain the transport behaviors of bacteria with the co presence of bsa lower repulsive force yet enhanced transport with bsa xdlvo forces including lw el and ab both with and without bsa co present in suspensions thus were calculated fig s6 under all examined solution conditions the total interaction energy between cell and sand in the presence of bsa solid lines was also lower than those in the absence of bsa dash lines which would expect a decreased transport of bacteria with bsa in suspensions yet increased cell transport was obtained with bsa in suspensions under all examined solution conditions clearly similar as dlvo interaction force the xdlvo interaction energy with the incorporation of lewis acid base interaction could not explain the increased transport behavior of bacteria observed with bsa in suspensions many previous studies found that the presence of macromolecules on bacteria surface would result in steric repulsion which would affect the transport and deposition behavior of bacteria in porous media camesano and logan 2000 kretzschmar et al 1997 tong et al 2005 walker et al 2005 since adsorption of bsa onto cell surfaces occurred single layer steric interaction between bacteria and quartz sand was then derived the calculated single layer steric interaction fig 3 a and b between bacteria and quartz sand with bsa adsorption only on bacteria surfaces confirmed that steric repulsion did exist with the adsorption of bsa onto bacterial surface the total interaction energies with the incorporation of single layer steric repulsion in xdlvo forces with the presence of bsa were found to be more repulsive relative to those without bsa in suspensions fig 3c and d which could theoretically explain the enhanced transport of bacteria obtained with bsa pre adsorbed onto cell surfaces yet with the removal of suspended bsa as stated above in addition to the adsorption of cell surfaces bsa would also adsorb onto quartz sand surfaces when bsa was present in cell suspensions double layer steric interaction between cell and sand since bsa would adsorb onto both bacteria and quartz sand surfaces the double layer steric repulsion with bsa adsorbed on both bacteria and quartz sand was larger than single layer steric repulsion fig 3 a and b which resulted in more repulsive total interaction energies by the incorporation of double layer steric repulsion relative to that of single layer steric repulsive the greater cell transport with bsa present in suspensions bsa adsorbed onto both cell and sand surfaces relative to that of bacteria with bsa adsorbed on surfaces yet without the presence of bsa in suspensions thus was obtained the observation indicated that the incorporation of steric repulsion into total interaction force calculation could theoretically explain the observation that the greater cell transport with bsa present in suspensions obviously in addition to lw el and ab steric interaction was also a major interaction controlling the transport and deposition behaviors of bacteria with bsa present in cell suspensions 3 2 influence of bovine trypsin on transport and deposition of cells different types of proteins contain different orders of amino acids in the polymeric sequence resulting in diverse structures and surface properties different charged groups in the structure of proteins would lead to the various electric properties under natural aquatic systems the above observations showed that the presence of negatively charged bsa would affect the transport behaviors of bacteria in porous media to understand whether the presence of positively charged protein would also influence the transport of bacteria in porous media e coli transport experiments in packed quartz sand with and without 1 mg l toc trypsin co present in suspensions were conducted in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions fig 4 regardless of the absence or presence of trypsin the breakthrough curves at low ionic strength were higher relative to those at high ionic strength at the same solution ionic strength conditions the breakthrough plateaus of bacteria with the presence of trypsin fig 4 solid symbols were lower relative to those with the absence of trypsin fig 4 open symbols this held true at all examined ionic strength conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions for instance the amounts of bacteria broke through the column decreased from 83 98 to 53 24 and 53 35 to 23 21 with the addition of trypsin in 1 2 mm and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively the observations indicated that unlike the observation obtained with the presence of bsa in suspensions the presence of positively charged trypsin decreased the transport of bacteria in porous media under all examined solution conditions the inhibition of bacteria transport in quartz sand by the presence of positively charged matters has also been reported previously gentile and de cortalezzi 2016 yang et al 2016 regardless of the absence or presence of trypsin in suspensions the retained cell concentrations at low ionic strengths were less than those at high ionic strengths in both nacl and cacl2 solutions fig 4 right which was consistent with mass balance consideration table s2 moreover under all experimental conditions the amounts of bacteria retained in the porous media with trypsin in suspensions were greater than those without trypsin in suspensions fig 4 right indicating the presence of trypsin in suspensions increased the deposition of bacteria in porous media interestingly at the same solution condition the shapes of the retained profiles for bacteria with trypsin copresent in suspensions were different from those without trypsin in suspensions the observation held true at all examined ionic strength conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions particularly the retained profiles of bacteria with the presence of trypsin were steeper relative to that without trypsin in suspensions to understand the mechanisms controlling the change of transport and deposition behaviors of bacteria by the presence of trypsin in suspensions the sizes and zeta potentials of bacteria zeta potentials of quartz sand as well as the interaction between bacteria and sand both with and without trypsin in suspensions were determined the sizes of bacteria with the presence of trypsin were found to be lager relative to those without trypsin table s1 which indicated that the addition of trypsin in suspensions had an influence on the alteration of bacteria sizes as stated above many previous studies found that increasing colloid size would decrease the colloid transport cai et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2012a yang et al 2012a therefore the inhibition transport behavior of bacteria with the presence of trypsin might be due to the increased sizes of bacteria bacterial zeta potential measurements showed that at the same solution conditions the addition of positively charged trypsin in cell suspensions at ph 6 4 resulted in the less negatively charged bacteria regardless of ion valence and ionic strengths table s1 moreover to verify whether trypsin would adsorb onto cell surfaces adsorption experiments of trypsin in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions were conducted fig s1 showed 38 and 26 of trypsin absorbed onto bacterial surfaces in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively the observation confirmed the adsorption of trypsin did occur on cell surfaces with the presence of trypsin the decreased absolute value of cell zeta potentials due to the adsorption of trypsin theoretically predicts a decreased repulsive interaction between bacteria and quartz sand clearly the inhibited transport behavior of bacteria obtained with the presence of trypsin was consistent with the theoretical prediction herein the surface property alteration by trypsin adsorption onto cell surfaces also contributed to the decreased cell transport behavior except for the alteration of cell surface property the presence of trypsin also changed the zeta potentials of quartz sand specifically the zeta potentials of quartz sand with the presence of trypsin was less negative relative to those without trypsin under all examined solution conditions table s1 the zeta potential alteration of quartz sand surfaces could be attributed to the adsorption of positively charged trypsin onto sand surfaces the transport experiment of trypsin in quartz sand figs s2 and b in representative conditions 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 confirmed the adsorption of trypsin onto quartz sand specifically almost 30 and 40 of trypsin were found to adsorb on quartz sand surface in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively fig s2 furthermore the less negatively charged quartz sand would lead to the decreased repulsive interaction between bacteria and quartz sand which theoretically supported the observed greater deposition of bacteria under all the experimental conditions to fully understand the interaction forces between cell and quartz sand the classical dlvo forces both in the absence and presence of trypsin in suspensions were determined fig 5 under all the experimental conditions the total interaction energies between bacteria and quartz sand were less repulsive with presence of trypsin fig 5 solid lines relative to those without trypsin in suspensions fig 5 dash lines according to the calculation profiles under all the experimental conditions increased cell deposition would be theoretically expected due to the less repulsive interaction between cell and quartz sand as stated above the inhibited bacteria transport was observed with trypsin copresent in suspensions fig 4 which was consistent with the theoretically prediction fig 5 obviously the classical dlvo forces including lw and el could explain the transport behaviors of bacteria with the co presence of trypsin the negative zeta potentials of both bacteria and quartz sand with the copresence of positively charged trypsin in suspensions table s1 indicated both surfaces of bacteria and quartz sand were not fully covered by trypsin for example in 5 mm cacl2 solutions approximately 5 4 of bacteria surfaces were covered by trypsin while 5 17 of quartz sand surfaces were covered by the adsorbed trypsin after 3 pv of injection fig s3 detailed calculation method was provided in supplementary materials clearly chemical heterogeneity was present both on the surfaces of bacteria and quartz sand which would result in the presence of attractive patch charge interaction among bacteria as well as between bacteria and quartz sand previous study sheng et al 2016 reported that the attractive patch charge interaction was the dominant force controlling the interaction among colloids with the presence of chemical heterogeneity the attractive patch charge interaction between bacteria and quartz sand resulted from the chemical heterogeneity on both surfaces of bacteria and quartz sand would have contribution to the altered transport behaviors of bacteria in quartz sand with copresence of trypsin many previous studies found that the transport behavior of colloids would be changed by the presence of chemical heterogeneity of colloids and porous media bradford and torkzaban 2012 2013 2015 to testify whether the alteration in transport behavior of bacteria with the presence of trypsin was caused by the presence of chemical heterogeneity on cell surfaces due to the adsorption of trypsin onto cell surfaces additional transport experiments of bacteria pre mixed with trypsin yet with the removal of suspended trypsin were conducted under representative conditions 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 fig 6 the pretreatment processes of trypsin on bacteria were the same as those with the pretreatment of bsa the breakthrough curves of bacteria pre mixed with trypsin yet with the removal of suspended trypsin were found to be lower than those in the absence of trypsin in cell suspensions fig 6 open triangles versus open squares accordingly the retained profiles of bacteria with adsorbed trypsin present on cell surfaces yet without trypsin suspended in solutions were higher than those without trypsin in suspensions fig 6 right open triangles versus open squares the observations held true in both 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions the observation indicated that adsorption of trypsin onto bacterial surfaces decreased bacteria transport in porous media clearly the alteration in chemical heterogeneity of bacterial surfaces did contribute to the change of bacteria transport behaviors with the presence of trypsin in suspensions it should be noted that under all examined conditions the breakthrough curves for bacteria with trypsin adsorbed on surfaces yet without the presence of trypsin in suspensions fig 6 left open triangles were slightly higher than those with trypsin in cell suspensions fig 6 left solid squares the results showed that although the adsorption of trypsin onto bacterial surfaces could decrease bacteria transport in porous media yet it was not the sole contributor the adsorption of colloids or organic matters onto porous media has been reported to provide additional deposition sites on quartz sand leading to the increased cell deposition in porous media dong et al 2014 kim et al 2008 to determine whether the positively charged trypsin adsorbed on quartz sand surfaces chemical heterogeneity present on quartz sand surfaces would affect the transport behavior of bacteria transport experiments that involved pre covering the deposition sites on the quartz sand with trypsin pretreating the columns with three pore volumes of 1 mg l toc trypsin solution at experimental ionic strength were conducted under representative conditions 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions the breakthrough curves of bacteria for columns pretreated with trypsin yet without trypsin in cell suspensions fig 6 left solid triangles were lower relative to those without pretreatment of trypsin and addition of trypsin in suspensions fig 6 left open squares the observations indicated that the adsorbed trypsin on quartz sand surface did provide extra sites for bacteria deposition which lead to the enhanced deposition of bacteria on quartz sand surfaces obviously chemical heterogeneity present on quartz sand surfaces due to the trypsin also have contribution to the decreased bacteria transport with the presence of trypsin in suspensions 4 conclusion this study systematically investigated the influence of negatively bsa as representative and positively bovine trypsin as representative charged proteins which are important components of natural dom on bacterial transport under different aquatic conditions ion valence and ionic strength we found that negatively charged bsa increased the transport and decreased bacterial deposition in quartz sand under the experimental conditions examined in the present study regardless of ionic strength and ion valence whereas the presence of positively charged trypsin inhibited the transport and enhanced bacterial deposition under all experimental conditions bsa competed with bacteria for the deposition sites on the quartz sand surfaces moreover the presence of bsa in cell suspensions led to the presence of steric repulsion interaction between bacteria and quartz sand as a result the enhanced transport behaviors of bacteria were observed under all experimental conditions when bsa was co present in cell suspensions less negatively charged bacteria and quartz sand as well as increase in bacteria size obtained with the copresence of trypsin was found to have significant influence on the inhibition of bacterial transport behavior the attractive patch charged interaction induced by the chemical heterogeneity on both surfaces of cell and quartz sand due to the adsorption of trypsin had great contribution to the decreased bacterial transport in porous media the results showed that different charged proteins would induce different transport behaviors of bacteria in porous media the mechanisms controlling the changes of bacterial transport behaviors varied for different charged proteins obviously the bacterial transport would be enhanced with the copresence of negatively charged proteins while it would be decreased with the copresence of positive charged proteins acknowledgments this work was supported by the national nature science foundation of china under grants no 51779001 and fund for

19441,humification plays an important role in the sewage sludge stabilization treatment and probably influences the end product ecotoxicity which are not fully understood for high solid anaerobic digestion ad process this study monitored the aromaticity degree of humic acid like fraction ha and detected digestate phytotoxicity during a 48 d high solid ad significant repolymerization of aromatic structures in ha electrical conductivity ec of digestate changed negatively with the aromaticity degree in ha and the digestate with high ec had low seed germination index sgi a positive correlation between sgi and the aromaticity degree of ha was found aromatic repolymerization of ha supplies more aromatic electron rich sites to form neo humic polymers and to determine the distribution of organic and or inorganic phytotoxic compounds thus aromatic repolymerization of ha may control the digestate phytotoxicity by reducing excessive salinity the results showed the effect of ha repolymerization on digestate stabilization and phytotoxicity reduction during the high solid ad process the inadequate phytotoxicity reduction efficiency sgi 17 may be ascribed to unaccomplished ha repolymerization creating a demand for humification intensification studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge high solid anaerobic digestion humic acid like fraction aromatization phytotoxicity stabilization 1 introduction management and disposal of sewage sludge have become important issues due to environmental and economic concerns appels et al 2008 anaerobic digestion ad a biochemical conversion process that can efficiently decompose organic matter om and produce methane rich biogas 60 70 vol of methane ch4 is one of the most technically mature and cost effective processes duan et al 2012 the high solid ad can directly treat dewatered sewage sludge total solid ts content 15 with smaller reactors higher volumetric methane productivity and lower energy demand for heating duan et al 2012 nevertheless although the digestate contains large amounts of n p k and micronutrients the positive effect of the end product of ad as an organic amendment and fertilizer is still under debate nkoa 2014 in most cases the digestate in its basic form may harm the environment and human health because of the undesirable characteristics such as odor viscosity high humidity high content of ammonium volatile fatty acids vfa and salinity the end product stability of anaerobic digestate should be highlighted for further disposal and management the humified fraction of organic matter om is considered to be the most important one responsible for the stability of om as it is the fraction most resistant to microbial degradation bernal et al 2009 in composting organic wastes are reported to biologically convert into relatively stable humic like substances hs for agricultural applications li et al 2017 watteau and villemin 2011 moreover the increase of humic acid like fraction ha result in the stability of om indicating the compost maturity zhang et al 2015 as for ad the vs ts ratio is widely used to reflect microbial decomposition of organic matter and stabilization dong et al 2013 om is decomposed and transformed into stable humic compounds and biogas appels et al 2008 provenzano et al 2016 with their high molecular weight and abundant functional affinity sites around the aromatic structure hs interact with metal ions and organic cations buffer ph and control physicochemical behavior biological availability and even the environmental fate of macro and micronutrients haroun et al 2009 kulikowska et al 2015 plaza et al 2005 ren et al 2016 the cation binding capacity of hs can retain and exchange macro and micronutrients reducing the bioavailability of organic and inorganic pollutants maia et al 2008 plaza et al 2005 the phytotoxicity of the digestate is likely influenced by the progress of humification thus it is necessary to explore the transformation of hs during the high solid ad processes however the formation and transfiguration of hs during the high solid anaerobic digestion process have not been fully understood especially the aromatization and its possible impact on the phytotoxicity of the end product additionally ha is the most important and active component of hs originating from various resources boguta et al 2016 li et al 2014 rodriguez et al 2016 in sewage sludge according to the method of the international humic substances society the extracted hs accounts for 14 6 of total solids ts and 27 0 of organic matter and ha accounts for 90 6 of hs while the remaining portion is the fulvic acid like fraction fa li et al 2014 compared to ha fa features a lower affinity of proton binding and heterogeneity in carboxylic type groups plaza et al 2005 a high ha fa represents successful humification owing to the biodegradation of the fa fraction or the non humic fraction and the polymerization of aromatic structures in ha awasthi et al 2017 to focus on the end product of the sludge this study explores the biotransformation of ha only the phytotoxicity depends on ph ec low weight carboxylic acids heavy metals and phenols suggesting that the digestate phytotoxicity synthetically reflects the status of degraded organic matter deepesh et al 2014 kataki et al 2017 roig et al 2012 and the concentrations of the pollutant the excessive salinity of the digestate has a significant inhibitory effect on the seedling establishment alburquerque et al 2012 kataki et al 2017 tigini et al 2016 excessive salinity in water solute extracts leads to a strong osmotic pressure between plant roots and the growth substrate and causes a significant reduction in water availability to seeds and plants alburquerque et al 2012 el fels et al 2014a in fact microbial immobilization li et al 2016 and the chelating of hs bustamante et al 2012 can decrease the salinity of the sludge moreover metal ions can be controlled by the complexation of aromatic carboxylic and phenolic functional structures in ha during ad for example stronger binding of cu ii ions occurs when ha is characterized by a higher degree of aromaticity and humification while the affinity of zn in humic substances shows that the organic complexes of zn are well correlated with the humic substance content dong et al 2013 in general the aromatic affinity sites of ha on heavy metals in highly anaerobic conditions plays an important role in the transformation of metal ions from exchangeable forms to immobile organic complexations aromatic structures with abundant functional groups should be closely monitored ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbance has been widely used for characterizing humic substances rodriguez et al 2016 the parameter specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 uva254 toc toc total organic carbon is used to characterize the aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 and molecular weight świetlik and sikorska 2006 of ha suva254 mainly represents electron rich sites such as aromatic functional groups and double bonded c groups in the humic macromolecule kim et al 2006 rodriguez

polyenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons uyguner and bekbolet 2005 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir has been used to identify the functional groups within the humic macromolecule

2012 kataki et al 2017 tigini et al 2016 which has been extensively used to evaluate compost toxicity kataki et al 2017 selim et al 2012 tambone et al 2015 the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the aromatic characterization of ha in high solid anaerobic digestate using elemental analysis uv vis and ftir spectroscopy 2 to analyze the digestate phytotoxicity and its relation to ha transformation 3 and to provide the indicators for further stabilization and reutilization of the high solid anaerobic digestate 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates high solid ad trials and physicochemical analyses dewatered raw sewage sludge rss collected at the dehydration machine room of the quyang wastewater treatment plant in shanghai was used as the substrate for the ad treatment a mesophilic anaerobic digestion reactor with a working volume of 12 l was set up with helix type stirrers at a rate of 60 rpm rotations per minute with 10 min stirring and 2 min break total solids ts

and added to the reactor which was operated in batch mode for 48 d at 35 1 c the samples of anaerobically digested sludge in this study were collected every 8 d marked as ad 8 d ad 16 d ad 24 d and so on additionally the rss was considered as the sample of day 0 operation time in the high solid ad physicochemical properties including ph electrical conductivity ec ts vs ts and gas production were tested the samples of the high solid ad were stored at 20 c before analysis the moisture content was determined by weight loss upon drying at 105 c in an oven for 24 h the vs content was determined by heating the samples at 550 c for 1 h in a muffle furnace the ph and ec of a 1 10 w w suspension were measured using a mettler toledo ph and ec meter switzerland respectively total extractable carbon tec was obtained by mixing 2 g of freeze dried sludge with 100 ml of the solution of 0 1 m na4p2o7 and 0 1 m naoh and shaking for 48 h at 338 k then 25 ml of the supernatant solution fa was acidified to ph 1 using 50 h2so4 tec and total organic carbon of fa fac were determined using a toc vcpn analyzer shimadzu japan humic acid carbon hac was calculated by subtracting fac from tec roletto et al 1985 2 2 extraction of humic substances the freeze dried and sieved samples were used to extract ha according to the method implemented by the international humic substances society 1996 in summary 50 g sample was added to 500 ml 1 mol l 1 hcl after shaking for 1 h and centrifuging for 20 min at 3000 rpm the supernatant was separated then 0 1 mol l 1 naoh redissolved the precipitate with an l s ratio of 10 under n2 atmosphere the solution was shaken for 4 h and the extracted humic substances were separated into ha and fa fractions by acidifying the extract to ph 1 using 6 mol l 1 hcl the supernatant fa and the precipitated fraction ha were separated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min after the redissolution of the ha fraction in 0 1 mol l 1 koh the acidification and centrifugation of the supernatant were repeated the ha precipitate was purified using the 0 1 mol l 1 hcl 0 3 mol l 1 hf solution until the ash content was below 1 followed by dialysis against deionized water using a dialysis membrane viskase md55 characterized by the molecular weight cut off of 3500 finally the extracted ha was freeze dried tf fd 1 freeze dryer china for further analysis 2 3 analysis methods of ha uv254 was measured at 254 nm in 3 0 mg solutions of each ha sample in 10 ml of 0 05 mol l 1 nahco3 with ph adjusted to 8 3 using 0 02 mol l 1 naoh the suva is the ratio of the special uv vis absorbance to toc measured using uv2559 shimadzu japan and toc vcpn analyzer shimadzu japan respectively a mixture of 1 2 mg of freeze dried ha samples and 100 mg of potassium bromide kbr ir grade was pressed into pellets then the pellets were ground to be homogenized and analyzed with a fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet 5700 from 400 to 4000 cm 1 the ftir results were normalized by dividing them by the sum of the absorbance values subsequently normalized ftir absorbance values were translated as 0 001 in order from rss to ad 48 d on y axis showing the main changes in aromatic functional groups at 1000 1800 cm 1 and aliphatic groups at 2820 3000 cm 1 the carbon c hydrogen h and nitrogen n contents of ha were analyzed using a chn coder elementar vario el iii with 5 mg freeze dried ha for each sample the h c and c n molar ratios were calculated to investigate the structural characteristics of organic matter 2 4 phytotoxicity tests two plant species morning glory ipomoea hederacea l mg and sunflower hehanthus annuus l sf were chosen as test objects among the most sensitive plant species recommended by the oecd 1984 except vegetables phytotoxicity tests were conducted according to the national standard of the people s republic of china for sludge disposal from the municipal wastewater treatment gb t 23486 2009 in summary sludge extracts were prepared by shaking 8 g sludge with 24 ml distilled water for 1 h at 160 r min 1 the suspension was centrifuged before being introduced into a polyethylene tube and kept at 4 c twenty seeds were placed on a layer of filter paper in 7 5 cm petri dishes and 5 ml of each sludge extract was added to the petri dishes distilled water was used as the blank control each test was repeated five times and all petri dishes were incubated in the dark at 25 c for 48 h the seed germination index sgi was calculated as follows 1 sgi 100 s g r s a r l s s s g r c a r l s c where sgrs is the seed germination rate sgr in the sludge sample sgrc is the sgr in the control arlss is the average root length of seedlings arls in the sludge and arlsc is the arls in the control to verify the impact of ec on seedlings a univariate test was performed using 0 0125 mol l 1 and four aqueous solutions of nacl with 0 025 mol l 1 concentration gradients 0 025 0 100 mol l 1 ec and sgi of each digestate sample including rss and six digestates samples ad 8 d 48 d were measured commercial ha cha shanghai yuanye bio technology h17j8t28708 was used to test sgi i e the effect of ha on seedlings 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobically digested sludge evolution the ph ec and ts content and the vs ts ratio at different stages of the high solid ad are presented in table 1 during the start up period the vs ts ratio decreased sharply in the first eight days from 64 81 to 47 97 because of the intensive decomposition of biodegradable organic matter by anaerobic microbes the total degradation rate of organic matter reached 62 92 based on vs degradation koch et al 2009 corresponding to a previous study shao et al 2013 the total biogas yield and cumulative biogas produced every four days during ad are shown in fig 1 which is consistent with the results of dong et al 2013 the average biogas yield from the digesters was 527 ml g 1 vsremoval or 410 ml g 1 vsadded the ph value increased in the first 16 d from 7 49 to 8 84 and then it was steady in the range of 8 84 8 89 although a slight decrease occurred in ad 48 d the decrease was possibly caused by the mineralization of proteinaceous groups to yield alkaline ammonia and or to lose volatile acids li et al 2015 2016 the ec first increased from 0 62 ms cm 1 at rss to 3 41 ms cm 1 in ad 24 d and dropped to 2 53 ms cm 1 in ad 48 d the increase in ec may be attributed to the degradation of organic matter and the release of different mineral salts in available forms such as phosphate ammonium and potassium li et al 2011 2015 while the reduction of ec primarily result from the loss of soluble salts by microbial immobilization and or the formation of insoluble salts li et al 2016 and chelating humic substances bustamante et al 2012 3 2 characteristics of ha transformation during high solid ad 3 2 1 changes in aromatization of ha of 48 d high solid ad 1 uv vis analysis fig 2 depicts the variations in uv vis parameters in ha during the high solid ad process after the initial increase in the first eight days decreasing trends in suva254 and suva280 were observed in ad 8 24 d both suva254 and suva280 had the lowest values in ad 24 d 2 407 l mg 1 m 1 and 2 088 l mg 1 m 1 respectively and then they increased to their highest values of 4 071 l mg 1 m 1 and 3 237 l mg 1 m 1 in ad 48 d respectively these results suggest the transformation of aromaticity in ha hs are supramolecular associations characterized by their aromatic origin sutton and sposito 2005 thus in the start up period the relative enhancement of aromaticity can be ascribed to the exposure of inner aromatics under intensive consumption of superficial labile aliphatics as the energy source of microorganisms in ad 8 24 d the exposed aromatic structures in ha were further biodegraded indicating that the original aromatics were not persistent enough however the aromatization degree of ha developed again in the second 24 days and reached a new high level at the end it is possible that the ha core can aggregate new aromatics to form more unsaturated and stable structures during the high solid ad process which is similar to the polymerization repolymerization of aromatics as new humic substances amir et al 2006 maia et al 2008 therefore the reduction of aliphatics and some labile aromatics of original ha may lead to the reconstruction of new aromatic structures and form final humic macromolecules 2 elemental analysis elemental composition and atomic ratios of ha are shown in table 2 and fig 3 respectively nitrogen n decreased from 8 321 rss to 7 146 ad 16 d and then increased to 8 791 ad 48 d with fluctuations around ad 24 d the increase in n after initial consumption in the start up period may result from the presence of n in ha and the condensation of lignin with proteins stevenson 1983 the reduction of h from 8 156 rss to 7 475 ad 48 d was probably caused by the fusion of aliphatic chains with the addition of aromatic groups huang et al 2006 mainly during the second 24 d in the high solid ad the c content slightly increased initially then decreased significantly from 55 555 ad 8 d to 51 220 ad 16 d and recovered during the last 16 d of ad despite the fluctuations in ad 24 d the increase at the beginning may be explained by the reduction of other elements including n and h the significant reduction in the middle was in agreement with the sharp decrease in vs ts caused by the decomposition of organic carbon as the energy resource the final recovery of carbon shows that the products of degradation i e c aromatics c carboxyl and c ester by microbial activity and enzymatic reactions can be the precursors of new humic structures amir et al 2010 although humic acid is considered not biodegradable in most environmental conditions this study detected an intermediate drop in the aromatization degree and the reduction of c h and n in ha these results suggest that besides labile sugars proteins amino acids fatty acids and aromatics can also be consumed by anaerobic microorganisms as c sources provenzano et al 2014 2016 the molar ratio of h c in ha decreased at first and then increased from ad 8 d to 24 d following the sequential loss from 1 818 ad 24 d to 1 624 ad 48 d the first decrease in h c was attributed to reduced h and relatively enhanced c caused by the fusion of aliphatic chains and exposure of aromatics the increased h c was caused by the intermediate decline of the aromaticity degree confirming the consumption of c aromatics in the second 24 d of the high solid ad the rapid decrease of h c in ha was similar to the enhanced maturity progress of humic substances in the compost indicating the increased degree of aromatic condensation garcia et al 1989 the molar ratio of c n increased from 7 606 rss to 8 362 ad 16 d and then sharply reduced to 7 299 ad 40 d although the eventual c n was 7 331 the initial high c n in ha suggests that n mineralizes more rapidly than c the final decreasing c n with the increasing c content demonstrates its stronger repolymerization effect on n because the lower level of c n is associated with the higher degree of mineralization of the alkyl carbon branch and the incorporation of protein decomposition products during the humification process zhang et al 2015 3 ftir spectroscopy analyses the spectra of all ha samples feature peaks around 1600 1680 cm 1 of moderate and strong intensity owing to the overlapping signature absorption originated from aromatic c c vibrations of alkenes stretching c o of amide i o c o of ester and carboxyl and c o of ketones and quinone groups amir et al 2010 chai et al 2007 el fels et al 2014b the intensity of the peaks at 1627 cm 1 and 1655 cm 1 reduced during the first 24 d because of the consumption of liable aromatic structures in ha nevertheless in ad 32 48 d more peaks strengthened at 1636 cm 1 1646 cm 1 1662 cm 1 and 1670 cm 1 unmarked in fig 4 suggesting that the aromatic structures in ha can be rebuilt with new materials and groups maybe released from lignin derived aromatics el fels et al 2014a kataeva et al 2013 besides the peak at 1711 cm 1 rss disappeared but then shifted to 1716 cm 1 in the last eight days of the high solid ad the peak at 1716 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of c c acids ketones and carboxyl groups gonzález pérez et al 2004 the sharp shoulder peaks in 1630 1680 cm 1 1517 1559 cm 1 and 1435 1456 cm 1 supported the repolymerization of aromatics during the second 24 days of high solid ad especially in ad 40 48 d for instance the intensities of the bands at 1517 cm 1 1521 cm 1 and 1435 cm 1 unsaturated and aromatic c c increased furthermore strong absorption was observed at 1540 cm 1 amide ii or aromatic c c 1230 1220 cm 1 amide iii or aromatic ethers c o c rodríguez et al 2016 1079 1072 cm 1 and 1032 cm 1 aromatic ethers c o c of carbohydrates or si o c groups the intensities of these peaks at 2852 cm 1 2923 cm 1 and 2958 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetric methylene stretching in long chain aliphatic molecules decreased because of the biotransformation of complex molecules into simpler forms by mineralization in addition a slight increase at 1456 cm 1 oh of phenols coo ch3 and amide ii occurred from ad 32 d to 48 d el fels et al 2014b reported that the aromaticity and the polymerization degree of ha increased after the consumption of total lipids and aliphatic compounds in co composting suggesting that the repolymerization can take place with the aromatic derivatives of neo humic substances by microbial metabolism hence the repolymerization of ha structures with aromatic electron rich sites can occur during the high solid ad three main routes of aromatic repolymerization of ha are as follows a decomposition of aliphatic c contributes to the progressive transformation of polysaccharides to other oxygenated compounds amir et al 2010 particularly carboxylic and ester groups b the novel stabilized ha structure may be originated from aromatic c c or the lignin derived aromatics amir et al 2006 zheng et al 2014 c the biodegradation of fa fraction or non humic substances is capable of polymerizing the aromatic structures of ha awasthi et al 2017 therefore the aromatic absorbance that initially declined and later increased in ha can be identified as repolymerization during the high solid ad also supported by the results of uv vis elemental and ftir analyses the lysis and active destruction of aliphatics and aromatics can be regarded as a preparation for repolymerization of new ha structures this result is consistent with the reduction in hac during the first 24 d and the slower reduction between days 24 and 48 overall the observations of ha repolymerization of the 48 d high solid ad are similar to the humification of composting in which a net production of aromatic compounds as well as the partial formation of neo humic polymers such as polysaccharides occurred amir et al 2010 el fels et al 2014a 2014b 3 2 2 characteristics of ha transformation of high solid ad compared to low solid ad few studies reported there is aromatic repolymerization of ha in low solid ad process as reported by kataki et al 2017 the 30 45 d low solid ad ts 7 31 g kg 1 0 7 3 1 25 6 3 6 c with three types of input biomass cow manure ipomoea carnea and rice straw is expected to increase in maturity or stability by the longer hydraulic retention time however during a low solid ad ts 1 2 35 1 c that lasted about 90 d shao et al 2013 the dissolved organic matter dom of the digestate was gradually humified the humification index was low in the first 18 d and then it increased and stabilized after 40 d of digestion it is similar to the repolymerization of ha during the high solid ad in this experiment the proportion of organic matter except protein and polysaccharide decreased initially and then the refractory soluble microbial products increased to dominate dom however with only 48 d under high solid anaerobic conditions the organic carbon content of ha reached 17 9 table 1 which was equal to 74 3 of ha fractionation at the end of the 94 d low solid ad 24 1 shao et al 2013 besides according to du and li 2017 there were no significant peaks of ha in the low solid ad ts 1 2 20 c although the value of the fluorescence intensity on day 61 was slightly stronger than on day 31 with higher organic loading rates abundant substrate prevents the nutrient imbalance for ad microbes as a result compared to the long term low solid ad high solid ad may have a higher humification potential and accelerate the humification progress 3 3 relationship between phytotoxicity and humification during the 48 d high solid ad 3 3 1 phytotoxicity and correlated salinity of digestate changes the phytotoxicity of the digestate reflected by sgi on sunflower and morning glory is shown in fig 5 a the sgi of sunflower sf sgi decreased from 29 rss to 5 ad 24 d but increased again during the second 24 days with the endpoint of 16 ad 48 d while the sgi of morning glory mg sgi decreased in the first 24 d by 2 and then it increased from 0 ad 24 d and 32 d to 7 ad 48 d soaking seeds in the water extract of the digestate demonstrates that the salinity is the direct contributor to the damage of the plasma membrane of the seeds because of salt stress guo and yu 2012 fig 5 c illustrates the ec levels of the water extract of the digestate 1 3 w w the ec increased by 3 7 times with the highest value of 8 79 ms cm 1 in ad 24 d and reduced to 6 89 ms cm 1 in ad 48 d this is almost opposite to the changes in sgi which are in agreement with the results in table 1 in accordance with results of kataki et al 2017 the changes in ec correlate negatively with sgi on sf slope 0 12 r sq 0 9363 and mg slope 0 07 r sq 0 7105 fig 5 d indicating that excessive ec causes a significant inhibitory effect on seed germination dong et al 2013 reported increasing ammonia from 4363 7 mg l 1 to 5828 4 mg l 1 during the 33 d high solid ts 22 3 w w ad in batch mode at 35 1 c this is not consistent with the sgi rebound in our experiment as for volatile fatty acid vfa concentration it increased to 8333 582 mg l 1 in ad 6 d and decreased to 1029 145 mg l 1 until the end of ad dong et al 2013 according to brinton 1998 volatile organic acids voa in plant growth media as low as 300 500 ppm could be phytotoxic on plant seedling the changes of vfa are not in accordance with the sgi rebound in ad 24 d either and this result agrees some phytotoxic components remain after high solid ad so far excessive ec level is the most important component of phytotoxicity on plant seedling and shows the most sensitivity with ha repolymerization 3 3 2 phytotoxicity changes and correlated ha transformation of digestate five aqueous solutions of cha with 10 mg ml 1 concentration gradients 10 50 mg ml 1 were tested in supplemented media fig 5 b cha at 10 mg ml 1 had a high sf sgi 111 and cha at 50 mg ml 1 had the highest sf sgi at 153 a significant positive correlation between cha and sf sgi was detected r2 0 8146 the relatively poor mg sgi value showed a similar trend although it increased slowly mg sgi at 101 in 50 mg ml 1 of cha mg sgi showed a stronger correlation with cha concentrations r2 0 8696 these results show that ha is effective from root to shoot and acts as a rooting stimulator elmongy et al 2018 nevertheless sf sgi and mg sgi were still less than 17 despite a large amount of humic acid carbon during the high solid ad table 1 moreover the decreasing humic acid carbon levels cannot explain the improvement in sgi during ad 24 48 d therefore only monitoring the amount of ha is meaningless without a structural or a characteristics analysis this implies that the changes in the aromaticity degree of ha might explain the digestate phytotoxicity variations as for the impact of the aromaticity degree of ha on sgi fig 6 shows the relevant data in three dimensional graphs combined with phytotoxicity indicators sf sgi mg sgi on the z axis and the aromaticity variables of ha in terms of uv vis parameters suva254 and suva280 elemental indicators h c c n and the normalized ftir absorbance at 1230 cm 1 and 1627 cm 1 on the projection of the plane x and y axes the curves in three dimensional graphs show the strong affinity between aromatization of ha and sludge phytotoxicity the plots have similar turning points in ad 24 d marked with the lowest aromatization degree and severe phytotoxicity 5 of sf sgi 0 of mg sgi after 24 d high solid ad the aromatization degree of ha firms up along with the acutely recovered phytotoxicity of the digestate supported by fig 6 e and f the changes in the normalized absorbance of specific aromatic structures in ha correlate with the reduction and late enrichment of germination and root shooting the projection of ftir absorbance reveals aromatic ethers c o c or amide iii 1230 cm 1 and aromatic c c c o in carboxyl and quinone groups 1627 cm 1 therefore the decrease and late improvement of sgi on sf and mg in ad 24 d can be ascribed to the decline and repolymerization of aromatics in ha during the high solid ad the results of the regression analysis between representative aromatic parameters suva254 suva280 h c specific ftir absorbance and phytotoxicity indicators sf sgi mg sgi are presented in table 3 both sf sgi r2 0 7217 and 0 6568 and mg sgi r2 0 6192 and 0 7501 correlated positively with suva254 and suva280 respectively the h c ratio and mg sgi were characterized by a significant negative correlation r2 0 9554 while a relatively weak relationship with sf sgi r2 0 4536 was observed in addition positive correlations of normalized ftir specific aromatic absorbance at 1627 cm 1 and 1230 cm 1 with mg sgi were stronger than those with sf sgi which might have resulted from the differences in the sensitivity of plant species the characterization of some indicators may also have played a role for example the ftir absorbance changed slowly with the operating time of digestion and mg sgi fluctuated within a limited range the spectrographic and chemical characteristics of ha show that the aromaticity of has in the second 24 d of high solid ad has higher abundance of aromatic electron rich sites and that π π electron transitions can contribute to the complexation of heavy metals and or contaminated organic matter kulikowska et al 2015 plaza et al 2005 xiong et al 2013 increasing the acute ecotoxicity of the digestate through the changes in ec the ec enhancement in the first 24 d is linked to not only the mineralization of organically bound nutrients kataki et al 2017 but also the break of some liable aromatic complexes with soluble salts and or metal ions the ec declined when aromatic ha structures were reconstructed ad 24 48 d suggesting the effect of the immobilization of aromatics in ha boguta et al 2016 bustamante et al 2012 dong et al 2013 kulikowska et al 2015 maia et al 2008 especially an extremely low degree of aromatization in ha accompanied with the highest level of ec in ad 24 d resulted in the lowest sgi during the whole high solid ad process ha is able to absorb pesticides phthalates and pcbs maia et al 2008 plaza et al 2005 thus besides salinity other phytotoxic components can also be removed by the reconstructed aromatic sites the repolymerization of aromatics in ha leads to a larger reduction in phytotoxicity than relatively liable aromatics in general the condensation and repolymerization of aromatics in ha play an important role in the immobilization of free metal ions by controlling ec and directly improving the sgi of the digestate extracts 3 3 3 stabilization assessment of high solid ad based on phytotoxicity and ha transformation a greater degree of humification is ascribed to more complex and condensed aromatic structures and or more conjugation in aliphatic chains which are resistant to degradation he et al 2011 as synthesized indicators the aromatic repolymerization of ha and phytotoxicity changes contribute to the further understanding of digestate stabilization according to shao et al 2013 there are two main pathways for humification of organic matter 1 degradation and accumulation of recalcitrant material and 2 oxidation and polyphenolic condensation therefore during the ad process initially the intense mineralization is supposed to extract aromatic recalcitrant material from liable non aromatic or aromatic organic material second the net production of aromatic neo humic polymers determines the end product bioaccessibility and the distribution of organic and or inorganic phytotoxic compounds actually the significant phytotoxicity still existed associated with the highest sgi only 17 of sf sgi and 7 of mg sgi zucconi et al 1981 considering the reasons of remaining phytotoxicity on the one hand the ec of digestate extracts for testing sgi in ad 48 d 6 89 ms cm 1 was still belong to the high range of 3 4 9 3 ms cm 1 reported by kataki et al 2017 the findings above however the ha repolymerization is in accordance with little vs ts decrease and the 21 62 ec reduction in ad 24 48 d indicating the organic matrix has become stabilized and the phytotoxic components would not increase again therefore the remaining phytotoxic component especially excessive salinity need further immobilization ascribed to ha aromatics or other treatments on the other hand compared with the low solid anaerobic digestion the high solid anaerobic digestion shows higher efficiency on ha repolymerization mainly reflecting on final hac toc level it seems that the humification process can be accelerate during high solid anaerobic conditions which provides abundant substrate and more intense activity of anaerobic microbes therefore in order to enhance aromatic repolymerization and control digestate phytotoxicity both preventing nutrient imbalance and the improvement of cooperative efficiency of anaerobic microbes are necessary moreover the accumulation of recalcitrant material especially some microbial derivative such as the neo aromatics is difficult to finish without thorough degradation of anaerobic microbes in general aromatic repolymerization of ha provides to a new understanding of high solid ad for stabilization treatment besides unfinished ha repolymerization and accumulation suggests the inadequate phytotoxicity reduction further creating a demand for further humification and stabilization studies 4 conclusions the conclusions of this research are follows 1 during the 48 d high solid ad aromatic structures of ha underwent repolymerization after a break and consumption during the second 24 d as evidenced by increasing suva280 and suva254 values strengthened ftir absorbance of aromatics and decreasing h c and c n ratios 2 the enhanced aromatization degree of ha correlated strongly with the digestate salinity rebound and the improvement of sgi therefore aromatic repolymerization may be the internal force that controls phytotoxicity by reducing the direct inhibitory effect of excessive digestate salinity 3 aromatic repolymerization of ha is consistent with little changes in vs ts during the second 24 days of high solid ad therefore the organic matrix has become stabilized and the phytotoxic components would not increase again which are evidenced by 21 62 ec reduction and the improvement of sgi on sf and mg further aromatic repolymerization of ha can act as an important indicator of the stabilization of organic matter and plays the influential role on digestate phytotoxicity reduction 4 compared to the long term low solid ad the 48 d high solid ad achieved more significant aromatic repolymerization of ha although it needs further humification intensification and digestate stabilization to overcome inadequate phytotoxicity reduction

19441,humification plays an important role in the sewage sludge stabilization treatment and probably influences the end product ecotoxicity which are not fully understood for high solid anaerobic digestion ad process this study monitored the aromaticity degree of humic acid like fraction ha and detected digestate phytotoxicity during a 48 d high solid ad significant repolymerization of aromatic structures in ha electrical conductivity ec of digestate changed negatively with the aromaticity degree in ha and the digestate with high ec had low seed germination index sgi a positive correlation between sgi and the aromaticity degree of ha was found aromatic repolymerization of ha supplies more aromatic electron rich sites to form neo humic polymers and to determine the distribution of organic and or inorganic phytotoxic compounds thus aromatic repolymerization of ha may control the digestate phytotoxicity by reducing excessive salinity the results showed the effect of ha repolymerization on digestate stabilization and phytotoxicity reduction during the high solid ad process the inadequate phytotoxicity reduction efficiency sgi 17 may be ascribed to unaccomplished ha repolymerization creating a demand for humification intensification studies graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge high solid anaerobic digestion humic acid like fraction aromatization phytotoxicity stabilization 1 introduction management and disposal of sewage sludge have become important issues due to environmental and economic concerns appels et al 2008 anaerobic digestion ad a biochemical conversion process that can efficiently decompose organic matter om and produce methane rich biogas 60 70 vol of methane ch4 is one of the most technically mature and cost effective processes duan et al 2012 the high solid ad can directly treat dewatered sewage sludge total solid ts content 15 with smaller reactors higher volumetric methane productivity and lower energy demand for heating duan et al 2012 nevertheless although the digestate contains large amounts of n p k and micronutrients the positive effect of the end product of ad as an organic amendment and fertilizer is still under debate nkoa 2014 in most cases the digestate in its basic form may harm the environment and human health because of the undesirable characteristics such as odor viscosity high humidity high content of ammonium volatile fatty acids vfa and salinity the end product stability of anaerobic digestate should be highlighted for further disposal and management the humified fraction of organic matter om is considered to be the most important one responsible for the stability of om as it is the fraction most resistant to microbial degradation bernal et al 2009 in composting organic wastes are reported to biologically convert into relatively stable humic like substances hs for agricultural applications li et al 2017 watteau and villemin 2011 moreover the increase of humic acid like fraction ha result in the stability of om indicating the compost maturity zhang et al 2015 as for ad the vs ts ratio is widely used to reflect microbial decomposition of organic matter and stabilization dong et al 2013 om is decomposed and transformed into stable humic compounds and biogas appels et al 2008 provenzano et al 2016 with their high molecular weight and abundant functional affinity sites around the aromatic structure hs interact with metal ions and organic cations buffer ph and control physicochemical behavior biological availability and even the environmental fate of macro and micronutrients haroun et al 2009 kulikowska et al 2015 plaza et al 2005 ren et al 2016 the cation binding capacity of hs can retain and exchange macro and micronutrients reducing the bioavailability of organic and inorganic pollutants maia et al 2008 plaza et al 2005 the phytotoxicity of the digestate is likely influenced by the progress of humification thus it is necessary to explore the transformation of hs during the high solid ad processes however the formation and transfiguration of hs during the high solid anaerobic digestion process have not been fully understood especially the aromatization and its possible impact on the phytotoxicity of the end product additionally ha is the most important and active component of hs originating from various resources boguta et al 2016 li et al 2014 rodriguez et al 2016 in sewage sludge according to the method of the international humic substances society the extracted hs accounts for 14 6 of total solids ts and 27 0 of organic matter and ha accounts for 90 6 of hs while the remaining portion is the fulvic acid like fraction fa li et al 2014 compared to ha fa features a lower affinity of proton binding and heterogeneity in carboxylic type groups plaza et al 2005 a high ha fa represents successful humification owing to the biodegradation of the fa fraction or the non humic fraction and the polymerization of aromatic structures in ha awasthi et al 2017 to focus on the end product of the sludge this study explores the biotransformation of ha only the phytotoxicity depends on ph ec low weight carboxylic acids heavy metals and phenols suggesting that the digestate phytotoxicity synthetically reflects the status of degraded organic matter deepesh et al 2014 kataki et al 2017 roig et al 2012 and the concentrations of the pollutant the excessive salinity of the digestate has a significant inhibitory effect on the seedling establishment alburquerque et al 2012 kataki et al 2017 tigini et al 2016 excessive salinity in water solute extracts leads to a strong osmotic pressure between plant roots and the growth substrate and causes a significant reduction in water availability to seeds and plants alburquerque et al 2012 el fels et al 2014a in fact microbial immobilization li et al 2016 and the chelating of hs bustamante et al 2012 can decrease the salinity of the sludge moreover metal ions can be controlled by the complexation of aromatic carboxylic and phenolic functional structures in ha during ad for example stronger binding of cu ii ions occurs when ha is characterized by a higher degree of aromaticity and humification while the affinity of zn in humic substances shows that the organic complexes of zn are well correlated with the humic substance content dong et al 2013 in general the aromatic affinity sites of ha on heavy metals in highly anaerobic conditions plays an important role in the transformation of metal ions from exchangeable forms to immobile organic complexations aromatic structures with abundant functional groups should be closely monitored ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbance has been widely used for characterizing humic substances rodriguez et al 2016 the parameter specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 uva254 toc toc total organic carbon is used to characterize the aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 and molecular

investigate the aromatic characterization of ha in high solid anaerobic digestate using elemental analysis uv vis and ftir spectroscopy 2 to analyze the digestate phytotoxicity and its relation to ha transformation 3 and to provide the indicators for further stabilization and reutilization of the high solid anaerobic digestate 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates high solid ad trials and physicochemical analyses dewatered raw sewage sludge rss collected at the dehydration machine room of the quyang wastewater treatment plant in shanghai was used as the substrate for the ad treatment a mesophilic anaerobic digestion reactor with a working volume of 12 l was set up with helix type stirrers at a rate of 60 rpm rotations per minute with 10 min stirring and 2 min break total solids ts

and added to the reactor which was operated in batch mode for 48 d at 35 1 c the samples of anaerobically digested sludge in this study were collected every 8 d marked as ad 8 d ad 16 d ad 24 d and so on additionally the rss was considered as the sample of day 0 operation time in the high solid ad physicochemical properties including ph electrical conductivity ec ts vs ts and gas production were tested the samples of the high solid ad were stored at 20 c before analysis the moisture content was determined by weight loss upon drying at 105 c in an oven for 24 h the vs content was determined by heating the samples at 550 c for 1 h in a muffle furnace the ph and ec of a 1 10 w w suspension were measured using a mettler toledo ph and ec meter switzerland respectively total extractable carbon tec was obtained by mixing 2 g of freeze dried sludge with 100 ml of the solution of 0 1 m na4p2o7 and 0 1 m naoh and shaking for 48 h at 338 k then 25 ml of the supernatant solution fa was acidified to ph 1 using 50 h2so4 tec and total organic carbon of fa fac were determined using a toc vcpn analyzer shimadzu japan humic acid carbon hac was calculated by subtracting fac from tec roletto et al 1985 2 2 extraction of humic substances the freeze dried and sieved samples were used to extract ha according to the method implemented by the international humic substances society 1996 in summary 50 g sample was added to 500 ml 1 mol l 1 hcl after shaking for 1 h and centrifuging for 20 min at 3000 rpm the supernatant was separated then 0 1 mol l 1 naoh redissolved the precipitate with an l s ratio of 10 under n2 atmosphere the solution was shaken for 4 h and the extracted humic substances were separated into ha and fa fractions by acidifying the extract to ph 1 using 6 mol l 1 hcl the supernatant fa and the precipitated fraction ha were separated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min after the redissolution of the ha fraction in 0 1 mol l 1 koh the acidification and centrifugation of the supernatant were repeated the ha precipitate was purified using the 0 1 mol l 1 hcl 0 3 mol l 1 hf solution until the ash content was below 1 followed by dialysis against deionized water using a dialysis membrane viskase md55 characterized by the molecular weight cut off of 3500 finally the extracted ha was freeze dried tf fd 1 freeze dryer china for further analysis 2 3 analysis methods of ha uv254 was measured at 254 nm in 3 0 mg solutions of each ha sample in 10 ml of 0 05 mol l 1 nahco3 with ph adjusted to 8 3 using 0 02 mol l 1 naoh the suva is the ratio of the special uv vis absorbance to toc measured using uv2559 shimadzu japan and toc vcpn analyzer shimadzu japan respectively a mixture of 1 2 mg of freeze dried ha samples and 100 mg of potassium bromide kbr ir grade was pressed into pellets then the pellets were ground to be homogenized and analyzed with a fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet 5700 from 400 to 4000 cm 1 the ftir results were normalized by dividing them by the sum of the absorbance values subsequently normalized ftir absorbance values were translated as 0 001 in order from rss to ad 48 d on y axis showing the main changes in aromatic functional groups at 1000 1800 cm 1 and aliphatic groups at 2820 3000 cm 1 the carbon c hydrogen h and nitrogen n contents of ha were analyzed using a chn coder elementar vario el iii with 5 mg freeze dried ha for each sample the h c and c n molar ratios were calculated to investigate the structural characteristics of organic matter 2 4 phytotoxicity tests two plant species morning glory ipomoea hederacea l mg and sunflower hehanthus annuus l sf were chosen as test objects among the most sensitive plant species recommended by the oecd 1984 except vegetables phytotoxicity tests were conducted according to the national standard of the people s republic of china for sludge disposal from the municipal wastewater treatment gb t 23486 2009 in summary sludge extracts were prepared by shaking 8 g sludge with 24 ml distilled water for 1 h at 160 r min 1 the suspension was centrifuged before being introduced into a polyethylene tube and kept at 4 c twenty seeds were placed on a layer of filter paper in 7 5 cm petri dishes and 5 ml of each sludge extract was added to the petri dishes distilled water was used as the blank control each test was repeated five times and all petri dishes were incubated in the dark at 25 c for 48 h the seed germination index sgi was calculated as follows 1 sgi 100 s g r s a r l s s s g r c a r l s c where sgrs is the seed germination rate sgr in the sludge sample sgrc is the sgr in the control arlss is the average root length of seedlings arls in the sludge and arlsc is the arls in the control to verify the impact of ec on seedlings a univariate test was performed using 0 0125 mol l 1 and four aqueous solutions of nacl with 0 025 mol l 1 concentration gradients 0 025 0 100 mol l 1 ec and sgi of each digestate sample including rss and six digestates samples ad 8 d 48 d were measured commercial ha cha shanghai yuanye bio technology h17j8t28708 was used to test sgi i e the effect of ha on seedlings 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobically digested sludge evolution the ph ec and ts content and the vs ts ratio at different stages of the high solid ad are presented in table 1 during the start up period the vs ts ratio decreased sharply in the first eight days from 64 81 to 47 97 because of the intensive decomposition of biodegradable organic matter by anaerobic microbes the total degradation rate of organic matter reached 62 92 based on vs degradation koch et al 2009 corresponding to a previous study shao et al 2013 the total biogas yield and cumulative biogas produced every four days during ad are shown in fig 1 which is consistent with the results of dong et al 2013 the average biogas yield from the digesters was 527 ml g 1 vsremoval or 410 ml g 1 vsadded the ph value increased in the first 16 d from 7 49 to 8 84 and then it was steady in the range of 8 84 8 89 although a slight decrease occurred in ad 48 d the decrease was possibly caused by the mineralization of proteinaceous groups to yield alkaline ammonia and or to lose volatile acids li et al 2015 2016 the ec first increased from 0 62 ms cm 1 at rss to 3 41 ms cm 1 in ad 24 d and dropped to 2 53 ms cm 1 in ad 48 d the increase in ec may be attributed to the degradation of organic matter and the release of different mineral salts in available forms such as phosphate ammonium and potassium li et al 2011 2015 while the reduction of ec primarily result from the loss of soluble salts by microbial immobilization and or the formation of insoluble salts li et al 2016 and chelating humic substances bustamante et al 2012 3 2 characteristics of ha transformation during high solid ad 3 2 1 changes in aromatization of ha of 48 d high solid ad 1 uv vis analysis fig 2 depicts the variations in uv vis parameters in ha during the high solid ad process after the initial increase in the first eight days decreasing trends in suva254 and suva280 were observed in ad 8 24 d both suva254 and suva280 had the lowest values in ad 24 d 2 407 l mg 1 m 1 and 2 088 l mg 1 m 1 respectively and then they increased to their highest values of 4 071 l mg 1 m 1 and 3 237 l mg 1 m 1 in ad 48 d respectively these results suggest the transformation of aromaticity in ha hs are supramolecular associations characterized by their aromatic origin sutton and sposito 2005 thus in the start up period the relative enhancement of aromaticity can be ascribed to the exposure of inner aromatics under intensive consumption of superficial labile aliphatics as the energy source of microorganisms in ad 8 24 d the exposed aromatic structures in ha were further biodegraded indicating that the original aromatics were not persistent enough however the aromatization degree of ha developed again in the second 24 days and reached a new high level at the end it is possible that the ha core can aggregate new aromatics to form more unsaturated and stable structures during the high solid ad process which is similar to the polymerization repolymerization of aromatics as new humic substances amir et al 2006 maia et al 2008 therefore the reduction of aliphatics and some labile aromatics of original ha may lead to the reconstruction of new aromatic structures and form final humic macromolecules 2 elemental analysis elemental composition and atomic ratios of ha are shown in table 2 and fig 3 respectively nitrogen n decreased from 8 321 rss to 7 146 ad 16 d and then increased to 8 791 ad 48 d with fluctuations around ad 24 d the increase in n after initial consumption in the start up period may result from the presence of n in ha and the condensation of lignin with proteins stevenson 1983 the reduction of h from 8 156 rss to 7 475 ad 48 d was probably caused by the fusion of aliphatic chains with the addition of aromatic groups huang et al 2006 mainly during the second 24 d in the high solid ad the c content slightly increased initially then decreased significantly from 55 555 ad 8 d to 51 220 ad 16 d and recovered during the last 16 d of ad despite the fluctuations in ad 24 d the increase at the beginning may be explained by the reduction of other elements including n and h the significant reduction in the middle was in agreement with the sharp decrease in vs ts caused by the decomposition of organic carbon as the energy resource the final recovery of carbon shows that the products of degradation i e c aromatics c carboxyl and c ester by microbial activity and enzymatic reactions can be the precursors of new humic structures amir et al 2010 although humic acid is considered not biodegradable in most environmental conditions this study detected an intermediate drop in the aromatization degree and the reduction of c h and n in ha these results suggest that besides labile sugars proteins amino acids fatty acids and aromatics can also be consumed by anaerobic microorganisms as c sources provenzano et al 2014 2016 the molar ratio of h c in ha decreased at first and then increased from ad 8 d to 24 d following the sequential loss from 1 818 ad 24 d to 1 624 ad 48 d the first decrease in h c was attributed to reduced h and relatively enhanced c caused by the fusion of aliphatic chains and exposure of aromatics the increased h c was caused by the intermediate decline of the aromaticity degree confirming the consumption of c aromatics in the second 24 d of the high solid ad the rapid decrease of h c in ha was similar to the enhanced maturity progress of humic substances in the compost indicating the increased degree of aromatic condensation garcia et al 1989 the molar ratio of c n increased from 7 606 rss to 8 362 ad 16 d and then sharply reduced to 7 299 ad 40 d although the eventual c n was 7 331 the initial high c n in ha suggests that n mineralizes more rapidly than c the final decreasing c n with the increasing c content demonstrates its stronger repolymerization effect on n because the lower level of c n is associated with the higher degree of mineralization of the alkyl carbon branch and the incorporation of protein decomposition products during the humification process zhang et al 2015 3 ftir spectroscopy analyses the spectra of all ha samples feature peaks around 1600 1680 cm 1 of moderate and strong intensity owing to the overlapping signature absorption originated from aromatic c c vibrations of alkenes stretching c o of amide i o c o of ester and carboxyl and c o of ketones and quinone groups amir et al 2010 chai et al 2007 el fels et al 2014b the intensity of the peaks at 1627 cm 1 and 1655 cm 1 reduced during the first 24 d because of the consumption of liable aromatic structures in ha nevertheless in ad 32 48 d more peaks strengthened at 1636 cm 1 1646 cm 1 1662 cm 1 and 1670 cm 1 unmarked in fig 4 suggesting that the aromatic structures in ha can be rebuilt with new materials and groups maybe released from lignin derived aromatics el fels et al 2014a kataeva et al 2013 besides the peak at 1711 cm 1 rss disappeared but then shifted to 1716 cm 1 in the last eight days of the high solid ad the peak at 1716 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of c c acids ketones and carboxyl groups gonzález pérez et al 2004 the sharp shoulder peaks in 1630 1680 cm 1 1517 1559 cm 1 and 1435 1456 cm 1 supported the repolymerization of aromatics during the second 24 days of high solid ad especially in ad 40 48 d for instance the intensities of the bands at 1517 cm 1 1521 cm 1 and 1435 cm 1 unsaturated and aromatic c c increased furthermore strong absorption was observed at 1540 cm 1 amide ii or aromatic c c 1230 1220 cm 1 amide iii or aromatic ethers c o c rodríguez et al 2016 1079 1072 cm 1 and 1032 cm 1 aromatic ethers c o c of carbohydrates or si o c groups the intensities of these peaks at 2852 cm 1 2923 cm 1 and 2958 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetric methylene stretching in long chain aliphatic molecules decreased because of the biotransformation of complex molecules into simpler forms by mineralization in addition a slight increase at 1456 cm 1 oh of phenols coo ch3 and amide ii occurred from ad 32 d to 48 d el fels et al 2014b reported that the aromaticity and the polymerization degree of ha increased after the consumption of total lipids and aliphatic compounds in co composting suggesting that the repolymerization can take place with the aromatic derivatives of neo humic substances by microbial metabolism hence the repolymerization of ha structures with aromatic electron rich sites can occur during the high solid ad three main routes of aromatic repolymerization of ha are as follows a decomposition of aliphatic c contributes to the progressive transformation of polysaccharides to other oxygenated compounds amir et al 2010 particularly carboxylic and ester groups b the novel stabilized ha structure may be originated from aromatic c c or the lignin derived aromatics amir et al 2006 zheng et al 2014 c the biodegradation of fa fraction or non humic substances is capable of polymerizing the aromatic structures of ha awasthi et al 2017 therefore the aromatic absorbance that initially declined and later increased in ha can be identified as repolymerization during the high solid ad also supported by the results of uv vis elemental and ftir analyses the lysis and active destruction of aliphatics and aromatics can be regarded as a preparation for repolymerization of new ha structures this result is consistent with the reduction in hac during the first 24 d and the slower reduction between days 24 and 48 overall the observations of ha repolymerization of the 48 d high solid ad are similar to the humification of composting in which a net production of aromatic compounds as well as the partial formation of neo humic polymers such as polysaccharides occurred amir et al 2010 el fels et al 2014a 2014b 3 2 2 characteristics of ha transformation of high solid ad compared to low solid ad few studies reported there is aromatic repolymerization of ha in low solid ad process as reported by kataki et al 2017 the 30 45 d low solid ad ts 7 31 g kg 1 0 7 3 1 25 6 3 6 c with three types of input biomass cow manure ipomoea carnea and rice straw is expected to increase in maturity or stability by the longer hydraulic retention time however during a low solid ad ts 1 2 35 1 c that lasted about 90 d shao et al 2013 the dissolved organic matter dom of the digestate was gradually humified the humification index was low in the first 18 d and then it increased and stabilized after 40 d of digestion it is similar to the repolymerization of ha during the high solid ad in this experiment the proportion of organic matter except protein and polysaccharide decreased initially and then the refractory soluble microbial products increased to dominate dom however with only 48 d under high solid anaerobic conditions the organic carbon content of ha reached 17 9 table 1 which was equal to 74 3 of ha fractionation at the end of the 94 d low solid ad 24 1 shao et al 2013 besides according to du and li 2017 there were no significant peaks of ha in the low solid ad ts 1 2 20 c although the value of the fluorescence intensity on day 61 was slightly stronger than on day 31 with higher organic loading rates abundant substrate prevents the nutrient imbalance for ad microbes as a result compared to the long term low solid ad high solid ad may have a higher humification potential and accelerate the humification progress 3 3 relationship between phytotoxicity and humification during the 48 d high solid ad 3 3 1 phytotoxicity and correlated salinity of digestate changes the phytotoxicity of the digestate reflected by sgi on sunflower and morning glory is shown in fig 5 a the sgi of sunflower sf sgi decreased from 29 rss to 5 ad 24 d but increased again during the second 24 days with the endpoint of 16 ad 48 d while the sgi of morning glory mg sgi decreased in the first 24 d by 2 and then it increased from 0 ad 24 d and 32 d to 7 ad 48 d soaking seeds in the water extract of the digestate demonstrates that the salinity is the direct contributor to the damage of the plasma membrane of the seeds because of salt stress guo and yu 2012 fig 5 c illustrates the ec levels of the water extract of the digestate 1 3 w w the ec increased by 3 7 times with the highest value of 8 79 ms cm 1 in ad 24 d and reduced to 6 89 ms cm 1 in ad 48 d this is almost opposite to the changes in sgi which are in agreement with the results in table 1 in accordance with results of kataki et al 2017 the changes in ec correlate negatively with sgi on sf slope 0 12 r sq 0 9363 and mg slope 0 07 r sq 0 7105 fig 5 d indicating that excessive ec causes a significant inhibitory effect on seed germination dong et al 2013 reported increasing ammonia from 4363 7 mg l 1 to 5828 4 mg l 1 during the 33 d high solid ts 22 3 w w ad in batch mode at 35 1 c this is not consistent with the sgi rebound in our experiment as for volatile fatty acid vfa concentration it increased to 8333 582 mg l 1 in ad 6 d and decreased to 1029 145 mg l 1 until the end of ad dong et al 2013 according to brinton 1998 volatile organic acids voa in plant growth media as low as 300 500 ppm could be phytotoxic on plant seedling the changes of vfa are not in accordance with the sgi rebound in ad 24 d either and this result agrees some phytotoxic components remain after high solid ad so far excessive ec level is the most important component of phytotoxicity on plant seedling and shows the most sensitivity with ha repolymerization 3 3 2 phytotoxicity changes and correlated ha transformation of digestate five aqueous solutions of cha with 10 mg ml 1 concentration gradients 10 50 mg ml 1 were tested in supplemented media fig 5 b cha at 10 mg ml 1 had a high sf sgi 111 and cha at 50 mg ml 1 had the highest sf sgi at 153 a significant positive correlation between cha and sf sgi was detected r2 0 8146 the relatively poor mg sgi value showed a similar trend although it increased slowly mg sgi at 101 in 50 mg ml 1 of cha mg sgi showed a stronger correlation with cha concentrations r2 0 8696 these results show that ha is effective from root to shoot and acts as a rooting stimulator elmongy et al 2018 nevertheless sf sgi and mg sgi were still less than 17 despite a large amount of humic acid carbon during the high solid ad table 1 moreover the decreasing humic acid carbon levels cannot explain the improvement in sgi during ad 24 48 d therefore only monitoring the amount of ha is meaningless without a structural or a characteristics analysis this implies that the changes in the aromaticity degree of ha might explain the digestate phytotoxicity variations as for the impact of the aromaticity degree of ha on sgi fig 6 shows the relevant data in three dimensional graphs combined with phytotoxicity indicators sf sgi mg sgi on the z axis and the aromaticity variables of ha in terms of uv vis parameters suva254 and suva280 elemental indicators h c c n and the normalized ftir absorbance at 1230 cm 1 and 1627 cm 1 on the projection of the plane x and y axes the curves in three dimensional graphs show the strong affinity between aromatization of ha and sludge phytotoxicity the plots have similar turning points in ad 24 d marked with the lowest aromatization degree and severe phytotoxicity 5 of sf sgi 0 of mg sgi after 24 d high solid ad the aromatization degree of ha firms up along with the acutely recovered phytotoxicity of the digestate supported by fig 6 e and f the changes in the normalized absorbance of specific aromatic structures in ha correlate with the reduction and late enrichment of germination and root shooting the projection of ftir absorbance reveals aromatic ethers c o c or amide iii 1230 cm 1 and aromatic c c c o in carboxyl and quinone groups 1627 cm 1 therefore the decrease and late improvement of sgi on sf and mg in ad 24 d can be ascribed to the decline and repolymerization of aromatics in ha during the high solid ad the results of the regression analysis between representative aromatic parameters suva254 suva280 h c specific ftir absorbance and phytotoxicity indicators sf sgi mg sgi are presented in table 3 both sf sgi r2 0 7217 and 0 6568 and mg sgi r2 0 6192 and 0 7501 correlated positively with suva254 and suva280 respectively the h c ratio and mg sgi were characterized by a significant negative correlation r2 0 9554 while a relatively weak relationship with sf sgi r2 0 4536 was observed in addition positive correlations of normalized ftir specific aromatic absorbance at 1627 cm 1 and 1230 cm 1 with mg sgi were stronger than those with sf sgi which might have resulted from the differences in the sensitivity of plant species the characterization of some indicators may also have played a role for example the ftir absorbance changed slowly with the operating time of digestion and mg sgi fluctuated within a limited range the spectrographic and chemical characteristics of ha show that the aromaticity of has in the second 24 d of high solid ad has higher abundance of aromatic electron rich sites and that π π electron transitions can contribute to the complexation of heavy metals and or contaminated organic matter kulikowska et al 2015 plaza et al 2005 xiong et al 2013 increasing the acute ecotoxicity of the digestate through the changes in ec the ec enhancement in the first 24 d is linked to not only the mineralization of organically bound nutrients kataki et al 2017 but also the break of some liable aromatic complexes with soluble salts and or metal ions the ec declined when aromatic ha structures were reconstructed ad 24 48 d suggesting the effect of the immobilization of aromatics in ha boguta et al 2016 bustamante et al 2012 dong et al 2013 kulikowska et al 2015 maia et al 2008 especially an extremely low degree of aromatization in ha accompanied with the highest level of ec in ad 24 d resulted in the lowest sgi during the whole high solid ad process ha is able to absorb pesticides phthalates and pcbs maia et al 2008 plaza et al 2005 thus besides salinity other phytotoxic components can also be removed by the reconstructed aromatic sites the repolymerization of aromatics in ha leads to a larger reduction in phytotoxicity than relatively liable aromatics in general the condensation and repolymerization of aromatics in ha play an important role in the immobilization of free metal ions by controlling ec and directly improving the sgi of the digestate extracts 3 3 3 stabilization assessment of high solid ad based on phytotoxicity and ha transformation a greater degree of humification is ascribed to more complex and condensed aromatic structures and or more conjugation in aliphatic chains which are resistant to degradation he et al 2011 as synthesized indicators the aromatic repolymerization of ha and phytotoxicity changes contribute to the further understanding of digestate stabilization according to shao et al 2013 there are two main pathways for humification of organic matter 1 degradation and accumulation of recalcitrant material and 2 oxidation and polyphenolic condensation therefore during the ad process initially the intense mineralization is supposed to extract aromatic recalcitrant material from liable non aromatic or aromatic organic material second the net production of aromatic neo humic polymers determines the end product bioaccessibility and the distribution of organic and or inorganic phytotoxic compounds actually the significant phytotoxicity still existed associated with the highest sgi only 17 of sf sgi and 7 of mg sgi zucconi et al 1981 considering the reasons of remaining phytotoxicity on the one hand the ec of digestate extracts for testing sgi in ad 48 d 6 89 ms cm 1 was still belong to the high range of 3 4 9 3 ms cm 1 reported by kataki et al 2017 the findings above however the ha repolymerization is in accordance with little vs ts decrease and the 21 62 ec reduction in ad 24 48 d indicating the organic matrix has become stabilized and the phytotoxic components would not increase again therefore the remaining phytotoxic component especially excessive salinity need further immobilization ascribed to ha aromatics or other treatments on the other hand compared with the low solid anaerobic digestion the high solid anaerobic digestion shows higher efficiency on ha repolymerization mainly reflecting on final hac toc level it seems that the humification process can be accelerate during high solid anaerobic conditions which provides abundant substrate and more intense activity of anaerobic microbes therefore in order to enhance aromatic repolymerization and control digestate phytotoxicity both preventing nutrient imbalance and the improvement of cooperative efficiency of anaerobic microbes are necessary moreover the accumulation of recalcitrant material especially some microbial derivative such as the neo aromatics is difficult to finish without thorough degradation of anaerobic microbes in general aromatic repolymerization of ha provides to a new understanding of high solid ad for stabilization treatment besides unfinished ha repolymerization and accumulation suggests the inadequate phytotoxicity reduction further creating a demand for further humification and stabilization studies 4 conclusions the conclusions of this research are follows 1 during the 48 d high solid ad aromatic structures of ha underwent repolymerization after a break and consumption during the second 24 d as evidenced by increasing suva280 and suva254 values strengthened ftir absorbance of aromatics and decreasing h c and c n ratios 2 the enhanced aromatization degree of ha correlated strongly with the digestate salinity rebound and the improvement of sgi therefore aromatic repolymerization may be the internal force that controls phytotoxicity by reducing the direct inhibitory effect of excessive digestate salinity 3 aromatic repolymerization of ha is consistent with little changes in vs ts during the second 24 days of high solid ad therefore the organic matrix has become stabilized and the phytotoxic components would not increase again which are evidenced by 21 62 ec reduction and the improvement of sgi on sf and mg further aromatic repolymerization of ha can act as an important indicator of the stabilization of organic matter and plays the influential role on digestate phytotoxicity reduction 4 compared to the long term low solid ad the 48 d high solid ad achieved more significant aromatic repolymerization of ha although it needs further humification intensification and digestate stabilization to overcome inadequate phytotoxicity reduction

19442,the secondary sedimentation tank sst is a sensitive and complicated process in an activated sludge process due to the importance of its performance computational fluid dynamics cfd methods have been employed to study the underflow hydrodynamics and solids distribution unlike most of the previous numerical studies in the present investigation the performance of three different types of turbulence models standard k ε rng k ε and realizable k ε are evaluated firstly two dimensional axisymmetric cfd models of two circular ssts are validated with the field observations next comprehensive comparisons are presented of the model predictions of the key physical quantities such as the concentration of effluent suspended solids ess and returned activated sludge ras sludge blanket height sbh turbulent properties and flow and concentration patterns a surprising result shows that the prediction of the ess concentration is not sensitive to the change of turbulence models while remarkable prediction difference can be observed in the inlet zone and near field of sludge hopper and sbh the results suggest that more observations inside the inlet zone are needed to achieve better model calibration and correct application of the turbulence model which can be crucial to optimizing the geometry of inlet structure and sludge hopper as well as changing return solids

rate 1 introduction gravity sedimentation is one of the most commonly used treatment methods for removal of suspended solids ss in water or wastewater treatment plants in addition the cost for building the sedimentation tank is about 30 of the total investment of a treatment plant tamayol et al 2008 for conventional wastewater treatment plants sedimentation tanks are mainly divided into two categories primary and secondary sedimentation tanks sst primary sedimentation tanks have a low influent ss concentration therefore buoyancy effects are usually negligible however ssts are used to remove and concentrate and recycle biosolids and have much higher influent ss concentrations tamayol et al 2008 therefore flow currents can be density driven and affect the performance of ssts ekama and marais 2002 stated that ssts are the bottle neck limiting the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant the placement of the two types of the sedimentation tanks is shown in fig 1 previously ssts were designed only using empirical equations which were based on hydraulic criteria such as surface overflow rate sor parker 1983 parker and stenquist 1986 parker et al 1996 other influential factors such as 1 tank internal geometry 2 solids characteristics 3 atmospheric conditions including wind movement and temperature were not considered krebs 1995 stamou et al 2009 thickening capability was often correlated to the sludge volume index svi but is now usually based upon state point analysis wahlberg and keinath 1988 one dimensional 1 d models were developed to estimate solids loading rate and have evolved from conceptual models kynch 1952 to numerical models the model can solve problems such as the returned activated sludge ras concentration the sludge blanket height sbh and solids inventory management kynch 1952 takács et al 1991 li and stenstrom 2014 although 1 d models are useful in evaluating loads they cannot include non ideal effects such as flow currents and poor geometries to improve the predicative capability of 1 d models and consider non ideal conditions cfd models have been developed over the last 40 years and have improved our knowledge of sedimentation tanks larsen 1977 zhou and mccorquodale 1992a 1992b 1992c de clercq 2003 griborio 2004 ramin et al 2014 the development and the applications of the cfd model of ssts depend on the following four parts 1 improving the understanding of ssts by relaxing assumptions for ideal behavior by including physical problems such as the impacts of turbulence and density currents larsen 1977 adams and rodi 1990 zhou et al 1992 wells and laliberte 1998 jayanti and narayanan 2004 2 selecting a mathematical structure for the turbulence and buoyant flow modeling components to more accurately conform to the physical mechanisms adams and rodi 1990 bretscher et al 1992 vitasovic et al 1997 lakehal et al 1999 griborio 2004 3 optimizing the solution to more quickly and accurately solve the differencing equations imam and mccorquodale 1983 imam et al 1983 abdel gawad and mccorquodale 1984a 1985 4 improving computational speed of computers larsen 1977 was among the first to address the physical problems of ssts and is considered the pioneer in the cfd study of ssts setting the framework for the future sedimentation tank research in his work the prandtl mixing length theory was applied to solve the eddy viscosity and was also used in abdel gawad and mccorquodale 1984a 1984b the complexity of solving the resulting partial differential equations was reduced with several key assumptions constant eddy viscosity was assumed in several early studies imam et al 1983 krebs 1991 krebs et al 1992 1995 however since eddy viscosity depends on the state of turbulence in the ssts the value of the eddy viscosity should vary from case to case as well as in different parts of the ssts the constant eddy viscosity assumption limited to the accuracy of the models additionally both the mixing length theory model and constant eddy viscosity assumption imply that the turbulence is dissipated where it is generated which cannot be used to accurately describe the transport of turbulence in the flow field griborio 2004 therefore a more advanced turbulence model standard k ε model which is based on the transport of turbulent kinetic energy tke and the turbulent dissipation rate tdr was used to improve many of the previously developed sst models in the last 30 years the standard k ε model ske has become the most widely applied turbulence model in the cfd of ssts because of its robustness economy and reasonable accuracy for the prediction of turbulent flow in ssts stamou et al 1989 zhou and mccorquodale 1992b 1992c 1992a vitasovic et al 1997 lakehal et al 1999 armbruster et al 2001 kleine and reddy 2005 weiss et al 2007 tamayol et al 2009 gong et al 2011 patziger et al 2012 xanthos et al 2013 ramin et al 2014 in the previous studies with circular sedimentation tank few of velocity and concentration calibrations were reported inside the inlet zone where the reynolds number can be very high turbulent flow moreover the ske model is valid only for fully turbulent flow and performs poorly for complex flows involving strong streamline curvature das et al 2016 fluent 2017 therefore two modified versions of the ske model rng k ε and realizable k ε models have been applied in recent sedimentation tank studies laine et al 1999 tamayol et al 2008 tarpagkou and pantokratoras 2013 patziger and kiss 2015 das et al 2016 however in these studies the rng k ε model was applied in the studies of sedimentation tanks either in potable water treatment or primary sedimentation tanks in wastewater treatment where the buoyancy effect can be ignored in the flow field to the best of our knowledge none of the published ssts papers simulated the density stratified flow with the application of rng k ε model only das et al 2016 has applied the realizable k ε model to simulate the turbulent flow in their complex three dimensional 3d model but they had no field observations to show the reliability and superiority of the realizable k ε model therefore because of 1 the limitation of the widely applied ske model 2 the superior of the rng and realizable k ε models in predicting the turbulence flow involving strong streamline curvature and 3 the recent applications of the rng and realizable k ε models in the related cfd study areas these three models are selected to compare their prediction performance in two different ssts in this paper the influences of the ske rng k ε and realizable k ε models on the performance of a circular sst are compared using data from the witney wastewater treatment plant wwtp from burt 2010 and the darvill wwtp from griborio 2004 firstly the computational meshes with different number of cells are applied to ensure the solutions are mesh independent next the witney sst simulation results are compared to the measured velocity and concentration profiles the comparisons show reasonable agreement on the scale of the entire sst for darvill only the effluent suspended solids ess concentration and ras concentrations are available but they also agree well with the simulations next the validated models are used with the three different turbulence models to compare the prediction of the hydrodynamics such as velocity and concentration patterns especially in the inlet zone and in the near field zone of the sludge hopper where significant differences are observed among the three models additionally the predictions of the maximum loading rate by these turbulence models are compared for the witney sst 2 methods 2 1 the mathematical model 2 1 1 general information since the dominant hydrodynamics processes of circular ssts take place in the radial direction it can reasonably be simplified to a 2 d axisymmetric approach zhou and mccorquodale 1992b vitasovic et al 1997 lakehal et al 1999 griborio 2004 tamayol et al 2009 patziger et al 2012 patziger and kiss 2015 patziger 2016 gao and stenstrom 2017 2 1 2 governing equations the equations describing 2 d steady turbulent and density stratified flow

averaged navier stokes equations tke can be calculated based on the turbulence closure method in this study three types of turbulence closure approaches ske rng k ε and realizable k ε models are applied and compared the major differences in these models are 1 the turbulent schmidt numbers governing the turbulent diffusion of tke and tdr 2 the source term in the ε and 3 the method of calculating turbulence fluent 2017 the standard k ε model is a semi empirical model based on the transport equations for the tke k and tdr ε rodi 1980 it is assumes that the flow is fully turbulent and the effect of molecular viscosity is negligible tamayol et al 2008 the tke and tdr are calculated from the following transport equations 10 u k r v k y r ϑ ϑ t σ k k r y ϑ ϑ t σ k k y g k g b ρ ε

empirical constants are given the standard values suggested by rodi 1993 c μ 0 09 c 1 1 44 c 2 1 92 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 3 the value of the empirical constant c 3 related to the buoyancy source term g b depends on the flow situation lakehal et al 1999 different researches applied different c 3 values in their specific cases lyn et al 1992 dahl et al 1994 lakehal et al 1999 gong et al 2011 ramin et al 2014 rodi 1993 suggested that c 3 is in the range of 0 8 1 0 for stable stratification that prevails in ssts and tends toward zero for unstable stratification the rng k ε model is derived using a statistical technique called the renormalization group rng theory the analytical derivation results in a model with constants different from those in the ske model and additional terms and functions in the transport equations for tke and tdr the rng k ε model has a similar form to the ske model 15 u k r v k y r α k μ e f f k r y α k μ e f f k y g k g b ρ ε and 16 u ε r v ε y r α ε μ e f f ε r y α

the effects of rapid strain and streamline curvature than the ske model and may have a superior performance in the simulation of sedimentation tank model with a complex inlet geometry the definition of the r ε and its effects on the prediction of the tdr are illustrated in the ansys fluent theory guide equations 4 48 to 4 50 fluent 2017 the dimensionless model constants are c 1 1 42 c 2 1 68 another modified k ε model is the realizable k ε model it involves a modified transport equation for the tdr which has been derived from an exact equation for the transport of the mean square vorticity fluctuation compared with ske realizable k ε model gives a much more accurate prediction of reynolds stresses for flow with rotation and recirculation das et al 2016 the modeled transport equations for tke and tdr in the realizable k ε model are 18 u k r v k y r ϑ ϑ t σ k k r y ϑ ϑ t σ k k y g k g b ρ ε and 19 u ε r v ε y r ϑ ϑ t σ ε ε r y ϑ ϑ t σ ε ε y c 1 ε k c 3 g b ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2

rotation rates the angular velocity of the system rotation and the turbulent fields 2 1 3 boundary conditions velocity inlet boundary condition is applied to inlet and sludge bottom boundaries which assumes a uniform distribution of all the dependent variables at the boundary face for the surface outlet a pressure outlet boundary condition is applied which assumes a uniform pressure and zero gradient for all transport variables instead of estimating the tke and tdr turbulent intensity and hydraulic diameter are used as the turbulence specification method on the inlet and outlet boundaries for the free ambient water surface the rigid lid approximation for all velocity components with full slip shear condition is assumed wang et al 2008 tarpagkou and pantokratoras 2013 and the free surface boundary is treated as a symmetry condition the solid boundaries are specified as stationary walls with a no slip shear condition and standard wall function is used with the turbulence models 2 1 4 solution procedure the governing equations are numerically solved by the commercial cfd code ansys fluent v 17 2 a first order upwind method is used for interpolation of variables to cell faces for the convective terms whereas diffusive terms are discretized using second order central differencing pressure velocity coupling is achieved using the simple method the solution procedures which are accomplished in meshes with different grid numbers can be summarized in the following steps 1 the flow filed with pure water is firstly solved in the absence of turbulence convergence is reached when normalized residuals are less than 10 4 2 the converged solution is interpolated into the pure water flow field coupled with ske model to calculate the steady state turbulence flow field none of the buoyancy damping terms to the tke and tdr are included convergence is reached when normalized residuals are less than 10 4 3 the solids transport equation defined in the user define scalar is coupled to the model 4 the buoyancy damping term g b is included to the tke equation to describe the turbulent and density stratified flow 5 the buoyancy damping term g b associated with c3 is added to the tdr equation to complete the procedure in the steps 3 to 5 convergence is achieved when the following three criteria are all achieved 1 normalized residuals are less than 10 3 or the solution no longer changes with subsequent iterations 2 the net flux imbalance is less than 1 of the smallest flux through the domain boundary 3 other monitored key physical quantities no longer change with subsequent iterations the velocity profiles as a function of depth for witney and darvill ssts are calculated from meshes with different grid numbers at three radial locations and are shown in the supplementary material figs s1 and s2 respectively after achieving grid independence tests the second order upwind method is used to calculate a more accurate solution for the final step described in the previous solution procedures 2 2 geometry and meshing the geometries and meshes are generated using ansys meshing v 17 2 the general geometry of the witney sst with the computational mesh fine mesh that is used in the simulations after achieving grid independent test consists of 428 000 cells in order to ensure that the solution is mesh independent three additional meshes are used one coarse consisting of 123 096 cells a medium one consisting of 225 284 cells and a finer one consisting of 901 136 cells fig s1 shows that the difference between the prediction of the coarse mesh to other three finer medium fine and finer meshes is significant but the difference among the prediction of the three finer meshes is negligible therefore the solution from the mesh of 428 000 cells is considered mesh independent the general geometry of the darvill sst with the computational mesh that is used in the simulations after achieving grid independent test consists of 218 700 cells in order to ensure that the solution is mesh independent two additional finer meshes are used one consisting of 389 428 cells and another one consisting of 874 800 cells fig s2 shows that the difference among the prediction of these three meshes is negligible therefore the solution from the mesh of 218 700 cells is considered mesh independent and has the benefit of increased computational speed the general geometry of the witney and darvill ssts are displayed in figs 2 and 3 respectively since the outlet is extremely small compared with inlet the grids near the outlet zone are enlarged to show the outlet boundary condition clearly the dimensions of the witney and darvill ssts are shown in table 2 2 3 model verification since only the measurements of the velocity and concentration profiles for the witney sst are available in burt 2010 they are used to compare the model predictions for the witney sst the comparisons of the velocity and concentration profiles along the sst radial direction between the model predictions and the field measurements are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively however the predictions of darvill sst are compared with the observed performance indicators such as ess and ras concentrations of three tests in ekama and marais 2002 and griborio 2004 the investigated loading conditions for witney and darvill ssts are shown in table 1 figs 4 and 5 show the velocity and concentration profiles comparison along the radial direction of witney sst between the model predictions and the field measurements respectively in fig 4 the overall stream curvatures outside of the stilling well are reasonably predicted but less well predicted inside the stilling well fig 5 indicates that the predictions of the bed transition 0 85 g l contour followed by burt 2010 agree reasonably well with the measurements but sludge blanket concentration is less well predicted 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance indicators comparisons among the predictions of the performance indicators by the different turbulence models and the field data in darvill and witney ssts are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively figs 6 and 7 show that the predictions of ess by the three models are quite similar all the models show fair agreement with the field data of the darvill sst and show good agreement with the field data of the witney sst for the ras concentration fig 6 shows that all the turbulence models give a similar prediction of ras concentration and show reasonable agreement with the field data in tests 2 and 3 however in the test 1 realizable k ε model gives a 10 higher of ras concentration prediction than the ske model additionally the difference among the prediction of ras concentration for the witney sst is also significant as shown in fig 7 the predictions of sbh by the three turbulence models for the darvill sst are also varied the largest prediction difference is shown in test 3 where the realizable k ε produces a 14 1 lower sbh than the prediction by ske the predicted ras concentration in the local area of inlet zone as shown in figs 6 and 7 and the sbh in fig 6 show remarkable disagreement indicating that the influence of turbulence is important 3 2 velocity and concentration contours for darvill sst fig 8 a c presents the predictions of the velocity magnitude vectors in the inlet zone and concentration contours by the ske a rng k ε b and realizable k ε c models for the test 1 of darvill sst respectively it shows that the predicted turbulent flow contours by the ske and rng k ε models are similar both models show the influent flows into the center well immediately turns sharply downward without impinging the baffle and then changes its direction towards the baffle in the near field zone above the sludge hopper and finally flows as a horizontal jet from the bottom lip of the baffle outside the inlet zone additionally both ske a and rng k ε b models predict the formation of a small eddy below the inlet port and a large eddy between the downward jet and baffle from the surface to the turning point of jet at the bottom however the flow contour predicted by realizable k ε inside the inlet zone is totally different from the simulation result using ske and rng k ε turbulence models the realizable k ε model predicts that the horizontal inflow jet impinges on the center of the baffle and is then forced in the opposite direction before reversing directions to form a horizontal jet from the lip of the baffle outside the inlet zone additionally realizable k ε c predicts a larger eddy below the inlet port and a compressed eddy in the triangulated area bounded by the surface baffle and downward jet moreover the region of the high downward flow shown as red in fig 8a and b predicted by the realizable k ε is much smaller than the region predicted by the other two models the prediction of the magnitude and the location of the peak velocity is also different results of the realizable k ε also show that the location of the peak velocity 0 131 m s is at the inlet port while both ske 0 149 m s and rng k ε 0 183 m s models predict it is at the center of the core of the high downward flow fig 9 presents the quantitative comparisons of the velocity magnitude of the three models inside and outside the inlet zone for test 1 of darvill sst consistent with the qualitatively comparisons in fig 8 ske and rng k ε models have similar velocity magnitude distribution from the surface to bottom although the peak velocity prediction and the vertical position of the peak velocity have some small differences however large disagreement of the velocity magnitude distribution can be found between realizable k ε and ske rng k ε in the inlet zone outside of the inlet zone the difference reduces gradually along the radial direction as the energy is dissipated the flow contours predicted by the ske and rng k ε models are similar which creates similar concentration profiles in both cases the concentrations in inlet outlet main settling and bottom sludge zones and the sbh are all similar however the velocity and concentration predictions of ske and rng k ε models of the sludge in the near field zone of the sludge hopper are quite different than predicted by the realizable k ε model the differences in concentrations predicted by the realizable k ε are caused by the high downward velocities inside the center well as shown in fig 8c the magnitude and pattern of the velocities near the middle of the center well are quite different the downward velocity predicted by the realizable k ε model at r 1 0 m is lower and does not closely approach the sludge hopper as observed in the ske and rng k ε results fig 8 shows that the concentration above the sludge hopper ranges from 4 to 11 g l green to red for the ske and rng k ε model results while the realizable k ε predictions for concentrations in this area range from 8 to 11 g l yellow orange to red the realizable k ε model results show a similarity of the overall concentration contour within the sst but produces a more homogeneous highly concentrated sludge blanket in the near field zone of the sludge hopper and a shallower sludge blanket fig 8c as compared to the ske and rng k ε results this is because the high downward flow predicted by ske and rng k ε in the inlet zone swirls up the settled sludge which results in drifting of the settled sludge particles and insufficient transport towards sludge hopper patziger et al 2016 therefore elevating the entire sludge blanket 3 3 velocity contour for witney sst fig 10 indicates that these three turbulence models predict the similar flow contour on the scale of the entire witney sst therefore the similar concentration contour all the models predict that the inflow turns sharply downward as a density current without reaching the stilling well however the ske model predicts a 15 8 longer length of the bottom horizontal jet flow than the prediction of the rng and realizable k ε models which indicates the ske model predicts a stronger horizontal jet than the prediction of the rng and realizable k ε models also fig 4b e shows the prediction of the bottom horizontal jet by ske model is deeper and closer to the sludge blanket surface since the strong and deep horizontal flow jet can easily drift and swirl up the settled sludge patziger 2016 the ske model predicts a higher ess than the prediction of the rng and realizable k ε models shown in fig 7a as the increase of the influent rate the ske model may predict the failure of sst when the rng and realizable k ε models still predict the well operated sst 3 4 cfd stress tests for the witney sst 3 4 1 predictions of the flow capacity in order to compare the prediction of the witney sst capacity by these turbulence models stress tests are simulated by increasing the influent rate the failure of the sst is accepted as ess 30 mg l mlss and ras ratio keep constant fig 11 shows the prediction of the ess under the original influent rate and the limiting influent rate by these turbulence models the limiting influent rate or the maximum loading rate predicted by the ske model is 6120 m3 d surface overflow rate sor 0 464 m h when ess reaches 30 mg l while the predictions of the limiting influent rates are 6630 sor 0 502 m h and 8026 m3 d sor 0 608 m h respectively by the rng and realizable k ε models the limiting influent rates predicted by the rng and realizable k ε models are about 8 and 31 higher than predicted by the ske model respectively this indicates that the turbulence model selection strongly influences the prediction of the witney sst s flow capacity 3 4 2 comparison of the predicted velocity contours under the maximum loading rate fig 12 shows the prediction of the velocity contours by these turbulence models when their prediction of the ess reaches 30 mg l the rng model does not predict the downward density current that the other two models predict as shown in fig 10 at lower loading rates simulations with all three models predict similar flow contours in fig 12 the ske and realizable k ε models similarly predict the density currents from the inlet without reaching the stilling well while the rng model predicts a strong horizontal jet impinging on the baffle based on the similarity and difference predicted by these turbulence models under the original and maximum loading rates especially in the inlet zone table 3 shows a diagnostic approach to select the most accurate turbulence model the same symbol in a column indicates that the predictions of the turbulence models are similar the first column indicates that the predictions of the velocity and concentration fields by these turbulence models are all similar under the original loading rate and one cannot decide the most accurate turbulence model next the second column shows that the predictions of the flow capacity by the ske model are significantly different from the rng and realizable k ε models if the experimental data show the actual maximum flow capacity is close to the prediction of the ske model the ske model is the optimal turbulence model otherwise the velocity and concentration profiles under the maximum loading rate especially in the inlet zone need to be measured to select the optimal model from the rng and realizable k ε models 4 conclusions in this paper a fluent based 2d axisymmetric numerical model is used to analyze the hydrodynamics and turbulent flow such as flow and concentration patterns of two different ssts the previous numerical studies did not study the effect of different turbulent models on the turbulent flow and concentration pattern in the inlet zone where they can have major impacts in the present work numerical simulations with three advanced turbulent models ske rng k ε and realizable k ε are performed on two different ssts to study the influence of turbulent models on the flow and concentration patterns and operation parameters such as ess ras concentration and sbh also the predictions of the sst capacity are compared using the three turbulence models for the case studied by various turbulence models the following conclusions are made turbulence model selection can have a strong influence on the prediction of hydrodynamics of an sst such as flow and concentration patterns the difference is remarkable inside the inlet zone where the high flow energy is dissipated resulting in high turbulence the remarkable different predictions of the hydrodynamics inside the inlet zone cause significant differences more than 10 in predicting ras concentration and sbh which can greatly influence the operation of sludge return concentration turbulence model selection also can have a strong influence on the prediction of flow capacity the rng and realizable k ε models predict 8 and 31 higher of the flow capacity than the ske model respectively for the witney sst the significant difference among the predictions of the turbulence models inside the inlet zone of darvill sst under the original loading rate and of witney sst under the maximum loading rate suggest that more observations are required in this area for model verification and turbulence model selection the turbulence models as shown with these simple geometries have a strong influence on the prediction of the sst hydrodynamics inside the inlet zone for geometries with complex inlet baffling structures such as the la or tangential energy dissipating inlet structure which cannot be easily simplified to a 2 d axisymmetric mesh it is especially necessarily to study the influence of the turbulence model such complex geometries use will likely require 3 d meshes to better predict sst performance and turbulence model selection should have a major impact future work should include non steady state simulations to better understand the hydrodynamics predicted by these turbulence models during transient conditions other advanced turbulence models such as the large eddy simulation model by al sammarraee et al 2009 should also be considered in the future turbulence model comparisons appendix a supplementary data the following are the

19442,the secondary sedimentation tank sst is a sensitive and complicated process in an activated sludge process due to the importance of its performance computational fluid dynamics cfd methods have been employed to study the underflow hydrodynamics and solids distribution unlike most of the previous numerical studies in the present investigation the performance of three different types of turbulence models standard k ε rng k ε and realizable k ε are evaluated firstly two dimensional axisymmetric cfd models of two circular ssts are validated with the field observations next comprehensive comparisons are presented of the model predictions of the key physical quantities such as the concentration of effluent suspended solids ess and returned activated sludge ras sludge blanket height sbh turbulent properties and flow and concentration patterns a surprising result shows that the prediction of the ess concentration is not sensitive to the change of turbulence models while remarkable prediction difference can be observed in the inlet zone and near field of sludge hopper and sbh the results suggest that more observations inside the inlet zone are needed to achieve better model calibration and correct application of the turbulence model which can be crucial to optimizing the geometry of inlet structure and sludge hopper as well as changing return solids

rate 1 introduction gravity sedimentation is one of the most commonly used treatment methods for removal of suspended solids ss in water or wastewater treatment plants in addition the cost for building the sedimentation tank is about 30 of the total investment of a treatment plant tamayol et al 2008 for conventional wastewater treatment plants sedimentation tanks are mainly divided into two categories primary and secondary sedimentation tanks sst primary sedimentation tanks have a low influent ss concentration therefore buoyancy effects are usually negligible however ssts are used to remove and concentrate and recycle biosolids and have much higher influent ss concentrations tamayol et al 2008 therefore flow currents can be density driven and affect the performance of ssts ekama and marais 2002 stated that ssts are the bottle neck limiting the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant the placement of the two types of the sedimentation tanks is shown in fig 1 previously ssts were designed only using empirical equations which were based on hydraulic criteria such as surface overflow rate sor parker 1983 parker and stenquist 1986 parker et al 1996 other influential factors such as 1 tank internal geometry 2 solids characteristics 3 atmospheric conditions including wind movement and temperature were not considered krebs 1995 stamou et al 2009 thickening capability was often correlated to the sludge volume index svi but is now usually based upon state point analysis wahlberg and keinath 1988 one dimensional 1 d models were developed to estimate solids loading rate and have evolved from conceptual models kynch 1952 to numerical models the model can solve problems such as the returned activated sludge ras concentration the sludge blanket height sbh and solids inventory management kynch 1952 takács et al 1991 li and stenstrom 2014 although 1 d models are useful in evaluating loads they cannot include non ideal effects such as flow currents and poor geometries to improve the predicative capability of 1 d models and consider non ideal conditions cfd models have been developed over the last 40 years and have improved our knowledge of sedimentation tanks larsen 1977 zhou and mccorquodale 1992a 1992b 1992c de clercq 2003 griborio 2004 ramin et al 2014 the development and the applications of the cfd model of ssts depend on the following four parts 1 improving the understanding of ssts by relaxing assumptions for ideal behavior by including physical problems such as the impacts of turbulence and density currents larsen 1977 adams and rodi 1990 zhou et al 1992 wells and laliberte 1998 jayanti and narayanan 2004 2 selecting a mathematical structure for the turbulence and buoyant flow modeling components to more accurately conform to the physical mechanisms adams and rodi 1990 bretscher et al 1992 vitasovic et al 1997 lakehal et al 1999 griborio 2004 3 optimizing the solution to more quickly and accurately solve the differencing equations imam and mccorquodale 1983 imam et al 1983 abdel gawad and mccorquodale 1984a 1985 4 improving computational speed of computers larsen 1977 was among the first to address the physical problems of ssts and is considered the pioneer in the cfd study of ssts setting the framework for the future sedimentation tank research in his work the prandtl mixing length theory was applied to solve the eddy viscosity and was also used in abdel gawad and mccorquodale 1984a 1984b the complexity of solving the resulting partial differential equations was reduced with several key assumptions constant eddy viscosity was assumed in several early studies imam et al 1983 krebs 1991 krebs et al 1992 1995 however since eddy viscosity depends on the state of turbulence in the ssts the value of the eddy viscosity should vary from case to case as well as in different parts of the ssts the constant eddy viscosity assumption limited to the accuracy of the models additionally both the mixing length theory model and constant eddy viscosity assumption imply that the turbulence is dissipated where it is generated which cannot be used to accurately describe the transport of turbulence in the flow field griborio 2004 therefore a more advanced turbulence model standard k ε model which is based on the transport of turbulent kinetic energy tke and the turbulent dissipation rate tdr was used to improve many of the previously developed sst models in the last 30 years the standard k ε model ske has become the most widely applied turbulence model in the cfd of ssts because of its robustness economy and reasonable accuracy for the prediction of turbulent flow in ssts stamou et al 1989 zhou and mccorquodale 1992b 1992c 1992a vitasovic et al 1997 lakehal et al 1999 armbruster et al 2001 kleine and reddy 2005 weiss et al 2007 tamayol et al 2009 gong et al 2011 patziger et al 2012 xanthos et al 2013 ramin et al 2014 in the previous studies with circular sedimentation tank few of velocity and concentration calibrations were reported inside the inlet zone where the reynolds number can be very high turbulent flow moreover the ske model is valid only for fully turbulent flow and performs poorly for complex flows involving strong streamline curvature das et al 2016 fluent 2017 therefore two modified versions of the ske model rng k ε and realizable k ε models have been applied in recent sedimentation tank studies laine et al 1999 tamayol et al 2008 tarpagkou and pantokratoras 2013 patziger and kiss 2015 das et al 2016 however in these studies the rng k ε model was applied in the studies of sedimentation tanks either in potable water treatment or primary sedimentation tanks in wastewater treatment where the buoyancy effect can be ignored in the flow field to the best of our knowledge none of the published ssts papers simulated the density stratified flow with the application of rng k ε model only das et al 2016 has applied the realizable k ε model to simulate the turbulent flow in their complex three dimensional 3d model but they had no field observations to show the reliability and superiority of the realizable k ε model therefore because of 1 the limitation of the widely applied ske model 2 the superior of the rng and realizable k ε models in predicting the turbulence flow involving strong streamline curvature and 3 the recent applications of the rng and realizable k ε models in the related cfd study areas these three models are selected to compare their prediction performance in two different ssts in this paper the influences of the ske rng k ε and realizable k ε models on the performance of a circular sst are compared using data from the witney wastewater treatment plant wwtp from burt 2010 and the darvill wwtp from griborio 2004 firstly the computational meshes with different number of cells are applied to ensure the solutions are mesh independent next the witney sst simulation results are compared to the measured velocity and concentration profiles the comparisons show reasonable agreement on the scale of the entire sst for darvill only the effluent suspended solids ess concentration and ras concentrations are available but they also agree well with the simulations next the validated models are used with the three different turbulence models to compare the prediction of the hydrodynamics such as velocity and concentration patterns especially in the inlet zone and in the near field zone of the sludge hopper where significant differences are observed among the three models additionally the predictions of the maximum loading rate by these turbulence models are compared for the witney sst 2 methods 2 1 the mathematical model 2 1 1 general information since the dominant hydrodynamics processes of circular ssts take place in the radial direction it can reasonably be simplified to a 2 d axisymmetric approach zhou and mccorquodale 1992b vitasovic et al 1997 lakehal et al 1999 griborio 2004 tamayol et al 2009 patziger et al 2012 patziger and kiss 2015 patziger 2016 gao and stenstrom 2017 2 1 2 governing equations the equations describing 2 d steady turbulent and density stratified flow

averaged navier stokes equations tke can be calculated based on the turbulence closure method in this study three types of turbulence closure approaches ske rng k ε and realizable k ε models are applied and compared the major differences in these models are 1 the turbulent schmidt numbers governing the turbulent diffusion of tke and tdr 2 the source term in the ε and 3 the method of calculating turbulence fluent 2017 the standard k ε model is a semi empirical model based on the transport equations for the tke k and tdr ε rodi 1980 it is assumes that the flow is fully turbulent and the effect of molecular viscosity is negligible tamayol et al 2008 the tke and tdr are calculated from the following transport equations 10 u k r v k y r ϑ ϑ t σ k k r y ϑ ϑ t σ k k y g k g b ρ ε

empirical constants are given the standard values suggested by rodi 1993 c μ 0 09 c 1 1 44 c 2 1 92 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 3 the value of the empirical constant c 3 related to the buoyancy source term g b depends on the flow situation lakehal et al 1999 different researches applied different c 3 values in their specific cases lyn et al 1992 dahl et al 1994 lakehal et al 1999 gong et al 2011 ramin et al 2014 rodi 1993 suggested that c 3 is in the range of 0 8 1 0 for stable stratification that prevails in ssts and tends toward zero for unstable stratification the rng k ε model is derived using a statistical technique called the renormalization group rng theory the analytical derivation results in a model with constants different from those in the ske model and additional terms and functions in the transport equations for tke and tdr the rng k ε model has a similar form to the ske model 15 u k r v k y r α k μ e f f k r y α k μ e f f k y g k g b ρ ε and 16 u ε r v ε y r α ε μ e f f ε r y α

the effects of rapid strain and streamline curvature than the ske model and may have a superior performance in the simulation of sedimentation tank model with a complex inlet geometry the definition of the r ε and its effects on the prediction of the tdr are illustrated in the ansys fluent theory guide equations 4 48 to 4 50 fluent 2017 the dimensionless model constants are c 1 1 42 c 2 1 68 another modified k ε model is the realizable k ε model it involves a modified transport equation for the tdr which has been derived from an exact equation for the transport of the mean square vorticity fluctuation compared with ske realizable k ε model gives a much more accurate prediction of reynolds stresses for flow with rotation and recirculation das et al 2016 the modeled transport

rotation rates the angular velocity of the system rotation and the turbulent fields 2 1 3 boundary conditions velocity inlet boundary condition is applied to inlet and sludge bottom boundaries which assumes a uniform distribution of all the dependent variables at the boundary face for the surface outlet a pressure outlet boundary condition is applied which assumes a uniform pressure and zero gradient for all transport variables instead of estimating the tke and tdr turbulent intensity and hydraulic diameter are used as the turbulence specification method on the inlet and outlet boundaries for the free ambient water surface the rigid lid approximation for all velocity components with full slip shear condition is assumed wang et al 2008 tarpagkou and pantokratoras 2013 and the free surface boundary is treated as a symmetry condition the solid boundaries are specified as stationary walls with a no slip shear condition and standard wall function is used with the turbulence models 2 1 4 solution procedure the governing equations are numerically solved by the commercial cfd code ansys fluent v 17 2 a first order upwind method is used for interpolation of variables to cell faces for the convective terms whereas diffusive terms are discretized using second order central differencing pressure velocity coupling is achieved using the simple method the solution procedures which are accomplished in meshes with different grid numbers can be summarized in the following steps 1 the flow filed with pure water is firstly solved in the absence of turbulence convergence is reached when normalized residuals are less than 10 4 2 the converged solution is interpolated into the pure water flow field coupled with ske model to calculate the steady state turbulence flow field none of the buoyancy damping terms to the tke and tdr are included convergence is reached when normalized residuals are less than 10 4 3 the solids transport equation defined in the user define scalar is coupled to the model 4 the buoyancy damping term g b is included to the tke equation to describe the turbulent and density stratified flow 5 the buoyancy damping term g b associated with c3 is added to the tdr equation to complete the procedure in the steps 3 to 5 convergence is achieved when the following three criteria are all achieved 1 normalized residuals are less than 10 3 or the solution no longer changes with subsequent iterations 2 the net flux imbalance is less than 1 of the smallest flux through the domain boundary 3 other monitored key physical quantities no longer change with subsequent iterations the velocity profiles as a function of depth for witney and darvill ssts are calculated from meshes with different grid numbers at three radial locations and are shown in the supplementary material figs s1 and s2 respectively after achieving grid independence tests the second order upwind method is used to calculate a more accurate solution for the final step described in the previous solution procedures 2 2 geometry and meshing the geometries and meshes are generated using ansys meshing v 17 2 the general geometry of the witney sst with the computational mesh fine mesh that is used in the simulations after achieving grid independent test consists of 428 000 cells in order to ensure that the solution is mesh independent three additional meshes are used one coarse consisting of 123 096 cells a medium one consisting of 225 284 cells and a finer one consisting of 901 136 cells fig s1 shows that the difference between the prediction of the coarse mesh to other three finer medium fine and finer meshes is significant but the difference among the prediction of the three finer meshes is negligible therefore the solution from the mesh of 428 000 cells is considered mesh independent the general geometry of the darvill sst with the computational mesh that is used in the simulations after achieving grid independent test consists of 218 700 cells in order to ensure that the solution is mesh independent two additional finer meshes are used one consisting of 389 428 cells and another one consisting of 874 800 cells fig s2 shows that the difference among the prediction of these three meshes is negligible therefore the solution from the mesh of 218 700 cells is considered mesh independent and has the benefit of increased computational speed the general geometry of the witney and darvill ssts are displayed in figs 2 and 3 respectively since the outlet is extremely small compared with inlet the grids near the outlet zone are enlarged to show the outlet boundary condition clearly the dimensions of the witney and darvill ssts are shown in table 2 2 3 model verification since only the measurements of the velocity and concentration profiles for the witney sst are available in burt 2010 they are used to compare the model predictions for the witney sst the comparisons of the velocity and concentration profiles along the sst radial direction between the model predictions and the field measurements are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively however the predictions of darvill sst are compared with the observed performance indicators such as ess and ras concentrations of three tests in ekama and marais 2002 and griborio 2004 the investigated loading conditions for witney and darvill ssts are shown in table 1 figs 4 and 5 show the velocity and concentration profiles comparison along the radial direction of witney sst between the model predictions and the field measurements respectively in fig 4 the overall stream curvatures outside of the stilling well are reasonably predicted but less well predicted inside the stilling well fig 5 indicates that the predictions of the bed transition 0 85 g l contour followed by burt 2010 agree reasonably well with the measurements but sludge blanket concentration is less well predicted 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance indicators comparisons among the predictions of the performance indicators by the different turbulence models and the field data in darvill and witney ssts are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively figs 6 and 7 show that the predictions of ess by the three models are quite similar all the models show fair agreement with the field data of the darvill sst and show good agreement with the field data of the witney sst for the ras concentration fig 6 shows that all the turbulence models give a similar prediction of ras concentration and show reasonable agreement with the field data in tests 2 and 3 however in the test 1 realizable k ε model gives a 10 higher of ras concentration prediction than the ske model additionally the difference among the prediction of ras concentration for the witney sst is also significant as shown in fig 7 the predictions of sbh by the three turbulence models for the darvill sst are also varied the largest prediction difference is shown in test 3 where the realizable k ε produces a 14 1 lower sbh than the prediction by ske the predicted ras concentration in the local area of inlet zone as shown in figs 6 and 7 and the sbh in fig 6 show remarkable disagreement indicating that the influence of turbulence is important 3 2 velocity and concentration contours for darvill sst fig 8 a c presents the predictions of the velocity magnitude vectors in the inlet zone and concentration contours by the ske a rng k ε b and realizable k ε c models for the test 1 of darvill sst respectively it shows that the predicted turbulent flow contours by the ske and rng k ε models are similar both models show the influent flows into the center well immediately turns sharply downward without impinging the baffle and then changes its direction towards the baffle in the near field zone above the sludge hopper and finally flows as a horizontal jet from the bottom lip of the baffle outside the inlet zone additionally both ske a and rng k ε b models predict the formation of a small eddy below the inlet port and a large eddy between the downward jet and baffle from the surface to the turning point of jet at the bottom however the flow contour predicted by realizable k ε inside the inlet zone is totally different from the simulation result using ske and rng k ε turbulence models the realizable k ε model predicts that the horizontal inflow jet impinges on the center of the baffle and is then forced in the opposite direction before reversing directions to form a horizontal jet from the lip of the baffle outside the inlet zone additionally realizable k ε c predicts a larger eddy below the inlet port and a compressed eddy in the triangulated area bounded by the surface baffle and downward jet moreover the region of the high downward flow shown as red in fig 8a and b predicted by the realizable k ε is much smaller than the region predicted by the other two models the prediction of the magnitude and the location of the peak velocity is also different results of the realizable k ε also show that the location of the peak velocity 0 131 m s is at the inlet port while both ske 0 149 m s and rng k ε 0 183 m s models predict it is at the center of the core of the high downward flow fig 9 presents the quantitative comparisons of the velocity magnitude of the three models inside and outside the inlet zone for test 1 of darvill sst consistent with the qualitatively comparisons in fig 8 ske and rng k ε models have similar velocity magnitude distribution from the surface to bottom although the peak velocity prediction and the vertical position of the peak velocity have some small differences however large disagreement of the velocity magnitude distribution can be found between realizable k ε and ske rng k ε in the inlet zone outside of the inlet zone the difference reduces gradually along the radial direction as the energy is dissipated the flow contours predicted by the ske and rng k ε models are similar which creates similar concentration profiles in both cases the concentrations in inlet outlet main settling and bottom sludge zones and the sbh are all similar however the velocity and concentration predictions of ske and rng k ε models of the sludge in the near field zone of the sludge hopper are quite different than predicted by the realizable k ε model the differences in concentrations predicted by the realizable k ε are caused by the high downward velocities inside the center well as shown in fig 8c the magnitude and pattern of the velocities near the middle of the center well are quite different the downward velocity predicted by the realizable k ε model at r 1 0 m is lower and does not closely approach the sludge hopper as observed in the ske and rng k ε results fig 8 shows that the concentration above the sludge hopper ranges from 4 to 11 g l green to red for the ske and rng k ε model results while the realizable k ε predictions for concentrations in this area range from 8 to 11 g l yellow orange to red the realizable k ε model results show a similarity of the overall concentration contour within the sst but produces a more homogeneous highly concentrated sludge blanket in the near field zone of the sludge hopper and a shallower sludge blanket fig 8c as compared to the ske and rng k ε results this is because the high downward flow predicted by ske and rng k ε in the inlet zone swirls up the settled sludge which results in drifting of the settled sludge particles and insufficient transport towards sludge hopper patziger et al 2016 therefore elevating the entire sludge blanket 3 3 velocity contour for witney sst fig 10 indicates that these three turbulence models predict the similar flow contour on the scale of the entire witney sst therefore the similar concentration contour all the models predict that the inflow turns sharply downward as a density current without reaching the stilling well however the ske model predicts a 15 8 longer length of the bottom horizontal jet flow than the prediction of the rng and realizable k ε models which indicates the ske model predicts a stronger horizontal jet than the prediction of the rng and realizable k ε models also fig 4b e shows the prediction of the bottom horizontal jet by ske model is deeper and closer to the sludge blanket surface since the strong and deep horizontal flow jet can easily drift and swirl up the settled sludge patziger 2016 the ske model predicts a higher ess than the prediction of the rng and realizable k ε models shown in fig 7a as the increase of the influent rate the ske model may predict the failure of sst when the rng and realizable k ε models still predict the well operated sst 3 4 cfd stress tests for the witney sst 3 4 1 predictions of the flow capacity in order to compare the prediction of the witney sst capacity by these turbulence models stress tests are simulated by increasing the influent rate the failure of the sst is accepted as ess 30 mg l mlss and ras ratio keep constant fig 11 shows the prediction of the ess under the original influent rate and the limiting influent rate by these turbulence models the limiting influent rate or the maximum loading rate predicted by the ske model is 6120 m3 d surface overflow rate sor 0 464 m h when ess reaches 30 mg l while the predictions of the limiting influent rates are 6630 sor 0 502 m h and 8026 m3 d sor 0 608 m h respectively by the rng and realizable k ε models the limiting influent rates predicted by the rng and realizable k ε models are about 8 and 31 higher than predicted by the ske model respectively this indicates that the turbulence model selection strongly influences the prediction of the witney sst s flow capacity 3 4 2 comparison of the predicted velocity contours under the maximum loading rate fig 12 shows the prediction of the velocity contours by these turbulence models when their prediction of the ess reaches 30 mg l the rng model does not predict the downward density current that the other two models predict as shown in fig 10 at lower loading rates simulations with all three models predict similar flow contours in fig 12 the ske and realizable k ε models similarly predict the density currents from the inlet without reaching the stilling well while the rng model predicts a strong horizontal jet impinging on the baffle based on the similarity and difference predicted by these turbulence models under the original and maximum loading rates especially in the inlet zone table 3 shows a diagnostic approach to select the most accurate turbulence model the same symbol in a column indicates that the predictions of the turbulence models are similar the first column indicates that the predictions of the velocity and concentration fields by these turbulence models are all similar under the original loading rate and one cannot decide the most accurate turbulence model next the second column shows that the predictions of the flow capacity by the ske model are significantly different from the rng and realizable k ε models if the experimental data show the actual maximum flow capacity is close to the prediction of the ske model the ske model is the optimal turbulence model otherwise the velocity and concentration profiles under the maximum loading rate especially in the inlet zone need to be measured to select the optimal model from the rng and realizable k ε models 4 conclusions in this paper a fluent based 2d axisymmetric numerical model is used to analyze the hydrodynamics and turbulent flow such as flow and concentration patterns of two different ssts the previous numerical studies did not study the effect of different turbulent models on the turbulent flow and concentration pattern in the inlet zone where they can have major impacts in the present work numerical simulations with three advanced turbulent models ske rng k ε and realizable k ε are performed on two different ssts to study the influence of turbulent models on the flow and concentration patterns and operation parameters such as ess ras concentration and sbh also the predictions of the sst capacity are compared using the three turbulence models for the case studied by various turbulence models the following conclusions are made turbulence model selection can have a strong influence on the prediction of hydrodynamics of an sst such as flow and concentration patterns the difference is remarkable inside the inlet zone where the high flow energy is dissipated resulting in high turbulence the remarkable different predictions of the hydrodynamics inside the inlet zone cause significant differences more than 10 in predicting ras concentration and sbh which can greatly influence the operation of sludge return concentration turbulence model selection also can have a strong influence on the prediction of flow capacity the rng and realizable k ε models predict 8 and 31 higher of the flow capacity than the ske model respectively for the witney sst the significant difference among the predictions of the turbulence models inside the inlet zone of darvill sst under the original loading rate and of witney sst under the maximum loading rate suggest that more observations are required in this area for model verification and turbulence model selection the turbulence models as shown with these simple geometries have a strong influence on the prediction of the sst hydrodynamics inside the inlet zone for geometries with complex inlet baffling structures such as the la or tangential energy dissipating inlet structure which cannot be easily simplified to a 2 d axisymmetric mesh it is especially necessarily to study the influence of the turbulence model such complex geometries use will likely require 3 d meshes to better predict sst performance and turbulence model selection should have a major impact future work should include non steady state simulations to better understand the hydrodynamics predicted by these turbulence models during transient conditions other advanced turbulence models such as the large eddy simulation model by al sammarraee et al 2009 should also be considered in the future turbulence model comparisons appendix a supplementary data the following are the

19443,limited concentrations of oxygen in constructed wetlands cws have inhibited their ability to remove emerging organic contaminants eocs at μg l or ng l levels manganese mn oxides were proposed as a solution as they are powerful oxidants with strong adsorptive capabilities in the present study triclosan tcs was selected as a typical eoc and cw microcosms with mn oxides birnessite coated sand b cws and without c cws were developed to test the removal capacities of tcs and common nutrients we found that the addition of mn oxides coated sand significantly improved removal efficiencies of tcs nh4 n cod no3 n and tp p 0 05 the average concentration of mn ii effluent was 0 036 mg l 1 mostly lower than the drinking water limit to gain insight into the mechanisms of pollution removal mn transformation dissolved oxygen do distribution bacterial abundance and microbial community composition were also investigated maximum mn ii was detected at 20 cm height of the b cws in anoxic zone although mn oxidizing bacteria existed in the layer of 30 50 cm with 103 104 cfu g 1 dry substate mn oxides were only detected at height from 40 to 50 cm with rich oxygen in b cw the quantities of bacterial 16s rrna amoa narg and nosz were not significantly different between two systems p 0 05 while illumina high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the abundance of denitrifying bacteria was significant higher in b cws and the abundance of gammaproteobacteria that have a recognized role in mn transformation were significantly increased the results indicated that mn oxides could enhance tcs and common pollutants removal in both anoxic and aerobic areas through the recycling of mn between mn ii and biogenic mn oxides graphical abstract image 1 keywords constructed wetlands manganese oxides triclosan manganese cycling 1 introduction in the last decade the removal of emerging organic contaminants eocs has gained a significant amount of attention in wastewater treatment eocs of specific concern include pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps pesticides and veterinary drugs although they are normally detected at very low concentrations between μg l and ng l levels their persistence toxicity and continuous release into environment may pose a risk to human and environmental health constructed wetlands cws utilize natural processes to remove of wastewater constituents which are widely used to alleviate contaminants in many kinds of wastewaters wu et al 2014 because of the structure of cws there are diverse oxygen conditions with sufficient oxygen at the upper layers and insufficient or even no oxygen at the lower layers liu et al 2016 interestingly diverse oxygen conditions provide several micro environments for various microbial communities which can aid in nitrogen removal by aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification li et al 2014 thus these micro environments can also offer different metabolic pathways allowing for the degradation of eocs through aerobic oxidation and anaerobic reduction better performance was also detected in various eocs treatment hijosa valsero et al 2010 matamoros et al 2008 rühmland et al 2015 however aerobic degradation of eocs is often more efficient than anaerobic ones despite the fact that reductive dehalogenation and the cleavage of ether bonds occur more easily under strictly anaerobic conditions vogel et al 1987 aerobic conditions are generally considered to be more effective in most eocs removal ghattas et al 2017 moreover highly halogenated aromatic compounds could not be totally degraded under anaerobic conditions in fact most of their metabolites need be further transformed under aerobic conditions therefore artificial aeration is often used to supply more oxygen and improve the removal of organic carbon sources in cws kahl et al 2017 liu et al 2016 nivala et al 2013 wiessner et al 2005 however in large scale cws this is impractical due to the high energy consumption of artificial aeration except aerobic conditions the relatively low concentrations of eocs also inhibit their biodegradation luo et al 2014 dordio et al 2010 in a recent study wen et al used vermiculite to enhance the removal of di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate by first adsorption and then biofilm biodegradation wen et al 2016 manganese mn oxides as a powerful oxidants with adsorptive capability has been reported to removal clarithromycin chlorophene diclofenac and triclosan in membrane bioreactors and column reactors at the lab scale water treatment processes forrez et al 2009 joshi et al 2017 accompanied with the oxidation of pollutants mn oxides mostly mno2 were shown to be reduced to mn ii with or without microbial reactions liang et al 2016 zhang and huang 2003 interestingly mn ii can be further oxidized to biogenic mn oxides by many kinds of microbes under oxygen rich conditions blothe et al 2015 liang et al 2016 biogenic mn oxides have shown a much higher adsorptive capability than both synthetic δ mno2 and the commercially available mn oxide pyrolusite primarily due to their large specific surface areas and small particle sizes forrez et al 2010a hennebel et al 2009 it was hypothesized that both mn oxides and biogenic mn oxides could provide a hopeful type of substrate for cws in eocs removal and the cycling of mn between mn ii and biogenic mn oxides could enhance the performance triclosan 2 4 4 trichloro 2 hydroxydiphenyl ether tcs is a synthetic antibacterial and antifungal agent widely used in soaps toothpaste cosmetics and other household cleaning lotions or medical disinfectants singer et al 2002 thus tcs is a ubiquitous pollutant that can be detected in all types of aquatic environments including rivers and cws at concentrations ranging from 10 to 5160 ng l 1 carranza diaz et al 2014 ramaswamy et al 2011 in this experiment tcs was selected as the typical eoc pollutant to investigate the performance of cws with mn oxides in the removal of eocs from wastewaters taking into consideration of the chemical and biological properties of cws mn oxides and mn transformation products mn oxides was only added at the lower layers substrate of cws under anoxic conditions the aim of this research was to elucidate 1 whether mn oxides could enhance the performance of cws in tcs and common pollutants removal 2 whether the cycling between mn ii and biogenic mn oxides formed at the upper layers of cws under aerobic conditions 3 whether microbes were involved in the process to this end the concentrations of pollutants and mn ii were analyzed the biogenic mn oxides formed were determined mn oxidizing bacteria microbial abundance and community structure were investigated here we present a new type of substrate for effective treatment of cws contaminated with eocs as well as common pollutants 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals tcs was purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany the internal standard

2 mol of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added drop wise to the solution while vigorously stirred after boiling for a further 10 min the precipitate was filtered and washed mckenzie 1981 then repeat ten times to get enough birnessite coated sand for our experiment the average mn oxidation state of the birnessite coated sand was 3 75 murray et al 1984 grebel et al 2016 2 2 lab scale vertical up flow subsurface cws set up to get rich oxygen for mn ii oxidation at upper layer of substrate vertical subsurface cws were selected garcía and bayona 2011 to test the function of mn oxides in the anoxic region of the cws up flow cws were adopted six lab scale cws were employed and consisted of column reactors which were used transparent rigid plexiglas cylinders with capacity of 10 6 l

highest sampling outlet was below the sand surface all cws consisted of 10 cm layer of gravel layer at the bottom with the diameter ranging from 1 to 3 cm six lab scale cws were divided into two groups one group was filled with washed river sand as substrate at a column depth from 10 to 50 cm and named c cws the other group contained a 20 cm layer of birnessite coated sand substituted for washed river sand at the height from 10 to 30 cm and named b cws fig s1 phragmites australis were chosen and collected from the local plant nursery jinan shandong china the well grown plants of similar size and height were selected removed the adherent soil and dead plant tissues by washing with tap water and transplanted into lab scale cws the plants were cultivated with 10 hoagland solution for about 2 weeks until they grew vigorously 2 3 experimental procedure and sampling the influent water was synthetic and mainly consisted of sucrose nh4 2so4 kh2po4 and kno3 to simulate polluted river water as reported by d huett et al 2005 its characteristics are listed in table s1 synthetic wastewater prepared using micronutrients required for normal plant growth was used during the experiment to investigate the effect of mn oxides on eocs removal and get anoxic environment where mn oxides coated sand was filled without the influence of oxygen synthetic wastewater was pre aerated with nitrogen gas n2 to maintain anoxic conditions and then continuously fed into the cws from bottom to top layer with a peristaltic pump the influent volume of wastewater was 3 l for each column per day with hydraulic loading rate of 8 cm d 1 and a hydraulic retention time of around 3 days after acclimation in the influent water for 2 weeks 80 μg l 1 of tcs was added to all the cws cws were then cultivated for two months until the removal efficiencies of tcs and common contaminants had reached their steady states water samples were homogenized and collected from the top outlet 50 cm of cws every 7 days for three months water samples from each outlet were collected every 4 weeks for tcs organic matter and nutrient determination substrate samples from the five sampling locations were collected and homogenized at the end of experiment for three months all samples were transported to the laboratory in a chilled insulating box for further analysis 2 4 chemical analysis and quantity control the concentration of soluble mn ii in the water samples was determined via aa 6300 atomic absorption spectrophotometry schimadzu forrez et al 2010b x ray diffraction xrd was used to

discussion 3 1 pollutant removal performance of different cws in wastewater treatment the removal of nh4 n no3 n cod and tp are main priorities during the experiment the concentrations of those four pollutants decreased and reached a steady state in the effluent fig 1 in fact for each contaminant there was a significant difference p 0 05 in concentrations between c cws and b cws concentrations of nh4 n reduced from 20 0 mg l 1 to 1 6 and 3 9 mg l 1 in the b cws and c cws respectively the average concentration of no3 n in b cw effluents were 1 9 mg l 1 only two fifths of that in c cws as for cod the average removal efficiency was 71 9 in b cws whereas it was only 57 6 in c cws moreover mn oxides decreased the final concentration of tp in b cws compared to c cws with the minimum concentration of 4 0 mg l 1 in b cws versus 6 8 mg l 1 in c cws tcs the ubiquitous chemical contaminant could be efficiently removed by cws in a previous study we showed that more than 80 0 of tcs can be removed in cws through the action of different species of wetland plants zhao et al 2016 as shown in fig 2 a more than 91 0 of tcs was removed from b cws with the minimum concentration of 5 0 μg l 1 however in c cws the average removal efficiency was only 83 8 furthermore minimum tcs effluent concentrations were 13 1 μg l 1 in c cws which was significantly higher than the b cws p 0 05 taking into consideration of the strong adsorptive capacity of mn oxides and hydrophobic property of tcs the amount of tcs adsorbed by substrate were measured table s2 showed that tcs adsorbed by mn oxide coated sand was 27 7 ng g 1 which was higher than uncoated sand of 19 3 ng g 1 however the amount of tcs absorbed by mn oxide minerals coated sand only took account of no more than 2 0 of total tcs removal so the priority of tcs removal was mainly induced by the oxidizing properties of mn oxides in b cws the support matrix in a wetland system can influence both physical and microbial structure stottmeister et al 2003 and at last pollutant removal performance in cws arias et al 2001 li et al 2008 it was easy to understand that mn oxides in a substrate could improve nitrification processes nh4 n and organic carbon transformation cod and tcs remucal and ginder vogel 2014 due to their strong oxidizing properties huguet et al 2013 hulth et al 1999 however it was very interesting that the denitrification was also enhanced in b cws the reason might be anaerobic mn ii oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction swathi et al 2017 which was further discussed in section 3 5 similar with iron and aluminum in constructed reed bed substrates arias et al 2001 fixation of phosphate by mn might be the key mechanisms of tp removal in b cws 3 2 pollution removal efficiencies along the height of cws diverse micro environments along the height provided various microbial habits led to different microbial communities and at last affected pollutant removal performance in the b cws cumulative removal efficiencies of tcs nh4 n no3 n and tp were all significantly increased from the height of 20 cm figs 2b and 3 especially when compared to the c cws indeed in the b cws tcs was removed at height of 30 cm with the maximum cumulative removal efficiency of 54 0 this was much higher than that of c cws with a maximum of 32 4 similarly concentrations of nh4 n were reduced to 13 2 and 8 4 mg l 1 at 20 cm and 30 cm heights in the b cws whereas the nh4 n concentrations reached 18 1 and 15 2 mg l 1 in the c cws the cumulative removal efficiency of nh4 n reached 58 5 at the height of 30 cm in b cws whereas it only reached 24 8 in c cws concentrations of cod and tp presented similar trends as nh4 n in that they were quickly removed with the addition of mn oxides although the concentrations of no3 n were also significantly decreased in b cws compared to c cws p 0 05 the effects were not as obvious as what was seen with the other pollutants at a 30 cm height the concentrations of no3 n were 5 2 and 8 0 mg l 1 in b cws and c cws respectively and then compared with c cws b cws kept their priority in pollutant removal at the height from 30 to 50 cm without mn oxides addition to summarize addition of mn oxides could promote the removal of all tested pollutants in both mn oxides layer and upper layer at the height of 30 50 cm 3 3 the concentration of mn ii and the existence of mn oxides along the height of cws mn oxides were reduced to mn ii as organic contaminants and nh4 n were oxidized fig 4 a the highest concentration of mn ii was at the height of 20 cm in b cws this is where tcs and other pollutants were also removed most quickly this is in accordance with prior studies that mn oxides are reduced to mn ii as pollutants are oxidized bartlett et al 2008 hulth et al 2005 luther et al 1997 and then the concentration of mn ii quickly decreased with the water flowing as mn ii concentration is one of controlling specifications of water quality cerrato et al 2010 we measured mn ii concentrations in the final outlet most of the mn ii concentrations below 0 05 mg l 1 only one time was as high as 0 098 mg l 1 which is higher than the us epa water quality criteria 0 05 mg l 1 but lower than the national standard for drinking water in china 0 10 mg l 1 weng et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 compared with substrate before experiment some new diffraction peaks of xrd pattern were appeared at substrate layer of 40 50 cm of post experiment in b cws which were related to namno2 fig 5 because mn ii could only be oxidize to mn oxides via the action of mn oxidizing bacteria in environment the examined mn oxides were biogenic mn oxides nealson and saffarini 1994 furthermore only under aerobic conditions mn ii could be oxidized by microbes nealson and ford 1980 zhang et al 2015 fig 4b showed the concentration of do was the highest at the height of 50 cm with 2 4 mg l 1 and then sharply dropped to 1 4 and 0 8 mg l 1 at height of 40 cm in b cws and c cws respectively at the height of 10 cm do concentration reached almost zero although mn ii was decreased at the height from 30 to 40 fig 4a mn oxides was not detected at the layer the results might be explained by either low concentration of mn oxides formation or mn ii adsorption by substrate zhang and huang 2005 it was interesting that do concentrations in b cws were much higher than that of c cws at the height from 20 to 40 cm with the same design and operation most oxygen was consumed by degraded organic matter and nitrification reaction nivala et al 2013 however the concentrations of pollutants in b cws were less than that of c cws at the height from 20 to 40 cm figs 2b and 3 which needed less oxygen for further pollutant removal and would provide more sufficient oxygen for mn ii oxidization our results confirmed that mn oxides were formed in the upper layer 40 50 cm of cws under aerobic conditions zhang and huang 2003 2005 3 4 quantities of mn oxidizing bacteria and nitrogen related genes mn oxidizing microbes have been linked to the production of biogenic mn oxides in terrestrial freshwater and marine environments tani et al 2003 numbers of mn oxidizing bacteria in the b cws and c cws were presented in table 1 results showed that mn oxidizing bacteria in b cws were 104 and 103 104 cfu g 1 dry substrate at the height of 40 50 cm and 30 40 cm respectively however in c cws these bacteria were only 10 102 cfu g 1 at the height of 40 50 cm and not detectable at 30 40 cm although there were mn oxidizing bacteria mn oxides were not detected at layer of 30 40 cm in b cws and at layer of 40 50 cm in c cw except the existence of mn ii mn oxidizing bacteria could oxidize mn ii to biogenic mn oxides under conditions with some extent do garcía and bayona 2011 otherwise the transformation rate will be decreased or restricted due to higher do concentration fig 4b mn oxides only detected at the layer of 40 50 cm in b cws microbial action is recognized as one of the dominant mechanisms of pollutant removals in cws zhao et al 2016 quantities of bacterial 16s rrna genes determined by qpcr are often used to estimate the quantity of the intact bacterial cells and thus the organic removal efficiency of a system shin et al 2010 the absolute abundances of bacterial 16s rrna varied within 8 10 orders of magnitude and were not significantly different between the two treatment groups p 0 05 table s3 quantification of bacteria and related genes capable of nitrification and denitrification have also been used to reflect nh4 n and no3 n removal performance baek et al 2010 however in this study despite the performance of b cws exceeding the c cws quantities of nitrification and denitrification related genes amoa narg nosz were not significantly different between the two treatment groups p 0 05 table s3 3 5 shifts in microbial community structure microbial community composition could also impact the pollution removal efficiencies in an ecosystem the influences of microbial communities on nutrient cycling have been reported in many studies landesman and dighton 2010 song et al 2012 to characterize the microbial community composition samples at 20 30 cm and 40 50 cm heights were selected from b cws and c cws for community structure analysis and named b 20 b 50 c 20 and c 50 respectively community structure was characterized using illumina high throughput sequencing after de multiplexing and quality filtering a total of 150 038 high quality sequences were obtained table s4 species coverage estimates ranged from 91 95 to 96 82 with otus ranging from 2981 to 5526 both community richness chao and ace and species diversity shannon index were different between the b cws and c cws indicating a shift of microbial community composition with the addition of mn oxides results showed that mn oxides had a positive effect on the microbial richness and diversity at both heights which might be attributed to the better removal of tcs and other common pollutants in the b cws microbial composition at phylum level is shown in fig 6 sequences that could not be classified into any known group were assigned as unclassified bacteria of the 26 known phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria verrucomicrobia and chloroflexi were dominant in microbial communities accounting for 66 8 b 50 73 3 b 20 72 0 c 50 and 73 1 c 20 of all detected microbial organisms which was in accordance with what has been reported in former studies using both natural wetlands and cws ansola et al 2014 proteobacteria abundance was positive correlated with tcs removal louis et al 2013 furthermore proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all samples especially for the b 20 sample in b 20 proteobacteria accounted for 54 9 which was significantly different from c 20 furthermore within the proteobacteria there was high level of bacterial metabolic diversity which was related to global carbon or nitrogen cycling and dominated the wastewater treatment process ansola et al 2014 we postulate that the high abundance of this species could also contribute to the removal of the common contaminants fig 1 there were also significant differences in the subgroups of proteobacteria between the two types of cws fig 7 a betaproteobacteria was the dominant group in c cws accounting for 65 9 and 37 7 of the microbial community in c 20 and c 50 respectively however gammaproteobacteria was the dominant group in b cws accounting for 31 1 and 36 6 of the microbial community in b 20 and b 50 respectively this finding is consistent with previous work that observed that gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant group in deep sea manganese nodules and this group of organisms drove a biologically closed manganese cycle within these nodules blothe et al 2015 these results along with the increased mn oxidizing bacteria richness and mn oxides formation in the b cws in section 3 4 indicated that a mn cycle was formed and played a role in pollutant removal from b cws in addition the relative abundance of bacteroidetes fig 7b which was the second abundant phylum and has been previously reported to degrade chlorinated compounds by reductive dechlorination li et al 2013 was similar between b cws and c cws however the richness of sphingobacteria one class of bacteroidetes was different between b 20 and c 20 with 52 5 and 39 8 respectively former studies have demonstrated that purified strains of sphingobacteria could biodegrade tcs and other aromatic pollutants with similar structures kim et al 2011 thus higher abundance of sphingobacteria in b cws likely also contributed to the better tcs removal performance fig 2 the relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria table s5 showed no difference between two treatment groups p 0 05 coupled with mn ii formation section 3 3 and the fact that the abundance of the nitrification gene amoa in two groups had no difference section 3 4 we postulate that oxidation via mn oxides played the main role in increasing nitrification above the level of the controls although the gene related to denitrification narg was not significantly different between b cws and c cws the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria in b cws was higher than c cws which could have contributed to no3 n removal since narg represents only membrane bound nitrate reductase analysis based on narg might exclude those bacteria possessing the periplasmic nitrate reductase or unknown nitrate reductase cheneby et al 2003 thus we postulated that the denitrification process was catalyzed by bacteria harboring non membrane bound nitrate reductase and that an anoxic mn ii oxidation coupled with denitrification simultaneously occurred as observed in swathi et al 2017 this was supported by the fact that the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria increased 9 fold at the height of 20 cm under anoxic conditions while only 1 7 fold at the height of 50 cm under aerobic conditions in b cws table s5 furthermore abundance of organic carbon was the most important factors in the heterotrophic denitrification process wan et al 2017 thus the lower cod concentration was correlated with higher nitrate removal efficiency meaning that more cod was utilized for denitrification fig 1 3 6 proposed mechanism of pollution removal in b cws based on the results presented here we derived a mechanism of pollutant removal in the b cws fig 8 tcs and some other pollutant were susceptible to chemical oxidation by mno2 under both aerobic and anoxic conditions forrez et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 in the height of 10 30 cm under anoxic conditions pollutants including tcs nh4 n and other organic carbon compounds were first absorbed and then oxidized by mn oxides birnessite as mn ii was produced gammaproteobacteria acted to accelerate pollutant oxidization blothe et al 2015 lee et al 2014 denitrification coupled with mn ii oxidation were speculated to occur in the b cws resulting in no3 n removal in the height between 30 and 50 cm mn oxidizing bacteria accumulated in the b cws these bacteria have the ability to re oxidize the mn ii under aerobic conditions and produce biogenic mn oxides at the layer of 40 50 cm biogenic mn oxides could more effectively absorb and oxidize pollutants due to their high specific surface areas hennebel et al 2009 and high catalytic reactivity forrez et al 2010b however little mn ii was detected in this height we suspect that this is either due to oxidization of mn ii by mn oxidizing bacteria under sufficient oxygen conditions nealson and ford 1980 zhu et al 2010 or adsorption of mn ii by mn oxides and substrate zhang and huang 2005 4 conclusions mn oxides could enhance the performance of cws in pollutant removal through their strong oxidizing properties and adsorptive capacities under anoxic conditions at the height from 10 to 30 cm tcs nh4 n no3 n and other organic carbon sources were all removed efficiently as mn ii was formed at upper layer from 30 to 50 cm height the concentrations of pollution continued decreasing with the decline of mn ii and biogenic mn oxides were formed in aerobic condition from 40 to 50 cm height at the final outlet most of mn ii concentrations were below the drinking water limit 0 05 mg l 1 under both anoxic and aerobic conditions not only the changing of microbial structure but also the abundance of gammaproteobacteria and mn oxidizing bacteria were all involved in the mn cycle and at last improved the removal efficiency of tcs in b cws in conclusion cycling of mn between mn ii and biogenic mn oxides did set up and enhanced pollutant removal in cws in both anoxic and aerobic areas acknowledgments this work was supported by shandong provincial natural science zr2015bm004 and

19443,limited concentrations of oxygen in constructed wetlands cws have inhibited their ability to remove emerging organic contaminants eocs at μg l or ng l levels manganese mn oxides were proposed as a solution as they are powerful oxidants with strong adsorptive capabilities in the present study triclosan tcs was selected as a typical eoc and cw microcosms with mn oxides birnessite coated sand b cws and without c cws were developed to test the removal capacities of tcs and common nutrients we found that the addition of mn oxides coated sand significantly improved removal efficiencies of tcs nh4 n cod no3 n and tp p 0 05 the average concentration of mn ii effluent was 0 036 mg l 1 mostly lower than the drinking water limit to gain insight into the mechanisms of pollution removal mn transformation dissolved oxygen do distribution bacterial abundance and microbial community composition were also investigated maximum mn ii was detected at 20 cm height of the b cws in anoxic zone although mn oxidizing bacteria existed in the layer of 30 50 cm with 103 104 cfu g 1 dry substate mn oxides were only detected at height from 40 to 50 cm with rich oxygen in b cw the quantities of bacterial 16s rrna amoa narg and nosz were not significantly different between two systems p 0 05 while illumina high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the abundance of denitrifying bacteria was significant higher in b cws and the abundance of gammaproteobacteria that have a recognized role in mn transformation were significantly increased the results indicated that mn oxides could enhance tcs and common pollutants removal in both anoxic and aerobic areas through the recycling of mn between mn ii and biogenic mn oxides graphical abstract image 1 keywords constructed wetlands manganese oxides triclosan manganese cycling 1 introduction in the last decade the removal of emerging organic contaminants eocs has gained a significant amount of attention in wastewater treatment eocs of specific concern include pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps pesticides and veterinary drugs although they are normally detected at very low concentrations between μg l and ng l levels their persistence toxicity and continuous release into environment may pose a risk to human and environmental health constructed wetlands cws utilize natural processes to remove of wastewater constituents which are widely used to alleviate contaminants in many kinds of wastewaters wu et al 2014 because of the structure of cws there are diverse oxygen conditions with sufficient oxygen at the upper layers and insufficient or even no oxygen at the lower layers liu et al 2016 interestingly diverse oxygen conditions provide several micro environments for various microbial communities which can aid in nitrogen removal by aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification li et al 2014 thus these micro environments can also offer different metabolic pathways allowing for the degradation of eocs through aerobic oxidation and anaerobic reduction better performance was also detected in various eocs treatment hijosa valsero et al 2010 matamoros et al 2008 rühmland et al 2015 however aerobic degradation of eocs is often more efficient than anaerobic ones despite the fact that reductive dehalogenation and the cleavage of ether bonds occur more easily under strictly anaerobic conditions vogel et al 1987 aerobic conditions are generally considered to be more effective in most eocs removal ghattas et al 2017 moreover highly halogenated aromatic compounds could not be totally degraded under anaerobic conditions in fact most of their metabolites need be further transformed under aerobic conditions therefore artificial aeration is often used to supply more oxygen and improve the removal of organic carbon sources in cws kahl et al 2017 liu et al 2016 nivala et al 2013 wiessner et al 2005 however in large scale cws this is impractical due to the high energy consumption of artificial aeration except aerobic conditions the relatively low concentrations of eocs also inhibit their biodegradation luo et al 2014 dordio et al 2010 in a recent study wen et al used vermiculite to enhance the removal of di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate by first adsorption and then biofilm biodegradation wen et al 2016 manganese mn oxides as a powerful oxidants with adsorptive capability has been reported to removal clarithromycin chlorophene diclofenac and triclosan in membrane bioreactors and column reactors at the lab scale water treatment processes forrez et al 2009 joshi et al 2017 accompanied with the oxidation of pollutants mn oxides mostly mno2 were shown to be reduced to mn ii with or without microbial reactions liang et al 2016 zhang and huang 2003 interestingly mn ii can be further oxidized to biogenic mn oxides by many kinds of microbes under oxygen rich conditions blothe et al 2015 liang et al 2016 biogenic mn oxides have shown a much higher adsorptive capability than both synthetic δ mno2 and the commercially available mn oxide pyrolusite primarily due to their large specific surface areas and small particle sizes forrez et al 2010a hennebel et al 2009 it was hypothesized that both mn oxides and biogenic mn oxides could provide a hopeful type of substrate for cws in eocs removal and the cycling of mn between mn ii and biogenic mn oxides could enhance the performance triclosan 2 4 4 trichloro 2 hydroxydiphenyl ether tcs is a synthetic antibacterial and antifungal agent widely used in soaps toothpaste cosmetics and other household cleaning lotions or medical disinfectants singer et al 2002 thus tcs is a ubiquitous pollutant that can be detected in all types of aquatic environments including rivers and cws at concentrations ranging from 10 to 5160 ng l 1 carranza diaz et al 2014 ramaswamy et al 2011 in this experiment tcs was selected as the typical eoc pollutant to investigate the performance of cws with mn oxides in the removal of eocs from wastewaters taking into consideration of the chemical and biological properties of cws mn oxides and mn transformation products mn oxides was only added at the lower layers substrate of cws under anoxic conditions the aim of this research was to elucidate 1 whether mn oxides could enhance the performance of cws in tcs and common pollutants removal 2 whether the cycling between mn ii and biogenic mn oxides formed at the upper layers of cws under aerobic conditions 3 whether microbes were involved in the process to this end the concentrations of pollutants and mn ii were analyzed the biogenic mn oxides formed were determined mn oxidizing bacteria microbial abundance and community structure were investigated here we present a new type of substrate for effective treatment of cws contaminated with eocs as well as common pollutants 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals tcs was purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany the internal standard

special gases co ltd shandong china birnessite coated sand was synthesized in batch 300 g of acid washed sand was added in a boiling solution of 1 mol of potassium permanganate in 2 5 l of water then 2 mol of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added drop wise to the solution while vigorously stirred after boiling for a further 10 min the precipitate was filtered and washed mckenzie 1981 then repeat ten times to get enough birnessite coated sand for our experiment the average mn oxidation state of the birnessite coated sand was 3 75 murray et al 1984 grebel et al 2016 2 2 lab scale vertical up flow subsurface cws set up to get rich oxygen for mn ii oxidation at upper layer of substrate vertical subsurface cws were selected garcía and bayona 2011 to test the function of mn oxides in the anoxic region of the cws up flow cws were adopted six lab scale cws were employed and consisted of column reactors which were used transparent rigid plexiglas cylinders with capacity of 10 6 l diameter of 15 cm height of 60 cm surface area of 0 018 m2 five sampling point of outlets at the height of 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm from the bottom were taped along the column reactors the highest sampling outlet was below the sand surface all cws consisted of 10 cm layer of gravel layer at the bottom with the diameter ranging from 1 to 3 cm six lab scale cws were divided into two groups one group was filled with washed river sand as substrate at a column depth from 10 to 50 cm and named c cws the other group contained a 20 cm layer of birnessite coated sand substituted for washed river sand at the height from 10 to 30 cm and named b cws fig s1 phragmites australis were chosen and collected from the local plant nursery jinan shandong china the well grown plants of similar size and height were selected removed the adherent soil and dead plant tissues by washing with tap water and transplanted into lab scale cws the plants were cultivated with 10 hoagland solution for about 2 weeks until they grew vigorously 2 3 experimental procedure and sampling the influent water was synthetic and mainly consisted of sucrose nh4 2so4 kh2po4 and kno3 to simulate polluted river water as reported by d huett et al 2005 its characteristics are listed in table s1 synthetic wastewater prepared using micronutrients required for normal plant growth was used during the experiment to investigate the effect of mn oxides on eocs removal and get anoxic environment where mn oxides coated sand was filled without the influence of oxygen synthetic wastewater was pre aerated with nitrogen gas n2 to maintain anoxic conditions and then continuously fed into the cws from bottom to top layer with a peristaltic pump the influent volume of wastewater was 3 l for each column per day with hydraulic loading rate of 8 cm d 1 and a hydraulic retention time of around 3 days after acclimation in the influent water for 2 weeks 80 μg l 1 of tcs was added to all the cws cws were then cultivated for two months until the removal efficiencies of tcs and common contaminants had reached their steady states water samples were homogenized and collected from the top outlet 50 cm of cws every 7 days for three months water samples from each outlet were collected every 4 weeks for tcs organic matter and nutrient determination substrate samples from the five sampling locations were collected and homogenized at the end of experiment for three months all samples were transported to the laboratory in a chilled insulating box for further analysis 2 4 chemical analysis and quantity control the concentration of soluble mn ii in the water samples was determined via aa 6300 atomic absorption spectrophotometry schimadzu forrez et al 2010b x ray diffraction xrd was used to study the substrate composition of b cws at the layer of 30 40 cm and 40 50 cm xrd data were recorded at ambient temperature on a bruker d8 advance powder diffractometer in the angular range 5 70 2θ

in triplicate amplicons were then purified with axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen and pooled 250 bp paired end sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons were performed using a illumina miseq instrument at shanghai yuanxu biotechnology co ltd illumina sequencing data was deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under bioproject number prjna393530 with biosample accession of samn07336348 2 7 data analysis data analyses were carried out using microsoft excel 2013 and the origin 8 5 software package the xrd patterns were analyzed by the software program jade statistically significant

wang et al 2007 abundance differences phylum and genus between samples were analyzed using meta analyses ouzounis et al 2009 principal component analysis pca was performed in canoco5 3 results and discussion 3 1 pollutant removal performance of different cws in wastewater treatment the removal of nh4 n no3 n cod and tp are main priorities during the experiment the concentrations of those four pollutants decreased and reached a steady state in the effluent fig 1 in fact for each contaminant there was a significant difference p 0 05 in concentrations between c cws and b cws concentrations of nh4 n reduced from 20 0 mg l 1 to 1 6 and 3 9 mg l 1 in the b cws and c cws respectively the average concentration of no3 n in b cw effluents were 1 9 mg l 1 only two fifths of that in c cws as for cod the average removal efficiency was 71 9 in b cws whereas it was only 57 6 in c cws moreover mn oxides decreased the final concentration of tp in b cws compared to c cws with the minimum concentration of 4 0 mg l 1 in b cws versus 6 8 mg l 1 in c cws tcs the ubiquitous chemical contaminant could be efficiently removed by cws in a previous study we showed that more than 80 0 of tcs can be removed in cws through the action of different species of wetland plants zhao et al 2016 as shown in fig 2 a more than 91 0 of tcs was removed from b cws with the minimum concentration of 5 0 μg l 1 however in c cws the average removal efficiency was only 83 8 furthermore minimum tcs effluent concentrations were 13 1 μg l 1 in c cws which was significantly higher than the b cws p 0 05 taking into consideration of the strong adsorptive capacity of mn oxides and hydrophobic property of tcs the amount of tcs adsorbed by substrate were measured table s2 showed that tcs adsorbed by mn oxide coated sand was 27 7 ng g 1 which was higher than uncoated sand of 19 3 ng g 1 however the amount of tcs absorbed by mn oxide minerals coated sand only took account of no more than 2 0 of total tcs removal so the priority of tcs removal was mainly induced by the oxidizing properties of mn oxides in b cws the support matrix in a wetland system can influence both physical and microbial structure stottmeister et al 2003 and at last pollutant removal performance in cws arias et al 2001 li et al 2008 it was easy to understand that mn oxides in a substrate could improve nitrification processes nh4 n and organic carbon transformation cod and tcs remucal and ginder vogel 2014 due to their strong oxidizing properties huguet et al 2013 hulth et al 1999 however it was very interesting that the denitrification was also enhanced in b cws the reason might be anaerobic mn ii oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction swathi et al 2017 which was further discussed in section 3 5 similar with iron and aluminum in constructed reed bed substrates arias et al 2001 fixation of phosphate by mn might be the key mechanisms of tp removal in b cws 3 2 pollution removal efficiencies along the height of cws diverse micro environments along the height provided various microbial habits led to different microbial communities and at last affected pollutant removal performance in the b cws cumulative removal efficiencies of tcs nh4 n no3 n and tp were all significantly increased from the height of 20 cm figs 2b and 3 especially when compared to the c cws indeed in the b cws tcs was removed at height of 30 cm with the maximum cumulative removal efficiency of 54 0 this was much higher than that of c cws with a maximum of 32 4 similarly concentrations of nh4 n were reduced to 13 2 and 8 4 mg l 1 at 20 cm and 30 cm heights in the b cws whereas the nh4 n concentrations reached 18 1 and 15 2 mg l 1 in the c cws the cumulative removal efficiency of nh4 n reached 58 5 at the height of 30 cm in b cws whereas it only reached 24 8 in c cws concentrations of cod and tp presented similar trends as nh4 n in that they were quickly removed with the addition of mn oxides although the concentrations of no3 n were also significantly decreased in b cws compared to c cws p 0 05 the effects were not as obvious as what was seen with the other pollutants at a 30 cm height the concentrations of no3 n were 5 2 and 8 0 mg l 1 in b cws and c cws respectively and then compared with c cws b cws kept their priority in pollutant removal at the height from 30 to 50 cm without mn oxides addition to summarize addition of mn oxides could promote the removal of all tested pollutants in both mn oxides layer and upper layer at the height of 30 50 cm 3 3 the concentration of mn ii and the existence of mn oxides along the height of cws mn oxides were reduced to mn ii as organic contaminants and nh4 n were oxidized fig 4 a the highest concentration of mn ii was at the height of 20 cm in b cws this is where tcs and other pollutants were also removed most quickly this is in accordance with prior studies that mn oxides are reduced to mn ii as pollutants are oxidized bartlett et al 2008 hulth et al 2005 luther et al 1997 and then the concentration of mn ii quickly decreased with the water flowing as mn ii concentration is one of controlling specifications of water quality cerrato et al 2010 we measured mn ii concentrations in the final outlet most of the mn ii concentrations below 0 05 mg l 1 only one time was as high as 0 098 mg l 1 which is higher than the us epa water quality criteria 0 05 mg l 1 but lower than the national standard for drinking water in china 0 10 mg l 1 weng et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 compared with substrate before experiment some new diffraction peaks of xrd pattern were appeared at substrate layer of 40 50 cm of post experiment in b cws which were related to namno2 fig 5 because mn ii could only be oxidize to mn oxides via the action of mn oxidizing bacteria in environment the examined mn oxides were biogenic mn oxides nealson and saffarini 1994 furthermore only under aerobic conditions mn ii could be oxidized by microbes nealson and ford 1980 zhang et al 2015 fig 4b showed the concentration of do was the highest at the height of 50 cm with 2 4 mg l 1 and then sharply dropped to 1 4 and 0 8 mg l 1 at height of 40 cm in b cws and c cws respectively at the height of 10 cm do concentration reached almost zero although mn ii was decreased at the height from 30 to 40 fig 4a mn oxides was not detected at the layer the results might be explained by either low concentration of mn oxides formation or mn ii adsorption by substrate zhang and huang 2005 it was interesting that do concentrations in b cws were much higher than that of c cws at the height from 20 to 40 cm with the same design and operation most oxygen was consumed by degraded organic matter and nitrification reaction nivala et al 2013 however the concentrations of pollutants in b cws were less than that of c cws at the height from 20 to 40 cm figs 2b and 3 which needed less oxygen for further pollutant removal and would provide more sufficient oxygen for mn ii oxidization our results confirmed that mn oxides were formed in the upper layer 40 50 cm of cws under aerobic conditions zhang and huang 2003 2005 3 4 quantities of mn oxidizing bacteria and nitrogen related genes mn oxidizing microbes have been linked to the production of biogenic mn oxides in terrestrial freshwater and marine environments tani et al 2003 numbers of mn oxidizing bacteria in the b cws and c cws were presented in table 1 results showed that mn oxidizing bacteria in b cws were 104 and 103 104 cfu g 1 dry substrate at the height of 40 50 cm and 30 40 cm respectively however in c cws these bacteria were only 10 102 cfu g 1 at the height of 40 50 cm and not detectable at 30 40 cm although there were mn oxidizing bacteria mn oxides were not detected at layer of 30 40 cm in b cws and at layer of 40 50 cm in c cw except the existence of mn ii mn oxidizing bacteria could oxidize mn ii to biogenic mn oxides under conditions with some extent do garcía and bayona 2011 otherwise the transformation rate will be decreased or restricted due to higher do concentration fig 4b mn oxides only detected at the layer of 40 50 cm in b cws microbial action is recognized as one of the dominant mechanisms of pollutant removals in cws zhao et al 2016 quantities of bacterial 16s rrna genes determined by qpcr are often used to estimate the quantity of the intact bacterial cells and thus the organic removal efficiency of a system shin et al 2010 the absolute abundances of bacterial 16s rrna varied within 8 10 orders of magnitude and were not significantly different between the two treatment groups p 0 05 table s3 quantification of bacteria and related genes capable of nitrification and denitrification have also been used to reflect nh4 n and no3 n removal performance baek et al 2010 however in this study despite the performance of b cws exceeding the c cws quantities of nitrification and denitrification related genes amoa narg nosz were not significantly different between the two treatment groups p 0 05 table s3 3 5 shifts in microbial community structure microbial community composition could also impact the pollution removal efficiencies in an ecosystem the influences of microbial communities on nutrient cycling have been reported in many studies landesman and dighton 2010 song et al 2012 to characterize the microbial community composition samples at 20 30 cm and 40 50 cm heights were selected from b cws and c cws for community structure analysis and named b 20 b 50 c 20 and c 50 respectively community structure was characterized using illumina high throughput sequencing after de multiplexing and quality filtering a total of 150 038 high quality sequences were obtained table s4 species coverage estimates ranged from 91 95 to 96 82 with otus ranging from 2981 to 5526 both community richness chao and ace and species diversity shannon index were different between the b cws and c cws indicating a shift of microbial community composition with the addition of mn oxides results showed that mn oxides had a positive effect on the microbial richness and diversity at both heights which might be attributed to the better removal of tcs and other common pollutants in the b cws microbial composition at phylum level is shown in fig 6 sequences that could not be classified into any known group were assigned as unclassified bacteria of the 26 known phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria verrucomicrobia and chloroflexi were dominant in microbial communities accounting for 66 8 b 50 73 3 b 20 72 0 c 50 and 73 1 c 20 of all detected microbial organisms which was in accordance with what has been reported in former studies using both natural wetlands and cws ansola et al 2014 proteobacteria abundance was positive correlated with tcs removal louis et al 2013 furthermore proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all samples especially for the b 20 sample in b 20 proteobacteria accounted for 54 9 which was significantly different from c 20 furthermore within the proteobacteria there was high level of bacterial metabolic diversity which was related to global carbon or nitrogen cycling and dominated the wastewater treatment process ansola et al 2014 we postulate that the high abundance of this species could also contribute to the removal of the common contaminants fig 1 there were also significant differences in the subgroups of proteobacteria between the two types of cws fig 7 a betaproteobacteria was the dominant group in c cws accounting for 65 9 and 37 7 of the microbial community in c 20 and c 50 respectively however gammaproteobacteria was the dominant group in b cws accounting for 31 1 and 36 6 of the microbial community in b 20 and b 50 respectively this finding is consistent with previous work that observed that gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant group in deep sea manganese nodules and this group of organisms drove a biologically closed manganese cycle within these nodules blothe et al 2015 these results along with the increased mn oxidizing bacteria richness and mn oxides formation in the b cws in section 3 4 indicated that a mn cycle was formed and played a role in pollutant removal from b cws in addition the relative abundance of bacteroidetes fig 7b which was the second abundant phylum and has been previously reported to degrade chlorinated compounds by reductive dechlorination li et al 2013 was similar between b cws and c cws however the richness of sphingobacteria one class of bacteroidetes was different between b 20 and c 20 with 52 5 and 39 8 respectively former studies have demonstrated that purified strains of sphingobacteria could biodegrade tcs and other aromatic pollutants with similar structures kim et al 2011 thus higher abundance of sphingobacteria in b cws likely also contributed to the better tcs removal performance fig 2 the relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria table s5 showed no difference between two treatment groups p 0 05 coupled with mn ii formation section 3 3 and the fact that the abundance of the nitrification gene amoa in two groups had no difference section 3 4 we postulate that oxidation via mn oxides played the main role in increasing nitrification above the level of the controls although the gene related to denitrification narg was not significantly different between b cws and c cws the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria in b cws was higher than c cws which could have contributed to no3 n removal since narg represents only membrane bound nitrate reductase analysis based on narg might exclude those bacteria possessing the periplasmic nitrate reductase or unknown nitrate reductase cheneby et al 2003 thus we postulated that the denitrification process was catalyzed by bacteria harboring non membrane bound nitrate reductase and that an anoxic mn ii oxidation coupled with denitrification simultaneously occurred as observed in swathi et al 2017 this was supported by the fact that the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria increased 9 fold at the height of 20 cm under anoxic conditions while only 1 7 fold at the height of 50 cm under aerobic conditions in b cws table s5 furthermore abundance of organic carbon was the most important factors in the heterotrophic denitrification process wan et al 2017 thus the lower cod concentration was correlated with higher nitrate removal efficiency meaning that more cod was utilized for denitrification fig 1 3 6 proposed mechanism of pollution removal in b cws based on the results presented here we derived a mechanism of pollutant removal in the b cws fig 8 tcs and some other pollutant were susceptible to chemical oxidation by mno2 under both aerobic and anoxic conditions forrez et al 2011 zhang et al 2008 in the height of 10 30 cm under anoxic conditions pollutants including tcs nh4 n and other organic carbon compounds were first absorbed and then oxidized by mn oxides birnessite as mn ii was produced gammaproteobacteria acted to accelerate pollutant oxidization blothe et al 2015 lee et al 2014 denitrification coupled with mn ii oxidation were speculated to occur in the b cws resulting in no3 n removal in the height between 30 and 50 cm mn oxidizing bacteria accumulated in the b cws these bacteria have the ability to re oxidize the mn ii under aerobic conditions and produce biogenic mn oxides at the layer of 40 50 cm biogenic mn oxides could more effectively absorb and oxidize pollutants due to their high specific surface areas hennebel et al 2009 and high catalytic reactivity forrez et al 2010b however little mn ii was detected in this height we suspect that this is either due to oxidization of mn ii by mn oxidizing bacteria under sufficient oxygen conditions nealson and ford 1980 zhu et al 2010 or adsorption of mn ii by mn oxides and substrate zhang and huang 2005 4 conclusions mn oxides could enhance the performance of cws in pollutant removal through their strong oxidizing properties and adsorptive capacities under anoxic conditions at the height from 10 to 30 cm tcs nh4 n no3 n and other organic carbon sources were all removed efficiently as mn ii was formed at upper layer from 30 to 50 cm height the concentrations of pollution continued decreasing with the decline of mn ii and biogenic mn oxides were formed in aerobic condition from 40 to 50 cm height at the final outlet most of mn ii concentrations were below the drinking water limit 0 05 mg l 1 under both anoxic and aerobic conditions not only the changing of microbial structure but also the abundance of gammaproteobacteria and mn oxidizing bacteria were all involved in the mn cycle and at last improved the removal efficiency of tcs in b cws in conclusion cycling of mn between mn ii and biogenic mn oxides did set up and enhanced pollutant removal in cws in both anoxic and aerobic areas acknowledgments this work was supported by shandong provincial natural science zr2015bm004 and

19444,this work is to evaluate pilot scale revolving algal biofilm rab reactors of two heights 0 9 m and 1 8 m tall to treat supernatant from sludge sedimentation at metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago mwrd for removing nutrients n and p as well as various metals the rab reactors demonstrated a superior performance in n and p removal as compared to control raceway ponds taller 1 8 m rab reactors performed better than 0 9 m rab reactors in terms of total nutrient removal and algal biomass productivity at 7 day hrt total p tp and total kjeldahl n tkn removal efficiency reached to 80 and 87 respectively while ortho p and ammonia removal efficiency reached to 100 decreasing hrt led to an enhanced tp and tkn removal rate and nutrient removal capacity at hrt of 1 3 day the tp removal per footprint of 1 8 m tall rab reactors was around 7 times higher than the open pond system the rab reactors also showed certain capabilities of removing metals from wastewater the study demonstrated that rab based treatment process is an effective method to recover nutrients from municipal wastewater graphical abstract image keywords revolving algal biofilm sludge thickening municipal wastewater nutrients removal metals removal pilot scale 1 introduction strict national pollution discharge elimination system npdes limits set by the united states environmental protection agency usepa and state regulatory agencies on effluent nutrient limits have driven municipal wastewater reclamation plants wrps to remove and preferably recover nutrients from wastewater table 1 the npdes permit program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants to waters of the united states currently wrps are facing the challenge of developing low energy low carbon based technologies for nitrogen n and phosphorus p recovery for example ammonia can be converted into n2 gas through nitrification and denitrification however the nitrification process requires intensive aeration while the denitrification needs additional carbon e g methanol which increases the operating costs anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process reduces the energy and carbon requirements but the anaerobic process is inhibited by low oxygen exposure egli et al 2001 and also sensitivity to nitrite strous et al 1999 enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr requires an organic carbon for polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos growth and the aerobic stage of ebpr requires energy intensive aeration yuan et al 2012 as an alternative to the traditional bacteria based nutrient removal methods microalgae have been widely studied for removal of nutrients from wastewater due to their capability of simultaneous assimilation of n and p compared to other nutrient recovery methods the growth of microalgae does not need organic carbon because algal cells perform photo autotrophic metabolism using co2 aeration a high energy input commonly used in traditional bacteria based process can also be avoided algal based wastewater treatment however is hindered by limitations associated with the engineering design of the algal culture systems for example open raceway ponds have been commonly used for large scale algal cultivation chaumont 1993 christenson and sims 2011 however implementation of algal raceway ponds at wrps particularly in urban suburban areas is not practical due to the large land required and requirement of longer hydraulic resident times hrt in the tune of weeks to months another system enclosed photobioreactors are capital intensive and have a low volume throughput harvesting algae biomass from each of these systems is also challenging due to the low cell density in the treated water to overcome the shortcoming of algal raceway ponds and photobioreactors algal attached growth based systems have drawn great attention as a wastewater treatment method for example boelee et al 2011 established continuous wastewater treatment system via a 30 6 2 cm3 algal biofilm reactor to reduce the effluent n and p concentration to 2 2 mg l and 0 15 mg l respectively a rope based algal biofilm reactors at different scales 8 8000 l and hrts 2 6 day for treating tertiary wastewater were also reported christenson and sims 2012 shayan et al 2016 currently however the development of algal biofilm based wastewater treatment is still premature for example the majority of these algal biofilm system have been based on lab scale boelee et al 2011 shi et al 2014 sukačová et al 2015 synthetic wastewater not the real wastewater was used in many studies boelee et al 2014 karya et al 2013 li et al 2015 the operation durations of these studies were also relatively short in recent years researchers at iowa state university isu have developed a revolving algal biofilm rab reactor for algal attached growth gross et al 2013 2015b 2016 gross and wen 2014 2018 in the rab system the revolving growth attachment material belt rotates through the wastewater stream absorbs nutrients then rotates out of the water to facilitate light exposure and gas co2 and o2 exchanges the vertical configuration of the revolving belt allows for greater surface area exposure to sunlight in a much smaller footprint compared to an open raceway pond in anticipation of future stringent nutrient discharge limits and recognizing the potential of the rab system to recover nutrients the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago mwrd teamed with isu researchers to deploy pilot scale rab systems at the terrence j o brien o brien wrp in skokie il usa pilot studies consisted of two 0 9 m tall rab reactors two 1 8 m tall rab reactors and two control raceway ponds the pilot units were started in january 2016 and operated for a half year long evaluation of the rab system s nutrients n and p removal and algae biomass production on a variety of wastewater streams the heavy metal removal from wastewater and accumulation in the algae biomass were also studied to date only limited studies have been conducted to evaluate algal biofilm based wastewater treatment process using a real wastewater stream from a wrp at such an extended period de assis et al 2017 lee et al 2014 the main objectives of pilot studies were to test the performance of the unique rab reactors to remove and recover nutrients from wastewater and to compare algal biomass productivity of rab reactors to control raceway ponds 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater stream mwrd s o brien wrp uses primary clarification and activated sludge for removing total suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand the sludge from the primary and secondary sediment tanks are combined in gravity concentration tanks for thickening resulting in a supernatant side stream designated as o brien supernatant on a daily basis the wastewater sample was transferred to a storage tank in a green house algal facility where the rab based algal reactors was co located the sample was then stored for less than 1 h before being pumped into the rab reactor for processing 2 2 algal biofilm reactor design rab systems were used to treat the o brien supernatant the design configuration of the rab system is described in the literature gross and wen 2014 gross et al 2015b fig 1 a shows the design concept of the rab system in brief a flexible material similar to a conveyor belt belt was stretched around drive shafts to form a vertical configuration the lowest region of the belt was submerged in a medium reservoir to supply nutrients while the rest of the belt was exposed to the gas phase for direct access to light and carbon dioxide the shafts were driven by a motor rotating the belt between the liquid and gas phases a liquid reservoir 2 43 m long 1 83 m wide 0 22 m deep containing 1000 l liquid wastewater was retrofitted four sections of attachment belt each with serpentine design fig 1b each section of belt was 1 m wide two heights of the rab reactors were tested 1 8 m tall with a surface area of 43 5 m2 and 0 9 m tall with a surface area of 23 4 m2 the rotating speed of the belt was 4 cm s 1 in addition two control raceway ponds with the same dimension as the reservoir in the rab system but without the attachment belts were used as controls all the reactors were placed inside a greenhouse facility where natural sunlight was fluctuated with the local climate conditions the greenhouse was heated in winter with the air temperature ranging from 10 c to 30 c throughout the experimental period while the influent water temperature was within the range of 10 20 c 2 3 algal biofilm reactor operation procedures in november 2015 the reservoir of rab reactors and the control ponds were inoculated with a polyculture of microalgae prepared at the isu research facility at ames iowa usa and algal consortium growing in clarifiers at mwrd o brien wrp the rab reactor was incubated with the algae seed culture for two months during which the liquid of the rab reservoir was replaced for 2 3 time with the fresh seed culture in late january 2016 when a stable biofilm was established on the rab belt the rab reactors were switched to a semi continuous operation mode by discharging effluent from and feeding the influent o brien supernatant into the rab reservoir from 1 26 2016 to 4 12 2016 500 l of effluent in the rab reservoir 1000 l working volume was discharged every 3 5 days and then the same amount of the influent was added to the reservoir this operation provided an hrt equivalent to 7 day from 4 12 2016 to 6 10 2016 the hrt was reduced to 4 7 day equivalent i e every 3 5 days 750 l of effluent in the rab reservoir was discharged with the same amount of influent was added from 6 10 2016 to 7 15 2016 the hrt was further reduced to 1 3 day by discharging 750 l effluent and adding the same amount of influent on a daily basis throughout the operation period the biomass was harvested every 7 days considering the rab reactor has four belt sections to ensure the biomass in the rab reactor be maintained at an approximately even amount throughout the 7 day harvest cycle each belt section was harvested at different schedule throughout the week the algae in the rab biofilm was harvested in situ by scraping the biomass from the belt with a scraper blade the biomass in the control pond was harvested by centrifugation harvested algae from the rab biofilm is a paste like material with a moisture content of 85 90 w w which is similar to the cell pellets obtained from centrifugation of the suspended growth algae it should be noted that the reporting period for this study from january to july 2016 about 180 days is overall representative to the climatic conditions in chicago area day night time temperature and the wmrd o brien facility wastewater effluent conditions nutrients levels 2 4 chemical analyses total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and tp in algae biomass and water were extracted by sulfuric acid digestion and measured using kjeldahl procedure bremner 1996 and the modified ascorbic acid method murphy and riley 1962 respectively ortho p was analyzed by filtering the water samples through 0 45 μm filter without acid digestion the p concentration of all digested or undigested samples was determined by a spectrophotometer using the molybdate blue method murphy and riley 1962 ammonium were determined with the lachat autoanalyzer lachat quick chem systems milwaukee wi u s for analysis of total metals in water samples and algal biomass samples were digested in concentrated nitric acid and concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes 2 5 evaluation of the nutrient removal performance the nutrient

0 05 being defined as statistically significant 3 results 3 1 nutrient removal performance the nutrient concentrations in the o brien supernatant treated by the 1 8 m rab reactor and control pond are shown in fig 2 the data for the 0 9 m rab effluent were not presented to allow for figure presentation clarity the influent nutrient concentrations tp ortho p tkn and ammonia were at a relatively stable level throughout the entire period of operation the tp concentration of the 1 8 m rab effluent was lower than the control pond fig 2a indicating a better treatment performance by the 1 8 m rab reactor the ortho p concentrations in the 1 8 m rab effluent were similar to the control pond effluent when hrt was 7 day but when hrt was reduced to 4 7 day and 1 3 day the 1 8 m rab effluent had a lower ortho p than the control pond fig 2b the effluent tkn concentration fig 2c and ammonia concentration fig 2d of the 1 8 m rab reactor and the control pond demonstrated a similar trend as those the tp and ortho p respectively i e similar treatment at 7 day hrt and better treatment achieved in rab at a lower hrt level in summary the effluent nutrient concentrations presented in fig 2 clearly demonstrate a better nutrient removal performance in the rab reactor than the control pond to provide deeper insight and quantitative nutrient removal performance of the different types of reactors the nutrient concentrations in both the influent and effluent derived from 0 9 m rab 1 8 m rab and open pond reactors were derived into various parameters including nutrient removal rate nutrient removal efficiency and nutrient removal capacity per footprint area and nutrient removal capacity per belt surface area 3 1 1 tp removal parameters fig 3 a shows that tp removal rate of the rab reactors was between 0 5 and 0 8 mg l day when hrt were at 7 day and 4 7 day when hrt was reduced to 1 3 day the tp removal rate of 1 8 m rab reactor increased significantly to 3 4 mg l day the control pond only had 0 4 0 8 mg l day removal through all the hrt levels fig 3b shows that the rab reactors achieved 60 90 tp removal at 7 day and 4 7 day of hrt decreasing hrt to 1 3 day reduced the tp removal efficiency overall tp removal efficiencies of the rab reactors were higher than the control pond which was less than 60 throughout all the hrt levels the footprint based tp removal capacity fig 3c had a similar trend with the tp removal rate fig 3a i e the 1 8 m rab reactor resulted in a higher footprint based removal capacity than the 0 9 m rab reactor fig 3c in particular at 1 3 day of hrt the 1 8 m rab reactor had a maximum removal of 660 mg tp m2 day as compared to the control pound which only had a maximum of 160 mg tp m2 day when the belt surface based tp removal capacity is considered however the rab reactors showed an opposite tend i e the 0 9 m rab reactor had a slightly higher capacity than the 1 8 m rab reactor fig 3d 3 1 2 ortho p removal parameters all the three reactors demonstrated a similar performance of ortho p removal at 7 day hrt fig 4 at this hrt level the ortho p concentration in the effluents of all three reactors were 0 01 mg l fig 2b resulting in almost 100 ortho p removal efficiency fig 4b decreasing hrt from 7 day to 1 3 day provided additional ortho p to the algal cells and thus significantly p 0 05 enhanced ortho p removal rate fig 4a and removal capacities fig 4c and d on a footprint basis the 1 8 m rab reactor removed 220 mg ortho p m2 day at 1 3 day hrt while the control pond s ortho p removal capacity was only 70 mg m2 day at the same hrt level fig 4c overall the rab reactors had a better nutrient removal performance than the control pond and the 1 8 m rab performed better than the 0 9 m rab reactor fig 4a c except the belt surface based ortho p removal capacity fig 4d where the 0 9 m rab had a better ortho p removal capacity than the 1 8 m rab reactor 3 1 3 tkn removal parameters the trends of tkn removal rate fig 5 a removal capacity footprint based fig 5c and removal capacity belt surface based fig 5d with the different height rab reactors and hrts were similar to those of the tp removal parameters however the tkn removal efficiencies of the rab reactors were maintained at a higher level 80 through all the hrts fig 5b which were much higher than those of the control raceway ponds fig 5b at hrt 1 3 day the 1 8 m rab reactor demonstrated a superior footprint based tkn removal capacity performance 2300 mg tkn m2 day compared to 1200 mg m2 day tkn removed by the control pond fig 5c 3 1 4 ammonia removal parameters the trend of ammonia removal parameters with different algal reactors and the hrts were quite different from those of tkn removal parameters at 7 day and 4 7 day hrt levels ammonia removal rate removal efficiency and removal capacities of all the three reactors were very similar fig 6 a d the reason was due to a complete removal of ammonia from the influent at these two hrt levels fig 2d which lead to ammonia limitation scenarios when hrt was reduced to 1 3 day ammonia feeding to the algal reactor improved as a result much higher removal rates were observed for all the three reactors fig 6a while ammonia removal efficiency of the control pond decreased slightly 90 at hrt of 1 3 day the two ammonia removal capacity parameters footprint based and belt surface based increased significantly compared to the other hrt levels 3 2 metal removal from influent and accumulation in algal biomass the rab reactors and the control pond were further evaluated for their absorption of metals from the o brien supernatant as shown in table 2 the influent contains appreciable amount of sodium 117 mg l calcium 73 mg l magnesium 28 mg l and potassium 13 mg l 1 2 mg l of iron and zinc and trace amount less than 1 mg l of chromium nickel manganese copper non metal selenium was also detected in the influent with a trace amount aluminum arsenic cadmium and lead were not detected in the influent both rab reactors and control pond showed certain capabilities of removing those metals while the removal efficiencies varied with reactor type and element species table 2 chromium and nickel were removed completely from the influent by all the three reactors the rab reactors had much higher removal efficiencies on manganese and zinc p 0 05 than the open pond for calcium copper iron potassium and selenium the removal efficiencies of rab reactors and open pond were not significantly different p 0 05 magnesium and sodium were not removed by any of the algal reactors the content of these elements in the biomass of the rab reactors were also evaluated table 2 as shown in table 2 several observations were highlighted here first the biomass contained certain amount of aluminum cadmium lead and trace amount of arsenic although these four elements were below detection limits in the original influent this indicates that trace amount of those elements existed in the influent but below detection levels the biomass in the rab reactors can accumulate those elements second algal biomass can completely remove chromium and nickel the 0 9 m rab biomass contained higher content of these two elements than the 1 8 m rab biomass the reason may be that as all chromium and nickel were absorbed from the influent the 0 9 m rab and 1 8 m rab absorbed the equal amount of each element but the 1 8 m rab generated more biomass than the 0 9 m rab which resulted a dilution effect of the element content in the biomass third the biomass from 0 9 m rab and 1 8 m rab reactors contained similar content of manganese zinc calcium copper iron potassium and selenium which may indicate the absorptions of those elements per unit of biomass were saturated although 1 8 m rab reactor generated more biomass finally table 2 indicates that the biomass from the rab reactors contained more than 5000 mg l of magnesium although the effluent removal of this element from influent was not statistically significant however the biomass contained trace amounts of sodium although sodium concentration in the influent was high 117 mg l this indicates different capabilities of these two elements absorption by the algal biomass in the rab reactors in addition to data presented in table 2 hrt 7 day the metal removal and biomass metal content were also measured at 4 7 day hrt the results were similar to those reported in table 2 data not shown however the data at 1 3 day hrt were not determined 3 3 algal biomass production and chemical composition the algal growth in the rab reactors was also evaluated to provide a holistic view of the rab performance when treating wastewater here the biomass productivities based on the footprint and the surface belt were evaluated as shown in fig 7 for both 0 9 m rab and 1 8 m rab reactors decreasing hrt led to a higher biomass productivity under the same hrt level however the two rab reactors showed different trends when the footprint based biomass productivity is concerned the 1 8 m rab resulted in a much higher biomass productivity per square meter of footprint than the 0 9 m rab reactor throughout all the hrt levels studied with the 1 8 m rab reactor achieving the highest productivity 7 0 g m2 day at 1 3 day hrt fig 7a fig 7b shows that the belt surface based biomass productivity of 1 8 m rab reactor was slightly lower than that of the 0 9 m rab reactor although this difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 this phenomenon was probably caused by the more mutual shading in the higher rab belts it should be noted that during the experiment we also quantified the total suspended solid tss content in the liquid it shows that the tss of the rab reservoir was on an average of 20 35 mg l significantly lower than the tss in o brien supernatant influent 110 170 mg l meanwhile the tss in the control raceway pond was around 200 mg l these tss data indicated that the algal suspended growth in the rab reservoir was very minimal additionally during the entire 180 day of operation during this project we did not observe any detachment of the biomass from the biofilm this was due to that the short harvest frequency used in this work every 7 days avoided the extended cell residence in the biofilm the n and p content of the biomass harvested from the rab reactors are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8a n content of the biomass was in the range of 5 5 7 0 without significant p 0 05 variations among different rab reactors and hrt levels the results indicate that the algal cells in the rab biofilm may have reached the maximum capacity of absorbing n for proteins synthesis using the n to protein conversion ratio of 5 95 lópez 2010 the protein content in the biomass was estimated as 33 42 wt fig 8b shows the p content of the biomass a decreasing hrt resulted in a higher p content probably due to fast algal growth at lower hrt levels eixler et al 2006 kulaev and vagabov 1983 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient removal performance results of this study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of using rab reactors for treating municipal wastewater the rab reactors showed a higher removal rate and removal efficiency of tp and tkn than the raceway pond this higher removal rate and removal efficiency were most likely due to higher biomass productivity in the rab system as compared to raceway ponds previous studies also reported that the algal biofilm has a better capability of degrading the organic portion of the tp and tkn through a mineralization process bridgham et al 1998 or physical adsorptions of the organic compounds by extracellular polymeric substance eps sabater et al 2007 in terms of ortho p and ammonia removal the rab reactors had a similar removal performance as the control pond particularly at hrt of 7 day and 4 7 day this was probably due to the limitation of these two nutrients which is evidenced by the near zero concentration of ortho p and ammonia in the reactor effluents fig 2b and d at longer hrts however it should be noted that at hrt of 7 day and 4 7 day algal growth may not be limited by total nitrogen and total phosphorus although ammonia and ortho p concentration reached to zero this is because ammonia may be oxidized into nitrite and nitrate by the algae bacteria system while luxury p update in the algal cells alleviate the p limitation at this condition the rab system may be limited by other factors and a reduced hrt i e an increased flow rate can alleviate these limiting factor s in traditional open raceway ponds low hrt will eventually result in algae cells being washed out of the reactors in the rab reactors this will not be a concern as the attachment of algae on the belt surface separates the solid and hydraulic retention times additionally nutrient removal efficiency results at a short hrt 1 3 day clearly show the advantage of the rab nutrient removal efficiency compared to the open pond figs 3b 4b and 5b and 6b on the footprint basis cf equation 3 this work shows that the 1 8 m rab reactors had about 4 times as high tp removal capacity fig 3c and 2 times as high tkn removal capacity fig 5c as the open ponds the ortho p fig 4c and ammonia fig 6c removal capacity based on footprint at short hrt level i e 1 3 day also demonstrate the superior performance of the rab reactors than the open pond between the two rab reactors the 1 8 m rab reactor resulted in a higher tp tkn and ammonia removal capacity than the 0 9 m rab reactor figs 3c 4c and 5c further indicating the benefit of footprint saving by the rab reactors the small footprint of the rab system is another advantage for municipal wrps which are often located in urban suburban areas and limited by land availability if a treatment plant installs an algal culture system to remove same amount nutrients from the wastewater the required footprint will be less for the rab system as compared to the open raceway pond with the further optimization for the rab reactors such as the reactor height belt speed and the attachment materials it is likely that the nutrient removal capacity can be further increased which means the required land to accommodate the rab reactors can be further reduced on the belt surface basis cs equation 4 however figs 3d 4d and 5d 6d showed that the nutrient removal capacity of 1 8 m rab was somewhat lower than the 0 9 m rab although this reduction for some nutrient species such as tp was not significant p 0 05 this phenomenon was likely caused by the mutual shading between different belts in the rab reactor which eventually decreased cell growth and nutrient removal per unit of belt surface this problem can be overcome by several measures such as properly adjusting the positions of the belts to introduce more lighting or adding artificial lighting devices further development of the rab reactors needs to be carefully designed to balance the footprint based and belt surface based capacities 4 2 metal removal and accumulation in algal biomass heavy metals in water bring critical global public health concerns some heavy metal ions such as arsenic cadmium chromium lead and mercury are of public health concern even with very low concentrations tchounwou et al 2012 bio based absorbents have been considered an attractive option for metal removal from water due to their abundance relatively low cost strong metal binding capacity and high efficiency in dilute effluents monteiro et al 2011 as a promising bio based material microalgae has shown notable biosorption ability due to the negative charged groups on their cell surface ayangbenro and babalola 2017 in particular the results obtained here table 2 demonstrated that the rab reactors can effectively remove some metals which could be due to the unique features of the biofilm matrix gross et al 2015a in general algal biofilm contains a significant amount of eps including polysaccharide protein humic substances uronic acid nucleic acid and lipids comte et al 2008 previous research had shown that eps was capable of physically binding heavy metals under natural conditions fomina and gadd 2014 therefore the high metal removal efficiency of rab system observed in this study may be due to this unique feature of eps however it should be noted that some heavy metals can be enriched in the biomass since this algae biomass is grown on wastewater beneficial uses of this biomass for land application will fall under 40cfr part 503 regulations u s epa 1994 metal concentrations of algal biomass reported in this study is below the ceiling concentrations limits under part 503 regulations and may be allowed for land application u s epa 1994 moreover at this time mwrd is evaluating many other beneficial uses of this biomass including co digestion with solids from activated sludge process however the metal content in the biomass needs to be closely monitored for future beneficial uses of produced algae biomass 4 3 algal biomass production and chemical composition the wastewater streams significantly affect the algal growth and thus the nutrient removal of the rab reactor for example in an independent rab algal biomass growth study gross and wen 2014 in which a synthetic medium recipe was used the rab reactors produced 5 17 g m2 day footprint based biomass and 3 5 g m2 day belt surface based biomass at an hrt of 14 days these values were much higher than the corresponding results obtained in the current o brien rab reactors 1 7 g m2 day footprint based biomass and 0 3 0 9 g m2 day belt surface based biomass fig 7 it should be noted that the o brien supernatant contained a certain level of organic carbon 50 200 mg l of cod which may boost the bacteria growth on the rab belt the co existence of the indigenous algae and bacteria has been reported to represent a more stable system for wastewater treatment than only bacteria or algae roeselers et al 2007 a microscopic observation revealed the existence of bacteria in the rab biofilm while the majority of the microalgae in the biofilm included filamentous cyanobacteria and green algae such as scenedesmus pediastrum and chlorella these algal species were also commonly reported in other municipal wastewater treatment processes table 3 4 4 comparison of the microalgal based system for treating municipal wastewater to date various algae based processes have been reported to treat municipal wastewater streams for nutrients n and p removal a comprehensive summary of these treatment processes are summarized in table 3 this research is diversified in terms of wastewater streams used the initial nutrient concentrations in the influent the scale of the algae systems and the nutrient removal efficiencies the table shows that the influent nutrient concentration varied widely depending on the wastewater streams used also as real municipal wastewater was used in these studies the nutrient concentrations in the influent fluctuated widely which also resulted in a large variation in the nutrient removal efficiencies in general pure algal culture is hard to maintain for these algae treatment systems particularly at a larger scale the algal culture may also be compounded with bacteria growth due to the organic carbon contained in the wastewater as a result an indigenous algae and bacteria consortium existed in most of pilot scale suspended systems and all biofilm systems it should be noted that the majority of the reports in table 3 was based on suspended growth systems at a small scale 100 l with limited number of algal biofilm systems the pilot study reported in this work demonstrates a superior performance for nutrient removal compared to other reports table 3 however it should be noted there are still room to further improve the performance of the rab reactors from both the reactor design such as height the belt materials and operation such as hrt and lighting perspectives 5 conclusion this work demonstrates that the rab system can efficiently remove nutrients from wastewater in municipal wrps as a hybrid system for biomass production and domestic sewage treatment the rab reactors can be integrated into conventional raceway ponds with part of the biomass attached and other part suspended the nutrient removal performance depends on the rab reactor design such as the height the operational parameters such as the hrt and specific nutrient species overall taller rab reactors 1 8 m rab and a shorter hrt i e 1 3 day resulted in a better nutrient removal performance than shorter rab reactors 0 9 m rab with a longer hrt 4 7 and 7 day the rab reactor resulted in a much higher tp and tkn removal efficiency than a control open pond in particular the tp removal capacity per footprint area was 4 times higher than the open pond the ortho p and ammonia removal efficiencies of the rab reactors were comparable to the traditional open pond system at higher hrt 6 day and 4 7 day but rab had better removal efficiencies of these two nutrients when hrt was reduced to 1 3 day the rab reactors also removed various metals from the wastewater in the future reactor design and operation optimization are needed to practically implement the rab reactor in the municipal wrps also the suspended biomass needs to be accessed for their growth nutrient content and metal removal

19444,this work is to evaluate pilot scale revolving algal biofilm rab reactors of two heights 0 9 m and 1 8 m tall to treat supernatant from sludge sedimentation at metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago mwrd for removing nutrients n and p as well as various metals the rab reactors demonstrated a superior performance in n and p removal as compared to control raceway ponds taller 1 8 m rab reactors performed better than 0 9 m rab reactors in terms of total nutrient removal and algal biomass productivity at 7 day hrt total p tp and total kjeldahl n tkn removal efficiency reached to 80 and 87 respectively while ortho p and ammonia removal efficiency reached to 100 decreasing hrt led to an enhanced tp and tkn removal rate and nutrient removal capacity at hrt of 1 3 day the tp removal per footprint of 1 8 m tall rab reactors was around 7 times higher than the open pond system the rab reactors also showed certain capabilities of removing metals from wastewater the study demonstrated that rab based treatment process is an effective method to recover nutrients from municipal wastewater graphical abstract image keywords revolving algal biofilm sludge thickening municipal wastewater nutrients removal metals removal pilot scale 1 introduction strict national pollution discharge elimination system npdes limits set by the united states environmental protection agency usepa and state regulatory agencies on effluent nutrient limits have driven municipal wastewater reclamation plants wrps to remove and preferably recover nutrients from wastewater table 1 the npdes permit program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants to waters of the united states currently wrps are facing the challenge of developing low energy low carbon based technologies for nitrogen n and phosphorus p recovery for example ammonia can be converted into n2 gas through nitrification and denitrification however the nitrification process requires intensive aeration while the denitrification needs additional carbon e g methanol which increases the operating costs anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process reduces the energy and carbon requirements but the anaerobic process is inhibited by low oxygen exposure egli et al 2001 and also sensitivity to nitrite strous et al 1999 enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr requires an organic carbon for polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos growth and the aerobic stage of ebpr requires energy intensive aeration yuan et al 2012 as an alternative to the traditional bacteria based nutrient removal methods microalgae have been widely studied for removal of nutrients from wastewater due to their capability of simultaneous assimilation of n and p compared to other nutrient recovery methods the growth of microalgae does not need organic carbon because algal cells perform photo autotrophic metabolism using co2 aeration a high energy input commonly used in traditional bacteria based process can also be avoided algal based wastewater treatment however is hindered by limitations associated with the engineering design of the algal culture systems for example open raceway ponds have been commonly used for large scale algal cultivation chaumont 1993 christenson and sims 2011 however implementation of algal raceway ponds at wrps particularly in urban suburban areas is not practical due to the large land required and requirement of longer hydraulic resident times hrt in the tune of weeks to months another system enclosed photobioreactors are capital intensive and have a low volume throughput harvesting algae biomass from each of these systems is also challenging due to the low cell density in the treated water to overcome the shortcoming of algal raceway ponds and photobioreactors algal attached growth based systems have drawn great attention as a wastewater treatment method for example boelee et al 2011 established continuous wastewater treatment system via a 30 6 2 cm3 algal biofilm reactor to reduce the effluent n and p concentration to 2 2 mg l and 0 15 mg l respectively a rope based algal biofilm reactors at different scales 8 8000 l and hrts 2 6 day for treating tertiary wastewater were also reported christenson and sims 2012 shayan et al 2016 currently however the development of algal biofilm based wastewater treatment is still premature for example the majority of these algal biofilm system have been based on lab scale boelee et al 2011 shi et al 2014 sukačová et al 2015 synthetic wastewater not the real wastewater was used in many studies boelee et al 2014 karya et al 2013 li et al 2015 the operation durations of these studies were also relatively short in recent years researchers at iowa state university isu have developed a revolving algal biofilm rab reactor for algal attached growth gross et al 2013 2015b 2016 gross and wen 2014 2018 in the rab system the revolving growth attachment material belt rotates through the wastewater stream absorbs nutrients then rotates out of the water to facilitate light exposure and gas co2 and o2 exchanges the vertical configuration of the revolving belt allows for greater surface area exposure to sunlight in a much smaller footprint compared to an open raceway pond in anticipation of future stringent nutrient discharge limits and recognizing the potential of the rab system to recover nutrients the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago mwrd teamed with isu researchers to deploy pilot scale rab systems at the terrence j o brien o brien wrp in skokie il usa pilot studies consisted of two 0 9 m tall rab reactors two 1 8 m tall rab reactors and two control raceway ponds the pilot units were started in january 2016 and operated for a half year long evaluation of the rab system s nutrients n and p removal and algae biomass production on a variety of wastewater streams the heavy metal removal from wastewater and accumulation in the algae biomass were also studied to date only limited studies have been conducted to evaluate algal biofilm based wastewater treatment process using a real wastewater stream from a wrp at such an extended period de assis et al 2017 lee et al 2014 the main objectives of pilot studies were to test the performance of the unique rab reactors to remove and recover nutrients from wastewater and to compare algal biomass productivity of rab reactors to control raceway ponds 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater stream mwrd s o brien wrp uses primary clarification and activated sludge for removing total suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand the sludge from the primary and secondary sediment tanks are combined in gravity concentration tanks for thickening resulting in a supernatant side stream designated as o brien supernatant on a daily basis the wastewater sample was transferred to a storage tank in a green house algal facility where the rab based algal reactors was co located the sample was then stored for less than 1 h before being pumped into the rab reactor for processing 2 2 algal biofilm reactor design rab systems were used to treat the o brien supernatant the design configuration of the rab system is described in the literature gross and wen 2014 gross et al 2015b fig 1 a shows the design concept of the rab system in brief a flexible material similar to a conveyor belt belt was stretched around drive shafts to form a vertical configuration the lowest region of the belt was submerged in a medium reservoir to supply nutrients while the rest of the belt was exposed to the gas phase for direct access to light and carbon dioxide the shafts were driven by a motor rotating the belt between the liquid and gas phases a liquid reservoir 2 43 m long 1 83 m wide 0 22 m deep containing 1000 l liquid wastewater was retrofitted four sections of attachment belt each with serpentine design fig 1b each section of belt was 1 m wide two heights of the rab reactors were tested 1 8 m tall with a surface area of 43 5 m2 and 0 9 m tall with a surface area of 23 4 m2 the rotating speed of the belt was 4 cm s 1 in addition two control raceway ponds with the same dimension as the reservoir in the rab system but without the attachment belts were used as controls all the reactors were placed inside a greenhouse facility where natural sunlight was fluctuated with the local climate conditions the greenhouse was heated in winter with the air temperature ranging from 10 c to 30 c throughout the experimental period while the influent water temperature was within the range of 10 20 c 2 3 algal biofilm reactor operation procedures in november 2015 the reservoir of rab reactors and the control ponds were inoculated with a polyculture of microalgae prepared at the isu research facility at ames iowa usa and algal consortium growing in clarifiers at mwrd o brien wrp the rab reactor was incubated with the algae seed culture for two months during which the liquid of the rab reservoir was replaced for 2 3 time with the fresh seed culture in late january 2016 when a stable biofilm was established on the rab belt the rab reactors were switched to a semi continuous operation mode by discharging effluent from and feeding the influent o brien supernatant into the rab reservoir from 1 26 2016 to 4 12 2016 500 l of effluent in the rab reservoir 1000 l working volume was discharged every 3 5 days and then the same amount of the influent was added to the reservoir this operation provided an hrt equivalent to 7 day from 4 12 2016 to 6 10 2016 the hrt was reduced to 4 7 day equivalent i e every 3 5 days 750 l of effluent in the rab reservoir was discharged with the same amount of influent was added from 6 10 2016 to 7 15 2016 the hrt was further reduced to 1 3 day by discharging 750 l effluent and adding the same amount of influent on a daily basis throughout the operation period the biomass was harvested every 7 days considering the rab reactor has four belt sections to ensure the biomass in the rab reactor be maintained at an approximately even amount throughout the 7 day harvest cycle each belt section was harvested at different schedule throughout the week the algae in the rab biofilm was harvested in situ by scraping the biomass from the belt with a scraper blade the biomass in the control pond was harvested by centrifugation harvested algae from the rab biofilm is a paste like material with a moisture content of 85 90 w w which is similar to the cell pellets obtained from centrifugation of the suspended growth algae it should be noted that the reporting period for this study from january to july 2016 about 180 days is overall representative to the climatic conditions in chicago area day night time temperature and the wmrd o brien facility wastewater effluent conditions nutrients levels 2 4 chemical analyses total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and tp in algae biomass and water were extracted by sulfuric acid digestion and measured using kjeldahl procedure bremner 1996 and the modified ascorbic acid method murphy and riley 1962 respectively ortho p was analyzed by filtering the water samples through 0 45 μm filter without acid digestion the p concentration of all digested or undigested samples was determined by a spectrophotometer using the molybdate blue method murphy and riley 1962 ammonium were determined with the lachat autoanalyzer lachat quick chem systems milwaukee wi u s for analysis of total metals in water samples and algal biomass samples were digested in concentrated nitric acid and concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes 2 5 evaluation of the nutrient removal performance the nutrient

0 05 being defined as statistically significant 3 results 3 1 nutrient removal performance the nutrient concentrations in the o brien supernatant treated by the 1 8 m rab reactor and control pond are shown in fig 2 the data for the 0 9 m rab effluent were not presented to allow for figure presentation clarity the influent nutrient concentrations tp ortho p tkn and ammonia were at a relatively stable level throughout the entire period of operation the tp concentration of the 1 8 m rab effluent was lower than the control pond fig 2a indicating a better treatment performance by the 1 8 m rab reactor the ortho p concentrations in the 1 8 m rab effluent were similar to the control pond effluent when hrt was 7 day but when hrt was reduced to 4 7 day and 1 3 day the 1 8 m rab effluent had a lower ortho p than the control pond fig 2b the effluent tkn concentration fig 2c and ammonia concentration fig 2d of the 1 8 m rab reactor and the control pond demonstrated a similar trend as those the tp and ortho p respectively i e similar treatment at 7 day hrt and better treatment achieved in rab at a lower hrt level in summary the effluent nutrient concentrations presented in fig 2 clearly demonstrate a better nutrient removal performance in the rab reactor than the control pond to provide deeper insight and quantitative nutrient removal performance of the different types of reactors the nutrient concentrations in both the influent and effluent derived from 0 9 m rab 1 8 m rab and open pond reactors were derived into various parameters including nutrient removal rate nutrient removal efficiency and nutrient removal capacity per footprint area and nutrient removal capacity per belt surface area 3 1 1 tp removal parameters fig 3 a shows that tp removal rate of the rab reactors was between 0 5 and 0 8 mg l day when hrt were at 7 day and 4 7 day when hrt was reduced to 1 3 day the tp removal rate of 1 8 m rab reactor increased significantly to 3 4 mg l day the control pond only had 0 4 0 8 mg l day removal through all the hrt levels fig 3b shows that the rab reactors achieved 60 90 tp removal at 7 day and 4 7 day of hrt decreasing hrt to 1 3 day reduced the tp removal efficiency overall tp removal efficiencies of the rab reactors were higher than the control pond which was less than 60 throughout all the hrt levels the footprint based tp removal capacity fig 3c had a similar trend with the tp removal rate fig 3a i e the 1 8 m rab reactor resulted in a higher footprint based removal capacity than the 0 9 m rab reactor fig 3c in particular at 1 3 day of hrt the 1 8 m rab reactor had a maximum removal of 660 mg tp m2 day as compared to the control pound which only had a maximum of 160 mg tp m2 day when the belt surface based tp removal capacity is considered however the rab reactors showed an opposite tend i e the 0 9 m rab reactor had a slightly higher capacity than the 1 8 m rab reactor fig 3d 3 1 2 ortho p removal parameters all the three reactors demonstrated a similar performance of ortho p removal at 7 day hrt fig 4 at this hrt level the ortho p concentration in the effluents of all three reactors were 0 01 mg l fig 2b resulting in almost 100 ortho p removal efficiency fig 4b decreasing hrt from 7 day to 1 3 day provided additional ortho p to the algal cells and thus significantly p 0 05 enhanced ortho p removal rate fig 4a and removal capacities fig 4c and d on a footprint basis the 1 8 m rab reactor removed 220 mg ortho p m2 day at 1 3 day hrt while the control pond s ortho p removal capacity was only 70 mg m2 day at the same hrt level fig 4c overall the rab reactors had a better nutrient removal performance than the control pond and the 1 8 m rab performed better than the 0 9 m rab reactor fig 4a c except the belt surface based ortho p removal capacity fig 4d where the 0 9 m rab had a better ortho p removal capacity than the 1 8 m rab reactor 3 1 3 tkn removal parameters the trends of tkn removal rate fig 5 a removal capacity footprint based fig 5c and removal capacity belt surface based fig 5d with the different height rab reactors and hrts were similar to those of the tp removal parameters however the tkn removal efficiencies of the rab reactors were maintained at a higher level 80 through all the hrts fig 5b which were much higher than those of the control raceway ponds fig 5b at hrt 1 3 day the 1 8 m rab reactor demonstrated a superior footprint based tkn removal capacity performance 2300 mg tkn m2 day compared to 1200 mg m2 day tkn removed by the control pond fig 5c 3 1 4 ammonia removal parameters the trend of ammonia removal parameters with different algal reactors and the hrts were quite different from those of tkn removal parameters at 7 day and 4 7 day hrt levels ammonia removal rate removal efficiency and removal capacities of all the three reactors were very similar fig 6 a d the reason was due to a complete removal of ammonia from the influent at these two hrt levels fig 2d which lead to ammonia limitation scenarios when hrt was reduced to 1 3 day ammonia feeding to the algal reactor improved as a result much higher removal rates were observed for all the three reactors fig 6a while ammonia removal efficiency of the control pond decreased slightly 90 at hrt of 1 3 day the two ammonia removal capacity parameters footprint based and belt surface based increased significantly compared to the other hrt levels 3 2 metal removal from influent and accumulation in algal biomass the rab reactors and the control pond were further evaluated for their absorption of metals from the o brien supernatant as shown in table 2 the influent contains appreciable amount of sodium 117 mg l calcium 73 mg l magnesium 28 mg l and potassium 13 mg l 1 2 mg l of iron and zinc and trace amount less than 1 mg l of chromium nickel manganese copper non metal selenium was also detected in the influent with a trace amount aluminum arsenic cadmium and lead were not detected in the influent both rab reactors and control pond showed certain capabilities of removing those metals while the removal efficiencies varied with reactor type and element species table 2 chromium and nickel were removed completely from the influent by all the three reactors the rab reactors had much higher removal efficiencies on manganese and zinc p 0 05 than the open pond for calcium copper iron potassium and selenium the removal efficiencies of rab reactors and open pond were not significantly different p 0 05 magnesium and sodium were not removed by any of the algal reactors the content of these elements in the biomass of the rab reactors were also evaluated table 2 as shown in table 2 several observations were highlighted here first the biomass contained certain amount of aluminum cadmium lead and trace amount of arsenic although these four elements were below detection limits in the original influent this indicates that trace amount of those elements existed in the influent but below detection levels the biomass in the rab reactors can accumulate those elements second algal biomass can completely remove chromium and nickel the 0 9 m rab biomass contained higher content of these two elements than the 1 8 m rab biomass the reason may be that as all chromium and nickel were absorbed from the influent the 0 9 m rab and 1 8 m rab absorbed the equal amount of each element but the 1 8 m rab generated more biomass than the 0 9 m rab which resulted a dilution effect of the element content in the biomass third the biomass from 0 9 m rab and 1 8 m rab reactors contained similar content of manganese zinc calcium copper iron potassium and selenium which may indicate the absorptions of those elements per unit of biomass were saturated although 1 8 m rab reactor generated more biomass finally table 2 indicates that the biomass from the rab reactors contained more than 5000 mg l of magnesium although the effluent removal of this element from influent was not statistically significant however the biomass contained trace amounts of sodium although sodium concentration in the influent was high 117 mg l this indicates different capabilities of these two elements absorption by the algal biomass in the rab reactors in addition to data presented in table 2 hrt 7 day the metal removal and biomass metal content were also measured at 4 7 day hrt the results were similar to those reported in table 2 data not shown however the data at 1 3 day hrt were not determined 3 3 algal biomass production and chemical composition the algal growth in the rab reactors was also evaluated to provide a holistic view of the rab performance when treating wastewater here the biomass productivities based on the footprint and the surface belt were evaluated as shown in fig 7 for both 0 9 m rab and 1 8 m rab reactors decreasing hrt led to a higher biomass productivity under the same hrt level however the two rab reactors showed different trends when the footprint based biomass productivity is concerned the 1 8 m rab resulted in a much higher biomass productivity per square meter of footprint than the 0 9 m rab reactor throughout all the hrt levels studied with the 1 8 m rab reactor achieving the highest productivity 7 0 g m2 day at 1 3 day hrt fig 7a fig 7b shows that the belt surface based biomass productivity of 1 8 m rab reactor was slightly lower than that of the 0 9 m rab reactor although this difference was not statistically significant p 0 05 this phenomenon was probably caused by the more mutual shading in the higher rab belts it should be noted that during the experiment we also quantified the total suspended solid tss content in the liquid it shows that the tss of the rab reservoir was on an average of 20 35 mg l significantly lower than the tss in o brien supernatant influent 110 170 mg l meanwhile the tss in the control raceway pond was around 200 mg l these tss data indicated that the algal suspended growth in the rab reservoir was very minimal additionally during the entire 180 day of operation during this project we did not observe any detachment of the biomass from the biofilm this was due to that the short harvest frequency used in this work every 7 days avoided the extended cell residence in the biofilm the n and p content of the biomass harvested from the rab reactors are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8a n content of the biomass was in the range of 5 5 7 0 without significant p 0 05 variations among different rab reactors and hrt levels the results indicate that the algal cells in the rab biofilm may have reached the maximum capacity of absorbing n for proteins synthesis using the n to protein conversion ratio of 5 95 lópez 2010 the protein content in the biomass was estimated as 33 42 wt fig 8b shows the p content of the biomass a decreasing hrt resulted in a higher p content probably due to fast algal growth at lower hrt levels eixler et al 2006 kulaev and vagabov 1983 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient removal performance results of this study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of using rab reactors for treating municipal wastewater the rab reactors showed a higher removal rate and removal efficiency of tp and tkn than the raceway pond this higher removal rate and removal efficiency were most likely due to higher biomass productivity in the rab system as compared to raceway ponds previous studies also reported that the algal biofilm has a better capability of degrading the organic portion of the tp and tkn through a mineralization process bridgham et al 1998 or physical adsorptions of the organic compounds by extracellular polymeric substance eps sabater et al 2007 in terms of ortho p and ammonia removal the rab reactors had a similar removal performance as the control pond particularly at hrt of 7 day and 4 7 day this was probably due to the limitation of these two nutrients which is evidenced by the near zero concentration of ortho p and ammonia in the reactor effluents fig 2b and d at longer hrts however it should be noted that at hrt of 7 day and 4 7 day algal growth may not be limited by total nitrogen and total phosphorus although ammonia and ortho p concentration reached to zero this is because ammonia may be oxidized into nitrite and nitrate by the algae bacteria system while luxury p update in the algal cells alleviate the p limitation at this condition the rab system may be limited by other factors and a reduced hrt i e an increased flow rate can alleviate these limiting factor s in traditional open raceway ponds low hrt will eventually result in algae cells being washed out of the reactors in the rab reactors this will not be a concern as the attachment of algae on the belt surface separates the solid and hydraulic retention times additionally nutrient removal efficiency results at a short hrt 1 3 day clearly show the advantage of the rab nutrient removal efficiency compared to the open pond figs 3b 4b and 5b and 6b on the footprint basis cf equation 3 this work shows that the 1 8 m rab reactors had about 4 times as high tp removal capacity fig 3c and 2 times as high tkn removal capacity fig 5c as the open ponds the ortho p fig 4c and ammonia fig 6c removal capacity based on footprint at short hrt level i e 1 3 day also demonstrate the superior performance of the rab reactors than the open pond between the two rab reactors the 1 8 m rab reactor resulted in a higher tp tkn and ammonia removal capacity than the 0 9 m rab reactor figs 3c 4c and 5c further indicating the benefit of footprint saving by the rab reactors the small footprint of the rab system is another advantage for municipal wrps which are often located in urban suburban areas and limited by land availability if a treatment plant installs an algal culture system to remove same amount nutrients from the wastewater the required footprint will be less for the rab system as compared to the open raceway pond with the further optimization for the rab reactors such as the reactor height belt speed and the attachment materials it is likely that the nutrient removal capacity can be further increased which means the required land to accommodate the rab reactors can be further reduced on the belt surface basis cs equation 4 however figs 3d 4d and 5d 6d showed that the nutrient removal capacity of 1 8 m rab was somewhat lower than the 0 9 m rab although this reduction for some nutrient species such as tp was not significant p 0 05 this phenomenon was likely caused by the mutual shading between different belts in the rab reactor which eventually decreased cell growth and nutrient removal per unit of belt surface this problem can be overcome by several measures such as properly adjusting the positions of the belts to introduce more lighting or adding artificial lighting devices further development of the rab reactors needs to be carefully designed to balance the footprint based and belt surface based capacities 4 2 metal removal and accumulation in algal biomass heavy metals in water bring critical global public health concerns some heavy metal ions such as arsenic cadmium chromium lead and mercury are of public health concern even with very low concentrations tchounwou et al 2012 bio based absorbents have been considered an attractive option for metal removal from water due to their abundance relatively low cost strong metal binding capacity and high efficiency in dilute effluents monteiro et al 2011 as a promising bio based material microalgae has shown notable biosorption ability due to the negative charged groups on their cell surface ayangbenro and babalola 2017 in particular the results obtained here table 2 demonstrated that the rab reactors can effectively remove some metals which could be due to the unique features of the biofilm matrix gross et al 2015a in general algal biofilm contains a significant amount of eps including polysaccharide protein humic substances uronic acid nucleic acid and lipids comte et al 2008 previous research had shown that eps was capable of physically binding heavy metals under natural conditions fomina and gadd 2014 therefore the high metal removal efficiency of rab system observed in this study may be due to this unique feature of eps however it should be noted that some heavy metals can be enriched in the biomass since this algae biomass is grown on wastewater beneficial uses of this biomass for land application will fall under 40cfr part 503 regulations u s epa 1994 metal concentrations of algal biomass reported in this study is below the ceiling concentrations limits under part 503 regulations and may be allowed for land application u s epa 1994 moreover at this time mwrd is evaluating many other beneficial uses of this biomass including co digestion with solids from activated sludge process however the metal content in the biomass needs to be closely monitored for future beneficial uses of produced algae biomass 4 3 algal biomass production and chemical composition the wastewater streams significantly affect the algal growth and thus the nutrient removal of the rab reactor for example in an independent rab algal biomass growth study gross and wen 2014 in which a synthetic medium recipe was used the rab reactors produced 5 17 g m2 day footprint based biomass and 3 5 g m2 day belt surface based biomass at an hrt of 14 days these values were much higher than the corresponding results obtained in the current o brien rab reactors 1 7 g m2 day footprint based biomass and 0 3 0 9 g m2 day belt surface based biomass fig 7 it should be noted that the o brien supernatant contained a certain level of organic carbon 50 200 mg l of cod which may boost the bacteria growth on the rab belt the co existence of the indigenous algae and bacteria has been reported to represent a more stable system for wastewater treatment than only bacteria or algae roeselers et al 2007 a microscopic observation revealed the existence of bacteria in the rab biofilm while the majority of the microalgae in the biofilm included filamentous cyanobacteria and green algae such as scenedesmus pediastrum and chlorella these algal species were also commonly reported in other municipal wastewater treatment processes table 3 4 4 comparison of the microalgal based system for treating municipal wastewater to date various algae based processes have been reported to treat municipal wastewater streams for nutrients n and p removal a comprehensive summary of these treatment processes are summarized in table 3 this research is diversified in terms of wastewater streams used the initial nutrient concentrations in the influent the scale of the algae systems and the nutrient removal efficiencies the table shows that the influent nutrient concentration varied widely depending on the wastewater streams used also as real municipal wastewater was used in these studies the nutrient concentrations in the influent fluctuated widely which also resulted in a large variation in the nutrient removal efficiencies in general pure algal culture is hard to maintain for these algae treatment systems particularly at a larger scale the algal culture may also be compounded with bacteria growth due to the organic carbon contained in the wastewater as a result an indigenous algae and bacteria consortium existed in most of pilot scale suspended systems and all biofilm systems it should be noted that the majority of the reports in table 3 was based on suspended growth systems at a small scale 100 l with limited number of algal biofilm systems the pilot study reported in this work demonstrates a superior performance for nutrient removal compared to other reports table 3 however it should be noted there are still room to further improve the performance of the rab reactors from both the reactor design such as height the belt materials and operation such as hrt and lighting perspectives 5 conclusion this work demonstrates that the rab system can efficiently remove nutrients from wastewater in municipal wrps as a hybrid system for biomass production and domestic sewage treatment the rab reactors can be integrated into conventional raceway ponds with part of the biomass attached and other part suspended the nutrient removal performance depends on the rab reactor design such as the height the operational parameters such as the hrt and specific nutrient species overall taller rab reactors 1 8 m rab and a shorter hrt i e 1 3 day resulted in a better nutrient removal performance than shorter rab reactors 0 9 m rab with a longer hrt 4 7 and 7 day the rab reactor resulted in a much higher tp and tkn removal efficiency than a control open pond in particular the tp removal capacity per footprint area was 4 times higher than the open pond the ortho p and ammonia removal efficiencies of the rab reactors were comparable to the traditional open pond system at higher hrt 6 day and 4 7 day but rab had better removal efficiencies of these two nutrients when hrt was reduced to 1 3 day the rab reactors also removed various metals from the wastewater in the future reactor design and operation optimization are needed to practically implement the rab reactor in the municipal wrps also the suspended biomass needs to be accessed for their growth nutrient content and metal removal
