air oxidation mineralization 1 introduction wet air oxidation wao is an aqueous oxidation process usually performed at high temperatures 200 320 c and pressures 20 200 bar ovejero et al 2012 such a technology is effective in treating wastewaters containing toxic and or biorefractory contaminants but it is energy intensive due to the high reaction temperature and pressure in comparison catalytic wet air oxidation cwao is relatively energy saving by utilizing a suitable catalyst to facilitate the oxidation reaction under mild conditions in cwao process active oxygen species either freely dissolved in aqueous solution or adsorbed on the catalysts are produced from the dissolved o2 and act as the oxidants of contaminants kim and ihm 2011 nickel can exist in ni 0 ni i ni ii and ni iii states that are readily invoked in catalysis availability of these valence states and their flexible inter conversions result in fantastic catalytic activities of nickel species in oxidation reactions tasker et al 2014 notably nio is a promising oxygen carrier to adsorb o2 in air and supply active oxygen species for the oxidation of organic molecules its p type semiconductor structure with an electron deficiency in the lattice allows electrons to be easily donated from the metal cations kamal et al 2016 when nio is placed in air o2 molecules adsorbed on its surface will convert to chemisorbed oxygen species by capturing electrons from the metal cations lai et al 2015 previous studies have indicated the majority of o2 adsorbed on nio surface at room temperature are present in the form of irreversibly bonded o o2 2 species bielańskiet and najbar 1972 mckay and henrich 1985 such chemisorbed oxygen species show a very high activity and serve as the main oxidizers of organic molecules in air oxidation reaction huang et al 2011 xie et al 2017 moreover ni atoms in either metallic or cationic state facilitate the oxidation of organic molecules via activating ch bonds yu et al 2015 these unique properties of nio enable it an active catalyst in air oxidation reaction so far efficient catalysts have significantly lowered the operation temperature of cwao however it is still a big challenge to run the cwao at room temperature for practical application in this regards anode electric field provides a possible way to assist the cwao process at room temperature it is generally believed that the oxidation of organic compounds by o2 in cwao follows a pathway involving initiation propagation and termination bhargava et al 2006 anode electric field facilitates the reaction either by generating ho from water to activate the organic molecules kapalka et al 2008 or using electro oxidation reaction to activate o2 molecules sun et al 2015 lei et al 2018 in our previous work we have demonstrated the oxidation of rhodamine b and phenol by air in an anode electric field while the oxidation rates of the pollutants in the systems are slow due to the low catalytic activity of carbon electrodes sun et al 2015 lei et al 2018 in this work we report an electro assisted cwao ecwao process with partially oxidized nickel ni nio immobilized on a porous graphite felt gf as the catalyst such a process demonstrates extensive effectiveness and good stability for deep oxidation of refractory organic pollutants at low energy costs degradation of high concentrations of dyes pharmaceutics and personal care products ppcps are evaluated in terms of pollutants mineralization efficiency and energy consumption mechanistic studies identify nio as the catalytically active site for electrochemical activation of o2 molecules to oxidize organic pollutants at room temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of a ni nio gf composite and its structure characterizations a partially oxidized ni nio gf composite was prepared by a combined impregnation and pyrolysis approach briefly 0 1 g of polyacrylonitrile pan was dissolved in 10 ml of n n

organic pollutants treated in the ecwao process included triclosan tcs bisphenol a ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole congo red crystal violent and rodamine b at a concentration of 0 4 mm the tcs was used as a probe pollutant for evaluating the stability of the ecwao process as well as for mechanistic studies to examine applicability of the ecwao process in field water treatment a lake water sample taken from hubing lake anhui china was spiked with a mixture of all target organic pollutants and then subjected to treatment in the ecwao process the lake water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter and amended with 50 mm na2so4 the concentration of each target pollutant in the spiked lake water was 0 04 mm the ecwao process was initiated by applying an electric field of 2 0 v

measured by ion chromatography on a shimadzu lc 2010 system japan intermediate products of tcs in the ecwao process were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms on a thermo trace 1300 system equipped with a tr v1 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm id 1 4 μm film usa prior to the gc ms analysis solid phase extraction was carried out using an oasis hlb spe cartridge 3 ml 60 mg waters usa

min 1 electron impact ei mass spectra were monitored from 50 to 500 m z the ion source and inlet line temperatures were set at 220 and 280 c respectively dissolved nickel was quantified by an agilent

was detected spectrophotometrically with nitro blue tetrazolium salt as an indicator bielski et al 1980 ding et al 2014 an iodimetric method was used to determine the total amount of peroxodisulfate hydrogen peroxide and ozone zhu et al 2008 all the experiments were conducted in triplicate and the average values with standard deviations were presented 2 3 electrochemical measurements cyclic voltammetry cv and chronoamperometry were performed on a chi 660d electrochemical workstation usa in three electrode with platinum counter electrode and sce reference electrode the electrolyte was 50

plate was incubated at 37 c and the growth of e coli was monitored by reading the absorption at 600 nm in a microtiter plate reader 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure characterizations of the ni nio gf composite fig 1 a shows xps survey spectrum of the ni nio gf composite which indicates the presence of ni o and c elements the nickel content in the composite is determined to be 10 8 wt by tg analysis in view that the final product after combustion in air is nio fig 1b ni 2p xps spectrum demonstrates six characteristic peaks fig 1c the peaks located at 852 1 and 869 3 ev are assigned to ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 of ni 0 and the peaks at 855 0 and 872 9 ev correspond to ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 of ni ii the ni 0 2p3 2 satellite signal is observed at 860 2 ev and the peak at 878 5 ev is referred to the ni ii 2p3 2 satellite signal the o1s level of the composite is deconvolved into three peaks corresponding to different types of oxygen species fig 1 d the peak at 529 8 ev corresponds to the lattice oxygen in crystalline nio and the peak at 531 7 ev is attributed to the chemisorbed oxygen species of nio as well as c o oc o groups on gf surface peck and langell 2012 lei et al 2018 the last peak at 533 3 ev is assigned to the physically adsorbed oxygen species of nio and coh coc groups of gf peck and langell 2012 biniak et al 1997 the o1s xps spectrum indicates the presence of nio crystal in the composite but nio peak is not displayed in the xrd pattern as shown in fig 1e the broad diffraction peak at 25 7 is assigned to gf support and the other three diffraction peaks at 44 5 51 9 and 76 4 are all assigned to cubic ni metal jcpds 04 0850 the xrd pattern without any diffraction peaks of crystal nio suggests a highly dispersed state of nio in the composite correspondingly sem images of the composite demonstrate that the surface of gf support is covered by a layer of cubic particles which should belong to metallic ni fig 1f and g however elemental mappings reveal that the abundance of o element at the ni sites is obviously higher than that at the other sites of the gf support fig 1h thus indicating the coexistence of ni and nio probably the nio forms on the surface of metallic ni as highly dispersed crystals taking into consideration of the fact that metallic ni is prone to oxidation in air li et al 2013 3 2 performance of the ecwao process towards pollutants degradation a series of electric fields were applied to drive the ecwao process for tcs degradation on the ni nio gf electrode as shown in fig 2 a with the increase of applied voltage from 0 8 to 3 0 v the potential of ni nio gf electrode increases from 0 4 to 1 8 v vs sce and the current density rises from 0 075 to 2 69 ma cm 2 fig 2b and c shows that the degradation of tcs in the ecwao process is strongly dependent upon the intensity of the electric field the degradation rate of tcs is accelerated as the applied voltage increases from 0 8 to 2 v however further increase of the voltage to 3 v presents an adverse effect on tcs degradation at 2 0 v the total removal of tcs is achieved in 90 min and a final mineralization efficiency of 86 0 1 4 is obtained in 105 min specific energy consumption sec kw h kg toc 1 is used to evaluate the energy efficiency of ecwao process in degrading the tcs the sec is calculated in terms of the removal of 1 kg toc as eq 1 1 s e c 0 t u i t o c where t represents the time required for the total removal of toc h u is the applied voltage kv and i is the circuit current a the sec values reported for conventional electrochemical oxidation processes are generally between 160 and 1476 5 kw h kg toc 1 60 and 553 7 kw h kg cod 1 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 xu et al 2013 in this work the ecwao process presents very low sce values due to the contribution of o2 in air to tcs mineralization as shown in fig 2d the ecwao process operated at 3 v has a sce of 24 8 0 6 kw h kg toc 1 and the sce value is reduced to 0 3 5 3 kw h kg toc 1 at the applied voltage below 2 v in summary the ecwao process is recommended to be operated at 2 v in order to achieve deep mineralization of tcs within a reasonable time at low energy consumption notably the ecwao process operated at 2 v maintains a very stable performance in mineralizing the tcs in six successive fed batch runs fig 2e and nickel leaching during the six runs is ignorable as determined by icp oes analysis fig 2f shows the tcs is mineralized at similar efficiencies over a wide ph range from 3 0 to 11 0 and no dissolved nickel is detected at all tested phs reflecting an excellent stability of the ni nio gf electrode in acid neutral and alkaline solutions the ecwao process with the ni nio gf electrode is extensively effective in degrading high concentrations of dyes pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps as shown in fig 2g the dyes of congo red rhodamine b and methylene blue can be totally mineralized within 320 min as for the ppcps of bisphenol a ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole which are well known for their recalcitrance to environmental degradation the ecwao process is also able to degrade them with mineralization efficiencies above 60 the different degradation rates and mineralization efficiencies of these organic pollutants should be attributed to the different chemical structures of parent and intermediate compounds notably the ecwao process demonstrates favorable performance for simultaneous mineralization of dyes and ppcps in field water as evidenced by the high mineralization efficiency of 78 5 1 4 obtained on the lake water containing a mixture of all target organic pollutants the secs of the ecwao process in dyes degradation are generally lower than 10 kw h kg toc 1 and the secs are no more than 30 kw h kg toc 1 for ppcps fig 2h therefore we believe that the ecwao process is an energetically advantageous process which can be widely used for the deep mineralization of various recalcitrant organic pollutants in wastewaters noticing the deep mineralization of organic pollutants requires several hours the time of treatment is still long for the ecwao process operated in a continuous mode to become a practically feasible process several stratagies can be taken to promote pollutants degradation rate in the ecwao process manipulation of morphologies and sizes of ni and nio as well as their contents in the ni nio gf electrode is encouraged to enhance the catalytic activity of electrode and design of appropriate reactor configuration as well as electrode stucture and scale should be pursured to improve the efficiency of the ecwao system 3 3 products generated from tcs in the ecwao process intermediate products generated during the degradation of tcs in the ecwao process are identified by gc ms as shown in fig 3 a there is only one strong peak at 21 08 min on the gas chromatogram of tcs with m z 288 and its peak density is gradually decreased to null along with the reaction time the degradation of tcs produces two intermediate products fig 3b and c the one with retention time of 10 08 min is identified to be dichlorophenol m z 162 and the other one with retention time of 10 35 min is monochlorophenol m z 128 sanchez prado et al 2006 noticing that the peaks of the two intermediate products disappear from the gas chromatogram at the reaction time of 120 min tcs is firstly degraded to dichlorophenol and monochlorophenol which continue to be oxidized to co2 h2o and small organic molecules theoretically the concentration of chloride ion in solution is calculated to be 42 60 mg l 1 assuming that all chlorine in tcs is released as chloride ion after the degradation at the end of the ecwao process the concentration of chloride ion is determined to be 39 97 1 13 mg l 1 just slightly lower than theoretical value due to adsorption of chloride ion by the electrode since the tcs is partially mineralized in the ecwao process the toxicity of its final products is investigated based on its effect on the growth of e coli bokare et al 2010 as shown in fig 3d tcs is a potent anti microbial agent which completely inhibits the growth of e coli in contrast the degradation products of tcs are nontoxic and they can even accelerate the bacterial growth 3 4 mechanism of tcs oxidation in the ecwao process potentiostatic experiment is conducted at an anodic potential of 1 0 v vs sce to investigate tcs degradation on the ni nio gf electrode through ecwao as shown in fig 4 a the ni nio gf electrode demonstrates certain adsorption to tcs and the adsorption is responsible for 28 0 3 8 of toc removal at 1 0 v vs sce of anodic potential with air bubbling tcs is rapidly degraded within 120 min at a toc removal efficiency of 85 5 1 8 in contrast the gf support only adsorbs 4 2 2 2 of tcs and the toc removal efficiency on gf is 23 6 1 3 after 120 min of ecwao a typical indirect anodic oxidation system with boron doped diamond bdd 2 5 4 cm2 diamond layer of 10 μm csem switzerland electrode is also operated at 1 0 v vs sce with continuous air bubbling the indirect anodic oxidation makes use of reactive oxygen species typically ho generated from water discharge to oxidize organic pollutants and the bdd electrode has been widely adopted as the anode of the indirect anodic oxidation for the total mineralization of a large number of organic pollutants de oliveira et al 2012 however the toc is removed by only 9 3 0 0 on the bdd electrode indicating poor mineralization of tcs via indirect anodic oxidation at such a low anodic potential as a matter of fact the tcs is mineralized mainly via air oxidation rather than electrochemical oxidation in the ecwao process as evidenced by the extremely high mineralization current efficiency mce of the process fig 4b the mce is the ratio of experimental toc removal to theoretical toc removal considering the applied electrical charges are all consumed to mineralize the organic pollutant and is calculated as 2 mce n f v s δ t o c e x p 7 2 10 5 m 0 t i 100 where n is the number of electrons involved in the mineralization of an organic pollutant f is the faraday constant 96485 c mol 1 v s is the solution volume l δ toc exp is the experimental toc decay mg l 1 7 2 105 is the conversion factor 60 s min 1 12000 mg carbon mol 1 m is the number of carbon atoms in the organic pollutant and i is the circuit current a at electrolysis time t min for conventional anodic oxidation process in which the oxidizing power is supplied by the electric field the mce should be lower than 100 due to inevitable charge loss in anodic reaction murugananthan et al 2008 in contrast the ecwao process presents mce values higher than 150 during the mineralization of tcs fig 4b notably within the first hour mecs are even above 200 suggesting the oxidation of tcs by o2 is the dominant pathway toward mineralization free radical chain theory of autoxidation is now accepted as a general framework to interpret the kinetics of wao bhargava et al 2006 kim and ihm 2011 according to this theory the first step in the wao is the oxidation of an organic molecule rh into organic radical r by o2 reaction 1 reactions 2 and 3 show the propagation steps leading to the degradation of the organic molecule reaction 1 is hard to occur at room temperature because of high activation energy over 200 kj mol 1 debellefontaine and foussard 2000 thus the activation of the organic molecule or o2 is necessary in order to enable the wao at room temperature 3 rh o 2 r ho 2 4 r o 2 ro 2 5 ro 2 rh rooh r the oxidation of acetic acid by o2 has been reported in an indirect anodic oxidation system at room temperature which was proposed to be initiated by the reaction between electrochemically generated ho and acetic acid to form organic radicals kapalka et al 2008 herein ho is also detected in the ecwao system but its concentration is very low due to limited water discharge at the low electrode potential fig 4c shows the ho concentration at the ni nio gf electrode is only 14 3 1 8 10 6 mol l 1 even lower than that at the gf electrode therefore the more efficient degradation of tcs on the ni nio gf electrode is not attributed to ho furthermore the contribution of ho to tcs degradation is determined using tertiary butanol t buoh and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso as quenchers of ho the hydrophilic t buoh is used to quench the ho dissolved in solution and the hydrophobic dmso is able to quench the ho adsorbed on electrode surface molar concentration of the quenchers is 1000 times of the molar concentration of tcs to ensure the ho is completely quenched as shown in fig 4d the degradation of tcs is visibly slowed down by t buoh and or dmso suggesting both the free and adsorbed ho contribute to tcs degradation in the ecwao process however the ho is not the initiator of ecwao process because the tcs is still degraded even though the ho has been quenched moreover superoxide radical is not detected and the total concentration of peroxodisulfate hydrogen peroxide and ozone is below the detection limit of the iodometric method thus their contributions to tcs degradation being excluded based on these results we propose the ecwao process is initiated through a non radical pathway the cv is performed to identify characteristic reactions occurring on the ni nio gf electrode in the ecwao process as shown in fig 4e the cyclic voltammogram of ni nio gf electrode obtained in n2 saturated na2so4 electrolyte features a couple of redox peaks with the anodic peak peak 1 centered at ca 0 35 v vs sce and the cathodic peak peak 2 at ca 0 50 v vs sce such redox peaks are not observed on the cyclic voltammogram of gf support and so they represent the redox reaction on the nio ni the addition of tcs into the electrolyte leads to the disappearance of peak 2 from the voltammogram indicating the species generated through the reaction at peak 1 can react with the tcs when the cv is performed in o2 saturated na2so4 tcs electrolyte an obvious o2 reduction peak is observed at 0 34 v vs sce in addition the intensity of peak 1 is visibly strengthened thus peak 1 should be related to the electro oxidation of oxygen species on nio which is generated from o2 molecules contribution of this electro oxidation reaction to tcs degradation is suggested by degradation behaviors of tcs at different electrode potentials as shown in fig 4b tcs is not able to be degraded at 0 1 v vs sce that is below the potential required to induce peak 1 when electrode potential rises to 0 40 v vs sce to initiate the electro oxidation reaction represented by peak 1 obvious degradation of tcs is observed what should be noted is that the tcs is neither to be degraded at 0 40 v vs sce without air participation nor to be degraded by air without an electric field suggesting both the o2 and electric field are indispensable for effective degradation of tcs these above results indicate an o2 activation mechanism for the ecwao process where the oxidation of tcs is initiated by the electrochemical activation of o2 on the ni nio such a mechanism is further confirmed by the current time profile of ni nio gf electrode at 0 40 v vs sce as a response to o2 bubbling or tcs addition as shown in fig 4f circuit current is maintained at a relatively stable level in na2so4 electrolyte bubbled with n2 the addition of tcs only brings about temporary fluctuation of the current but o2 bubbling causes an increment of the current indicating the movement of electrons from o2 to the electrode 3 5 proposed pathway for tcs oxidation by o2 in ecwao process nio is known to be an excellent catalyst for air oxidation reaction and chemisorbed oxygen species are of importance in the catalysis at room temperature o2 is adsorbed on nio predominantly as irreversibly bonded o species bielański and najbar 1972 meantime at the defect sites of nio surface the dissociation of o2 forms o2 2 species mckay and henrich 1985 these negatively charged chemisorbed oxygen species are potent oxidizers wang et al 2008 liu et al 2009 kamal et al 2016 and the transfer of oxygen atom from o2 molecules to an organic molecule through chemisorbed oxygen species on catalyst surface is an important pathway involved in conventional wao processes operated at high temperatures kim and ihm 2011 notably chemisorbed oxygen species on nio surface are highly active and can react with various organic compounds zhu et al 2012 tian et al 2016 herein we propose the nio in ni nio gf electrode is the catalytically active sites for ecwao the spill over mechanism is used to explain the transportation of oxygen atom from o2 to tcs wasalathanthri et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the oxidation reaction takes place through alternative adsorption of o2 and consumption of chemisorbed oxygen species on nio ni the o2 molecule is first adsorbed onto nio and undergoes dissociation to form chemisorbed oxygen species o o2 which are then electro oxidized to their active states o o2 in anode electric field these activated oxygen species are highly active at room temperature and they react with tcs in subsequent steps such an oxidation reaction cleaves the tcs yielding co2 h2o and small organic products with dichlorophenol and monochlorophenol as intermediates this electrochemically induced catalytic air oxidation process is strongly dependent upon chemisorbed oxygen species on nio surface as well as the electron transfer ability of the nio ni catalyst the nio supplies available active sites to accommodate chemisorbed oxygen species and the presence of ni ensures the conductivity of the catalyst during the electro activation reaction 4 conclusion the ecwao process on anodic ni nio gf demonstrates high efficiency for the deep mineralization of refractory organic pollutants at low energy consumption the probe pollutant tcs at a high concentration of 0 4 mm obtains a mineralization efficiency of 86 0 1 4 within 105 min in the ecwao process and the sce of process is as low as 5 3 0 3 kw h kg toc 1 the ni nio gf electrode shows a stable catalytic activity over a wide ph range from 3 0 to 11 0 and excellent reusability with negligible metal leaching the oxidation of tcs by o2 in the ecwao process applies an oxygen transfer pathway from o2 molecule to tcs molecule through chemisorbed oxygen species on nio chemisorbed oxygen species are activated in the electric field via electro oxidation reaction which enables them to oxidize the tcs at room temperature the nio in ni nio gf electrode supplies active sites to accommodate chemisorbed oxygen species and ni ensures the conductivity of the catalyst during the electro activation reaction

nio gf composite fig 1 a shows xps survey spectrum of the ni nio gf composite which indicates the presence of ni o and c elements the nickel content in the composite is determined to be 10 8 wt by tg analysis in view that the final product after combustion in air is nio fig 1b ni 2p xps spectrum demonstrates six characteristic peaks fig 1c the peaks located at 852 1 and 869 3 ev are assigned to ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 of ni 0 and the peaks at 855 0 and 872 9 ev correspond to ni 2p3 2 and ni 2p1 2 of ni ii the ni 0 2p3 2 satellite signal is observed at 860 2 ev and the peak at 878 5 ev is referred to the ni ii 2p3 2 satellite signal the o1s level of the composite is deconvolved into three peaks corresponding to different types of oxygen species fig 1 d the peak at 529 8 ev corresponds to the lattice oxygen in crystalline nio and the peak at 531 7 ev is attributed to the chemisorbed oxygen species of nio as well as c o oc o groups on gf surface peck and langell 2012 lei et al 2018 the last peak at 533 3 ev is assigned to the physically adsorbed oxygen species of nio and coh coc groups of gf peck and langell 2012 biniak et al 1997 the o1s xps spectrum indicates the presence of nio crystal in the composite but nio peak is not displayed in the xrd pattern as shown in fig 1e the broad diffraction peak at 25 7 is assigned to gf support and the other three diffraction peaks at 44 5 51 9 and 76 4 are all assigned to cubic ni metal jcpds 04 0850 the xrd pattern without any diffraction peaks of crystal nio suggests a highly dispersed state of nio in the composite correspondingly sem images of the composite demonstrate that the surface of gf support is covered by a layer of cubic particles which should belong to metallic ni fig 1f and g however elemental mappings reveal that the abundance of o element at the ni sites is obviously higher than that at the other sites of the gf support fig 1h thus indicating the coexistence of ni and nio probably the nio forms on the surface of metallic ni as highly dispersed crystals taking into consideration of the fact that metallic ni is prone to oxidation in air li et al 2013 3 2 performance of the ecwao process towards pollutants degradation a series of electric fields were applied to drive the ecwao process for tcs degradation on the ni nio gf electrode as shown in fig 2 a with the increase of applied voltage from 0 8 to 3 0 v the potential of ni nio gf electrode increases from 0 4 to 1 8 v vs sce and the current density rises from 0 075 to 2 69 ma cm 2 fig 2b and c shows that the degradation of tcs in the ecwao process is strongly dependent upon the intensity of the electric field the degradation rate of tcs is accelerated as the applied voltage increases from 0 8 to 2 v however further increase of the voltage to 3 v presents an adverse effect on tcs degradation at 2 0 v the total removal of tcs is achieved in 90 min and a final mineralization efficiency of 86 0 1 4 is obtained in 105 min specific energy consumption sec kw h kg toc 1 is used to evaluate the energy efficiency of ecwao process in degrading the tcs the sec is calculated in terms of the removal of 1 kg toc as eq 1 1 s e c 0 t u i t o c where t represents the time required for the total removal of toc h u is the applied voltage kv and i is the circuit current a the sec values reported for conventional electrochemical oxidation processes are generally between 160 and 1476 5 kw h kg toc 1 60 and 553 7 kw h kg cod 1 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 kumar et al 2015 xu et al 2013 in this work the ecwao process presents very low sce values due to the contribution of o2 in air to tcs mineralization as shown in fig 2d the ecwao process operated at 3 v has a sce of 24 8 0 6 kw h kg toc 1 and the sce value is reduced to 0 3 5 3 kw h kg toc 1 at the applied voltage below 2 v in summary the ecwao process is recommended to be operated at 2 v in order to achieve deep mineralization of tcs within a reasonable time at low energy consumption notably the ecwao process operated at 2 v maintains a very stable performance in mineralizing the tcs in six successive fed batch runs fig 2e and nickel leaching during the six runs is ignorable as determined by icp oes analysis fig 2f shows the tcs is mineralized at similar efficiencies over a wide ph range from 3 0 to 11 0 and no dissolved nickel is detected at all tested phs reflecting an excellent stability of the ni nio gf electrode in acid neutral and alkaline solutions the ecwao process with the ni nio gf electrode is extensively effective in degrading high concentrations of dyes pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps as shown in fig 2g the dyes of congo red rhodamine b and methylene blue can be totally mineralized within 320 min as for the ppcps of bisphenol a ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole which are well known for their recalcitrance to environmental degradation the ecwao process is also able to degrade them with mineralization efficiencies above 60 the different degradation rates and mineralization efficiencies of these organic pollutants should be attributed to the different chemical structures of parent and intermediate compounds notably the ecwao process demonstrates favorable performance for simultaneous mineralization of dyes and ppcps in field water as evidenced by the high mineralization efficiency of 78 5 1 4 obtained on the lake water containing a mixture of all target organic pollutants the secs of the ecwao process in dyes degradation are generally lower than 10 kw h kg toc 1 and the secs are no more than 30 kw h kg toc 1 for ppcps fig 2h therefore we believe that the ecwao process is an energetically advantageous process which can be widely used for the deep mineralization of various recalcitrant organic pollutants in wastewaters noticing the deep mineralization of organic pollutants requires several hours the time of treatment is still long for the ecwao process operated in a continuous mode to become a practically feasible process several stratagies can be taken to promote pollutants degradation rate in the ecwao process manipulation of morphologies and sizes of ni and nio as well as their contents in the ni nio gf electrode is encouraged to enhance the catalytic activity of electrode and design of appropriate reactor configuration as well as electrode stucture and scale should be pursured to improve the efficiency of the ecwao system 3 3 products generated from tcs in the ecwao process intermediate products generated during the degradation of tcs in the ecwao process are identified by gc ms as shown in fig 3 a there is only one strong peak at 21 08 min on the gas chromatogram of tcs with m z 288 and its peak density is gradually decreased to null along with the reaction time the degradation of tcs produces two intermediate products fig 3b and c the one with retention time of 10 08 min is identified to be dichlorophenol m z 162 and the other one with retention time of 10 35 min is monochlorophenol m z 128 sanchez prado et al 2006 noticing that the peaks of the two intermediate products disappear from the gas chromatogram at the reaction time of 120 min tcs is firstly degraded to dichlorophenol and monochlorophenol which continue to be oxidized to co2 h2o and small organic molecules theoretically the concentration of chloride ion in solution is calculated to be 42 60 mg l 1 assuming that all chlorine in tcs is released as chloride ion after the degradation at the end of the ecwao process the concentration of chloride ion is determined to be 39 97 1 13 mg l 1 just slightly lower than theoretical value due to adsorption of chloride ion by the electrode since the tcs is partially mineralized in the ecwao process the toxicity of its final products is investigated based on its effect on the growth of e coli bokare et al 2010 as shown in fig 3d tcs is a potent anti microbial agent which completely inhibits the growth of e coli in contrast the degradation products of tcs are nontoxic and they can even accelerate the bacterial growth 3 4 mechanism of tcs oxidation in the ecwao process potentiostatic experiment is conducted at an anodic potential of 1 0 v vs sce to investigate tcs degradation on the ni nio gf electrode through ecwao as shown in fig 4 a the ni nio gf electrode demonstrates certain adsorption to tcs and the adsorption is responsible for 28 0 3 8 of toc removal at 1 0 v vs sce of anodic potential with air bubbling tcs is rapidly degraded within 120 min at a toc removal efficiency of 85 5 1 8 in contrast the gf support only adsorbs 4 2 2 2 of tcs and the toc removal efficiency on gf is 23 6 1 3 after 120 min of ecwao a typical indirect anodic oxidation system with boron doped diamond bdd 2 5 4 cm2 diamond layer of 10 μm csem switzerland electrode is also operated at 1 0 v vs sce with continuous air bubbling the indirect anodic oxidation makes use of reactive oxygen species typically ho generated from water discharge to oxidize organic pollutants and the bdd electrode has been widely adopted as the anode of the indirect anodic oxidation for the total mineralization of a large number of organic pollutants de oliveira et al 2012 however the toc is removed by only 9 3 0 0 on the bdd electrode indicating poor mineralization of tcs via indirect anodic oxidation at such a low anodic potential as a matter of fact the tcs is mineralized mainly via air oxidation rather than electrochemical oxidation in the ecwao process as evidenced by the extremely high mineralization current efficiency mce of the process fig 4b the mce is the ratio of experimental toc removal to theoretical toc removal considering the applied electrical charges are all consumed to mineralize the organic pollutant and is calculated as 2 mce n f v s δ t o c e x p 7 2 10 5 m 0 t i 100 where n is the number of electrons involved in the mineralization of an organic pollutant f is the faraday constant 96485 c mol 1 v s is the solution volume l δ toc exp is the experimental toc decay mg l 1 7 2 105 is the conversion factor 60 s min 1 12000 mg carbon mol 1 m is the number of carbon atoms in the organic pollutant and i is the circuit current a at electrolysis time t min for conventional anodic oxidation process in which the oxidizing power is supplied by the electric field the mce should be lower than 100 due to inevitable charge loss in anodic reaction murugananthan et al 2008 in contrast the ecwao process presents mce values higher than 150 during the mineralization of tcs fig 4b notably within the first hour mecs are even above 200 suggesting the oxidation of tcs by o2 is the dominant pathway toward mineralization free radical chain theory of autoxidation is now accepted as a general framework to interpret the kinetics of wao bhargava et al 2006 kim and ihm 2011 according to this theory the first step in the wao is the oxidation of an organic molecule rh into organic radical r by o2 reaction 1 reactions 2 and 3 show the propagation steps leading to the degradation of the organic molecule reaction 1 is hard to occur at room temperature because of high activation energy over 200 kj mol 1 debellefontaine and foussard 2000 thus the activation of the organic molecule or o2 is necessary in order to enable the wao at room temperature 3 rh o 2 r ho 2 4 r o 2 ro 2 5 ro 2 rh rooh r the oxidation of acetic acid by o2 has been reported in an indirect anodic oxidation system at room temperature which was proposed to be initiated by the reaction between electrochemically generated ho and acetic acid to form organic radicals kapalka et al 2008 herein ho is also detected in the ecwao system but its concentration is very low due to limited water discharge at the low electrode potential fig 4c shows the ho concentration at the ni nio gf electrode is only 14 3 1 8 10 6 mol l 1 even lower than that at the gf electrode therefore the more efficient degradation of tcs on the ni nio gf electrode is not attributed to ho furthermore the contribution of ho to tcs degradation is determined using tertiary butanol t buoh and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso as quenchers of ho the hydrophilic t buoh is used to quench the ho dissolved in solution and the hydrophobic dmso is able to quench the ho adsorbed on electrode surface molar concentration of the quenchers is 1000 times of the molar concentration of tcs to ensure the ho is completely quenched as shown in fig 4d the degradation of tcs is visibly slowed down by t buoh and or dmso suggesting both the free and adsorbed ho contribute to tcs degradation in the ecwao process however the ho is not the initiator of ecwao process because the tcs is still degraded even though the ho has been quenched moreover superoxide radical is not detected and the total concentration of peroxodisulfate hydrogen peroxide and ozone is below the detection limit of the iodometric method thus their contributions to tcs degradation being excluded based on these results we propose the ecwao process is initiated through a non radical pathway the cv is performed to identify characteristic reactions occurring on the ni nio gf electrode in the ecwao process as shown in fig 4e the cyclic voltammogram of ni nio gf electrode obtained in n2 saturated na2so4 electrolyte features a couple of redox peaks with the anodic peak peak 1 centered at ca 0 35 v vs sce and the cathodic peak peak 2 at ca 0 50 v vs sce such redox peaks are not observed on the cyclic voltammogram of gf support and so they represent the redox reaction on the nio ni the addition of tcs into the electrolyte leads to the disappearance of peak 2 from the voltammogram indicating the species generated through the reaction at peak 1 can react with the tcs when the cv is performed in o2 saturated na2so4 tcs electrolyte an obvious o2 reduction peak is observed at 0 34 v vs sce in addition the intensity of peak 1 is visibly strengthened thus peak 1 should be related to the electro oxidation of oxygen species on nio which is generated from o2 molecules contribution of this electro oxidation reaction to tcs degradation is suggested by degradation behaviors of tcs at different electrode potentials as shown in fig 4b tcs is not able to be degraded at 0 1 v vs sce that is below the potential required to induce peak 1 when electrode potential rises to 0 40 v vs sce to initiate the electro oxidation reaction represented by peak 1 obvious degradation of tcs is observed what should be noted is that the tcs is neither to be degraded at 0 40 v vs sce without air participation nor to be degraded by air without an electric field suggesting both the o2 and electric field are indispensable for effective degradation of tcs these above results indicate an o2 activation mechanism for the ecwao process where the oxidation of tcs is initiated by the electrochemical activation of o2 on the ni nio such a mechanism is further confirmed by the current time profile of ni nio gf electrode at 0 40 v vs sce as a response to o2 bubbling or tcs addition as shown in fig 4f circuit current is maintained at a relatively stable level in na2so4 electrolyte bubbled with n2 the addition of tcs only brings about temporary fluctuation of the current but o2 bubbling causes an increment of the current indicating the movement of electrons from o2 to the electrode 3 5 proposed pathway for tcs oxidation by o2 in ecwao process nio is known to be an excellent catalyst for air oxidation reaction and chemisorbed oxygen species are of importance in the catalysis at room temperature o2 is adsorbed on nio predominantly as irreversibly bonded o species bielański and najbar 1972 meantime at the defect sites of nio surface the dissociation of o2 forms o2 2 species mckay and henrich 1985 these negatively charged chemisorbed oxygen species are potent oxidizers wang et al 2008 liu et al 2009 kamal et al 2016 and the transfer of oxygen atom from o2 molecules to an organic molecule through chemisorbed oxygen species on catalyst surface is an important pathway involved in conventional wao processes operated at high temperatures kim and ihm 2011 notably chemisorbed oxygen species on nio surface are highly active and can react with various organic compounds zhu et al 2012 tian et al 2016 herein we propose the nio in ni nio gf electrode is the catalytically active sites for ecwao the spill over mechanism is used to explain the transportation of oxygen atom from o2 to tcs wasalathanthri et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the oxidation reaction takes place through alternative adsorption of o2 and consumption of chemisorbed oxygen species on nio ni the o2 molecule is first adsorbed onto nio and undergoes dissociation to form chemisorbed oxygen species o o2 which are then electro oxidized to their active states o o2 in anode electric field these activated oxygen species are highly active at room temperature and they react with tcs in subsequent steps such an oxidation reaction cleaves the tcs yielding co2 h2o and small organic products with dichlorophenol and monochlorophenol as intermediates this electrochemically induced catalytic air oxidation process is strongly dependent upon chemisorbed oxygen species on nio surface as well as the electron transfer ability of the nio ni catalyst the nio supplies available active sites to accommodate chemisorbed oxygen species and the presence of ni ensures the conductivity of the catalyst during the electro activation reaction 4 conclusion the ecwao process on anodic ni nio gf demonstrates high efficiency for the deep mineralization of refractory organic pollutants at low energy consumption the probe pollutant tcs at a high concentration of 0 4 mm obtains a mineralization efficiency of 86 0 1 4 within 105 min in the ecwao process and the sce of process is as low as 5 3 0 3 kw h kg toc 1 the ni nio gf electrode shows a stable catalytic activity over a wide ph range from 3 0 to 11 0 and excellent reusability with negligible metal leaching the oxidation of tcs by o2 in the ecwao process applies an oxygen transfer pathway from o2 molecule to tcs molecule through chemisorbed oxygen species on nio chemisorbed oxygen species are activated in the electric field via electro oxidation reaction which enables them to oxidize the tcs at room temperature the nio in ni nio gf electrode supplies active sites to accommodate chemisorbed oxygen species and ni ensures the conductivity of the catalyst during the electro activation reaction

four reaction mechanisms including hydroxylation of benzene ring cleavage of c c bridge bond substitution of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group and the single electron coupling mechanism were proposed for phenols degradation by fe vi the extracted peak areas of the degradation products showed that the single electron coupling reaction is the main degradation mechanism in fe vi oxidation processes in addition to direct attack by fe vi hydroxyl radical as detected by electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra also plays a role in phenols degradation the oh initiated reactions and single electron coupling reactions were further explored by total charges distribution transition state calculations and potential energy profiles in addition fe vi could also work as a highly effective

developed to meet the more strict water quality standards for the drinking water treatment waste water drainage and reuse treatment emery et al 2003 since phenolic compounds often inhibit or even kill a large number of bacterial species the application of biological treatment methods are practically limited in full scale municipal wastewater treatment plants borja et al 1996 for the removal of these phenolic contaminants the widely used treatment technologies include physical methods and chemical oxidation methods dieckmann and gray 1996 liu et al 2009 unfortunately traditional water treatment methods like activated carbon adsorption membrane filtration coagulation and flocculation will generate sludge and wastes during water treatment which need further processing ahmed et al 2010 unlu et al 2009 to date conventional chemical treatment methods such as chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet uv have been applied to remove phenols however chlorination processes generally lead to the formation of mono di tri and tetra chlorinated by products with larger toxicity than the parent compounds lane et al 2015 and disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas which have potential chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity bond et al 2011 ultraviolet irradiation of phenols may generate the toxic dioxin like compounds buth et al 2010 in this

degradation of the four phenolic compounds by fe vi were studied at ph 8 0 with the initial molar ratio of fe vi and compounds fe vi com ranging from 5 1 to 20 1 fig 1 shows that the applied fe vi dose significantly affected the degradation rates of these phenols the removal rates were improved obviously with the initial fe vi concentration increasing from 200 μm fe vi com 5 1 to 800 μm fe vi com 20 1 for example the degradation rates of ph after 300 s of reaction were 45 4 78 7 and 100 at a fe vi com molar ratio of 5 1 10 1 and 20 1 respectively among the four phenols studied cp was very readily degraded by fe vi followed by 4 cp and 2 bp with ph the most recalcitrant at a fe vi com molar ratio of 5 1 the degradation rates of 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp after 300 s were 60 0 45 4 95 1 and 72 9 respectively fig 1b gives an example of using second order reaction kinetics to fit the kinetic data according to eqs 1 3 the second order rate constant k can be obtained by plotting ln ct c0 against fe vi t the residual fe vi during the reaction process was measured and the results were shown in fig s1 obviously the degradation of these four compounds all followed second order reaction kinetics r 2 0 98 with the k value in the order of k cp 353 m 1 s 1 k 4 cp 131 m 1 s 1 k 2 bp 103 m 1 s 1 k ph 40 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2005a investigated the reactions of fe vi with 4 cp and ph at ph 7 and also found that the k of 4 cp 130 m 1 s 1 is higher than that of ph 77 m 1 s 1 these results indicate that the presence of chlorine and benzyl groups into benzene ring can improve the reactivity of the phenolic compounds with fe vi 1 d com dt k fe vi com 2 d com com k fe vi dt 3 ln com t com 0 k 0 t fe vi dt 3 2 elucidation of degradation pathways based on the identified degradation products figs s2 s12 the degradation pathways of the four compounds by fe vi were proposed op 88 op 108a op 108b op 109 op 114 and op 121 were validated using standards figs s13 s18 op 433a and op 433b were purified by our lab and their detailed chemical structures were further characterized by 1h nmr spectrum figs s19 and s20 therefore their presence in the reaction systems could be unequivocally confirmed figs s13 s21 3 2 1 hydroxylation of benzene ring pathway i describes hydroxylation of benzene ring that leads to the formation of op 198 op 199 op 205 op 215 op 229 op 231 and op 233 during fe vi oxidation of 2 bp fig 2 the identification of hydroxylation products strongly indicates the formation of hydroxyl radicals via the self decomposition of fe vi in aqueous solution lee et al 2005b the detection of hydroxyl radical by epr analysis will be discussed in the following section in pathway i 2 bp is prone to be attacked by oh resulting in the formation of oh adduct then the detachment of a hydrogen atom from the benzene ring yields the hydroxylation product op 199 op 199 can undergo consecutive hydroxylation via pathway i with the generation of op 215 and op 231 as the products moreover op 199 can also be oxidized by ferrate into some other products through pathway ia in this pathway hydrogen transfer reaction occurs between op 199 and ferrate and a stable phenoxy radical was then formed through electron resonance in the aromatic ring rush et al 1995 yang et al 2011 during this process hfeo4 was reduced into h2feo4 subsequent hydrogen transfer reaction of the phenoxyl radical with h2feo4 produces the corresponding p benzoquinone type product op 198 accompanied by the generation of fe iv as the reaction progresses op 198 was oxidized to z 2 benzyl 4 oxopent 2 enedioic acid op 233a via ring opening reaction which then underwent decarboxylic reaction to yield 2 benzylmaleic acid op 205 following the similar reaction mechanisms the tetrahydroxylated product op 231 was transformed into op 229 and then op 205 similar to 2 bp ph could be oxidized to op 108b op 114 and op 88 via pathway i hydroxylation of benzene ring in 4 cp leads to the formation of op 142 pathway i products including op 233b op 215 op 213 op 231 and op 229 are also observed in the fe vi oxidation of cp fig s22 3 2 2 cleavage of c c bridge bond fig 3 shows a proposed mechanism of pathway ii in which the formation of monocyclic products op 109 and op 121 was observed during the oxidation of 2 bp fe vi attacks the bridging c c bond of 2 bp molecule producing two carbon centered radicals toluene radical and phenol radical as the first step the o of fe vi connects via an associative type of mechanism with the methylene c in the toluene radical the hydrogen atom subsequently leaves to fe vi leading to the formation of benzaldehyde a next step adds the o of another fe vi to c 7 atom and the o atom transfer would oxidize benzaldehyde into benzoic acid op 121 accompanied with the reduction of fe vi to fe iv hydrolysis of phenol radical was observed to generate op 109 which was transformed into o quinone op 108a via pathway ia subsequently further oxidation occurred to form maleic acid op 114 oxalic acid op 88 and finally co2 and h2o gandini et al 2000 in order to examine the mineralization of organics total organic carbon toc content in reaction solutions was measured using a toc analyzer oi 1030d usa the toc removal of the four phenolic compounds during fe vi oxidation were shown in fig s23 and the removal rate after 300 s followed the order of ph 21 3 2 bp 45 7 4 cp 50 6 cp 51 7 according to toc data and lc analysis the degradation rates of these compounds were much larger than the toc removal extent this is attributed to the generation of more stable intermediates during fe vi oxidation process previous researches have also reported that the reactions of fe vi with organic molecules typically produce a variety of incomplete degradation products and yield limited mineralization han et al 2013 peings et al 2015 velo gala et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 following the similar pathway two monocyclic products op 121 and op 142 were generated from the reaction of cp with fe vi fig s22 3 2 3 substitution of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group 4 cp was chosen as an example to illustrate substitution of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group fig 4 pathway iii was initiated by the electrophilic attack of fe vi on the chlorine containing benzene ring resulting in the generation of an aromatic radical a subsequent cl abstraction by fe vi followed by water oxidation will lead to hocl fe iv and hydroquinone moreover oh attack on the c atom connecting to cl atom can also produce hydroquinone via pathway i it is reported that the para chlorine atom in substituted phenols is susceptible to be substituted by hydroxyl group liu et al 2009 hydroquinone is quickly converted to p benzoquinone op 108b via pathway ia then the ring opening reaction occurs to form op 170 which was further transformed into op 114 op 88 and co2 and h2o via decarboxylation and direct oxidation op 108b op 170 op 114 op 88 co2 h2o pathway iii also occurred in cp with the formation of various products such as op 199 op 198 op 261 op 233a op 205 op 130 and op 88 fig s22 3 2 4 the single electron coupling mechanism in addition to low molecular weight products fig s22 the coupling products of 2 bp m z 275 365 457 547 639 and 729 ph m z 185 277 and 369 cp m z 343 399 433 615 649 797 831 and 865 and 4 cp m z 219 252 311 345 378 470 and 506 are also detected thus fe vi mediated single electron coupling mechanism was proposed for the substrates as illustrated in fig 5 fe vi is a strong electrophilic agent which may abstract an electron from 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp to form various types of free radicals r1 r4 r5 r7 r8 r11 and r12 r14 respectively subsequently these radicals couple with each other at different positions to form dimers trimers and tetramers via o c or c o c bonds with regard to 2 bp three isomeric dimers op 365a op 365b and op 365c were observed to have the same molecular ion of m z 365 15 fig s24 suggesting that they might be formed from the radical coupling reaction of r1 r2 c 13 o 14 c 12 r2 2 bp c 13 o 14 c 11 and r3 r2 c 13 o 14 c 10 respectively generally the compound with a larger polarity is eluted earlier than the less polar product for a c18 reversed phase column then dipole moment μ of these three isomers was calculated by gaussian 09 program at the b3lyp 6 311g level according to the μ value product op 365a μ 3 42 au was eluted first followed by product op 365b μ 2 50 au and finally product op 365c μ 2 43 au in addition r2 and r4 radicals are most likely to couple to each other via o 14 c 8 bond to form a coupling species op 275 with the elimination of a benzyl group dimers formed through such a single electron coupling mechanism can in most cases undergo further coupling reactions to produce highly oligomers such as trimers op 457a op 457b and op 547a to op 547f and tetramers op 639 and op 729a to op 729f bollag 1992 huang et al 2005 and their structures are shown in fig s25 for 4 cp the two isomeric dimers op 252a and op 252b corresponding to two different peaks at m z 252 98 were generated via c o c r12 r13 and r13 4 cp coupling pathways respectively additionally the dimer op 219 mw 219 02 was formed from coupling of r13 and r14 via o 7 c 3 bond by eliminating a chlorine atom trimers and tetramers of 4 cp were also detected and their molecular structures are shown in fig s26 similar to 2 bp and 4 cp the coupling reactions of cp and ph took place predominantly via o c or c o c pathways as depicted in fig 5 fig s27 and fig s28 several intermediates op 121 op 433a and op 433b were quantified using available standards by lc ms analyses table s3 presents the lc ms conditions and calibration curves of these products when the initial fe vi dosage was 0 4 and 0 8 mm the concentrations of these three products after 300 s of cp oxidation were measured as 0 72 and 0 79 mg l 1 for op 121 7 17 and 2 17 mg l 1 for op 433a 7 11 and 0 26 mg l 1 for op 433b respectively this seems to suggest that the dimers op 433a and op 433b were important products during cp oxidation process moreover the concentrations of op 121 in 2 bp oxidation system were 0 27 and 0 26 mg l 1 respectively because there are no standards available for most of the products the peak areas of intermediate products were obtained from the extracted ion chromatogram xic to determine the preferential reaction pathway during fe vi oxidation processes fig 6 shows the peak areas of the degradation products of these four phenols treated with different doses of fe vi when the initial fe vi dosage was 0 4 and 0 8 mm the abundance of coupling products were approximately 1 20 16 26 and 1 68 25 09 times that of the low molecular weight products respectively thus the single electron coupling reaction is considered the main reaction mechanism in fe vi oxidation processes in environmental pollution control coupling reactions may represent a way of decreasing toxic effects of pollutants and can prevent leaching of notoriously toxic and recalcitrant contaminants by immobilizing them tukayi et al 2011 furthermore the coupling products usually become insoluble as the degree of polymerization increases and thus can be separated easily by adsorption filtration and or sedimentation strutt et al 2008 torres et al 2003 shi et al 2016 investigated the laccase catalyzed removal of cp from water and found the dimers were important reaction products the toxicity test results showed that the acute toxicity of cp to s obliquus was reduced to a very low level 10 after 90 min of reaction and thus the formation of dimer species is highly effective for the elimination of cp toxicity there are also evidences that laccase and mn iii oxidation of endocrine disrupting agents can lead to polymerization and reduced toxicity modaressi et al 2005 uchida et al 2001 wang et al 2018 however the physicochemical properties of degradation products and the ecotoxicity at environmentally relevant levels need to be further investigated 3 3 detection of hydroxyl radical epr spin trapping experiments with dmpo were conducted to demonstrate the generation of oh from self decay of fe vi as illustrated in fig 7 the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh radical adducts with the hyperfine splitting constants an 14 9 g ah 14 9 g sánchez et al 2013 were observed in fe vi solution at 8 0 clearly indicating the generation of oh however some researchers considered that the dmpo oh signal can be derived from the reaction of fe ii and fe iii with dmpo or the decomposition of dmpo ooh paciolla 2001 therefore methanol meoh ethanol etoh and tert butyl alcohol tba were used to further identify oh radical fang et al 2013 pelaez et al 2016 the reaction of oh with meoh etoh and tba could lead to the formation of ch2oh chch3oh and ch2c ch3 2oh radical respectively fig 7 from fig 7 the intensity of dmpo oh adducts significantly decreased in the presence of 1 m meoh followed by etoh and tba meanwhile a new six line epr spectrum appeared corresponding to dmpo ch2oh adduct ah 22 4 g an 15 5 g dmpo chch3oh adduct ah 22 7 g an 15 7 g and dmpo ch2c ch3 2oh adduct respectively feng et al 2016 these results indicated that dmpo oh spinning adduct signal was stemmed from the reaction of oh with dmpo hence oh radical plays a role in degrading phenols during fe vi oxidation process in previous studies the occurrence of hydroxylation products was generally attributed to high valent iron species anquandah et al 2011 jiang et al 2014 our results showed that we should not ignore the contribution of oh radical 3 4 theoretical calculations to rationalize the formation of phenoxy radical and the reaction of hydroxyl radical with phenols during fe vi oxidation process quantum chemical calculations were performed by gaussian 09 program at the m06 2x 6 311 g d p or m06 2x 6 311 g 2d p m06 2x 6 31 g d p level the oxidation reaction can easily occur at positions with more negative atomic charges chen et al 2016 for these four phenols the most negative npa charges were distributed at oxygen atoms of hydroxyl groups o 14 0 734 for 2 bp o 7 0 734 for ph o 14 0 728 for cp and o 7 0 728 for 4 cp fig 8a1 8d1 indicating that it is possible for these o atoms to lose one electron to form phenoxy radicals two critical parameters g and δg were also employed to predict the probability of hydrogen abstraction at different positions in substrate molecules to form the radicals tables s4 s7 present the computed g values of reactants and products com hfeo4 com h2feo4 in the reaction of the four substrates with fe vi fig 9 and figs s29 s31 show the potential energy profiles involved in the hydrogen abstraction of substrates for hydrogen abstraction at different c atoms the δg values were calculated to be 28 49 26 02 27 81 25 51 28 80 25 39 and 25 74 24 92 kcal mol for 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp respectively for hydrogen abstraction at the hydroxyl group the calculated δg value was 52 58 kcal mol for 2 bp 50 01 kcal mol for ph 52 71 kcal mol for cp and 50 10 kcal mol for 4 cp obviously the δg values of hydrogen abstraction at different c atoms are much higher than the hydroxyl group the large negative δg values suggest that the hydrogen abstraction is a process of reducing the energy of the reaction system thus hydrogen abstraction is most likely to occur at the hydroxyl group leading to the formation of reactive radicals fig 5 for subsequent coupling reactions to further identify possible structures of dimers trimers and tetramers the spin densities of 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp radicals were computed using gaussian 09 program as shown in fig 8a2 8d2 the spin unpaired electron was likely to distribute at the hydroxyl oxygen and the carbons at the conjugated ortho and para positions i e the atoms c 8 c 10 c 12 and o 14 for 2 bp and cp and c 1 c 3 c 5 and o 7 for ph and 4 cp thus the self coupling reactions can be proceeded via c c o c or c o c pathways these results were consistent with the formation of dimers trimers and tetramers detected in addition the oh initiated reactions including the substitution of hydrogen chlorine atoms by hydroxyl group were also interpreted by the results of dft calculations the geometry optimizations of reactants transition states and products involved in the reactions were performed at all possible positions of the four compounds the correctness of these calculations was confirmed with one and only one negative eigenvalue of the hessian matrix moreover intrinsic reaction coordinate irc analyses were employed to confirm all the transition states of the reaction pathways as shown in fig 10 and figs s32 s34 the calculated reaction barriers δgº involved in the hydroxyl substitution reactions were 24 71 39 42 11 74 33 93 18 61 34 69 and 17 96 27 27 kj mol for 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp respectively according to the δgº values the hydroxyl substitution reaction should easily occur at the c 4 c 4 c 11 and c 1 position for 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp respectively this was confirmed by the observation of hydroxylated products calculated change in enthalpy and gibbs free energy δhrxn and δgrxn were all negative for the reaction between substrates and hydroxyl radicals tables s9 s11 this indicates that the hydroxyl radical attacks the substrate to form the product complex with the decrease of the enthalpy and gibbs free energy on the basis of the energies at the m06 2x 6 311 g 2d p m06 2x 6 31 g d p level the rate constants of oh radical initiated reactions for four phenols were evaluated by transition state theory at 298 k and 1 atm tunneling correction factors and rate constants k for the ts species involved in the reactions with oh were determined using wigner method and the values are shown in tables s12 s15 the calculated rate constants for 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp are 3 66 10 11 5 73 10 9 5 80 10 10 and 9 34 10 10 cm3 molecule 1 s 1 respectively significantly the order of oh initiated reaction rate constants ph 4 cp cp 2 bp is largely inconsistent with the measured overall rate constants cp 4 cp 2 bp ph indicating that oh radical plays a minor role in the fe vi oxidation process of phenolic compounds which further confirms the results in section 3 2 4 the single electron coupling mechanism 3 5 applications in real waters natural water is a very complex system containing various kinds of salts organic matters and even microbes which may affect the conversion of contaminants shan et al 2014 to test the effectiveness of this fe vi oxidation technique for the removal of the four phenolic compounds from natural waters river water rw secondary wastewater effluent swe and synthetic wastewater sw were used as the reaction medium it is observed from fig 11 that the removal efficiency of the four compounds presented a similar trend in the three water samples with the order of swe rw sw fig 11 according to the water quality parameters in table s2 it is inferred that the relatively low removal in sw sample was mainly attributed to the large amount of natural organic matter as indicated by toc the consumption of oxidants by the organic matters would inhibit the removal of target compounds the removal efficiency of substrates after 300 s was larger than 85 8 in sw while complete removal can be achieved in swe and rw these results demonstrated that fe vi could work as a highly effective oxidant to eliminate the four compounds in real water matrices 4 conclusions we found that 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp could be effectively removed from water by fe vi oxidation processes reactions between fe vi and substrates obeyed second order kinetics and the k values at a fe vi com molar ratio of 5 1followed the order of k cp 353 m 1 s 1 k 4 cp 131 m 1 s 1 k 2 bp 103 m 1 s 1 k ph 40 m 1 s 1 oxidation of phenols by fe vi resulted in the formation of low molecular weight and coupling products which were identified by lc q tof ms technology four pathways including hydroxylation of benzene ring cleavage of c c bridge bond substitution of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group and single electron coupling were thus proposed according to the extracted peak areas of the degradation products single electron coupling mechanism was considered as the preferential pathway for substrates oxidation hydroxyl radical which was observed in electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra also contributes to phenols degradation during fe vi oxidation process the formation of phenoxy radicals and their subsequent coupling reactions as well as the reaction of oh radical with phenols were further rationalized by theoretical calculations effectiveness of this fe vi oxidation method was also demonstrated in secondary wastewater effluent and river water declaration of interests the

18826,in this paper the removal of 2 benzylphenol 2 bp phenol ph chlorophene cp and 4 chlorophenol 4 cp by fe vi have been examined at ph 8 0 the second order rate constant k for substrates degradation at a fe vi concentration of 0 2 mm was in the order of k cp 353 m 1 s 1 k 4 cp 131 m 1 s 1 k 2 bp 102 m 1 s 1 k ph 40 m 1 s 1 indicating that the presence of chlorine and benzyl groups in benzene ring can enhance the reactivity of the phenolic compounds with fe vi reaction products were identified by a liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc q tof ms and four reaction mechanisms including hydroxylation of benzene ring cleavage of c c bridge bond substitution of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group and the single electron coupling mechanism were proposed for phenols degradation by fe vi the extracted peak areas of the degradation products showed that the single electron coupling reaction is the main degradation mechanism in fe vi oxidation processes in addition to direct attack by fe vi hydroxyl radical as detected by electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra also plays a role in phenols degradation the oh initiated reactions and single electron coupling reactions were further explored by total charges distribution transition state calculations and potential energy profiles in addition fe vi could also work as a highly effective

developed to meet the more strict water quality standards for the drinking water treatment waste water drainage and reuse treatment emery et al 2003 since phenolic compounds often inhibit or even kill a large number of bacterial species the application of biological treatment methods are practically limited in full scale municipal wastewater treatment plants borja et al 1996 for the removal of these phenolic contaminants the widely used treatment technologies include physical methods and chemical oxidation methods dieckmann and gray 1996 liu et al 2009 unfortunately traditional water treatment methods like activated carbon adsorption membrane filtration coagulation and flocculation will generate sludge and wastes during water treatment which need further processing ahmed et al 2010 unlu et al 2009 to date conventional chemical treatment methods such as chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet uv have been applied to remove phenols however chlorination processes generally lead to the formation of mono di tri and tetra chlorinated by products with larger toxicity than the parent compounds lane et al 2015 and disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas which have potential chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity bond et al 2011 ultraviolet irradiation of phenols may generate the toxic dioxin like compounds buth et al 2010 in this

so4 and oh at smd m06 2x 6 311 g and smd b3lyp 6 311 g level and they found activity of so4 with acs through the set channel was higher than that of oh however the reaction of phenolic compounds with fe vi has not been explored sufficiently through the dft method in this study the performance of ferrate vi in treating phenolic contaminants and the degradation pathways were investigated four phenols including 2 benzylphenol 2 bp phenol ph chlorophene cp and 4 chlorophenol 4 cp were chosen as target compounds since they are extensively used for the production of preservatives pesticides disinfectants and antiseptics gupta et al 2002 meunier 2002 these compounds are widely found at concentration levels of ng l mg l in the aquatic environment and have been labeled as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency epa and european decision 2455 2001 ec faludi et al 2015 sirés et al 2007 the main objectives of this study are i to compare the

effect of water was also considered using the solvation model of density smd continuum solvation model luo et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of the four phenolic compounds degradation of the four phenolic compounds by fe vi were studied at ph 8 0 with the initial molar ratio of fe vi and compounds fe vi com ranging from 5 1 to 20 1 fig 1 shows that the applied fe vi dose significantly affected the degradation rates of these phenols the removal rates were improved obviously with the initial fe vi concentration increasing from 200 μm fe vi com 5 1 to 800 μm fe vi com 20 1 for example the degradation rates of ph after 300 s of reaction were 45 4 78 7 and 100 at a fe vi com molar ratio of 5 1 10 1 and 20 1 respectively among the four phenols studied cp was very readily degraded by fe vi followed by 4 cp and 2 bp with ph the most recalcitrant at a fe vi com molar ratio of 5 1 the degradation rates of 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp after 300 s were 60 0 45 4 95 1 and 72 9 respectively fig 1b gives an example of using second order reaction kinetics to fit the kinetic data according to eqs 1 3 the second order rate constant k can be obtained by plotting ln ct c0 against fe vi t the residual fe vi during the reaction process was measured and the results were shown in fig s1 obviously the degradation of these four compounds all followed second order reaction kinetics r 2 0 98 with the k value in the order of k cp 353 m 1 s 1 k 4 cp 131 m 1 s 1 k 2 bp 103 m 1 s 1 k ph 40 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2005a investigated the reactions of fe vi with 4 cp and ph at ph 7 and also found that the k of 4 cp 130 m 1 s 1 is higher than that of ph 77 m 1 s 1 these results indicate that the presence of chlorine and benzyl groups into benzene ring can improve the reactivity of the phenolic compounds with fe vi 1 d com dt k fe vi com 2 d com com k fe vi dt 3 ln com t com 0 k 0 t fe vi dt 3 2 elucidation of degradation pathways based on the identified degradation products figs s2 s12 the degradation pathways of the four compounds by fe vi were proposed op 88 op 108a op 108b op 109 op 114 and op 121 were validated using standards figs s13 s18 op 433a and op 433b were purified by our lab and their detailed chemical structures were further characterized by 1h nmr spectrum figs s19 and s20 therefore their presence in the reaction systems could be unequivocally confirmed figs s13 s21 3 2 1 hydroxylation of benzene ring pathway i describes hydroxylation of benzene ring that leads to the formation of op 198 op 199 op 205 op 215 op 229 op 231 and op 233 during fe vi oxidation of 2 bp fig 2 the identification of hydroxylation products strongly indicates the formation of hydroxyl radicals via the self decomposition of fe vi in aqueous solution lee et al 2005b the detection of hydroxyl radical by epr analysis will be discussed in the following section in pathway i 2 bp is prone to be attacked by oh resulting in the formation of oh adduct then the detachment of a hydrogen atom from the benzene ring yields the hydroxylation product op 199 op 199 can undergo consecutive hydroxylation via pathway i with the generation of op 215 and op 231 as the products moreover op 199 can also be oxidized by ferrate into some other products through pathway ia in this pathway hydrogen transfer reaction occurs between op 199 and ferrate and a stable phenoxy radical was then formed through electron resonance in the aromatic ring rush et al 1995 yang et al 2011 during this process hfeo4 was reduced into h2feo4 subsequent hydrogen transfer reaction of the phenoxyl radical with h2feo4 produces the corresponding p benzoquinone type product op 198 accompanied by the generation of fe iv as the reaction progresses op 198 was oxidized to z 2 benzyl 4 oxopent 2 enedioic acid op 233a via ring opening reaction which then underwent decarboxylic reaction to yield 2 benzylmaleic acid op 205 following the similar reaction mechanisms the tetrahydroxylated product op 231 was transformed into op 229 and then op 205 similar to 2 bp ph could be oxidized to op 108b op 114 and op 88 via pathway i hydroxylation of benzene ring in 4 cp leads to the formation of op 142 pathway i products including op 233b op 215 op 213 op 231 and op 229 are also observed in the fe vi oxidation of cp fig s22 3 2 2 cleavage of c c bridge bond fig 3 shows a proposed mechanism of pathway ii in which the formation of monocyclic products op 109 and op 121 was observed during the oxidation of 2 bp fe vi attacks the bridging c c bond of 2 bp molecule producing two carbon centered radicals toluene radical and phenol radical as the first step the o of fe vi connects via an associative type of mechanism with the methylene c in the toluene radical the hydrogen atom subsequently leaves to fe vi leading to the formation of benzaldehyde a next step adds the o of another fe vi to c 7 atom and the o atom transfer would oxidize benzaldehyde into benzoic acid op 121 accompanied with the reduction of fe vi to fe iv hydrolysis of phenol radical was observed to generate op 109 which was transformed into o quinone op 108a via pathway ia subsequently further oxidation occurred to form maleic acid op 114 oxalic acid op 88 and finally co2 and h2o gandini et al 2000 in order to examine the mineralization of organics total organic carbon toc content in reaction solutions was measured using a toc analyzer oi 1030d usa the toc removal of the four phenolic compounds during fe vi oxidation were shown in fig s23 and the removal rate after 300 s followed the order of ph 21 3 2 bp 45 7 4 cp 50 6 cp 51 7 according to toc data and lc analysis the degradation rates of these compounds were much larger than the toc removal extent this is attributed to the generation of more stable intermediates during fe vi oxidation process previous researches have also reported that the reactions of fe vi with organic molecules typically produce a variety of incomplete degradation products and yield limited mineralization han et al 2013 peings et al 2015 velo gala et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 following the similar pathway two monocyclic products op 121 and op 142 were generated from the reaction of cp with fe vi fig s22 3 2 3 substitution of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group 4 cp was chosen as an example to illustrate substitution of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group fig 4 pathway iii was initiated by the electrophilic attack of fe vi on the chlorine containing benzene ring resulting in the generation of an aromatic radical a subsequent cl abstraction by fe vi followed by water oxidation will lead to hocl fe iv and hydroquinone moreover oh attack on the c atom connecting to cl atom can also produce hydroquinone via pathway i it is reported that the para chlorine atom in substituted phenols is susceptible to be substituted by hydroxyl group liu et al 2009 hydroquinone is quickly converted to p benzoquinone op 108b via pathway ia then the ring opening reaction occurs to form op 170 which was further transformed into op 114 op 88 and co2 and h2o via decarboxylation and direct oxidation op 108b op 170 op 114 op 88 co2 h2o pathway iii also occurred in cp with the formation of various products such as op 199 op 198 op 261 op 233a op 205 op 130 and op 88 fig s22 3 2 4 the single electron coupling mechanism in addition to low molecular weight products fig s22 the coupling products of 2 bp m z 275 365 457 547 639 and 729 ph m z 185 277 and 369 cp m z 343 399 433 615 649 797 831 and 865 and 4 cp m z 219 252 311 345 378 470 and 506 are also detected thus fe vi mediated single electron coupling mechanism was proposed for the substrates as illustrated in fig 5 fe vi is a strong electrophilic agent which may abstract an electron from 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp to form various types of free radicals r1 r4 r5 r7 r8 r11 and r12 r14 respectively subsequently these radicals couple with each other at different positions to form dimers trimers and tetramers via o c or c o c bonds with regard to 2 bp three isomeric dimers op 365a op 365b and op 365c were observed to have the same molecular ion of m z 365 15 fig s24 suggesting that they might be formed from the radical coupling reaction of r1 r2 c 13 o 14 c 12 r2 2 bp c 13 o 14 c 11 and r3 r2 c 13 o 14 c 10 respectively generally the compound with a larger polarity is eluted earlier than the less polar product for a c18 reversed phase column then dipole moment μ of these three isomers was calculated by gaussian 09 program at the b3lyp 6 311g level according to the μ value product op 365a μ 3 42 au was eluted first followed by product op 365b μ 2 50 au and finally product op 365c μ 2 43 au in addition r2 and r4 radicals are most likely to couple to each other via o 14 c 8 bond to form a coupling species op 275 with the elimination of a benzyl group dimers formed through such a single electron coupling mechanism can in most cases undergo further coupling reactions to produce highly oligomers such as trimers op 457a op 457b and op 547a to op 547f and tetramers op 639 and op 729a to op 729f bollag 1992 huang et al 2005 and their structures are shown in fig s25 for 4 cp the two isomeric dimers op 252a and op 252b corresponding to two different peaks at m z 252 98 were generated via c o c r12 r13 and r13 4 cp coupling pathways respectively additionally the dimer op 219 mw 219 02 was formed from coupling of r13 and r14 via o 7 c 3 bond by eliminating a chlorine atom trimers and tetramers of 4 cp were also detected and their molecular structures are shown in fig s26 similar to 2 bp and 4 cp the coupling reactions of cp and ph took place predominantly via o c or c o c pathways as depicted in fig 5 fig s27 and fig s28 several intermediates op 121 op 433a and op 433b were quantified using available standards by lc ms analyses table s3 presents the lc ms conditions and calibration curves of these products when the initial fe vi dosage was 0 4 and 0 8 mm the concentrations of these three products after 300 s of cp oxidation were measured as 0 72 and 0 79 mg l 1 for op 121 7 17 and 2 17 mg l 1 for op 433a 7 11 and 0 26 mg l 1 for op 433b respectively this seems to suggest that the dimers op 433a and op 433b were important products during cp oxidation process moreover the concentrations of op 121 in 2 bp oxidation system were 0 27 and 0 26 mg l 1 respectively because there are no standards available for most of the products the peak areas of intermediate products were obtained from the extracted ion chromatogram xic to determine the preferential reaction pathway during fe vi oxidation processes fig 6 shows the peak areas of the degradation products of these four phenols treated with different doses of fe vi when the initial fe vi dosage was 0 4 and 0 8 mm the abundance of coupling products were approximately 1 20 16 26 and 1 68 25 09 times that of the low molecular weight products respectively thus the single electron coupling reaction is considered the main reaction mechanism in fe vi oxidation processes in environmental pollution control coupling reactions may represent a way of decreasing toxic effects of pollutants and can prevent leaching of notoriously toxic and recalcitrant contaminants by immobilizing them tukayi et al 2011 furthermore the coupling products usually become insoluble as the degree of polymerization increases and thus can be separated easily by adsorption filtration and or sedimentation strutt et al 2008 torres et al 2003 shi et al 2016 investigated the laccase catalyzed removal of cp from water and found the dimers were important reaction products the toxicity test results showed that the acute toxicity of cp to s obliquus was reduced to a very low level 10 after 90 min of reaction and thus the formation of dimer species is highly effective for the elimination of cp toxicity there are also evidences that laccase and mn iii oxidation of endocrine disrupting agents can lead to polymerization and reduced toxicity modaressi et al 2005 uchida et al 2001 wang et al 2018 however the physicochemical properties of degradation products and the ecotoxicity at environmentally relevant levels need to be further investigated 3 3 detection of hydroxyl radical epr spin trapping experiments with dmpo were conducted to demonstrate the generation of oh from self decay of fe vi as illustrated in fig 7 the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh radical adducts with the hyperfine splitting constants an 14 9 g ah 14 9 g sánchez et al 2013 were observed in fe vi solution at 8 0 clearly indicating the generation of oh however some researchers considered that the dmpo oh signal can be derived from the reaction of fe ii and fe iii with dmpo or the decomposition of dmpo ooh paciolla 2001 therefore methanol meoh ethanol etoh and tert butyl alcohol tba were used to further identify oh radical fang et al 2013 pelaez et al 2016 the reaction of oh with meoh etoh and tba could lead to the formation of ch2oh chch3oh and ch2c ch3 2oh radical respectively fig 7 from fig 7 the intensity of dmpo oh adducts significantly decreased in the presence of 1 m meoh followed by etoh and tba meanwhile a new six line epr spectrum appeared corresponding to dmpo ch2oh adduct ah 22 4 g an 15 5 g dmpo chch3oh adduct ah 22 7 g an 15 7 g and dmpo ch2c ch3 2oh adduct respectively feng et al 2016 these results indicated that dmpo oh spinning adduct signal was stemmed from the reaction of oh with dmpo hence oh radical plays a role in degrading phenols during fe vi oxidation process in previous studies the occurrence of hydroxylation products was generally attributed to high valent iron species anquandah et al 2011 jiang et al 2014 our results showed that we should not ignore the contribution of oh radical 3 4 theoretical calculations to rationalize the formation of phenoxy radical and the reaction of hydroxyl radical with phenols during fe vi oxidation process quantum chemical calculations were performed by gaussian 09 program at the m06 2x 6 311 g d p or m06 2x 6 311 g 2d p m06 2x 6 31 g d p level the oxidation reaction can easily occur at positions with more negative atomic charges chen et al 2016 for these four phenols the most negative npa charges were distributed at oxygen atoms of hydroxyl groups o 14 0 734 for 2 bp o 7 0 734 for ph o 14 0 728 for cp and o 7 0 728 for 4 cp fig 8a1 8d1 indicating that it is possible for these o atoms to lose one electron to form phenoxy radicals two critical parameters g and δg were also employed to predict the probability of hydrogen abstraction at different positions in substrate molecules to form the radicals tables s4 s7 present the computed g values of reactants and products com hfeo4 com h2feo4 in the reaction of the four substrates with fe vi fig 9 and figs s29 s31 show the potential energy profiles involved in the hydrogen abstraction of substrates for hydrogen abstraction at different c atoms the δg values were calculated to be 28 49 26 02 27 81 25 51 28 80 25 39 and 25 74 24 92 kcal mol for 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp respectively for hydrogen abstraction at the hydroxyl group the calculated δg value was 52 58 kcal mol for 2 bp 50 01 kcal mol for ph 52 71 kcal mol for cp and 50 10 kcal mol for 4 cp obviously the δg values of hydrogen abstraction at different c atoms are much higher than the hydroxyl group the large negative δg values suggest that the hydrogen abstraction is a process of reducing the energy of the reaction system thus hydrogen abstraction is most likely to occur at the hydroxyl group leading to the formation of reactive radicals fig 5 for subsequent coupling reactions to further identify possible structures of dimers trimers and tetramers the spin densities of 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp radicals were computed using gaussian 09 program as shown in fig 8a2 8d2 the spin unpaired electron was likely to distribute at the hydroxyl oxygen and the carbons at the conjugated ortho and para positions i e the atoms c 8 c 10 c 12 and o 14 for 2 bp and cp and c 1 c 3 c 5 and o 7 for ph and 4 cp thus the self coupling reactions can be proceeded via c c o c or c o c pathways these results were consistent with the formation of dimers trimers and tetramers detected in addition the oh initiated reactions including the substitution of hydrogen chlorine atoms by hydroxyl group were also interpreted by the results of dft calculations the geometry optimizations of reactants transition states and products involved in the reactions were performed at all possible positions of the four compounds the correctness of these calculations was confirmed with one and only one negative eigenvalue of the hessian matrix moreover intrinsic reaction coordinate irc analyses were employed to confirm all the transition states of the reaction pathways as shown in fig 10 and figs s32 s34 the calculated reaction barriers δgº involved in the hydroxyl substitution reactions were 24 71 39 42 11 74 33 93 18 61 34 69 and 17 96 27 27 kj mol for 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp respectively according to the δgº values the hydroxyl substitution reaction should easily occur at the c 4 c 4 c 11 and c 1 position for 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp respectively this was confirmed by the observation of hydroxylated products calculated change in enthalpy and gibbs free energy δhrxn and δgrxn were all negative for the reaction between substrates and hydroxyl radicals tables s9 s11 this indicates that the hydroxyl radical attacks the substrate to form the product complex with the decrease of the enthalpy and gibbs free energy on the basis of the energies at the m06 2x 6 311 g 2d p m06 2x 6 31 g d p level the rate constants of oh radical initiated reactions for four phenols were evaluated by transition state theory at 298 k and 1 atm tunneling correction factors and rate constants k for the ts species involved in the reactions with oh were determined using wigner method and the values are shown in tables s12 s15 the calculated rate constants for 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp are 3 66 10 11 5 73 10 9 5 80 10 10 and 9 34 10 10 cm3 molecule 1 s 1 respectively significantly the order of oh initiated reaction rate constants ph 4 cp cp 2 bp is largely inconsistent with the measured overall rate constants cp 4 cp 2 bp ph indicating that oh radical plays a minor role in the fe vi oxidation process of phenolic compounds which further confirms the results in section 3 2 4 the single electron coupling mechanism 3 5 applications in real waters natural water is a very complex system containing various kinds of salts organic matters and even microbes which may affect the conversion of contaminants shan et al 2014 to test the effectiveness of this fe vi oxidation technique for the removal of the four phenolic compounds from natural waters river water rw secondary wastewater effluent swe and synthetic wastewater sw were used as the reaction medium it is observed from fig 11 that the removal efficiency of the four compounds presented a similar trend in the three water samples with the order of swe rw sw fig 11 according to the water quality parameters in table s2 it is inferred that the relatively low removal in sw sample was mainly attributed to the large amount of natural organic matter as indicated by toc the consumption of oxidants by the organic matters would inhibit the removal of target compounds the removal efficiency of substrates after 300 s was larger than 85 8 in sw while complete removal can be achieved in swe and rw these results demonstrated that fe vi could work as a highly effective oxidant to eliminate the four compounds in real water matrices 4 conclusions we found that 2 bp ph cp and 4 cp could be effectively removed from water by fe vi oxidation processes reactions between fe vi and substrates obeyed second order kinetics and the k values at a fe vi com molar ratio of 5 1followed the order of k cp 353 m 1 s 1 k 4 cp 131 m 1 s 1 k 2 bp 103 m 1 s 1 k ph 40 m 1 s 1 oxidation of phenols by fe vi resulted in the formation of low molecular weight and coupling products which were identified by lc q tof ms technology four pathways including hydroxylation of benzene ring cleavage of c c bridge bond substitution of chlorine atom by hydroxyl group and single electron coupling were thus proposed according to the extracted peak areas of the degradation products single electron coupling mechanism was considered as the preferential pathway for substrates oxidation hydroxyl radical which was observed in electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra also contributes to phenols degradation during fe vi oxidation process the formation of phenoxy radicals and their subsequent coupling reactions as well as the reaction of oh radical with phenols were further rationalized by theoretical calculations effectiveness of this fe vi oxidation method was also demonstrated in secondary wastewater effluent and river water declaration of interests the

18827,efficient digestate dewatering is crucial to reduce the volume and transportation cost of solid residues from anaerobic digestion ad plants large variations in dewatered cake solids have been reported and predictive models are therefore important in design and operation of such plants however current predictive models lack validation across several digestion substrates pre treatments and full scale plants in this study we showed that thermogravimetric analysis is a reliable prediction model for dewatered cake solids using digestates from 15 commercial full scale plants the tested digestates originated from different substrates with and without the pre ad thermal hydrolysis process thp moreover a novel combined physicochemical parameter c n ash characterizing different digestate blends was identified by multiplying the c n ratio with ash content of the dried solids using samples from 22 full scale wastewater food waste and co waste plants a linear relationship was found between c n ash and predicted cake solids for digestates with and without pre ad thp pre ad thp improved predicted cake solids by increasing the amount of free water however solids characteristics like c n ratio and ash content had a more profound influence on the predicted cake solids than pre ad thp and type of dewatering device finally c n ash was shown to have a linear relationship to cake solids and reported polymer dose from eight full scale pre ad thp plants in conclusion we identified the novel parameter c n ash which can be used to predict dewatered cake solids regardless of dewatering device and sludge origin graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion ash biogas c n dewatering thermal hydrolysis 1 introduction as the world s population is growing the demand for dedicated sewage and organic waste treatment increases wastewater treatment generates two main streams of organic residues primary sludge ps from initial sewage sedimentation and waste activated sludge was from aerobic biological treatment of the sewage liquid phase was and ps with relatively low content of inorganic material e g sand are suitable as substrates for anaerobic digestion ad a biological process converting organic matter to renewable energy in the form of biogas organic waste from households or industry can be treated by co digestion with ps and was or digested separately regardless of substrate the digested residue digestate typically contains 95 98 water to reduce transportation costs efficient separation of water from solids dewatering is crucial thus polyelectrolytes polymers are added to the digestate to bind particles into larger aggregates resulting in increased water release rate kopp and dichtl 2001b however large variations in dewatered cake solids are reported in literature despite similar ad configurations barber 2016 implying that digestate physicochemical properties could be important in explaining these variations digestate dewatering and disposal can represent 30 50 of a full scale plants annual operating cost mikkelsen and keiding 2002 consequently predicting the expected cake solids is important for the design and optimization of full scale ad plants predictive models on dewatering have been developed or investigated by several authors nellenschulte and kayser 1997 kopp and dichtl 2001b klinksieg et al 2007 skinner et al 2015 to et al 2018 small particles have been negatively correlated to dewatered cake solids nellenschulte and kayser 1997 however this does not include the effect of pre treatments such as the thermal hydrolysis process thp that reduces particle size and still improves dewaterability neyens et al 2004 several methods of quantifying dewaterability have been studied including the use of filtration models skinner et al 2015 replication of the full scale process in the laboratory to et al 2018 rheological analysis klinksieg et al 2007 and thermogravimetric analysis tga kopp and dichtl 2001b while most studies correlate their predictions to a small number of full scale results kopp and dichtl 2001b found a linear relationship between their predicted cake solids and results from 33 full scale plants digesting sewage sludge the model assumes that polymer product and dosage in addition to selected dewatering device will be optimized by respective vendors in full scale to reach the predicted maximum cake solids by tga however it has not been validated for pre treated digestates or other substrates than sewage sludge summarized the literature on predictive models lacks comparison to a wide range of full scale data or does not include the effect of different substrates and pre treatments all models are limited in the way that no single physicochemical parameter has been found linking dewaterability to a range of digestion substrates like ps was or other organic wastes was containing up to 80 extracellular polymeric substances eps has strong water holding capacities neyens et al 2004 skinner et al 2015 christensen et al 2015 was has been described as a viscous gel like material linked by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces markis et al 2014 in contrast ps behaves like a colloidal suspension where particles are linked by the much weaker van der waals forces markis et al 2014 thus was has higher viscosity hong et al 2018 and less free water than ps leading to poor dewaterability kopp and dichtl 2001a neyens et al 2004 christensen et al 2015 the ps to was ratio is thus an important factor in digestate dewaterability despite the negative effect of was and eps on dewaterability no standard method for measuring eps has been developed christensen et al 2015 alternatives such as the volatile solids vs concentration have been suggested skinner et al 2015 but are not valid when digesting co wastes such as food waste higgins and rajagopalan 2017 additionally the vs content in ps and was is similar suarez iglesias et al 2017 and can therefore not explain the differences between these two substrates however a decreasing trend in dewaterability of digestates when the vs content increased was observed by kopp and dichtl 2001b and they suggested this could be due to different behavior of organic and inorganic particles nicholson et al 2018 investigated the effect of the carbon to nitrogen c n ratio on dewaterability and found that an increase in c n ratio coincided with increased dewaterability however both kopp and dichtl 2001b and nicholson et al 2018 suggested that used alone neither vs nor c n ratio could accurately predict dewaterability identifying a parameter that can describe these differences will help predict dewatered cake solids for conventional ad plants however the digestion substrate mix is often fixed and to improve dewaterability pre treatment such as the thp is needed neyens and baeyens 2003 the thp as ad pre treatment pre ad thp improves dewaterability but dewatering efficiencies depend on digestate characteristics and dewatering device barber 2016 improved dewaterability has been linked to reduced viscosity higgins et al 2017 this could be due to the solubilization of eps weakening the water holding capacities of the flocs in was neyens et al 2004 however the mechanisms explaining the effect of pre ad thp on dewatering and linking it to digestion substrates are not well documented in conclusion a universal physicochemical parameter is needed to describe digestate dewaterability and the effect of pre ad thp in this study we have developed a standardized and universal predictive model for dewatered cake solids by using a diverse sample set from full scale plants based on digestates from a range of wastewater food waste and co waste plants the objectives of this study were 1 to validate tga as a method to predict digestate cake solids after full scale dewatering for several digestion substrates with and without pre ad thp 2 to identify a universal digestate physicochemical parameter that can be used to predict cake solids and 3 to investigate the effect of pre ad thp on predicted cake solids 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples digestates were collected from a total of 22 plants in europe and the usa with and without pre ad thp to study the effect of physicochemical properties and pre ad thp on dewatered cake solids table 1 additionally full scale dewatered digestates were collected at the outlet of the dewatering device at 15 plants to compare cake solids predictions by tga to full scale dewatering results plants a o plants p v did not run a dewatering process or used additives complicating direct comparison to the other dewatered digestates thus comparison of tga predictions and full scale results for these plants were not valid or possible digestates collected from plants a h in the united kingdom uk were studied in most detail to identify physicochemical parameters affecting predicted cake solids these plants used mesophilic anaerobic digestion mad of sewage sludge with various pre treatment methods allowing comparison of conventional and pre ad thp digestates two configurations of thp before ad pre ad thp were sampled thp treating both ps and was and only the was in these plants all thps were operated at 165 c for 30 min while pasteurization involved pre treatment of ps and was at 70 c for 1 h data from plants i and j have earlier been published by our research group svensson et al 2018 all samples were shipped to the norwegian university of life sciences in norway and stored in dark airtight containers at 4 c until analyzed 2 2 thermogravimetric analysis thermogravimetric analysis tga was used to determine the free water and predict dewatered cake solids in accordance to kopp and dichtl 2001b with minor modifications described by svensson et al 2018 in brief 100 mg samples were dried at 35 c in a netzsch simultaneous tg dta dsc apparatus sta 449 f1 jupiter with a constant nitrogen flow of 20 ml min the drying curve was analyzed and the linear region prior to the change in drying rate due to the transition between free and interstitial water was identified linear regression analysis of this region identified the line defining the free water evaporation immediately before the transition the deviation between the drying curve and free water defining line was calculated to identify the point between free and interstitial water the drying curves are enclosed in supplementary material a calibration was done with mono disperse silica particles of diameters 1 86 μm 4 08 μm and 7 75 μm cospheric lcc usa repeatability was investigated using five replicates on the same sludge sample predicted cake solids was found to be 40 6 0 7 ds 2 3 low field nuclear magnetic resonance low field nuclear magnetic resonance lfnmr was used to determine bound water in digestates from plants a h lfnmr allowed a non invasive measurement of the bound water in the digestate and as opposed to dilatometric measurements does not require any sample alteration such as freezing a bruker mq20 minispec with a 0 47 t permanent magnet bruker billerica ma usa was used to perform the lfnmr measurements previously described by beck et al 2018 to define bound water for plants a h in brief five ml of each sample was pipetted into a pre weighed glass lfnmr tube and the total weight was recorded the probe region of the lfnmr was stabilized at room temperature 22 c using a bvt 3000 nitrogen temperature control unit bruker billerica ma usa two minutes were allowed for the sample to equilibrate in the instrument before data acquisition the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence was used to measure the spin spin relaxation time t2 relaxation time of the samples with 32 000 echoes gain 66 db 8 scans and a recycle delay of 5 s the pulse separation τ for the measurements was optimized for the different sets of samples to allow full t2 relaxation while minimizing τ the cpmg decay curves were analyzed by continuous non negative least squares nnls fitting lawson and hanson 1974 whittall et al 1991 using prospa 3 2 magritek aachen germany the nnls fitting in prospa provides a continuous distribution of t2 values 512 data points were determined for each fit and a smoothing parameter of 0 5 was selected for each peak both t2 values corresponding to maximum peak intensity and peak area were determined 2 4 moisture distribution in this study the classification from kopp and dichtl 2001a and vesilind 1994 with three main water fractions was used free water not bound by particles interstitial water bound by capillary forces surface water bound by adhesive forces and intracellular water including the water of hydration the sum of surface and intracellular water was termed bound water the amount of free interstitial and bound water was determined by combining data from lfnmr and tga analyses the free water was determined by tga as described in section 2 2 and total water was determined by drying a sample at 105 c until constant weight bound water was determined by lfnmr where the area of the peak with shortest relaxation time was calculated in relation to the total area of all peaks interstitial water was calculated by subtracting the free and bound water from the total amount of water different pre treatments and operational strategies of the ad process in plants a h lead to different digestate dry solids ds concentrations to calculate and compare the moisture distribution between digestates all results were normalized theoretically to 3 ds to evaluate the percentage of free interstitial and bound water normalization also allowed the comparison to previous results on moisture distribution applying tga and dilatometric measurements kopp and dichtl 2001a 2 5 composition analysis digestates were analyzed for ds vs ash carbon nitrogen iron and aluminum plants a h and acid detergent fiber adf plants i p and v in the search for a physiochemical factor reflecting the digestion substrate that could predict cake solids after dewatering the ds vs and ash concentration were measured gravimetrically in triplicates by drying a sample at 105 c to constant weight followed by combustion at 550 c carbon and nitrogen were measured by combusting a dried sample 105 c overnight at 1150 c with a constant flow of oxygen gas in a vario el cube elemental analyzer elementar analysensysteme gmbh hanau germany ps was ratios on dry solids basis were communicated by plant owner iron and aluminum were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp os samples were acidified and digested at 85 c overnight before being analyzed by icp ms or icp os adf was analyzed according to manufacturer s recommendations using an ankom200 fiber analyzer ankom technology macedon new york usa with f58 filter bags 2 6 statistical analysis principal components analysis pca was performed on physicochemical parameters from plants a h supplementary material b table sb1 using the software past hammer et al 2001 the correlation matrix was used since the variables were measured in different units 3 results and discussion 3 1 predicted cake solids by tga compared to full scale results full scale digestates and dewatered digestates originating from several different substrates with and without pre ad thp were used to validate the tga as a good method for prediction of cake solids the cake solids from 15 full scale dewatered digestates were successfully predicted by tga and ranged from 17 to 34 ds r2 0 90 fig 1 a which is in line with previous findings from centrifuge dewatering by kopp and dichtl 2001b r2 0 92 despite three different dewatering devices being used in the full scale plants centrifuge belt press and hydraulic filter press some authors challenge the validity of drying tests such as tga because the results depend on several factors such as material sample size and drying conditions vaxelaire and cezac 2004 however when calibrating with mono disperse silica and using the same drying conditions and sample size these issues were overcome for our samples the samples included digestates from digesters treating pure food waste sewage sludge and a blend of sewage sludge and food waste fig 1a additionally eight plants had pre ad thp installed hence we conclude that tga is a reliable method for predicting dewatered cake solids on digestates originating from different substrates and with pre ad thp because dewatering devices function differently one explanation for the difference in cake solids is the use of different dewatering devices to investigate the dewatering devices impact on final cake solids we therefore grouped centrifuges belt presses and hydraulic filter presses to determine if dewatering device would result in different correlations to the free water fraction measured by tga fig 1b grouping the results and applying linear regression analysis revealed that 7 higher cake solids were achieved with centrifuges compared to belt presses although having similar free water content fig 1b this observation corresponds well with literature where centrifuges were reported to achieve 2 7 higher cake solids compared to belt presses novak 2006 samples from hydraulic filter presses were 9 dryer than those from centrifuges although having similar free water content according to kopp and dichtl 2001b all the free water measured by tga are removed in full scale centrifuges hence this implies that some of the interstitial water is accessed with a hydraulic filter press other authors have argued that some interstitial water can also be removed in dewatering of sludge by centrifugation or filtration vesilind 1994 novak 2006 however published full scale data on hydraulic filter presses compared to centrifuges and belt presses in sludge dewatering were not found nevertheless industrial testing supports that hydraulic filter presses access more water than centrifuges and belt presses thunberg 2010 the largest influence of dewatering device in the cake solids range tested would be 5 ds comparing a belt press and a hydraulic filter press although dewatering device influenced the achieved cake solids the variation across the data set 17 34 ds cannot be explained by dewatering device hence the difference observed in cake solids 17 ds must be determined by digester substrate or operation in the following section we therefore focused on identifying a universal physicochemical parameter with the aim of relating this parameter to the water holding properties of digestates 3 2 digestate physicochemical properties the current body of literature on sewage sludge dewatering suggests that the ps was ratio the amount and composition of the organic matter vs c n the inorganic matter and the moisture distribution are all important parameters influencing dewatering this study aimed at identifying a single parameter that could describe digestate dewaterability eight plants plants a h were selected for detailed analysis of different physicochemical parameters the feedstock of these plants spanned a wide range of ps was ratios and different pre treatment methods were applied the physicochemical characteristics of digestates from plants a h supplementary material b table sb1 were combined in a principal component analysis pca to identify the influence of various parameters on the free water content fig 2 two principal components pc described 87 of the variance in the dataset for pc 2 15 the variance was mostly related to the moisture distribution free interstitial and bound water large amounts of free water correlated negatively with large amounts of interstitial and bound water similar to findings by kopp and dichtl 2001a pc 1 described 72 of the variation and was related to physicochemical parameters typically measured at wwtps or in commercial laboratories and the ratio of ps was plants a b and e fig 2 qa and plant h fig 2 qc had the highest amount of vs carbon and nitrogen in the digestates in addition these plants had high amounts of was compared to ps high amounts of vs and was have been shown to correlate negatively with dewatering performance kopp and dichtl 2001a 2001b skinner et al 2015 although similar in vs carbon and nitrogen content plants a b and e groups in qa while plant h is found in qc the reason for this could be the application of thp in plants a b and e giving higher amounts of free water compared to plant h high concentrations of iron and aluminum ash high ps was ratio and high carbon nitrogen c n ratio were found for plants in qb and qd these parameters had a positive impact on free water and hence the predicted cake solids fig 2 pc1 plant c having the highest c n ratio and concentration of iron and aluminum was also the plant with the highest amount of free water in the digestate fig 2 qb the moisture distribution was mainly described by pc2 which explained only 15 of the variance in the data set additionally measuring moisture distribution requires instruments not normally present at wwtps or in commercial laboratories the physicochemical parameters primarily described by pc1 were therefore considered more relevant and useful the negative axis of pc1 is described by vs carbon and nitrogen all representing the organic fraction of the sludge the positive axis of pc1 is described by a combination of organic c n and inorganic fractions ash iron and aluminum literature suggests that both organic and inorganic sludge content is important for the dewatering performance kopp and dichtl 2001b skinner et al 2015 miryahyaei et al 2019 thus the parameters described by the positive pc1 axis are potential predictors of dewatering and therefore discussed in more detail below the role of cations in dewatering has been studied by several authors higgins and novak 1997 park et al 2006 ngwenya et al 2018 the divalent bridging theory higgins and novak 1997 linked the charge of divalent cations to the stabilization of sludge flocs and improved dewaterability by binding to the negatively charged eps and particles ngwenya et al 2018 also proposed the same mechanisms for monovalent cations the ratio between monovalent and divalent cations has been shown to correlate with polymer dosage and dewaterability across multiple substrates higgins and rajagopalan 2017 the relatively high concentrations of iron and aluminum supplementary material b table sb1 probably arise from the addition of inorganic coagulants in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp as pointed out by park et al 2006 inorganic cations might be better expressed as a fraction of the ash the positive impact of low volatile solids vs content and hence high ash content on predicted cake solids fig 2 has also been reported by others skinner et al 2015 kopp and dichtl 2001b kopp and dichtl 2001b explained the positive influence of ash by the density difference between organic and inorganic particles and the binding of more water by capillary forces to organic particles miryahyaei et al 2019 showed that the addition of up to 0 07 g inert material g was reduced viscosity of the digestate and improved dewaterability however addition of food waste low in ash content has also been shown to improve dewaterability of sewage sludge higgins and rajagopalan 2017 although there seems to be an agreement in literature that the ash content plays a role in dewatering an additional factor is needed to correct for the differences seen between ps and was and when adding a co substrate this factor could be the c n ratio several authors have observed that was contains more nitrogen and protein than ps and that was dewaters less than ps kopp and dichtl 2001a suarez iglesias et al 2017 higgins and rajagopalan 2017 the c n ratio of ps was found to be substantially higher than was higgins and rajagopalan 2017 nicholson et al 2018 and was suggested to be an indicator of eps nicholson et al 2018 in addition to the difference observed in c n of ps and was svensson et al 2018 found a clear difference between c n ratios of source separated food waste ssfw digestate and was digestate the ssfw digestate dewatered to 34 ds outperforming the was digestate which dewatered to 17 ds hence the c n ratio reflects the superior dewatering performance of ps and food waste compared to was the amount of ps and was going to digestion can be challenging to accurately predict in full scale as this factor depends on flow meters and manual sampling conducted at sometimes irregular intervals therefore we propose to use c n as a substitute for the ps was ratio as this is a more general factor that also can be used for other substrates such as food waste summarized we identified four factors influencing dewatering positively c n ps was ash and iron and aluminium however since iron aluminium and other cations are a part of the ash and c n can be used as substitute for the ps was ratio we suggest only using two factors when relating digestate physiochemical properties to the free water and predicted cake solids c n ratio and ash these two factors have been studied separately in relation to dewatering but alone any of these two parameters cannot accurately describe the variance in dewatering in this study we therefore tried combining these parameters to investigate if the effect of both inorganic and organic material could explain predicted cake solids compared to organic material such as eps ash has a low water holding capacity which makes it an important parameter to include when assessing dewaterability additionally inorganic compounds have also been shown to act as a skeleton adding a more rigid and incompressible structure to the sludge rendering it easier to mechanically dewater qi et al 2011 this effect including improved drainage and passage of water is probably more important for dewaterability than just the low water holding capacity of ash qi et al 2011 the beneficial effect of cations beyond contributing with fixed solids was also observed by alm et al 2016 measuring less water per volatile solids in dewatered cake when adding fecl3 therefore to combine the effect of the organic and inorganic composition of the digestate we multiplied the two factors together to create one combined factor denoted c n ash both factors point in the same direction i e both high c n and high ash indicate low water binding and thus good dewaterability we then investigated its correlation with predicted cake solids 3 3 predicting cake solids from physicochemical parameters the sample set plants a v was used to study the correlation between c n ash and predicted cake solids by tga on a broad range of digestion substrates fig 3 the test matrix included digestion substrates such as sewage sludge pulp and paper sludge fish waste food waste and manure generally the data showed a linear relationship between c n ash and predicted cake solids for all plants r2 0 65 however when separating the pre ad thp plants and conventional ad plants a much stronger linear relationship was obtained r2 0 91 and r2 0 93 two equations were identified by linear regression to predict dewatered cake solids of conventional and pre ad thp digestates by using c n ash fig 3 the results show that the variation in cake solids can be described by digestate physicochemical properties defined by c n ash the difference in predicted cake solids between the food waste plants fig 3 cannot be explained by different ps was ratios svensson et al 2018 found a higher concentration of acid detergent fibers adf in ssfw digestate compared to was digestate increasing adf concentrations in the food waste digestates plants i p and v corresponded with increasing cake solids and c n ratios in this study data not shown thus the c n ash also reflects physicochemical properties in food waste digestates that are related to predicted cake solids c n described the water binding capacity of the organic fraction the amount of ash corrects for the inorganic material with low water binding capacity and skeleton building mechanisms the combined c n ash was found to successfully describe the water binding capacity of digestates the results suggest that the negative effect of high amounts of was can be counteracted if high amounts of ash is present in the digestate overall these results provide a novel correlation that can be used to predict the dewatered cake solids of conventional and pre ad thp digestate from the physicochemical parameter c n ash the two equations fig 3 also make it possible to study how the installation of a pre ad thp will influence the predicted cake solids 3 4 effect of pre ad thp on predicted cake solids the linear regression analysis of conventional and pre ad thp plants fig 3 was further used to study the effect of pre ad thp on predicted cake solids the pre ad thp changes the moisture distribution and increases the amount of free water for a given sludge blend thereby increasing the dewatered cake solids fig 3 in the c n ash range studied 1 7 4 7 the pre ad thp improved dewaterability by 5 7 ds depending on the digestate however the difference in cake solids described by c n ash was 17 ds hence digestate physiochemical properties have a bigger effect on the predicted cake solids than the application of pre ad thp 3 4 1 relating physicochemical parameters to full scale dewatered cake solids and polymer dose the main goal of the dewatering process is to reduce the wet mass of cake by achieving the highest possible cake solids concentration on the other hand the amount of polymer used to achieve the desired cake solids is also of economic importance the polymer dose kg active substance as ton ds and measured cake solids for eight full scale pre ad thp dewatering processes plants a e and l n were compared to c n ash to relate c n ash to full scale dewaterability fig 4 linear relationships were found for both cake solids r2 0 79 and polymer dose r2 0 90 as a function of c n ash fig 4 the highest reported polymer dose was at pre ad thp plants digesting more was than ps c n ash 1 7 1 8 and the lowest reported polymer dose from a plant digesting only ps c n ash 4 fig 4 this is in agreement with literature where was was readily solubilized in the thp compared to ps suarez iglesias et al 2017 and increasing concentrations of soluble biopolymers have been linked to increased polymer dosage in sludge dewatering to et al 2018 the results show that in addition to being correlated to the free water fraction measured by tga the c n ash is highly relevant to predict the full scale dewatering process including both cake solids and polymer dose for pre ad thp plants 3 5 practical applications although the importance of the ps was ratio is known in full scale operation the calculation of this ratio can be challenging due to dependence on flow meters as well as manual sampling by plant operators change in plant operation due to seasonal weather conditions variation in co waste quality and the digestion process itself also make it difficult to predict the effect of the substrate on digestate dewatering more controlled conditions can be applied in laboratory studies but comparison to full scale and other laboratory studies can be difficult due to the lack of standardized analytical methods to et al 2016 in addition large variations in sludge characteristics can also make it challenging to compare sludge blends used in different studies to et al 2016 for instance it is known that sludge age of was will change the dewatering performance barber 2014 a variable that is not adequately described when using the ps was ratio this study has identified a physicochemical parameter c n ash that overcomes these challenges and will make it easier to compare the sludge blends used in different dewatering studies in the industry the c n ash will give realistic expectations for the dewatering process this can support cost benefit analysis prior to investments in several ways as an example for a pre ad thp plant the dewatering process can result in 1 23 ds in cake solids using 16 kg as polymer ton ds fig 4 plant a c n ash 1 7 or 2 34 ds in cake solids using 4 kg as polymer ton ds fig 4 plant m c n ash 4 the different digestates described by c n ash will thus predict very different operational budgets for a plant including both expenses for polymer and disposal boráň et al 2010 consequently including c n ash in economic analysis can identify if optimization of the wastewater treatment process is necessary to maximize the amount of ps in the ad substrate the c n ash correlation is thus a powerful tool in the planning and budgeting of full scale plants piao et al 2016 in greenfield projects testing demonstration and comparison of relevant dewatering devices guilayn et al 2019 are done on existing plants c n ash can therefore help identify suitable digestates for testing it can also eliminate the need for full scale testing completely saving valuable time and money in an investment process process guarantees including dewatering expectations are commonly set years before they must be demonstrated in the actual set up if discrepancies are observed between expected and actual values after project completion c n ash can be used to identify if the dewatering process is not performing according to expectations or if the sludge blend has changed 4 conclusions this study presents novel insight regarding the impact of digestate physicochemical properties and pre ad thp on dewatered cake solids the following conclusions were made 1 tga is a good method to predict full scale dewatered cake solids the method was valid for digestates from sewage sludge food waste and co digestion of these substrates as well as pre ad thp digestates 2 a universal factor describing digestion substrates was found by multiplying the c n ratio by the ash content of digestate dry solids c n ash 3 strong linear relationships were found between c n ash and predicted cake solids by tga for 22 full scale plants when separating conventional and pre ad thp digestates dewatered cake solids of both conventional and pre ad thp digestates can thus be predicted from c n ash 4 pre ad thp improved predicted cake solids of digestates by increasing the amount of free water 5 c n ash showed linear relationships with both dewatered cake solids and polymer dose of full scale pre ad thp plants declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18827,efficient digestate dewatering is crucial to reduce the volume and transportation cost of solid residues from anaerobic digestion ad plants large variations in dewatered cake solids have been reported and predictive models are therefore important in design and operation of such plants however current predictive models lack validation across several digestion substrates pre treatments and full scale plants in this study we showed that thermogravimetric analysis is a reliable prediction model for dewatered cake solids using digestates from 15 commercial full scale plants the tested digestates originated from different substrates with and without the pre ad thermal hydrolysis process thp moreover a novel combined physicochemical parameter c n ash characterizing different digestate blends was identified by multiplying the c n ratio with ash content of the dried solids using samples from 22 full scale wastewater food waste and co waste plants a linear relationship was found between c n ash and predicted cake solids for digestates with and without pre ad thp pre ad thp improved predicted cake solids by increasing the amount of free water however solids characteristics like c n ratio and ash content had a more profound influence on the predicted cake solids than pre ad thp and type of dewatering device finally c n ash was shown to have a linear relationship to cake solids and reported polymer dose from eight full scale pre ad thp plants in conclusion we identified the novel parameter c n ash which can be used to predict dewatered cake solids regardless of dewatering device and sludge origin graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion ash biogas c n dewatering thermal hydrolysis 1 introduction as the world s population is growing the demand for dedicated sewage and organic waste treatment increases wastewater treatment generates two main streams of organic residues primary sludge ps from initial sewage sedimentation and waste activated sludge was from aerobic biological treatment of the sewage liquid phase was and ps with relatively low content of inorganic material e g sand are suitable as substrates for anaerobic digestion ad a biological process converting organic matter to renewable energy in the form of biogas organic waste from households or industry can be treated by co digestion with ps and was or digested separately regardless of substrate the digested residue digestate typically contains 95 98 water to reduce transportation costs efficient separation of water from solids dewatering is crucial thus polyelectrolytes polymers are added to the digestate to bind particles into larger aggregates resulting in increased water release rate kopp and dichtl 2001b however large variations in dewatered cake solids are reported in literature despite similar ad configurations barber 2016 implying that digestate physicochemical properties could be important in explaining these variations digestate dewatering and disposal can represent 30 50 of a full scale plants annual operating cost mikkelsen and keiding 2002 consequently predicting the expected cake solids is important for the

al 2007 skinner et al 2015 to et al 2018 small particles have been negatively correlated to dewatered cake solids nellenschulte and kayser 1997 however this does not include the effect of pre treatments such as the thermal hydrolysis process thp that reduces particle size and still improves dewaterability neyens et al 2004 several methods of quantifying dewaterability have been studied including the use of filtration models skinner et al 2015 replication of the full scale process in the laboratory to et al 2018 rheological analysis klinksieg et al 2007 and thermogravimetric analysis tga kopp and dichtl 2001b while most studies correlate their predictions to a small number of full scale results kopp and dichtl 2001b found a linear relationship between their predicted cake solids and results from 33 full scale plants digesting sewage sludge the model assumes that polymer product and dosage in addition to selected dewatering device will be optimized by respective vendors in full scale to reach the predicted maximum cake solids by tga however it has not been validated for pre treated digestates or other substrates than sewage sludge summarized the literature on predictive models lacks comparison to a wide range of full scale data or does not include the effect of different substrates and pre treatments all models are limited in the way that no single physicochemical parameter has been found linking dewaterability to a range of digestion substrates like ps was or other organic wastes was containing up to 80 extracellular polymeric substances eps has strong water holding capacities neyens et al 2004 skinner et al 2015 christensen et al 2015 was has been described as a viscous gel like material linked by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces markis et al 2014 in contrast ps behaves like a colloidal suspension where particles are linked by the much weaker van der waals forces markis et al 2014 thus was has higher viscosity hong et al 2018 and less free water than ps leading to poor dewaterability kopp and dichtl 2001a neyens et al 2004 christensen et al 2015 the ps to was ratio is thus an important factor in digestate dewaterability despite the negative effect of was and eps on dewaterability no standard method for measuring eps has been developed christensen et al 2015 alternatives such as the volatile solids vs concentration have been suggested skinner et al 2015 but are not valid when digesting co wastes such as food waste higgins and rajagopalan 2017 additionally the vs content in ps and was is similar suarez iglesias et al 2017 and can therefore not explain the differences between these two substrates however a decreasing trend in dewaterability of digestates when the vs content increased was observed by kopp and dichtl 2001b and they suggested this could be due to different behavior of organic and inorganic particles nicholson et al 2018 investigated the effect of the carbon to nitrogen c n ratio on dewaterability and found that an increase in c n ratio coincided with increased dewaterability however both kopp and dichtl 2001b and nicholson et al 2018 suggested that used alone neither vs nor c n ratio could accurately predict dewaterability identifying a parameter that can describe these differences will help predict dewatered cake solids for conventional ad plants however the digestion substrate mix is often fixed and to improve dewaterability pre treatment such as the thp is needed neyens and baeyens 2003 the thp as ad pre treatment pre ad thp improves dewaterability but dewatering efficiencies depend on digestate characteristics and dewatering device barber 2016 improved dewaterability has been linked to reduced viscosity higgins et al 2017 this could be due to the solubilization of eps weakening the water holding capacities of the flocs in was neyens et al 2004 however the mechanisms explaining the effect of pre ad thp on dewatering and linking it to digestion substrates are not well documented in conclusion a universal physicochemical parameter is needed to describe digestate dewaterability and the effect of pre ad thp in this study we have developed a standardized and universal predictive model for dewatered cake solids by using a diverse sample set from full scale plants based on digestates from a range of wastewater food waste and co waste plants the objectives of this study were 1 to validate tga as a method to predict digestate cake solids after full scale dewatering for several digestion substrates with and without pre ad thp 2 to identify a universal digestate physicochemical parameter that can be used to predict cake solids and 3 to investigate the effect of pre ad thp on predicted cake solids 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples digestates were collected from a total of 22 plants in europe and the usa with and without pre ad thp to study the effect of physicochemical properties and pre ad thp on dewatered cake solids table 1 additionally full scale dewatered digestates were collected at the outlet of the dewatering device at 15 plants to compare cake solids predictions by tga to full scale dewatering results plants a o plants p v did not run a dewatering process or used additives complicating direct comparison to the other dewatered digestates thus comparison of tga predictions and full scale results for these plants were not valid or possible digestates collected from plants a h in the united kingdom uk were studied in most detail to identify physicochemical parameters affecting predicted cake solids these plants used mesophilic anaerobic digestion mad of sewage sludge with various pre treatment methods allowing comparison of conventional and pre ad thp digestates two configurations of thp before ad pre ad thp were sampled thp treating both ps and was and only the was in these plants all thps were operated at 165 c for 30 min while pasteurization involved pre treatment of ps and was at 70 c for 1 h data from plants i and j have earlier been published by our research group svensson et al 2018 all samples were shipped to the norwegian university of life sciences in norway and stored in dark airtight containers at 4 c until analyzed 2 2 thermogravimetric analysis thermogravimetric analysis tga was used to determine the free water and predict dewatered cake solids in accordance to kopp and dichtl 2001b with minor modifications described by svensson et al 2018 in brief 100 mg samples were dried at 35 c in a netzsch simultaneous tg dta dsc apparatus sta 449 f1 jupiter with a constant nitrogen flow of 20 ml min the drying curve was analyzed and the linear region prior to the change in drying rate due to the transition between free and interstitial water was identified linear regression analysis of this region identified the line defining the free water evaporation immediately before the transition the deviation between the drying curve and free water defining line was calculated to identify the point between free and interstitial water the drying curves are enclosed in supplementary material a calibration was done with mono disperse silica particles of diameters 1 86 μm 4 08 μm and 7 75 μm cospheric lcc usa repeatability was investigated using five replicates on the same sludge sample predicted cake solids was found to be 40 6 0 7 ds 2 3 low field nuclear magnetic resonance low field nuclear magnetic resonance lfnmr was used to determine bound water in digestates from plants a h lfnmr allowed a non invasive measurement of the bound water in the digestate and as opposed to dilatometric measurements does not require any sample alteration such as freezing a bruker mq20 minispec with a 0 47 t permanent magnet bruker billerica ma usa was used to perform the lfnmr measurements previously described by beck et al 2018 to define bound water for plants a h in brief five ml of each sample was pipetted into a pre weighed glass lfnmr tube and the total weight was recorded the probe region of the lfnmr was stabilized at room temperature 22 c using a bvt 3000 nitrogen temperature control unit bruker billerica ma usa two minutes were allowed for the sample to equilibrate in the instrument before data acquisition the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence was used to measure the spin spin relaxation time t2 relaxation time of the samples with 32 000 echoes gain 66 db 8 scans and a recycle delay of 5 s the pulse separation τ for the measurements was optimized for the different sets of samples to allow full t2 relaxation while minimizing τ the cpmg decay curves were analyzed by continuous non negative least squares nnls fitting lawson and hanson 1974 whittall et al 1991 using prospa 3 2 magritek aachen germany the nnls fitting in prospa provides a continuous distribution of t2 values 512 data points were determined for each fit and a smoothing parameter of 0 5 was selected for each peak both t2 values corresponding to maximum peak intensity and peak area were determined 2 4 moisture distribution in this study the classification from kopp and dichtl 2001a and vesilind 1994 with three main water fractions was used free water not bound by particles interstitial water bound by capillary forces surface water bound by adhesive forces and intracellular water including the water of hydration the sum of surface and intracellular water was termed bound water the amount of free interstitial and bound water was determined by combining data from lfnmr and tga analyses the free water was determined by tga as described in section 2 2 and total water was determined by drying a sample at 105 c until constant weight bound water was determined by lfnmr where the area of the peak with shortest relaxation time was calculated in relation to the total area of all peaks interstitial water was calculated by subtracting the free and bound water from the total amount of water different pre treatments and operational strategies of the ad process in plants a h lead to different digestate dry solids ds concentrations to calculate and compare the moisture distribution between digestates all results were normalized theoretically to 3 ds to evaluate the percentage of free interstitial and bound water normalization also allowed the comparison to previous results on moisture distribution applying tga and dilatometric measurements kopp and dichtl 2001a 2 5 composition analysis digestates were analyzed for ds vs ash carbon nitrogen iron and aluminum plants a h and acid detergent fiber adf plants i p and v in the search for a physiochemical factor reflecting the digestion substrate that could predict cake solids after dewatering the ds vs and ash concentration were measured gravimetrically in triplicates by drying a sample at 105 c to constant weight followed by combustion at 550 c carbon and nitrogen were measured by combusting a dried sample 105 c overnight at 1150 c with a constant flow of oxygen gas in a vario el cube elemental analyzer elementar analysensysteme gmbh hanau germany ps was ratios on dry solids basis were communicated by plant owner iron and aluminum were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp os samples were acidified and digested at 85 c overnight before being analyzed by icp ms or icp os adf was analyzed according to manufacturer s recommendations using an ankom200 fiber analyzer ankom technology macedon new york usa with f58 filter bags 2 6 statistical analysis principal components analysis pca was performed on physicochemical parameters from plants a h supplementary material b table sb1 using the software past hammer et al 2001 the correlation matrix was used since the variables were measured in different units 3 results and discussion 3 1 predicted cake solids by tga compared to full scale results full scale digestates and dewatered digestates originating from several different substrates with and without pre ad thp were used to validate the tga as a good method for prediction of cake solids the cake solids from 15 full scale dewatered digestates were successfully predicted by tga and ranged from 17 to 34 ds r2 0 90 fig 1 a which is in line with previous findings from centrifuge dewatering by kopp and dichtl 2001b r2 0 92 despite three different dewatering devices being used in the full scale plants centrifuge belt press and hydraulic filter press some authors challenge the validity of drying tests such as tga because the results depend on several factors such as material sample size and drying conditions vaxelaire and cezac 2004 however when calibrating with mono disperse silica and using the same drying conditions and sample size these issues were overcome for our samples the samples included digestates from digesters treating pure food waste sewage sludge and a blend of sewage sludge and food waste fig 1a additionally eight plants had pre ad thp installed hence we conclude that tga is a reliable method for predicting dewatered cake solids on digestates originating from different substrates and with pre ad thp because dewatering devices function differently one explanation for the difference in cake solids is the use of different dewatering devices to investigate the dewatering devices impact on final cake solids we therefore grouped centrifuges belt presses and hydraulic filter presses to determine if dewatering device would result in different correlations to the free water fraction measured by tga fig 1b grouping the results and applying linear regression analysis revealed that 7 higher cake solids were achieved with centrifuges compared to belt presses although having similar free water content fig 1b this observation corresponds well with literature where centrifuges were reported to achieve 2 7 higher cake solids compared to belt presses novak 2006 samples from hydraulic filter presses were 9 dryer than those from centrifuges although having similar free water content according to kopp and dichtl 2001b all the free water measured by tga are removed in full scale centrifuges hence this implies that some of the interstitial water is accessed with a hydraulic filter press other authors have argued that some interstitial water can also be removed in dewatering of sludge by centrifugation or filtration vesilind 1994 novak 2006 however published full scale data on hydraulic filter presses compared to centrifuges and belt presses in sludge dewatering were not found nevertheless industrial testing supports that hydraulic filter presses access more water than centrifuges and belt presses thunberg 2010 the largest influence of dewatering device in the cake solids range tested would be 5 ds comparing a belt press and a hydraulic filter press although dewatering device influenced the achieved cake solids the variation across the data set 17 34 ds cannot be explained by dewatering device hence the difference observed in cake solids 17 ds must be determined by digester substrate or operation in the following section we therefore focused on identifying a universal physicochemical parameter with the aim of relating this parameter to the water holding properties of digestates 3 2 digestate physicochemical properties the current body of literature on sewage sludge dewatering suggests that the ps was ratio the amount and composition of the organic matter vs c n the inorganic matter and the moisture distribution are all important parameters influencing dewatering this study aimed at identifying a single parameter that could describe digestate dewaterability eight plants plants a h were selected for detailed analysis of different physicochemical parameters the feedstock of these plants spanned a wide range of ps was ratios and different pre treatment methods were applied the physicochemical characteristics of digestates from plants a h supplementary material b table sb1 were combined in a principal component analysis pca to identify the influence of various parameters on the free water content fig 2 two principal components pc described 87 of the variance in the dataset for pc 2 15 the variance was mostly related to the moisture distribution free interstitial and bound water large amounts of free water correlated negatively with large amounts of interstitial and bound water similar to findings by kopp and dichtl 2001a pc 1 described 72 of the variation and was related to physicochemical parameters typically measured at wwtps or in commercial laboratories and the ratio of ps was plants a b and e fig 2 qa and plant h fig 2 qc had the highest amount of vs carbon and nitrogen in the digestates in addition these plants had high amounts of was compared to ps high amounts of vs and was have been shown to correlate negatively with dewatering performance kopp and dichtl 2001a 2001b skinner et al 2015 although similar in vs carbon and nitrogen content plants a b and e groups in qa while plant h is found in qc the reason for this could be the application of thp in plants a b and e giving higher amounts of free water compared to plant h high concentrations of iron and aluminum ash high ps was ratio and high carbon nitrogen c n ratio were found for plants in qb and qd these parameters had a positive impact on free water and hence the predicted cake solids fig 2 pc1 plant c having the highest c n ratio and concentration of iron and aluminum was also the plant with the highest amount of free water in the digestate fig 2 qb the moisture distribution was mainly described by pc2 which explained only 15 of the variance in the data set additionally measuring moisture distribution requires instruments not normally present at wwtps or in commercial laboratories the physicochemical parameters primarily described by pc1 were therefore considered more relevant and useful the negative axis of pc1 is described by vs carbon and nitrogen all representing the organic fraction of the sludge the positive axis of pc1 is described by a combination of organic c n and inorganic fractions ash iron and aluminum literature suggests that both organic and inorganic sludge content is important for the dewatering performance kopp and dichtl 2001b skinner et al 2015 miryahyaei et al 2019 thus the parameters described by the positive pc1 axis are potential predictors of dewatering and therefore discussed in more detail below the role of cations in dewatering has been studied by several authors higgins and novak 1997 park et al 2006 ngwenya et al 2018 the divalent bridging theory higgins and novak 1997 linked the charge of divalent cations to the stabilization of sludge flocs and improved dewaterability by binding to the negatively charged eps and particles ngwenya et al 2018 also proposed the same mechanisms for monovalent cations the ratio between monovalent and divalent cations has been shown to correlate with polymer dosage and dewaterability across multiple substrates higgins and rajagopalan 2017 the relatively high concentrations of iron and aluminum supplementary material b table sb1 probably arise from the addition of inorganic coagulants in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp as pointed out by park et al 2006 inorganic cations might be better expressed as a fraction of the ash the positive impact of low volatile solids vs content and hence high ash content on predicted cake solids fig 2 has also been reported by others skinner et al 2015 kopp and dichtl 2001b kopp and dichtl 2001b explained the positive influence of ash by the density difference between organic and inorganic particles and the binding of more water by capillary forces to organic particles miryahyaei et al 2019 showed that the addition of up to 0 07 g inert material g was reduced viscosity of the digestate and improved dewaterability however addition of food waste low in ash content has also been shown to improve dewaterability of sewage sludge higgins and rajagopalan 2017 although there seems to be an agreement in literature that the ash content plays a role in dewatering an additional factor is needed to correct for the differences seen between ps and was and when adding a co substrate this factor could be the c n ratio several authors have observed that was contains more nitrogen and protein than ps and that was dewaters less than ps kopp and dichtl 2001a suarez iglesias et al 2017 higgins and rajagopalan 2017 the c n ratio of ps was found to be substantially higher than was higgins and rajagopalan 2017 nicholson et al 2018 and was suggested to be an indicator of eps nicholson et al 2018 in addition to the difference observed in c n of ps and was svensson et al 2018 found a clear difference between c n ratios of source separated food waste ssfw digestate and was digestate the ssfw digestate dewatered to 34 ds outperforming the was digestate which dewatered to 17 ds hence the c n ratio reflects the superior dewatering performance of ps and food waste compared to was the amount of ps and was going to digestion can be challenging to accurately predict in full scale as this factor depends on flow meters and manual sampling conducted at sometimes irregular intervals therefore we propose to use c n as a substitute for the ps was ratio as this is a more general factor that also can be used for other substrates such as food waste summarized we identified four factors influencing dewatering positively c n ps was ash and iron and aluminium however since iron aluminium and other cations are a part of the ash and c n can be used as substitute for the ps was ratio we suggest only using two factors when relating digestate physiochemical properties to the free water and predicted cake solids c n ratio and ash these two factors have been studied separately in relation to dewatering but alone any of these two parameters cannot accurately describe the variance in dewatering in this study we therefore tried combining these parameters to investigate if the effect of both inorganic and organic material could explain predicted cake solids compared to organic material such as eps ash has a low water holding capacity which makes it an important parameter to include when assessing dewaterability additionally inorganic compounds have also been shown to act as a skeleton adding a more rigid and incompressible structure to the sludge rendering it easier to mechanically dewater qi et al 2011 this effect including improved drainage and passage of water is probably more important for dewaterability than just the low water holding capacity of ash qi et al 2011 the beneficial effect of cations beyond contributing with fixed solids was also observed by alm et al 2016 measuring less water per volatile solids in dewatered cake when adding fecl3 therefore to combine the effect of the organic and inorganic composition of the digestate we multiplied the two factors together to create one combined factor denoted c n ash both factors point in the same direction i e both high c n and high ash indicate low water binding and thus good dewaterability we then investigated its correlation with predicted cake solids 3 3 predicting cake solids from physicochemical parameters the sample set plants a v was used to study the correlation between c n ash and predicted cake solids by tga on a broad range of digestion substrates fig 3 the test matrix included digestion substrates such as sewage sludge pulp and paper sludge fish waste food waste and manure generally the data showed a linear relationship between c n ash and predicted cake solids for all plants r2 0 65 however when separating the pre ad thp plants and conventional ad plants a much stronger linear relationship was obtained r2 0 91 and r2 0 93 two equations were identified by linear regression to predict dewatered cake solids of conventional and pre ad thp digestates by using c n ash fig 3 the results show that the variation in cake solids can be described by digestate physicochemical properties defined by c n ash the difference in predicted cake solids between the food waste plants fig 3 cannot be explained by different ps was ratios svensson et al 2018 found a higher concentration of acid detergent fibers adf in ssfw digestate compared to was digestate increasing adf concentrations in the food waste digestates plants i p and v corresponded with increasing cake solids and c n ratios in this study data not shown thus the c n ash also reflects physicochemical properties in food waste digestates that are related to predicted cake solids c n described the water binding capacity of the organic fraction the amount of ash corrects for the inorganic material with low water binding capacity and skeleton building mechanisms the combined c n ash was found to successfully describe the water binding capacity of digestates the results suggest that the negative effect of high amounts of was can be counteracted if high amounts of ash is present in the digestate overall these results provide a novel correlation that can be used to predict the dewatered cake solids of conventional and pre ad thp digestate from the physicochemical parameter c n ash the two equations fig 3 also make it possible to study how the installation of a pre ad thp will influence the predicted cake solids 3 4 effect of pre ad thp on predicted cake solids the linear regression analysis of conventional and pre ad thp plants fig 3 was further used to study the effect of pre ad thp on predicted cake solids the pre ad thp changes the moisture distribution and increases the amount of free water for a given sludge blend thereby increasing the dewatered cake solids fig 3 in the c n ash range studied 1 7 4 7 the pre ad thp improved dewaterability by 5 7 ds depending on the digestate however the difference in cake solids described by c n ash was 17 ds hence digestate physiochemical properties have a bigger effect on the predicted cake solids than the application of pre ad thp 3 4 1 relating physicochemical parameters to full scale dewatered cake solids and polymer dose the main goal of the dewatering process is to reduce the wet mass of cake by achieving the highest possible cake solids concentration on the other hand the amount of polymer used to achieve the desired cake solids is also of economic importance the polymer dose kg active substance as ton ds and measured cake solids for eight full scale pre ad thp dewatering processes plants a e and l n were compared to c n ash to relate c n ash to full scale dewaterability fig 4 linear relationships were found for both cake solids r2 0 79 and polymer dose r2 0 90 as a function of c n ash fig 4 the highest reported polymer dose was at pre ad thp plants digesting more was than ps c n ash 1 7 1 8 and the lowest reported polymer dose from a plant digesting only ps c n ash 4 fig 4 this is in agreement with literature where was was readily solubilized in the thp compared to ps suarez iglesias et al 2017 and increasing concentrations of soluble biopolymers have been linked to increased polymer dosage in sludge dewatering to et al 2018 the results show that in addition to being correlated to the free water fraction measured by tga the c n ash is highly relevant to predict the full scale dewatering process including both cake solids and polymer dose for pre ad thp plants 3 5 practical applications although the importance of the ps was ratio is known in full scale operation the calculation of this ratio can be challenging due to dependence on flow meters as well as manual sampling by plant operators change in plant operation due to seasonal weather conditions variation in co waste quality and the digestion process itself also make it difficult to predict the effect of the substrate on digestate dewatering more controlled conditions can be applied in laboratory studies but comparison to full scale and other laboratory studies can be difficult due to the lack of standardized analytical methods to et al 2016 in addition large variations in sludge characteristics can also make it challenging to compare sludge blends used in different studies to et al 2016 for instance it is known that sludge age of was will change the dewatering performance barber 2014 a variable that is not adequately described when using the ps was ratio this study has identified a physicochemical parameter c n ash that overcomes these challenges and will make it easier to compare the sludge blends used in different dewatering studies in the industry the c n ash will give realistic expectations for the dewatering process this can support cost benefit analysis prior to investments in several ways as an example for a pre ad thp plant the dewatering process can result in 1 23 ds in cake solids using 16 kg as polymer ton ds fig 4 plant a c n ash 1 7 or 2 34 ds in cake solids using 4 kg as polymer ton ds fig 4 plant m c n ash 4 the different digestates described by c n ash will thus predict very different operational budgets for a plant including both expenses for polymer and disposal boráň et al 2010 consequently including c n ash in economic analysis can identify if optimization of the wastewater treatment process is necessary to maximize the amount of ps in the ad substrate the c n ash correlation is thus a powerful tool in the planning and budgeting of full scale plants piao et al 2016 in greenfield projects testing demonstration and comparison of relevant dewatering devices guilayn et al 2019 are done on existing plants c n ash can therefore help identify suitable digestates for testing it can also eliminate the need for full scale testing completely saving valuable time and money in an investment process process guarantees including dewatering expectations are commonly set years before they must be demonstrated in the actual set up if discrepancies are observed between expected and actual values after project completion c n ash can be used to identify if the dewatering process is not performing according to expectations or if the sludge blend has changed 4 conclusions this study presents novel insight regarding the impact of digestate physicochemical properties and pre ad thp on dewatered cake solids the following conclusions were made 1 tga is a good method to predict full scale dewatered cake solids the method was valid for digestates from sewage sludge food waste and co digestion of these substrates as well as pre ad thp digestates 2 a universal factor describing digestion substrates was found by multiplying the c n ratio by the ash content of digestate dry solids c n ash 3 strong linear relationships were found between c n ash and predicted cake solids by tga for 22 full scale plants when separating conventional and pre ad thp digestates dewatered cake solids of both conventional and pre ad thp digestates can thus be predicted from c n ash 4 pre ad thp improved predicted cake solids of digestates by increasing the amount of free water 5 c n ash showed linear relationships with both dewatered cake solids and polymer dose of full scale pre ad thp plants declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18828,despite significant progress made in multiple aspects of capacitive deionization cdi a rational framework is in need for optimizing the design and operation of a large desalination system based on cdi in this work we develop a theoretical framework for guiding the design of a desalination plant based on cdi with ion exchange membranes i e membrane cdi or mcdi this framework is established by identifying 1 the practical design constraints 2 the inter relationships between different design and operating parameters 3 a set of independent variables and 4 the key performance metrics the proposed design framework reduces the degrees of freedom of the system and facilitates more focused and systematic analysis of the overall performance of an mcdi based desalination plant careful analysis using the proposed design framework suggests the presence of an optimal tradeoff curve that comprises all the possible optima of design and operating conditions with which an mcdi based desalination plant is the most cost effective we also show that the typical practice of using equal flowrates for charging and discharge yields very good performance compared to the optima as long as water recovery is not too high finally we also briefly explain the implication of this framework on cost based optimization of the design and operation of an mcdi based desalination plant graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization desalination plant design system optimization 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi as an emerging desalination technology has received fast growing interest in academic research and industrial development porada et al 2013a significant advances have been made in the past decade for fabricating high performance electrodes huang et al 2017 liu et al 2017 ratajczak et al 2019 designing novel cell configurations and operating modes jeon et al 2013 garcia quismondo et al 2013 2016 gao et al 2015 yang et al 2016 elucidating fundamental mechanisms of mass and charge transport biesheuvel et al 2011 suss et al 2014 hemmatifar et al 2015 qu et al 2018 he et al 2018 singh et al 2018 and developing numerical models of different degree of fidelity for describing cdi device behavior biesheuvel and bazant 2010 suss et al 2012 biesheuvel et al 2015 guyes et al 2017 while more research effort is still in need in each of these important aspects the development of cdi has advanced to a stage that practical considerations regarding how a cdi based desalination plant should be designed and operated become increasingly significant the need for practical design considerations has recently become more recognized by the cdi community notably a recent review paper systematically assesses the performance metrics in cdi and identifies several key metrics that are of particular practical importance hawks et al 2018 indeed many papers in the early cdi literature justifiably reported fundamentally important metrics that are not necessarily of direct practical significance in system design or operation i e these metrics should not directly be used as objective functions when optimizing system design and operation certain performance metrics that are of direct practical significance such as energy consumption and desalination rate were widely reported but often in ways that are more meaningful for fundamental understanding than for practical design and operation when formulating the design framework we will reiterate what performance metrics are practically important and how they should be defined to facilitate practical system analysis while cdi technology has already been used in relatively large scale suss et al 2015 theoretical framework has yet been formulated for optimizing the design and operation of cdi based water treatment and desalination plants in the core of such an optimization is the selection of the appropriate desalination rate to be quantified in this analysis so that the desalination process neither consumes excessive energy nor requires unreasonably large system size this inherent tradeoff between desalination rate and energy efficiency has been experimentally quantified for the charging step in cdi processes with carbon electrodes wang and lin 2018a and electrodes with intercalation materials liu and smith 2018 in order to obtain a meaningful tradeoff curve on which every point corresponds to the same effluent salinity the feed flowrate has to be adjusted in accordance with the current density in other words how the cdi device behaves sets the constraint for how the cdi device can be operated to reduce the feed salinity from its initial value to the target value developing a framework for design and optimization requires elucidating the constraints and inter relationships between different parameters in cdi operation because of the relatively large number of parameters that can be physically adjusted in cdi especially when considering both charging and discharge steps performing a systematic analysis to identify the optimal set of design and operating parameters by varying each parameter independently requires a dauntingly large number of simulations zhao et al 2013a 2013b demirer et al 2013 one way to make such an analysis more manageable is to arbitrate certain operating rules to reduce the degrees of freedom for the system for example most reported studies on cdi with constant current operation adopted equal flowrate and equal current density but opposite signs for both charging and discharge steps while fixing the flowrate and current density throughout the experiment may appear to be an elegant and natural choice we note that such a choice is completely arbitrary given the existence of almost infinite number of other possibilities in theory such a choice may very likely not be the optimal conditions for design and operation the primary goal of this paper is to elucidate the constraints and interrelationships between the different parameters in cdi processes in the context of designing and operating a cdi based desalination plant with certain specific treatment objectives the presented analysis is performed exclusively for flow by cdi processes with alternating charging and discharge steps as flow by systems are most widely studied in cdi literature and have actually been commercialized suss et al 2015 cdi based on flow electrode requires a completely different design framework and will not be discussed in the current analysis mcdi is a variant of cdi with the integration of ion exchange membranes iems compared with cdi mcdi has several advantages including improved charge efficiency reduced parasitic reactions and more stable effluent concentration lee et al 2006 biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 kim and choi 2010 we will focus on membrane cdi mcdi with constant current operation in the charging and discharge steps because it is easier for such a system to achieve a nearly constant effluent salinity which makes the analysis more convenient however we note that the example presented in this study with its choice of configuration and operation mode only serves to illustrate the underlying principle universally applicable for designing any cdi process operated with temporally distinct charging and discharge half cycles i e not steady state cdi with flow electrodes in this paper we first formally describe the design constraints performance metrics parameter classification and the dynamic steady state dss model for quantifying mcdi module behavior with these concepts and the dss mcdi model we introduce a theoretical framework for designing an mcdi based desalination plant using an example with three degrees of freedom this framework is then applied to simulate the mcdi performance presented as the tradeoff curves that quantify the inherent tradeoff between energy efficiency and desalination rate we then introduce an important new concept called optimal tradeoff curve that comprises a set of possible optima of design and operating conditions we also perform an additional analysis using a framework with two degrees of freedom and compare the resulting tradeoff curves to the optimal tradeoff curve lastly we briefly explain the general approach of using the optimal tradeoff curve to identify the optimal design and operating conditions that lead to the lowest cost of water production 2 theoretical development the following discussion from section 2 1 to 2 4 explains the key concepts and the dss mcdi model that serve to establish the theoretical framework for mcdi plant design to be introduced in section 2 5 throughout the discussion we intentionally avoid using the term mcdi system because an mcdi system can be ambiguously interpreted as an mcdi module or device or as an mcdi based desalination plant that consists of multiple mcdi modules this analysis applies to the design and operation of an mcdi based desalination plant it does not concern the structural geometric and material design of an mcdi module or device as all these properties are considered as known for a given mcdi module 2 1 design constraints for an mcdi plant the first design constraint is the feed water salinity c 0 which is typically considered constant for feed water from a given source the average target effluent salinity c d which is usually based on regulation standard can be considered as another constraint of system design i e the system should always be designed and operated to produce an effluent with a concentration of c d or lower to simplify our analysis we focus on a simple one solute feed solution with a 1 1 electrolyte as the model solute and one single c d in our discussion even though we well recognize that in realistic applications the feed solution has multiple species each of which may have its own regulation standard to further simplify our analysis we assume that the mcdi process will reduce the feed salinity from c 0 to c d exactly but not lower in all illustrative examples in this analysis we consistently use a c 0 of 20 mm and a c d of 13 mm another important parameter that can be considered as a constraint in designing an mcdi desalination plant is the plant capacity defined as the average flow rate of the diluted effluent with a salinity of c d the plant capacity is a design constraint because any desalination plant is designed to meet a certain level of water demand for desalination plant based on flow by mcdi processes with charging and discharge steps the plant capacity χ is defined as 1 χ q c t c t c t d c n q c m t c t t o t where q c is the plant scale flow rate of the effluent with a salinity c d in the charging step t c t d c and t t o t are the durations of the charging step discharge step and the full charging discharge cycle respectively t t o t t c t d c the plant scale flow rate q c is simply the product of the per module flow rate q c m and the number of installed modules n the feed salinity c 0 the target effluent salinity c d and the plant capacity χ are the three major design constraints for a desalination plant in this study we chose a χ of 20 m3 day 1 for all analyses for mcdi with constant current cc charging an extra design constraint is the cutoff voltage v m a x the cutoff voltage is the maximum cell voltage at which charging is terminated further charging beyond v m a x may lead to undesirable parasitic reactions and long term degradation of carbon electrodes due to faradaic reactions he et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 we note that while the voltage for electrolysis is in theory 1 2v many mcdi studies have adopted cutoff voltages significantly higher than 1 2v as high as 1 6 v without observing the emergence of gas bubbles likely due to the significant over potential required for practical electrolysis especially in the absence of catalyst and the hindrance of faradaic reactions due to the existence of ion exchange membranes zhao et al 2012 tang et al 2017 to a certain extent v m a x can also be considered as an operating parameter as one can freely specify v m a x as long as it is not detrimentally high indeed different v m a x have been used in different cdi studies reported in literature dlugolecki and van der wal 2013 kim and yoon 2015 treating v m a x as an operating parameter increases the degrees of freedom of the framework and adds extra complexity to the analysis therefore we arbitrarily classify v m a x as a design constraint and specify one single v m a x for all operations in this specific study regardless of the current density the mcdi cell will always be charged till cell voltage reaches v m a x 2 2 performance metrics much of the content in this section has been covered in a recent review paper by hawks et al on the systematic assessment of the significance of and relationship between different performance metrics hawks et al 2018 nonetheless we still present the definitions of key performance metrics and highlight their relevance to this analysis from the perspective of water treatment plant design the two major technical considerations based on which performance metrics are defined are energy consumption and the system size with the former related to operating cost and the later related to the capital cost bartholomew et al 2018 here system size does not refer to the physical size of the desalination plant but is rather defined based on the amount of the core component used for example the system size of a reverse osmosis ro plant can be quantified by the total area of ro membrane or the number of membrane modules each of which has a fixed membrane area the currently most widely used parameter for quantifying the size of cdi systems in the literature is electrode mass w e this is justifiable because electrode mass rather than area is a more sensible parameter for normalization when defining the specific salt adsorption capacity sac which is an important performance metric for cdi electrode materials and arguably the most widely reported metric in early cdi literature after all if sac were defined based on electrode area one can arbitrarily increase sac simply by making thicker electrodes which is not meaningful from a material development perspective however from the standpoint of system design in which the electrode material is given and thus the thickness and density are fixed it is more intuitive and sensible to use electrode area a to quantify the scale of the mcdi plant this is particularly true in the case of mcdi where iems are used in which case both electrodes and iems contribute to the scale dependent capital cost therefore in the following discussion we will adopt the convention of using electrode area for quantifying system scale noting that the conversion between w e and a is technically trivial we can quantify the scale of an mcdi desalination plant using the number of modules installed n a a m with a m being the electrode iem area of a given module to be called per module electrode area for all simulations in this study a m is set as 13 4 m2 another performance metric named productivity p has also been recently proposed to quantify the desalination rate hawks et al 2018 productivity is defined as the volume of deionized water produced per area of electrode in a unit time averaged over the full charging discharge cycle which can be expressed as 2 p q c m t c a m t c t d c χ n a m χ a as a quantitative metric of desalination rate p has the exact same dimension as flux which is one of the most important performance metrics regarding kinetics in pressure driven membrane processes for water treatment and desalination even though there is no water permeation through electrodes in flow by cdi or mcdi another important performance metric is the specific energy consumption sec for practical cdi plant design the more straightforward definition of sec is based on normalizing the energy consumption by the volume of the deionized water produced we denote sec with such a definition as s e c w with the subscript w representing water to distinguish it from s e c i i for ion which is more commonly used sec defined as the energy consumed to remove a unit mole or mass of ions porada et al 2013a suss et al 2015 s e c w can be mathematically expressed as 3 s e c w 0 t c t d c i t v t d t q c t c where i t is the electrical current and v t is the cell voltage both being functions of time this volume based definition is commonly adopted in other water treatment processes zhu et al 2009 elimelech and phillip 2011 we note that the definition of s e c w based on equation 3 already considers energy recovery in the discharge step when the signs of i t and v t are opposite to each other in practical cdi processes not 100 of the theoretically recoverable energy in the discharge step is actually recovered using energy recovery devices alkuran and orabi 2008 kang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 if we define the efficiency of energy recovery η as the ratio of actually recovered energy over theoretically recoverable energy the more precise definitions of s e c w should replace the numerator 0 t c t d c i t v t d t with 0 t c i t v t d t η t c t d c i t v t d t here we will simplify the current analysis using an ideal assumption that η 1 a more practical analysis can assume an η less than unity however we speculate that in real cdi processes η is highly dependent on how the system is operated and is thus not a constant unfortunately we currently do not have sufficient knowledge regarding how η is dependent on operation as only few studies actually implemented real energy recovery alkuran and orabi 2008 kang et al 2016 there exists an intrinsic tradeoff between energy efficiency and desalination rate in cdi processes just as in other desalination processes lin and elimelech 2017 specifically more energy consumption i e s e c w is required to achieve a higher desalination rate i e p if the same resulting separation is achieved to more intuitively reflect such a tradeoff relationship the inverse of s e c w i e s e c w 1 was used because s e c w 1 monotonically decreases with increasing p 2 3 operating design and module parameters the challenge of performing a rational design and optimization of an mcdi desalination plant is that there appear to be too many parameters involved in an mcdi model now that we have clearly defined the design constraints section 2 1 and the key performance metrics section 2 2 the remaining parameters are either operation module or device or design parameters here module parameters are material properties and geometry parameters that are characteristic of the mcdi module once a type of mcdi module is chosen from a supplier the module parameters are fixed and cannot be modified in the design framework material properties include but are not limited to porosity tortuosity pore distribution thickness and capacitance of the electrodes ion conductivity and permselectivity of the iems electrical resistances of the electrodes iems current collector and across different interfaces porada et al 2012 2013b lei et al 2013 qu et al 2015 dykstra et al 2016 li et al 2018 palakkal et al 2018 geometric parameters include but are not limited to the area of electrode iem assembly per module the thicknesses of different components and porosity of the spacer all these parameters are required for running the dss mcdi model to simulate the time dependent effluent salinity and voltage for a given current density while all these parameters that are used in the mcdi model will have impacts on system performance and are listed in table s1 we do not intend to investigate their specific impacts on the system performance we note that more comprehensive models will require additional parameters related to the flow pattern of water stream in the spacer channel especially for large mcdi modules with spatial distribution of ion concentration in the flow channel suss et al 2014 hemmatifar et al 2015 however the simplified dss mcdi model adopted in this study assumes complete mixing in the spacer channel and thus does not require these parameters the primary design parameter is simply the size of the mcdi desalination plant which can be quantified using either the number of modules installed n or the total electrode iems area installed a the conversion factor between the two is simply the per module electrode area a m all parameters other than the module and design parameter can be considered as operating parameters which are those that can be varied during the operation after mcdi plant is built typical operating parameters include flowrates current densities and durations of the charging and discharge steps we note that these operating parameters are not necessarily independent for example for a given mcdi module if the charging current density i c is chosen the design constraints c 0 and c d will determine the per module charging flowrate q c m similarly given i c the design constraint v m a x will determine the charging duration t c we will further discuss these interdependent relationships when we describe the design model framework in section 2 5 an important parameter that deserves additional attention here is the water recovery w r which is generally defined as 4 w r q c m t c q c m t c q d c m t d c q c t c q c t c q d c t d c where q d c is the total flow rate for the desalination plant in the discharge step q c m and q d c m are the flow rates for a single module in the charging and discharge steps respectively the two expressions in equation 4 are equivalent to each other based on the scaling principle that says the overall flowrate of a plant is simply the product of the per module flowrate and the number of modules in the case of equal flow rate for charging and discharge steps w r is reduced to t c t c t d c which is also equal to χ q c according to equation 1 w r is important because it affects the specific costs of pretreatment and pumping defined as the costs required for pretreating and pumping per volume of the deionized water specifically because it costs energy to pretreat and circulate the entire feed stream if only a very small fraction of feed stream eventually becomes product water i e w r is low the specific cost of pretreatment and pumping becomes prohibitively high this consideration is well known for optimizing ro processes in which determination of optimal w r has to consider practical operation factors such as pretreatment cost efficiency of energy recovery device and pressure drop along the module lachish 2002 if only sec required for pressure driven water permeation is considered the theoretical optimal w r should be zero which is obviously unrealistic in theory w r should be classified as a performance metric because it is consequent of how the module is operated however unlike energy consumption or desalination rate that depend on the operating conditions in a more complex manner as described by the dss mcdi model the determination of w r is trivial once the flowrates and durations of the charging and discharge steps are specified therefore we categorize w r in the following analysis as an operating parameter in the sense that it can be easily and predictably controlled by adjusting other parameters in fact we will treat w r as an important operating parameter to control in our design framework i e we will fix w r and apply equation 4 to determine the other operating parameters that are not specified or determined by other system constraints 2 4 dynamic steady state mcdi model a general mcdi model relates operation module and design parameters to the behavior of the mcdi module while different versions of mcdi model have different accuracy and complexity they all have a similar structure in terms of model inputs and outputs biesheuvel et al 2011 ahualli et al 2017 for mcdi with cc charging and discharge specifically the inputs are influent salinity flow rate current density and charging and discharge durations the outputs i e the module responses are effluent salinity and cell voltage whereas the module parameters include a series of material and geometry properties fig 1 for constant voltage operation which is not considered in this analysis cell voltage is one of the inputs and current density and effluent salinity are the major outputs here we will adopt a dynamic steady state dss model that couples the modified donnan model for ion distribution equilibrium and the nernst plank model for ion transport kinetics we also assume complete mixing for the spacer channel and the macropores of the electrodes respectively which highly simplifies the model development dykstra et al 2016 2017 despite these simplifications this model works reasonably well for predicting the performance of small mcdi modules in previous studies details of developing the dss mcdi model with cc charging and rc discharge are provided in supplementary information s1 we have also performed mcdi experiments and extracted several key model parameters by fitting experimental data using the dss mcdi model the experimental details and results are also presented in the supplementary information s2 for larger modules used in industry the spatial distribution of ion concentrations in the spacer channels and in the macropores may need to be considered in order to yield more accurate prediction of system performance very complicated models can be developed to account for the three dimensional distribution of ions in the macropores and spacer channels suss et al 2014 biesheuvel and bazant 2010 dykstra et al 2016 however we want to emphasize that fidelity and details of the actual mcdi or cdi model are irrelevant to the discussion of the framework the presented framework can use any model with different degree of accuracies and different parameters and structures as long as the model functions to convert the inputs into outputs as shown in fig 1 the choice of specific mcdi model and its parameters only affects the numerical values of the simulated results but not the theoretical framework of mcdi plant design which is the focus of the current study 2 5 theoretical framework for mcdi plant design the model framework for mcdi plant design describes the relationship between different operating parameters design constraints and performance metrics fig 2 this framework is composed of the dss mcdi model and several equations introduced above that define or relate several key parameters in this specific framework we use here as an illustration we choose three independent variables including the current density of charging i c water recovery w r and the number of modules installed n once these independent variables are chosen the other operating parameters such as per module flowrates in the charging and discharge steps and the discharge current density will be determined according to the design constraints and the dss mcdi model the details regarding how these operation parameters and the performance metrics are determined are given in table 1 the key to develop the design framework depicted in fig 2 and table 1 lies in understanding the relationships between different operating and design parameters these relationships are established based on the dss mcdi model the dss condition i e the amount of salt removed in the charging step equals the amount of salt released in the discharge step and the specified design constraints without this framework performing rational process design and optimization appears to be a daunting task due to the presence of many physically adjustable operating parameters e g q c m q d c m i c i d t c and t d c this framework however reduces the degrees of freedom for plant design to three i c w r and n all other operating parameters such as q c m q d c m t c t d c and i d c have to be adjusted accordingly to satisfy the design constraints based on the relationships comprising the framework certainly one can choose another set of three independent operating and design parameters instead of i c w r and n as long as the degrees of freedom remain three 3 results and discussion using the theoretical design framework with three degrees of freedom as introduced in section 2 5 we will first show how other operating parameters depend on the three chosen independent variables we will also show how the two key performance metrics p and s e c w depend on the independent variables we will then introduce a new concept called optimal tradeoff curve which sets the upper bound of the system performance lastly we will also briefly discuss design frameworks with lower degrees of freedom 3 1 three degrees of freedom 3 1 1 dependence of operating parameters and performance on independent variables following the flowchart in fig 2 and the rationales in table 1 we simulate the dependent operating parameters and the system performance metrics as functions of the chosen independent variables the major results of these simulations are presented in fig 3 first the per module flowrate in the charging step q c m is strongly dependent charging current density i c according the dss mcdi model with the given design constraints see step 1 in table 1 specifically q c m increases nearly linearly with increasing i c fig 3a because a higher i c leads to a higher salt removal rate which in turn enables the same salinity reduction δ c c 0 c d for a larger flow of feed water zhao et al 2012 2013a if we fix w r 50 in this case and the number of mcdi modules installed n the degree of freedom is reduced to one and the only independent variable is the charging current density i c in this case both the discharge current density i dc and the per module discharge flowrate q dc m can be determined according to steps 2 to 7 in table 1 specifically both i dc and q dc m decrease monotonically with increasing i c and the change of i dc and q dc m with respect to i c is more sensitive when n is lower fig 3b when i c is high the charging flowrate should be high accordingly fig 3a and at the same time it takes shorter time for the cell voltage to rise to v max which in turn allows the discharge to performed more slowly and for a longer t dc after illustrating how other operating parameters depend on the chosen independent variables let us discuss the dependence of system performance on these chosen independent variables if we fix w r at 50 and vary i c the dependence of s e c w on i c varies significantly with different n when n is high e g n 9 meaning that a large total area of electrode iems assembly is available for salt removal s e c w increases monotonically with increasing i c fig 3c in this case the discharge current density is significantly and consistently lower than i c fig 3b and thus does not contribute significantly to the overall energy consumption therefore charging current density dominates energy consumption and higher i c results in higher s e c w as n decreases the total area of electrode iems assembly diminishes for a given plant capacity when n becomes very low e g n 5 an interesting phenomenon emerges specifically s e c w decreases with increasing i c in the low i c regime and increases with increasing i c in the high i c regime there is a critical i c at which s e c w reaches minimum the presence of minimum s e c w at a small n can be explained as following when i c is low the per module charging flowrate q c m is low if n is also low the mcdi modules need to be charged for a large fraction of the full cycle time leaving very little time for the module to undergo discharge the very short discharge time t dc demands discharge to be operated at very high current density as evidenced by fig 3b discharging at such a high current density reduces the amount of energy that can be recovered in the discharge step or in worse case may even consume energy for discharge recovering less energy or consuming additional energy in the discharge step increases the overall s e c w therefore there exists a critical i c at which s e c w reaches minimum the value of the critical i c depends on n and the minimum s e c w vanishes or moves to a point out of the investigated range of i c as n becomes sufficiently high fig 3c we note that charging and discharge current densities in this analysis have no impact on the kinetic efficiency of the mcdi plant which is quantified by productivity p this is quite counter intuitive as current density typically strongly correlates with desalination rate zhao et al 2013a 2013b kim and yoon 2015 however in the current analysis with χ being a design constraint p is simply a function of n and χ according to eqn 2 in other words each curve on fig 3c has the same p for all the points on a curve it also suggests that when p is high i e n is low there exists a set of optimal operating conditions as specified by the critical i c and the corresponding i dc q c m and q dc m however when p is low i e n is high operating with lower i c is always preferred although the results on fig 3c are simulated with one single w r of 50 simulations with other w r suggest that the shapes of the s e c w vs i c curves have almost no dependence on w r fig 3d which is rather surprising but can nonetheless be explained according to eqn 2 t dc is determined for a given p once we know how charging is performed which determines i c and thus q c m and for how long it is performed i e t c different w r can be achieved with the same t dc by simply adjusting q dc m while the change of q dc m has strong influence on the average brine salinity c b it barely changes i dc this is because i c t c is very close to i dc t dc not exactly equal because the charge efficiencies of charging and discharge steps are slightly different according to the dss condition and t dc has already been determined once p t c and i c are given regardless of w r therefore i dc is independent of w r for given p t c and i c consequently w r has almost no impact on the overall performance of the system in terms of s e c w and p in light of the fact that higher w r leads to lower specific energy consumption for pretreatment and pumping as discussed in section 2 3 it appears that operating at high w r is preferred due to lack of disadvantage but the presence of advantages 3 1 2 tradeoff curves and optimal tradeoff curve we simulate the tradeoff curves that capture the intrinsic tradeoff between energy efficiency and desalination rate using this framework as depicted by fig 2 and table 1 specifically s e c w 1 is plotted against p to construct the tradeoff curve based on performance metrics that are normalized by the volume of product water such a s e c w 1 vs p tradeoff curve which is more meaningful for practical design can be converted from the more fundamental tradeoff between ion normalized energy consumption and desalination rate hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018a provided certain design constraints e g c 0 and c d and operating parameters e g q c m and q dc m are given four s e c w 1 vs p tradeoff curves obtained with different i c are shown in fig 4 a all points on the same tradeoff curve correspond to the same separation i e the same c 0 c d and wr and charging current density different points on the same tradeoff curve were obtained using different numbers of installed mcdi modules n because p is inversely proportional to n for a given χ according to eqn 2 both p and n are used as x axis top axis for n and bottom axis for p in general s e c w 1 always monotonically decreases with increasing p meaning that higher energy efficiency i e higher s e c w 1 can be achieved with a slower desalination rate i e lower p or a larger system i e larger n and a in theory an mcdi operation that is in the upper right position of the s e c w 1 vs p diagram is more efficient than an mcdi operation in the lower left position because the former is both faster and consumes less energy hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018a b this relative position rule is important for comparing the general performance i e considering both the kinetic and energetic aspects of different mcdi operations and will be used in finding the optimal conditions for designing and operating an mcdi plant when i c is high the dependence of s e c w 1 on p is weak fig 4a such dependence becomes stronger as i c progressively decreases the implication is that there is little compromise of energy efficiency for significantly enhancing p when i c is very high for example when i c is 7 4 a m 2 orange curve in fig 4a increasing p by three folds from 4 to 12 l h 1 m 2 only leads to a decrease of s e c w 1 by 18 and a corresponding increase of s e c w by 22 in contrast if i c is very low the energy consumption becomes very sensitive to desalination rate specifically when i c is 3 0 a m 2 blue curve in fig 4a the same three fold increase of p from 4 to 12 l h 1 m 2 reduces s e c w 1 by nearly 75 and increases s e c w by 400 due to the systematically varying sensitivity of s e c w 1 to the change of p at different i c the s e c w 1 vs p tradeoff curves for different i c intersect with each other there are six intersections for the four selected tradeoff curves presented in fig 4a and b out of which three are what we define as top intersections yellow circles in fig 4b the top intersections are intersections above which there exists no tradeoff curve generally if we assume that each tradeoff curve will intersect with all others there will be i 1 k 1 i intersections and k 1 top intersections for k intersecting tradeoff curves for the specific example in fig 4 the three top intersections divide the chosen range of p and thus n into four regimes i e p from 4 0 to 8 9 l h 1 m 2 8 9 10 4 l h 1 m 2 10 4 15 5 l h 1 m 2 and 15 5 22 0 l h 1 m 2 each regime has its own optimal i c out of the four i c chosen for simulation determined by applying the relative position rule to the four tradeoff curves within that regime the four segments connecting the three top intersections constitute a set of optimal conditions among all possible conditions used for simulating the four presented tradeoff curves fig 4b it means that within a certain range of desalination rate as quantified by p and thus n using the i c corresponding to the red curve in fig 4b always yields better performance than using the other three investigated i c the combination of these four regionally optimal segments leads to the quasi optimal tradeoff curve if we continue to increase the number of simulations to generate infinite number of tradeoff curves each corresponding to a different i c there will be infinite number of top intersections these top intersections will constitute a smooth tradeoff curve that is called the optimal tradeoff curve alternatively we can also scan a range of i c for each chosen p to identify the optimal i c that leads to the minimum s e c w fig 5 a for each p within the investigated range there exists an i c that leads to a minimum s e c w i e d s e c w d i c 0 this approach of the scanning i c for the minimum s e c w at a given p is numerically more efficient and perhaps also conceptually more straightforward than finding a large number of top intersections as illustrated in fig 4 with this approach we generate the optimal tradeoff curve and compare that to the quasi optimal tradeoff curve discussed in fig 4 the optimal tradeoff curve red in fig 5b is consistently above the quasi optimal tradeoff curve black in fig 5b which is expected according to how such an optimal tradeoff curve is defined and numerically established the optimal tradeoff curve comprises a set of optimal design and operating conditions that both comply with the design framework depicted in fig 2 and lead to the best overall performance in other words the optimal tradeoff curve also sets the performance limit for a given mcdi module and a given set of design constraints any mcdi design and operation can be denoted either on or below but not beyond the optimal tradeoff curve based on the relative position rule an mcdi plant should always be designed i e to specify n and operated i e to control i c according to optimal tradeoff curve regardless of the relative significance of capital and energy costs the ultimate optimization considering capital and energy costs is to identify the exact n and i c that leads to the lowest cost of water production the general strategy of using the optimal tradeoff curve with the knowledge of other cost parameters for economic optimization of an mcdi process will be briefly discussed at the end of the paper 3 2 system performance with reduced degrees of freedom the discussion in section 3 1 explains how we can reduce a myriad of variables to be considered in designing an mcdi plant to three important variables i e i c w r and p that we can independently control the presence of three independent variables suggests that the system has three degrees of freedom within the framework described in fig 2 we may swap an independent variable with a dependent variable while maintaining the same degrees of freedom we can also reduce the degrees of freedom by either 1 fixing the value of the independent variable s or 2 specifying additional constraint s or inter relationship s to the design and operation framework in this section we will discuss the impacts on design strategy when the degrees of freedom are reduced to two by adding a design constraint of equal charging and discharge flowrate in nearly all reported cdi studies the per module charging flowrate q c m was controlled to be identical to the per module discharge flowrate q dc m except in a very recent study in which the flowrate is intentionally varied to achieve a high recovery ramachandran et al 2019 while constant flowrate operation is most likely a choice of experimental convenience it may actually be more practical in real cdi operations considering that constant speed pumps are usually cheaper and more reliable than pumps designed to operate with frequent speed change whether that is true or not we want to show how this additional constraint affects the design framework and the overall system performance with an additional constraint that sets q c m to be equal to q dc m the degree of freedom is reduced from three to two if we assign i c and w r as the independent variables all other operating and design parameters can be determined based on the design framework illustrated in fig 6 and table 2 in this case we cannot freely choose the number of cdi modules installed because the productivity p is already determined once i c and w r are specified for a given plant capacity χ in this framework with two degrees of freedom there is only one s e c w 1 vs p tradeoff curve for each chosen w r each point on a tradeoff curve is obtained by specifying i c and determining other dependent parameters and the performance metrics following the scheme in fig 6 and table 2 we simulate the tradeoff curves for w r of 50 70 and 90 using i c from 3 0 to 10 5 a cm 2 fig 7 we note that only part of the curve for wr 90 is shown in the figure to make its productivity p comparable to the other two conditions comparing these three tradeoff curves we observe that when the lowest tested current density i c 3 0 a cm 2 is used an mcdi process with a lower w r is more energy efficient i e has a higher s e c w 1 on the other hand s e c w is less dependent on p for an mcdi process with a higher w r interestingly even with the arbitrary condition of equal charging and discharge flowrate the tradeoff curves for w r of 50 and 70 very closely approach and even visually overlap with the optimal tradeoff curve obtained using three degrees of freedom at least over a reasonable range of p specifically the tradeoff curves for w r 50 and w r 70 closely approach the optimal tradeoff curve when p is relatively low and high respectively fig 7 even when they deviate from the optimal tradeoff curve the deviation is relatively insignificant less than 9 difference in the worst case however when w r increases to 90 the tradeoff curve is significantly below the optimal tradeoff curve which implies that it is difficult to achieve optimal performance with equal charging and discharge flowrate at such a high w r the above analysis suggests that as long as w r is not too high we can simply adopt the typical practice of fixing the flowrate for charging and discharge to obtain tradeoff curves that are very close to the optimal tradeoff curve finally we note that most cdi and mcdi experiments reported in literature were performed not only with the condition of the equal flowrate but also with the condition of equal duration for the charging and discharge steps the degree of freedom is reduced to only one in all those experiments with such a stipulation the tradeoff curve in such a case is simply the tradeoff curve on fig 7 with a wr of 50 4 conclusions and implications the design framework presented in fig 2 and table 1 helps us simplify the system design by reducing an unwieldy set of many seemingly independent variables to three i c n and w r now the presence of the optimal tradeoff curve fig 4b and the very weak dependence of system performance on wr fig 3d help us further simplify the optimization of an mcdi plant design and operation first the relative independence of system performance on w r in a framework with three degrees of freedom and the fact that specific cost for pretreatment and pumping negatively correlates with w r clearly suggest that we should adopt a w r as high as practically feasible second the presence of the optimal tradeoff curve suggests that the two independent variables i c and n can be reduced to one if the process is to be optimized we can either choose i c or n as the independent design variable and the other can be determined based on the optimal tradeoff curve with all the design constraints inter relationships between different variables and a set of rules regarding the optimal tradeoff curve that emerge in the above discussion the optimal design of an mcdi plant which used to involve a series of arbitrations is now reduced to only one degree of freedom either i c or n it comes down to selecting the right i c or n that leads to the lowest levelized cost of water lcow in other words we simply need to move along the optimal tradeoff curve to identify the point corresponding to a set of performance metrics s e c w and p that yields the lowest lcow for a given set of cost parameters these cost parameters affect the capital costs e g unit cost of each mcdi module and the operating costs e g unit energy cost because desalination rate directly determines n i e the size of the plant for a given plant capacity it has a major influence on the total capital cost even though the total capital cost is likely non linear to n likewise energy cost has a strong impact on the operating cost per volume of product water although there are other components of the operating and management cost e g labor cost that does not depend on energy consumption in general if the unit price of an mcdi module is very high it is desirable to design and operate the mcdi plant with a higher p even at the cost of more energy consumption if however the energy cost is very high then we should move up along the optimal tradeoff curve to reduce s e c w even that entails more modules but in any case it is certain that the most cost effective design and operation must follow the optimal tradeoff curve from this perspective the optimal tradeoff curve presented in this study provides the technical basis for cost optimization in addition to this technical component performing cost optimization for an mcdi plant requires a specific cost model and detailed cost parameters and is beyond the scope of the current study acknowledgement s lin acknowledges the support

18828,despite significant progress made in multiple aspects of capacitive deionization cdi a rational framework is in need for optimizing the design and operation of a large desalination system based on cdi in this work we develop a theoretical framework for guiding the design of a desalination plant based on cdi with ion exchange membranes i e membrane cdi or mcdi this framework is established by identifying 1 the practical design constraints 2 the inter relationships between different design and operating parameters 3 a set of independent variables and 4 the key performance metrics the proposed design framework reduces the degrees of freedom of the system and facilitates more focused and systematic analysis of the overall performance of an mcdi based desalination plant careful analysis using the proposed design framework suggests the presence of an optimal tradeoff curve that comprises all the possible optima of design and operating conditions with which an mcdi based desalination plant is the most cost effective we also show that the typical practice of using equal flowrates for charging and discharge yields very good performance compared to the optima as long as water recovery is not too high finally we also briefly explain the implication of this framework on cost based optimization of the design and operation of an mcdi based desalination plant graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization desalination plant design system optimization 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi as an emerging desalination technology has received fast growing interest in academic research and industrial development porada et al 2013a significant advances have been made in the past decade for fabricating high performance electrodes huang et al 2017

mechanisms of mass and charge transport biesheuvel et al 2011 suss et al 2014 hemmatifar et al 2015 qu et al 2018 he et al 2018 singh et al 2018 and developing numerical models of different degree of fidelity for describing cdi device behavior biesheuvel and bazant 2010 suss et al 2012 biesheuvel et al 2015 guyes et al 2017 while more research effort is still in need in each of these important aspects the development of cdi has advanced to a stage that practical considerations regarding how a cdi based desalination plant should be designed and operated become increasingly significant the need for practical design considerations has recently become more recognized by the cdi community notably a recent review paper systematically assesses the performance metrics in cdi and identifies several key metrics that are of particular practical importance hawks et al 2018 indeed many papers in the early cdi literature justifiably reported fundamentally important metrics that are not necessarily of direct practical significance in system design or operation i e these metrics should not directly be used as objective functions when optimizing system design and operation certain performance metrics that are of direct practical significance such as energy consumption and desalination rate were widely reported but often in ways that are more meaningful for fundamental understanding than for practical design and operation when formulating the design framework we will reiterate what performance metrics are practically important and how they should be defined to facilitate practical system analysis while cdi technology has already been used in relatively large scale suss et al 2015 theoretical framework has yet been formulated for optimizing the design and operation of cdi based water treatment and desalination plants in the core of such an optimization is the selection of the appropriate desalination rate to be quantified in this analysis so that the desalination process neither consumes excessive energy nor requires unreasonably large system size this inherent tradeoff between desalination rate and energy efficiency has been experimentally quantified for the charging step in cdi processes with carbon electrodes wang and lin 2018a and electrodes with intercalation materials liu and smith 2018 in order to obtain a meaningful tradeoff curve on which every point corresponds to the same effluent salinity the feed flowrate has to be adjusted in accordance with the current density in other words how the cdi device behaves sets the constraint for how the cdi device can be operated to reduce the feed salinity from its initial value to the target value developing a framework for design and optimization requires elucidating the constraints and inter relationships between different parameters in cdi operation because of the relatively large number of parameters that can be physically adjusted in cdi especially when considering both charging and discharge steps performing a systematic analysis to identify the optimal set of design and operating parameters by varying each parameter independently requires a dauntingly large number of simulations zhao et al 2013a 2013b demirer et al 2013 one way to make such an analysis more manageable is to arbitrate certain operating rules to reduce the degrees of freedom for the system for example most reported studies on cdi with constant current operation adopted equal flowrate and equal current density but opposite signs for both charging and discharge steps while fixing the flowrate and current density throughout the experiment may appear to be an elegant and natural choice we note that such a choice is completely arbitrary given the existence of almost infinite number of other possibilities in theory such a choice may very likely not be the optimal conditions for design and operation the primary goal of this paper is to elucidate the constraints and interrelationships between the different parameters in cdi processes in the context of designing and operating a cdi based desalination plant with certain specific treatment objectives the presented analysis is performed exclusively for flow by cdi processes with alternating charging and discharge steps as flow by systems are most widely studied in cdi literature and have actually been commercialized suss et al 2015 cdi based on flow electrode requires a completely different design framework and will not be discussed in the current analysis mcdi is a variant of cdi with the integration of ion exchange membranes iems compared with cdi mcdi has several advantages including improved charge efficiency reduced parasitic reactions and more stable effluent concentration lee et al 2006 biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 kim and choi 2010 we will focus on membrane cdi mcdi with constant current operation in the charging and discharge steps because it is easier for such a system to achieve a nearly constant effluent salinity which makes the analysis more convenient however we note that the example presented in this study with its choice of configuration and operation mode only serves to illustrate the underlying principle universally applicable for designing any cdi process operated with temporally distinct charging and discharge half cycles i e not steady state cdi with flow electrodes in this paper we first formally describe the design constraints performance metrics parameter classification and the dynamic steady state dss model for quantifying mcdi module behavior with these concepts and the dss mcdi model we introduce a theoretical framework for designing an mcdi based desalination plant using an example with three degrees of freedom this framework is then applied to simulate the mcdi performance presented as the tradeoff curves that quantify the inherent tradeoff between energy efficiency and desalination rate we then introduce an important new concept called optimal tradeoff curve that comprises a set of possible optima of design and operating conditions we also perform an additional analysis using a framework with two degrees of freedom and compare the resulting tradeoff curves to the optimal tradeoff curve lastly we briefly explain the general approach of using the optimal tradeoff curve to identify the optimal design and operating conditions that lead to the lowest cost of water production 2 theoretical development the following discussion from section 2 1 to 2 4 explains the key concepts and the dss mcdi model that serve to establish the theoretical framework for mcdi plant design to be introduced in section 2 5 throughout the discussion we intentionally avoid using the term mcdi system because an mcdi system can be ambiguously interpreted as an mcdi module or device or as an mcdi based desalination plant that consists of multiple mcdi modules this analysis applies to the design and operation of an mcdi based desalination plant it does not concern the structural geometric and material design of an mcdi module or device as all these properties are considered as known for a given mcdi module 2 1 design constraints for an mcdi plant the first design constraint is the feed water salinity c 0 which is typically considered constant for feed water from a given source the average target effluent salinity c d which is usually based on regulation standard can be considered as another constraint of system design i e the system should always be designed and operated to produce an effluent with a concentration of c d or lower to simplify our analysis we focus on a simple one solute feed solution with a 1 1 electrolyte as the model solute and one single c d in our discussion even though we well recognize that in realistic applications the feed solution has multiple species each of which may have its own regulation standard to further simplify our analysis we assume that the mcdi process will reduce the feed salinity from c 0 to c d exactly but not lower in all illustrative examples in this analysis we consistently use a c 0 of 20 mm and a c d of 13 mm another important parameter that can be considered as a constraint in designing an mcdi desalination plant is the plant capacity defined as the average flow rate of the diluted effluent with a salinity of c d the plant capacity is a design constraint because any desalination plant is designed to meet a certain level of water demand for desalination plant based on flow by mcdi processes with charging and discharge steps the plant capacity χ is defined as 1 χ q c t c t c t d c n q c m t c t t o t where q c is the plant scale flow rate of the effluent with a salinity c d in the charging step t c t d c and t t o t are the durations of the charging step discharge step and the full charging discharge cycle respectively t t o t t c t d c the plant scale flow rate q c is simply the product of the per module flow rate q c m and the number of installed modules n the feed salinity c 0 the target effluent salinity c d and the plant capacity χ are the three major design constraints for a desalination plant in this study we chose a χ of 20 m3 day 1 for all analyses for mcdi with constant current cc charging an extra design constraint is the cutoff voltage v m a x the cutoff voltage is the maximum cell voltage at which charging is terminated further charging beyond v m a x may lead to undesirable parasitic reactions and long term degradation of carbon electrodes due to faradaic reactions he et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 we note that while the voltage for electrolysis is in theory 1 2v many mcdi studies have adopted cutoff voltages significantly higher than 1 2v as high as 1 6 v without observing the emergence of gas bubbles likely due to the significant over potential required for practical electrolysis especially in the absence of catalyst and the hindrance of faradaic reactions due to the existence of ion exchange membranes zhao et al 2012 tang et al 2017 to a certain extent v m a x can also be considered as an operating parameter as one can freely specify v m a x as long as it is not detrimentally high indeed different v m a x have been used in different cdi studies reported in literature dlugolecki and van der wal 2013 kim and yoon 2015 treating v m a x as an operating parameter increases the degrees of freedom of the framework and adds extra complexity to the analysis therefore we arbitrarily classify v m a x as a design constraint and specify one single v m a x for all operations in this specific study regardless of the current density the mcdi cell will always be charged till cell voltage reaches v m a x 2 2 performance metrics much of the content in this section has been covered in a recent review paper by hawks et al on the systematic assessment of the significance of and relationship between different performance metrics hawks et al 2018 nonetheless we still present the definitions of key performance metrics and highlight their relevance to this analysis from the perspective of water treatment plant design the two major technical considerations based on which performance metrics are defined are energy consumption and the system size with the former related to operating cost and the later related to the capital cost bartholomew et al 2018 here system size does not refer to the physical size of the desalination plant but is rather defined based on the amount of the core component used for example the system size of a reverse osmosis ro plant can be quantified by the total area of ro membrane or the number of membrane modules each of which has a fixed membrane area the currently most widely used parameter for quantifying the size of cdi systems in the literature is electrode mass w e this is justifiable because electrode mass rather than area is a more sensible parameter for normalization when defining the specific salt adsorption capacity sac which is an important performance metric for cdi electrode materials and arguably the most widely reported metric in early cdi literature after all if sac were defined based on electrode area one can arbitrarily increase sac simply by making thicker electrodes which is not meaningful from a material development perspective however from the standpoint of system design in which the electrode material is given and thus the thickness and density are fixed it is more intuitive and sensible to use electrode area a to quantify the scale of the mcdi plant this is particularly true in the case of mcdi where iems are used in which case both electrodes and iems contribute to the scale dependent capital cost therefore in the following discussion we will adopt the convention of using electrode area for quantifying system scale noting that the conversion between w e and a is technically trivial we can quantify the scale of an mcdi desalination plant using the number of modules installed n a a m with a m being the electrode iem area of a given module to be called per module electrode area for all simulations in this study a m is set as 13 4 m2 another performance metric named productivity p has also been recently proposed to quantify the desalination rate hawks et al 2018 productivity is defined as the volume of deionized water produced per area of electrode in a unit time averaged over the full charging discharge cycle which can be expressed as 2 p q c m t c a m t c t d c χ n a m χ a as a quantitative metric of desalination rate p has the exact same dimension as flux which is one of the most important performance metrics regarding kinetics in pressure driven membrane processes for water treatment and desalination even though there is no water permeation through electrodes in flow by cdi or mcdi another important performance metric is the specific energy consumption sec for practical cdi plant design the more straightforward definition of sec is based on normalizing the energy consumption by the volume of the deionized water produced we denote sec with such a definition as s e c w with the subscript w representing water to distinguish it from s e c i i for ion which is more commonly used sec defined as the energy consumed to remove a unit mole or mass of ions porada et al 2013a suss et al 2015 s e c w can be mathematically expressed as 3 s e c w 0 t c t d c i t v t d t q c t c where i t is the electrical current and v t is the cell voltage both being functions of time this volume based definition is commonly adopted in other water treatment processes zhu et al 2009 elimelech and phillip 2011 we note that the definition of s e c w based on equation 3 already considers energy recovery in the discharge step when the signs of i t and v t are opposite to each other in practical cdi processes not 100 of the theoretically recoverable energy in the discharge step is actually recovered using energy recovery devices alkuran and orabi 2008 kang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 if we define the efficiency of energy recovery η as the ratio of actually recovered energy over theoretically recoverable energy the more precise definitions of s e c w should replace the numerator 0 t c t d c i t v t d t with 0 t c i t v t d t η t c t d c i t v t d t here we will simplify the current analysis using an ideal assumption that η 1 a more practical analysis can assume an η less than unity however we speculate that in real cdi processes η is highly dependent on how the system is operated and is thus not a constant unfortunately we currently do not have sufficient knowledge regarding how η is dependent on operation as only few studies actually implemented real energy recovery alkuran and orabi 2008 kang et al 2016 there exists an intrinsic tradeoff between energy efficiency and desalination rate in cdi processes just as in other desalination processes lin and elimelech 2017 specifically more energy consumption i e s e c w is required to achieve a higher desalination rate i e p if the same resulting separation is achieved to more intuitively reflect such a tradeoff relationship the inverse of s e c w i e s e c w 1 was used because s e c w 1 monotonically decreases with increasing p 2 3 operating design and module parameters the challenge of performing a rational design and optimization of an mcdi desalination plant is that there appear to be too many parameters involved in an mcdi model now that we have clearly defined the design constraints section 2 1 and the key performance metrics section 2 2 the remaining parameters are either operation module or device or design parameters here module parameters are material properties and geometry parameters that are characteristic of the mcdi module once a type of mcdi module is chosen from a supplier the module parameters are fixed and cannot be modified in the design framework material properties include but are not limited to porosity tortuosity pore distribution thickness and capacitance of the electrodes ion conductivity and permselectivity of the iems electrical resistances of the electrodes iems current collector and across different interfaces porada et al 2012 2013b lei et al 2013 qu et al 2015 dykstra et al 2016 li et al 2018 palakkal et al 2018 geometric parameters include but are not limited to the area of electrode iem assembly per module the thicknesses of different components and porosity of the spacer all these parameters are required for running the dss mcdi model to simulate the time dependent effluent salinity and voltage for a given current density while all these parameters that are used in the mcdi model will have impacts on system performance and are listed in table s1 we do not intend to investigate their specific impacts on the system performance we note that more comprehensive models will require additional parameters related to the flow pattern of water stream in the spacer channel especially for large mcdi modules with spatial distribution of ion concentration in the flow channel suss et al 2014 hemmatifar et al 2015 however the simplified dss mcdi model adopted in this study assumes complete mixing in the spacer channel and thus does not require these parameters the primary design parameter is simply the size of the mcdi desalination plant which can be quantified using either the number of modules installed n or the total electrode iems area installed a the conversion factor between the two is simply the per module electrode area a m all parameters other than the module and design parameter can be considered as operating parameters which are those that can be varied during the operation after mcdi plant is built typical operating parameters include flowrates current densities and durations of the charging and discharge steps we note that these operating parameters are not necessarily independent for example for a given mcdi module if the charging current density i c is chosen the design constraints c 0 and c d will determine the per module charging flowrate q c m similarly given i c the design constraint v m a x will determine the charging duration t c we will further discuss these interdependent relationships when we describe the design model framework in section 2 5 an important parameter that deserves additional attention here is the water recovery w r which is generally defined as 4 w r q c m t c q c m t c q d c m t d c q c t c q c t c q d c t d c where q d c is the total flow rate for the desalination plant in the discharge step q c m and q d c m are the flow rates for a single module in the charging and discharge steps respectively the two expressions in equation 4 are equivalent to each other based on the scaling principle that says the overall flowrate of a plant is simply the product of the per module flowrate and the number of modules in the case of equal flow rate for charging and discharge steps w r is reduced to t c t c t d c which is also equal to χ q c according to equation 1 w r is important because it affects the specific costs of pretreatment and pumping defined as the costs required for pretreating and pumping per volume of the deionized water specifically because it costs energy to pretreat and circulate the entire feed stream if only a very small fraction of feed stream eventually becomes product water i e w r is low the specific cost of pretreatment and pumping becomes prohibitively high this consideration is well known for optimizing ro processes in which determination of optimal w r has to consider practical operation factors such as pretreatment cost efficiency of energy recovery device and pressure drop along the module lachish 2002 if only sec required for pressure driven water permeation is considered the theoretical optimal w r should be zero which is obviously unrealistic in theory w r should be classified as a performance metric because it is consequent of how the module is operated however unlike energy consumption or desalination rate that depend on the operating conditions in a more complex manner as described by the dss mcdi model the determination of w r is trivial once the flowrates and durations of the charging and discharge steps are specified therefore we categorize w r in the following analysis as an operating parameter in the sense that it can be easily and predictably controlled by adjusting other parameters in fact we will treat w r as an important operating parameter to control in our design framework i e we will fix w r and apply equation 4 to determine the other operating parameters that are not specified or determined by other system constraints 2 4 dynamic steady state mcdi model a general mcdi model relates operation module and design parameters to the behavior of the mcdi module while different versions of mcdi model have different accuracy and complexity they all have a similar structure in terms of model inputs and outputs biesheuvel et al 2011 ahualli et al 2017 for mcdi with cc charging and discharge specifically the inputs are influent salinity flow rate current density and charging and discharge durations the outputs i e the module responses are effluent salinity and cell voltage whereas the module parameters include a series of material and geometry properties fig 1 for constant voltage operation which is not considered in this analysis cell voltage is one of the inputs and current density and effluent salinity are the major outputs here we will adopt a dynamic steady state dss model that couples the modified donnan model for ion distribution equilibrium and the nernst plank model for ion transport kinetics we also assume complete mixing for the spacer channel and the macropores of the electrodes respectively which highly simplifies the model development dykstra et al 2016 2017 despite these simplifications this model works reasonably well for predicting the performance of small mcdi modules in previous studies details of developing the dss mcdi model with cc charging and rc discharge are provided in supplementary information s1 we have also performed mcdi experiments and extracted several key model parameters by fitting experimental data using the dss mcdi model the experimental details and results are also presented in the supplementary information s2 for larger modules used in industry the spatial distribution of ion concentrations in the spacer channels and in the macropores may need to be considered in order to yield more accurate prediction of system performance very complicated models can be developed to account for the three dimensional distribution of ions in the macropores and spacer channels suss et al 2014 biesheuvel and bazant 2010 dykstra et al 2016 however we want to emphasize that fidelity and details of the actual mcdi or cdi model are irrelevant to the discussion of the framework the presented framework can use any model with different degree of accuracies and different parameters and structures as long as the model functions to convert the inputs into outputs as shown in fig 1 the choice of specific mcdi model and its parameters only affects the numerical values of the simulated results but not the theoretical framework of mcdi plant design which is the focus of the current study 2 5 theoretical framework for mcdi plant design the model framework for mcdi plant design describes the relationship between different operating parameters design constraints and performance metrics fig 2 this framework is composed of the dss mcdi model and several equations introduced above that define or relate several key parameters in this specific framework we use here as an illustration we choose three independent variables including the current density of charging i c water recovery w r and the number of modules installed n once these independent variables are chosen the other operating parameters such as per module flowrates in the charging and discharge steps and the discharge current density will be determined according to the design constraints and the dss mcdi model the details regarding how these operation parameters and the performance metrics are determined are given in table 1 the key to develop the design framework depicted in fig 2 and table 1 lies in understanding the relationships between different operating and design parameters these relationships are established based on the dss mcdi model the dss condition i e the amount of salt removed in the charging step equals the amount of salt released in the discharge step and the specified design constraints without this framework performing rational process design and optimization appears to be a daunting task due to the presence of many physically adjustable operating parameters e g q c m q d c m i c i d t c and t d c this framework however reduces the degrees of freedom for plant design to three i c w r and n all other operating parameters such as q c m q d c m t c t d c and i d c have to be adjusted accordingly to satisfy the design constraints based on the relationships comprising the framework certainly one can choose another set of three independent operating and design parameters instead of i c w r and n as long as the degrees of freedom remain three 3 results and discussion using the theoretical design framework with three degrees of freedom as introduced in section 2 5 we will first show how other operating parameters depend on the three chosen independent variables we will also show how the two key performance metrics p and s e c w depend on the independent variables we will then introduce a new concept called optimal tradeoff curve which sets the upper bound of the system performance lastly we will also briefly discuss design frameworks with lower degrees of freedom 3 1 three degrees of freedom 3 1 1 dependence of operating parameters and performance on independent variables following the flowchart in fig 2 and the rationales in table 1 we simulate the dependent operating parameters and the system performance metrics as functions of the chosen independent variables the major results of these simulations are presented in fig 3 first the per module flowrate in the charging step q c m is strongly dependent charging current density i c according the dss mcdi model with the given design constraints see step 1 in table 1 specifically q c m increases nearly linearly with increasing i c fig 3a because a higher i c leads to a higher salt removal rate which in turn enables the same salinity reduction δ c c 0 c d for a larger flow of feed water zhao et al 2012 2013a if we fix w r 50 in this case and the number of mcdi modules installed n the degree of freedom is reduced to one and the only independent variable is the charging current density i c in this case both the discharge current density i dc and the per module discharge flowrate q dc m can be determined according to steps 2 to 7 in table 1 specifically both i dc and q dc m decrease monotonically with increasing i c and the change of i dc and q dc m with respect to i c is more sensitive when n is lower fig 3b when i c is high the charging flowrate should be high accordingly fig 3a and at the same time it takes shorter time for the cell voltage to rise to v max which in turn allows the discharge to performed more slowly and for a longer t dc after illustrating how other operating parameters depend on the chosen independent variables let us discuss the dependence of system performance on these chosen independent variables if we fix w r at 50 and vary i c the dependence of s e c w on i c varies significantly with different n when n is high e g n 9 meaning that a large total area of electrode iems assembly is available for salt removal s e c w increases monotonically with increasing i c fig 3c in this case the discharge current density is significantly and consistently lower than i c fig 3b and thus does not contribute significantly to the overall energy consumption therefore charging current density dominates energy consumption and higher i c results in higher s e c w as n decreases the total area of electrode iems assembly diminishes for a given plant capacity when n becomes very low e g n 5 an interesting phenomenon emerges specifically s e c w decreases with increasing i c in the low i c regime and increases with increasing i c in the high i c regime there is a critical i c at which s e c w reaches minimum the presence of minimum s e c w at a small n can be explained as following when i c is low the per module charging flowrate q c m is low if n is also low the mcdi modules need to be charged for a large fraction of the full cycle time leaving very little time for the module to undergo discharge the very short discharge time t dc demands discharge to be operated at very high current density as evidenced by fig 3b discharging at such a high current density reduces the amount of energy that can be recovered in the discharge step or in worse case may even consume energy for discharge recovering less energy or consuming additional energy in the discharge step increases the overall s e c w therefore there exists a critical i c at which s e c w reaches minimum the value of the critical i c depends on n and the minimum s e c w vanishes or moves to a point out of the investigated range of i c as n becomes sufficiently high fig 3c we note that charging and discharge current densities in this analysis have no impact on the kinetic efficiency of the mcdi plant which is quantified by productivity p this is quite counter intuitive as current density typically strongly correlates with desalination rate zhao et al 2013a 2013b kim and yoon 2015 however in the current analysis with χ being a design constraint p is simply a function of n and χ according to eqn 2 in other words each curve on fig 3c has the same p for all the points on a curve it also suggests that when p is high i e n is low there exists a set of optimal operating conditions as specified by the critical i c and the corresponding i dc q c m and q dc m however when p is low i e n is high operating with lower i c is always preferred although the results on fig 3c are simulated with one single w r of 50 simulations with other w r suggest that the shapes of the s e c w vs i c curves have almost no dependence on w r fig 3d which is rather surprising but can nonetheless be explained according to eqn 2 t dc is determined for a given p once we know how charging is performed which determines i c and thus q c m and for how long it is performed i e t c different w r can be achieved with the same t dc by simply adjusting q dc m while the change of q dc m has strong influence on the average brine salinity c b it barely changes i dc this is because i c t c is very close to i dc t dc not exactly equal because the charge efficiencies of charging and discharge steps are slightly different according to the dss condition and t dc has already been determined once p t c and i c are given regardless of w r therefore i dc is independent of w r for given p t c and i c consequently w r has almost no impact on the overall performance of the system in terms of s e c w and p in light of the fact that higher w r leads to lower specific energy consumption for pretreatment and pumping as discussed in section 2 3 it appears that operating at high w r is preferred due to lack of disadvantage but the presence of advantages 3 1 2 tradeoff curves and optimal tradeoff curve we simulate the tradeoff curves that capture the intrinsic tradeoff between energy efficiency and desalination rate using this framework as depicted by fig 2 and table 1 specifically s e c w 1 is plotted against p to construct the tradeoff curve based on performance metrics that are normalized by the volume of product water such a s e c w 1 vs p tradeoff curve which is more meaningful for practical design can be converted from the more fundamental tradeoff between ion normalized energy consumption and desalination rate hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018a provided certain design constraints e g c 0 and c d and operating parameters e g q c m and q dc m are given four s e c w 1 vs p tradeoff curves obtained with different i c are shown in fig 4 a all points on the same tradeoff curve correspond to the same separation i e the same c 0 c d and wr and charging current density different points on the same tradeoff curve were obtained using different numbers of installed mcdi modules n because p is inversely proportional to n for a given χ according to eqn 2 both p and n are used as x axis top axis for n and bottom axis for p in general s e c w 1 always monotonically decreases with increasing p meaning that higher energy efficiency i e higher s e c w 1 can be achieved with a slower desalination rate i e lower p or a larger system i e larger n and a in theory an mcdi operation that is in the upper right position of the s e c w 1 vs p diagram is more efficient than an mcdi operation in the lower left position because the former is both faster and consumes less energy hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018a b this relative position rule is important for comparing the general performance i e considering both the kinetic and energetic aspects of different mcdi operations and will be used in finding the optimal conditions for designing and operating an mcdi plant when i c is high the dependence of s e c w 1 on p is weak fig 4a such dependence becomes stronger as i c progressively decreases the implication is that there is little compromise of energy efficiency for significantly enhancing p when i c is very high for example when i c is 7 4 a m 2 orange curve in fig 4a increasing p by three folds from 4 to 12 l h 1 m 2 only leads to a decrease of s e c w 1 by 18 and a corresponding increase of s e c w by 22 in contrast if i c is very low the energy consumption becomes very sensitive to desalination rate specifically when i c is 3 0 a m 2 blue curve in fig 4a the same three fold increase of p from 4 to 12 l h 1 m 2 reduces s e c w 1 by nearly 75 and increases s e c w by 400 due to the systematically varying sensitivity of s e c w 1 to the change of p at different i c the s e c w 1 vs p tradeoff curves for different i c intersect with each other there are six intersections for the four selected tradeoff curves presented in fig 4a and b out of which three are what we define as top intersections yellow circles in fig 4b the top intersections are intersections above which there exists no tradeoff curve generally if we assume that each tradeoff curve will intersect with all others there will be i 1 k 1 i intersections and k 1 top intersections for k intersecting tradeoff curves for the specific example in fig 4 the three top intersections divide the chosen range of p and thus n into four regimes i e p from 4 0 to 8 9 l h 1 m 2 8 9 10 4 l h 1 m 2 10 4 15 5 l h 1 m 2 and 15 5 22 0 l h 1 m 2 each regime has its own optimal i c out of the four i c chosen for simulation determined by applying the relative position rule to the four tradeoff curves within that regime the four segments connecting the three top intersections constitute a set of optimal conditions among all possible conditions used for simulating the four presented tradeoff curves fig 4b it means that within a certain range of desalination rate as quantified by p and thus n using the i c corresponding to the red curve in fig 4b always yields better performance than using the other three investigated i c the combination of these four regionally optimal segments leads to the quasi optimal tradeoff curve if we continue to increase the number of simulations to generate infinite number of tradeoff curves each corresponding to a different i c there will be infinite number of top intersections these top intersections will constitute a smooth tradeoff curve that is called the optimal tradeoff curve alternatively we can also scan a range of i c for each chosen p to identify the optimal i c that leads to the minimum s e c w fig 5 a for each p within the investigated range there exists an i c that leads to a minimum s e c w i e d s e c w d i c 0 this approach of the scanning i c for the minimum s e c w at a given p is numerically more efficient and perhaps also conceptually more straightforward than finding a large number of top intersections as illustrated in fig 4 with this approach we generate the optimal tradeoff curve and compare that to the quasi optimal tradeoff curve discussed in fig 4 the optimal tradeoff curve red in fig 5b is consistently above the quasi optimal tradeoff curve black in fig 5b which is expected according to how such an optimal tradeoff curve is defined and numerically established the optimal tradeoff curve comprises a set of optimal design and operating conditions that both comply with the design framework depicted in fig 2 and lead to the best overall performance in other words the optimal tradeoff curve also sets the performance limit for a given mcdi module and a given set of design constraints any mcdi design and operation can be denoted either on or below but not beyond the optimal tradeoff curve based on the relative position rule an mcdi plant should always be designed i e to specify n and operated i e to control i c according to optimal tradeoff curve regardless of the relative significance of capital and energy costs the ultimate optimization considering capital and energy costs is to identify the exact n and i c that leads to the lowest cost of water production the general strategy of using the optimal tradeoff curve with the knowledge of other cost parameters for economic optimization of an mcdi process will be briefly discussed at the end of the paper 3 2 system performance with reduced degrees of freedom the discussion in section 3 1 explains how we can reduce a myriad of variables to be considered in designing an mcdi plant to three important variables i e i c w r and p that we can independently control the presence of three independent variables suggests that the system has three degrees of freedom within the framework described in fig 2 we may swap an independent variable with a dependent variable while maintaining the same degrees of freedom we can also reduce the degrees of freedom by either 1 fixing the value of the independent variable s or 2 specifying additional constraint s or inter relationship s to the design and operation framework in this section we will discuss the impacts on design strategy when the degrees of freedom are reduced to two by adding a design constraint of equal charging and discharge flowrate in nearly all reported cdi studies the per module charging flowrate q c m was controlled to be identical to the per module discharge flowrate q dc m except in a very recent study in which the flowrate is intentionally varied to achieve a high recovery ramachandran et al 2019 while constant flowrate operation is most likely a choice of experimental convenience it may actually be more practical in real cdi operations considering that constant speed pumps are usually cheaper and more reliable than pumps designed to operate with frequent speed change whether that is true or not we want to show how this additional constraint affects the design framework and the overall system performance with an additional constraint that sets q c m to be equal to q dc m the degree of freedom is reduced from three to two if we assign i c and w r as the independent variables all other operating and design parameters can be determined based on the design framework illustrated in fig 6 and table 2 in this case we cannot freely choose the number of cdi modules installed because the productivity p is already determined once i c and w r are specified for a given plant capacity χ in this framework with two degrees of freedom there is only one s e c w 1 vs p tradeoff curve for each chosen w r each point on a tradeoff curve is obtained by specifying i c and determining other dependent parameters and the performance metrics following the scheme in fig 6 and table 2 we simulate the tradeoff curves for w r of 50 70 and 90 using i c from 3 0 to 10 5 a cm 2 fig 7 we note that only part of the curve for wr 90 is shown in the figure to make its productivity p comparable to the other two conditions comparing these three tradeoff curves we observe that when the lowest tested current density i c 3 0 a cm 2 is used an mcdi process with a lower w r is more energy efficient i e has a higher s e c w 1 on the other hand s e c w is less dependent on p for an mcdi process with a higher w r interestingly even with the arbitrary condition of equal charging and discharge flowrate the tradeoff curves for w r of 50 and 70 very closely approach and even visually overlap with the optimal tradeoff curve obtained using three degrees of freedom at least over a reasonable range of p specifically the tradeoff curves for w r 50 and w r 70 closely approach the optimal tradeoff curve when p is relatively low and high respectively fig 7 even when they deviate from the optimal tradeoff curve the deviation is relatively insignificant less than 9 difference in the worst case however when w r increases to 90 the tradeoff curve is significantly below the optimal tradeoff curve which implies that it is difficult to achieve optimal performance with equal charging and discharge flowrate at such a high w r the above analysis suggests that as long as w r is not too high we can simply adopt the typical practice of fixing the flowrate for charging and discharge to obtain tradeoff curves that are very close to the optimal tradeoff curve finally we note that most cdi and mcdi experiments reported in literature were performed not only with the condition of the equal flowrate but also with the condition of equal duration for the charging and discharge steps the degree of freedom is reduced to only one in all those experiments with such a stipulation the tradeoff curve in such a case is simply the tradeoff curve on fig 7 with a wr of 50 4 conclusions and implications the design framework presented in fig 2 and table 1 helps us simplify the system design by reducing an unwieldy set of many seemingly independent variables to three i c n and w r now the presence of the optimal tradeoff curve fig 4b and the very weak dependence of system performance on wr fig 3d help us further simplify the optimization of an mcdi plant design and operation first the relative independence of system performance on w r in a framework with three degrees of freedom and the fact that specific cost for pretreatment and pumping negatively correlates with w r clearly suggest that we should adopt a w r as high as practically feasible second the presence of the optimal tradeoff curve suggests that the two independent variables i c and n can be reduced to one if the process is to be optimized we can either choose i c or n as the independent design variable and the other can be determined based on the optimal tradeoff curve with all the design constraints inter relationships between different variables and a set of rules regarding the optimal tradeoff curve that emerge in the above discussion the optimal design of an mcdi plant which used to involve a series of arbitrations is now reduced to only one degree of freedom either i c or n it comes down to selecting the right i c or n that leads to the lowest levelized cost of water lcow in other words we simply need to move along the optimal tradeoff curve to identify the point corresponding to a set of performance metrics s e c w and p that yields the lowest lcow for a given set of cost parameters these cost parameters affect the capital costs e g unit cost of each mcdi module and the operating costs e g unit energy cost because desalination rate directly determines n i e the size of the plant for a given plant capacity it has a major influence on the total capital cost even though the total capital cost is likely non linear to n likewise energy cost has a strong impact on the operating cost per volume of product water although there are other components of the operating and management cost e g labor cost that does not depend on energy consumption in general if the unit price of an mcdi module is very high it is desirable to design and operate the mcdi plant with a higher p even at the cost of more energy consumption if however the energy cost is very high then we should move up along the optimal tradeoff curve to reduce s e c w even that entails more modules but in any case it is certain that the most cost effective design and operation must follow the optimal tradeoff curve from this perspective the optimal tradeoff curve presented in this study provides the technical basis for cost optimization in addition to this technical component performing cost optimization for an mcdi plant requires a specific cost model and detailed cost parameters and is beyond the scope of the current study acknowledgement s lin acknowledges the support

18829,recently the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args via plasmid mediated conjugation has been reported to be facilitated by a series of contaminants this has highlighted potential challenges to the effective control of this principal mode of horizontal transfer in the present study we found that low levels 0 02 mgn l of free nitrous acid fna remarkably inhibited over 90 the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 a model broad host range plasmid between escherichia coli the antimicrobial role of fna at the applied dosages was firstly ruled out since no dramatic reductions in viabilities of donor or recipient were observed instead fna appeared to reduce the available intracellular free mg2 which was confirmed to be triggered by the liberation of intracellular fe2 these alterations in intracellular mg2 and fe2 concentrations were found to significantly limit the available energy for conjugative transfer through suppression of glycolysis by decreasing the activities of glycogen phosphorylase and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and also by diverting the glycolytic flux into the pentose phosphate pathway via activation of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase towards the generation of nadph rather than atp moreover rp4 encoding genes responsible for dna transfer and replication trai traj and trfap coupling trag and mating pair formation traf and trbbp were all significantly down regulated after fna treatment indicating that the transfer apparatus required for plasmid processing and delivery was deactivated by validating the inhibitory effects of fna on conjugation in real wastewater this study highlights a promising method for controlling the dissemination of args in systems such as wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords free nitrous acid conjugative transfer intracellular ions energy driving force transfer apparatus dissemination control 1 introduction the emergence of antibiotic resistance is a pervasive global threat to modern health care vikesland et al 2017 this issue is getting worse due to the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer hgt among diverse microorganisms normally hgt occurs through three genetic mechanisms conjugation via cell to cell contact transformation from the uptake of extracellular dna and transduction via the infection of phages andersson and hughes 2010 among them plasmid mediated conjugation especially that involving the broad host range plasmid is the dominant routine this process has attracted significant attentions as it enables the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes args across bacterial species and even between bacteria and larger organisms klumper et al 2015 sorensen et al 2005 as one of the most well studied broad host range plasmids encoding multi antibiotic resistance plasmid rp4 has been reported to be transferable from donor strains to indigenous bacteria in situ in wastewater treatment plants wwtps guo et al 2015 soda et al 2008 moreover the host ranges of extraneous plasmids within the microbial community of wwtps have been reported to cover up to 13 phyla indicating that wwtps are hotspots for the plasmid mediated args exchange huang et al 2019 li et al 2018b munck et al 2015 in addition engineered nanoparticles qiu et al 2012 ionic liquid wang et al 2015 disinfectants guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 non antibiotic pharmaceuticals wang et al 2018a and petroleum exhaust particles zhang et al 2018 which are readily released into wwtps have all been proven to facilitate conjugative transfer of plasmids as a consequence the risks of args dissemination and propagation via plasmids in wwtps or the downstream environment that are receiving the effluent are high since wwtps are now regarded as the hotspots of mobile genetic elements including plasmids guo et al 2017 on the other hand successful transport of plasmids compromises the efficiency of removal conventional wastewater contaminants for instance zou et al 2016 observed that propagation of plasmid rp4 inhibited the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria in a lab scale granular sequencing batch reactor and diminished nh4 n removal efficiency temporarily therefore the development of an efficient strategy to reduce conjugative transfer is crucial it is widely reported that conjugation involves the transmembrane transport of genetic dna from donor to recipient cells chen et al 2005 the successful transfer of plasmid rp4 for example depends on the proper functioning of rp4 encoded transfer apparatus which consists of three major components the dna transfer and replication dtr system the mating pair formation mpf system and a coupler connecting the two systems grahn et al 2000 wang et al 2015 2018a as a result previous studies has focused mainly on cell membrane permeability pilus generation and transcriptional expression of the transfer apparatus and have elucidated the underlying mechanisms of promoted conjugation induced by environmental stimuli qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 2018a zhang et al 2017 there is increasing evidence that atp is needed to energize the transfer of substrate dna and induce the structural transition of the conjugative system however no studies have investigated the energy supply for conjugation it is well known that cellular energy metabolism is reliant on particular intracellular ions for instance intracellular mg2 has been reported to be the cofactor for over 600 enzymes including those involved in atp generation feeney et al 2016 the level of intracellular fe2 is the key trigger of oxidative stress dixon and stockwell 2014 wang et al 2017 which tends to result in the depletion of atp brookes et al 2004 moreover the efficiency of the function of transfer apparatus can be affected by concentrations of intracellular ions for example the in vitro function of relaxosomes which play a key role in the dtr system by initiating the first step of rp4 transfer relies on mg2 lujan et al 2007 pansegrau et al 1990 it has been suggested that inhibition of conjugative dna relaxosomes could disrupt the propagation of args via conjugation lujan et al 2007 therefore any factors which cause changes in the concentrations of these intracellular ions can influence the function of the transfer systems and potentially the conjugative transfer however related studies have never been reported to date in this study a new method for effective inhibition of the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 by using free nitrous acid fna to alter intracellular ions and disable transfer apparatus was reported as fna had been applied as an antimicrobial agent gao et al 2016 the possibility of fna to kill donor recipient at applied dosages was firstly ruled out then the effects of fna on the levels of intracellular mg2 and fe2 as well as their connections were explored via fluorescence indicators also the possible mechanisms for fna inhibiting conjugation were identified by evaluating the activity of metabolic enzymes and the transcriptional expressions of transfer apparatus encoded by plasmid rp4 finally the inhibitory effects of fna on conjugation was validate in real wastewater to our knowledge this is the first study reporting the inhibitory efficiency of fna on the dissemination of args mediated by conjugative plasmid 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains to carry out conjugation experiments strains with different resistant types were purchased from biovector science lab inc beijing china escherichia coli e coli k12 which harbors the self transferable plasmid rp4 encoding resistance to ampicillin amp kanamycin km and tetracycline tc was applied as the donor it should be noted that this strain has already been observed in the influent of wwtps in shanghai guo et al 2015 e coli hb101 which exhibits resistance to streptomycin str was chosen as the recipient both strains were preserved in the glycerin tubes and stored at 20 c for subsequent researches 2 2 effects of fna on the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 between e coli or from e coli to wastewater microorganisms the procedures of conjugation experiments were according the previous studies guo et al 2015 wang et al 2015 briefly all strains were firstly cultured to middle exponential phase at 37 c in lb medium with the appropriate antibiotics amp 100 mg l km 50 mg l tc 10 mg l for the donor and str 30 mg l for the recipient second the cultures were washed three times with sterile phosphate buffered saline pbs 137 mm nacl 2 7 mm kcl 10 mm na2hpo4 and 2 mm kh2po4 before being diluted to specific concentration od600 0 5 subsequently 4 75 ml of donor and recipient strains were mixed then to obtain fna with different concentrations 0 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 0 5 ml of sterile nitrite whose concentration was calculated according to equation 1 was added to the mixture finally the mixture was placed in a climate cabinet at 30 c after gentle vortex 1 f n a a s h n o 2 n n o 2 n k a 10 p h k a e 2300 270 t c after a 24 h mating period the cultures were vigorously mixed and appropriately diluted the numbers cfu ml of transconjugants donors and recipients were obtained by plating on solid lb medium containing appropriate antibiotics in detail the lb selective plates for transconjugants contained 100 mg l of amp 50 mg l of km 10 mg l of tc and 30 mg l of str those for donors or recipients were supplemented with amp km tc or str respectively in addition both donor and recipients were separately plated on the selective medium for transconjugants to rule out the possibility of spontaneous mutations the transfer frequency f was calculated using the formula f number of transconjugants number of recipients the presence of plasmid rp4 in transconjugants was confirmed via horizontal gel electrophoresis to examine the size as well as pcr to examine the appearance of rp4 specific trag like gene guo et al 2015 to validate the effects of fna on conjugation wastewater was collected from the influent of a municipal wwtp in shanghai the obtained influent was firstly settled at room temperature for 12 h then the supernatant was applied as the reaction mixture and the contained microorganisms were the potential recipients the main characteristics of the supernatant are as followings ph 7 2 0 1 total viable bacteria number 2 55 0 3 108 cfu ml to carry out the conjugation experiment the supernatant was mixed with e coli k12 od600 0 5 followed by the addition of different dosages of fna 0 0 02 mgn l reactors with only e coli k12 or supernatant were used as the negative control other details about the conjugation process were the same as that presented above 2 3 flow cytometry assays in the current study flow cytometry was applied to provide the insights of intracellular states of e coli k12 and hb101 in responses to fna treatments fluorescent reagents such as propidium iodide pi h2dcf da calcein am fluo 3 am and mag fluo 4 am were used as the indicators of cell membrane permeability and intracellular levels of reactive oxide species ros iron calcium and magnesium respectively hong et al 2017 li et al 2017 wan et al 2016 wang et al 2015 details about flow cytometry assays were presented in the supporting information text 1 2 4 in vitro enzyme assays in this study the activities of 12 key enzymes responsible for the energy metabolic from glycogen were assessed in vitro these enzymes included glycogen phosphorylase glgp phosphohexose isomerase gpi phosphofructokinase pfk aldolase ald triosephosphate isomerase tpi glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh phosphoglycerate kinase pgk phosphoglyceromutase pgm enolase enl and pyruvate kinase pk which are involved in the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway as well as glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pdh and 6 phosphogluconic dehydrogenase 6pgdh which participate in the pentose phosphate ppp pathway table s1 supporting information briefly fna treated 0 01 mgn l as well as fna untreated strains were firstly washed three times with pbs and sonicated 20 khz in ice bath for 5 min to extract crude enzymes then cell lysates of each sample were added to the corresponding reaction mixtures detailed in table s1 supporting information the spectrophotometrical changes at 340 nm were measured immediately the enzyme activities were normalized on the basis of protein concentration and presented as u mg protein 2 5 the mrna expression analysis rna was isolated from mating mixtures using the takara minibest universal rna extraction kit then a two step real time rt pcr was carried out that is rna was firstly transcribed to cdna using the primescript rt master mix kit takara subsequently qualitative pcr qpcr assays were performed using sybr green enzymes sybr premix ex taq ii takara to quantify target genes given that the rp4 conjugative transfer apparatus usually contains three major components grahn et al 2000 genes such as trfap traj trai dtr trbbp and traf mpf as well as trag coupling were chose as the representative genes in addition porin genes including ompa and ompc were also assessed the protocols and reaction mixtures were according to our previous study huang et al 2016 the primers for each target gene were detailed in table s2 supporting information 2 6 other analytical methods and statistical analysis cellular atp and glycogen levels were measured using the promega bactiter glo kit promega and enzychrom glycogen assay kit bioassay systems respectively according to the manufacturer s instructions the measurements of protein content cell viability lactate dehydrogenase ldh extracellular levels of mg2 as well as fe2 and reactive nitrogen species rns were according to our previous studies huang et al 2017 su et al 2016 zheng et al 2013 2018 pretreating strains with arsenate 1 mm for 30 min or 2 2 bipyridyl bip 0 05 mm for 10 min was applied to decrease initial atp level or restrict intracellular free fe2 accordingly conlon et al 2016 hong et al 2017 shatalin et al 2011 all tests in this study were performed in triplicate student t tests have been applied to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant marked with between different samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 fna inhibits the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 the occurrence of transconjugants is considered to be an indicator of successful conjugative transfer of plasmids from donor to recipient in this study a total of 4800 cfu ml transconjugants were detected after the conjugation process in the absence of fna accordingly the transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 from e coli k12 to hb101 was found to be 2 12 10 4 this rate is slightly higher than that reported in a previous study in which natural conjugation between e coli was applied as the transfer model wang et al 2018a the discrepancy might be attributable to the physiological differences the strains used in each study lopatkin et al 2016 however fna treatments caused the corresponding transconjugant numbers and transfer frequencies to decrease in a dose dependent manner for example the numbers of transconjugants were significantly declined to 1520 470 and 350 cfu ml p 0 01 in response to fna dosages of 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 mgn l respectively fig 1 a and the transfer frequencies were decreased to 6 6 10 5 2 1 10 5 and 1 8 10 5 accordingly fig 1b it is clear that he conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 is effectively inhibited by fna it has been reported that conjugative frequencies are influenced by the initial cell densities of the donor and recipient guo et al 2015 lin et al 2016 given that fna can be applied as an antimicrobial agent to wash out unwanted microbes gao et al 2016 it seems plausible that inhibited plasmid transfer might be attributed to the fna induced decrease in donor or recipient numbers to evaluate this possibility we assessed the viabilities of the strains used in this study after fna treatments fig 1c illustrates fna dosages of 0 0 01 mgn l caused only a slight decrease in donor and recipient viabilities p 0 05 at 0 02 mgn l fna caused the viabilities of both donor and recipient to decrease to 85 of the control no fna treatment similar observations were recorded with regards to donor and recipient numbers in the conjugation mixture after 24 h of mating fig 1d the inhibitory effects of fna on viability of cells are usually only observed at high dosages for example the threshold of fna to repress nitrite oxidizing bacteria is approximately 0 02 mgn l zhou et al 2011 while that for ammonia oxidizing bacteria is nearly 0 1 mgn l gao et al 2016 according to our data the inhibitory effect of fna towards conjugation is not related to the antimicrobial role of fna at lower dosages 3 2 fna induces shifts in intracellular levels of free mg2 and fe2 to explore the underlying mechanisms of fna induced inhibition of conjugation we assessed the level of intracellular mg2 using the fluorescent indicator mag fluo 4 am li et al 2017 since mg2 has been reported to be crucial to the initiation of conjugation through its role in the specific relaxation of supercoiled plasmid dna pansegrau et al 1990 as is shown in fig 2 a the fluorescence intensity in e coli k12 donor decreased once fna was added for example the average fluorescence intensity declined from 946 control to 335 after treatment with 0 01 mgn l fna indicating that fna reduced the availability of intracellular mg2 a similar trend was observed in the recipient figure s1a supporting information in the literature the bio effects of fna on cells have been mainly attributed to its uncoupler activities or to the reaction of fna with specific groups within key enzymes gao et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 although mg2 is one of the most abundant ions in cells and is the cofactor for more than 600 enzymatic reactions feeney et al 2016 few studies have focused on the responses of intracellular mg2 to fna to our knowledge this is the first study to report the regulatory effects of fna on intracellular mg2 levels the intracellular content of calcein chelatable iron fe2 was also affected by fna fig 2b and s1b the average fluorescence levels within the donor strain increased to 118 154 and 170 of the control level in response to 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 mgn l of fna respectively suggesting that the concentration of the cellular labile iron pool lip increases following fna exposure these effects might be attributable to the fact that fna and its derivatives can directly damage intracellular iron stores such as fe s clusters and bacterioferritin gao et al 2016 laloo et al 2018 facilitating the liberation of labile fe2 the liberated iron would in turn catalyze the generation of radicals via fenton chemistry dixon and stockwell 2014 shatalin et al 2011 wang et al 2017 which may explain the increased levels of ros and rns figure s2 supporting information caused by fna based on the above results it is clear that the intracellular mg2 and fe2 show opposing responses to fna treatments however in terms of extracellular levels similar trends were observed for both ions as figure s3 shows supporting information the concentration of extracellular mg2 increased significantly when either donor or recipient were treated with 0 01 mg l of fna with respect to extracellular fe2 a slight increase in concentration was observed to rule out the possibility that the increased extracellular levels were due to fna induced cell membrane damage both ldh release and pi fluorescence intensity in response to fna were evaluated it was observed that 0 01 mg l fna resulted in no significant differences in the values of ldh release and pi intensity p 0 05 figure s4 supporting information collectively these results indicate that the transport of mg2 is activated by fna recently laloo et al 2018 found that nitrosomonas sp showed resistance to fna induced oxidative stress via up regulation of enzymes involved in iron transport savigni and morgan 2003 reported that intracellular mg2 could compete for the low affinity iron transport system for transfer outside the cell therefore we proposed that the fna induced increase in lip might trigger the reduction in intracellular mg2 levels to confirm this speculation strains were pretreated with bip a widely applied chelator for intracellular free fe2 before exposure to fna shatalin et al 2011 it is interesting to note that the contribution of fna to decreased intracellular mg2 levels was limited when labile fe2 was chelated indicating that labile fe2 might be the regulator of intracellular mg2 fig 3 a moreover it should be noted that bip pretreatment reduced the levels of ros rns that were induced by fna fig 3b and c a finding that is consistent with the reported roles of intracellular mg2 and fe2 in maintaining and mediating the oxidative status dixon and stockwell 2014 hartwig 2001 more importantly the corresponding conjugation frequency recovered to 1 03 10 4 with bip pretreatment of both donor and recipient which was close to that of the control fig 1b taken together our data suggest that the changes in intracellular mg2 and fe2 levels are keys in the inhibition of conjugation by fna 3 3 fna limits the energy driving force for conjugative transfer conjugation is an atp consuming process as energy is required for the transfer of dna and for the induction of morphogenesis of the conjugation machines chen et al 2005 lu et al 2018 macdonald et al 1992 in order to examine the relationship between intracellular ions and inhibited conjugation more deeply atp levels in response to fna were monitored as fig 4 a illustrates fna caused a sharp dose dependent decline in atp within both strains for example 0 01 mgn l fna resulted in significantly decreased p 0 05 atp contents of donor and recipient at 37 8 and 41 2 of the control respectively more severe atp depletion 20 1 and 23 7 of the control in donor and recipient respectively was observed when the fna dosage was increased to 0 02 mgn l it has been reported that a particular level of intracellular atp represents the switch between cell necrosis and apoptosis under oxidant stress lelli et al 1998 it is therefore possible that the reduced atp following treatment with 0 01 mgn l fna was below the threshold for apoptosis thus no significant reduction in cell viabilities or numbers were observed fig 1c and d as revealed in figure s5 supporting information when intracellular atp was depleted by arsenate pretreatment via the formation of a hydrolysable adenosine diphosphate as conlon et al 2016 a similar inhibitory effect on the conjugative frequency was observed hence the decline in transfer frequencies that we recorded is likely due to the depletion of atp by fna as the mating experiments were carried out in pbs the energy atp required for cell maintenance and conjugation was mainly produced from internal energy stores such as intracellular glycogen macdonald et al 1992 an fna dosage of 0 01 mgn l caused the increased accumulation of glycogen by 32 5 and 28 7 compared with the control in donor and recipient respectively fig 4b reduced glycogen degradation may therefore represent a vital mechanism for the reduction in atp the influence of fna on cellular atp had been studied and fna has been reported to mainly serve as the uncoupler inhibiting atp synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation gao et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 however uncouplers such as carbonyl cyanide 3 chlorophenylhydrazone cccp have been proven to exert no inhibitory effects on glycogen degradation gomezfoix et al 1992 therefore fna might play additional roles to the protonophore in inhibiting the energy supply for conjugation the catabolism of glycogen in e coli proceeds via two main glycolytic routes the emp pathway and the ppp fig 4c perrenoud and sauer 2005 the emp pathway which is generally superior and consumes around 80 of glycolytic fluxes perrenoud and sauer 2005 yields two molecules of atp per molecules of glucose which are subsequently coupled to phosphorylation of adp flamholz et al 2013 the ppp however consumes available glucose to generate nadph without any atp generation jiang et al 2011 a number of key enzymes are involved in both pathways fig 4c in the present study it was found that only two of twelve target enzymes were significantly affected by exposure to fna fig 4d glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh which catalyzes the generation of atp as well as providing reducing power in the form of nadh in the emp pathway was inhibited by 48 1 and 30 8 in the donor and recipient respectively on the other hand the activity of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pdh the first and rate limiting enzyme of the ppp jiang et al 2011 was dramatically increased to 5 fold and 2 89 fold in donor and recipient accordingly it can be concluded that the presence of fna contributes to the inhibition of glycolysis and facilitates of pentose shunt which together result in a decrease in cellular atp interestingly the decreased activities of gapdh and g6pdh following fna exposure were partly relieved when bip pretreatment was applied figure s6 supporting information this suggests that intracellular mg2 and fe2 play important roles in regulating the activities of these enzymes this might be explained by corresponding levels of ros rns figures s3 and 3 as both gapdh and g6pdh have been reported to be sensitive to oxidative stress for instance yun et al 2015 suggested that the suppression of gapdh by vitamin c in cancer cells can be attributed to the ros that form which modifies the active site cysteine cys152 of gapdh via s glutathionylation or sulfonylation chen et al 2007 found that the ppp was activated during oxidative stress since indicated by the observation that regeneration of the redox couple i e gsh gssg relies on the supply of nadph in the current study we observed that fna induced oxidative stress contributed to the inhibition of conjugation however recent studies have suggested that the generated ros facilitate the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 by damaging cell membranes and triggering sos responses wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2017 2018 these discrepancies could be explained as follows fna may not necessary cause oxidative damage to cell gao et al 2016 a suggestion that is confirmed by our results in fig 1c and d rather the significant decline in atp that is caused by fna fig 4a may limit the available energy for the transcriptional expression of genes involved in the sos response with respect to other enzymes that were tested in this study pfk pgk and pk are well known glycolytic kinases which rely on the activation of intracellular mg2 heaton 1990 in addition enzymes such as glgp and enl which catalyze the rate limiting step of glycogen degradation and formation of phosphoenolpyruvate containing the high energy phosphate bond respectively are both suggested to be positively regulated by intracellular free mg2 gaussin et al 1997 heaton 1990 mathieu et al 2016 hence the accumulated glycogen that can be seen in fig 4b can be concluded to be a result of glgp inhibition due to the fna induced reduction in intracellular mg2 with the presence of fna fig 2a as is shown in fig 4d the in vitro activities of glgp and other mg2 related enzymes were not significantly affected by 0 01 mgn l of fna p 0 05 this could be explained by the fact that sufficient mg2 applied in in vitro tests table s2 masked the inhibitory effects of decreased intracellular mg2 on these enzymes in vivo study of pseudomonas aeruginosa treated with fna has revealed that the transcriptional levels of genes pgk enl and pk in the emp pathway are down regulated gao et al 2016 our finding concerning the reduction of intracellular mg2 therefore offers a possible explanation in summary fna exposure blocks the emp pathway but facilitates the ppp and significantly limits the available energy for conjugative transfer 3 4 fna suppresses transcriptional expression of conjugative transfer genes as a well known self transmissible plasmid plasmid rp4 encodes a membrane spanning transfer apparatus to regulate the conjugative transfer the precise apparatus bridges the inner and outer membranes of the donor cell and in order to transports processed dna to potential recipients chen et al 2005 frost and koraimann 2010 grahn et al 2000 the dtr and mpf systems of the transfer apparatus are controlled by a series of regulatory genes alteration of expression of these genes therefore affects the transfer frequency lin et al 2016 qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 2018 in the current study a number of representative genes for dtr mpf and coupler cp systems were assessed it was found that the mrna expression levels of dtr genes i e trai traj and trfap were all significantly suppressed by fna fig 5 it has been reported that trai is the dna relaxase that initiates conjugative transfer by introducing site and strand specific nick at the transfer origin orit lujan et al 2007 pansegrau et al 1990 on the other hand traj acts as an assistant to trai facilitating the recognition of orit and the formation of relaxosomes pansegrau et al 1990 in addition the function of relaxosomes depends on the level of intracellular mg2 pansegrau et al 1990 therefore our findings that trai and traj were down regulated and intracellular mg2 levels were decreased indicate that the first and key step of plasmid rp4 cleavage into a transferable strand was inhibited in the present study similar trends were also observed for the cp and mpf systems the product of trag trag has been proposed to be a membrane anchored oligomer that binds relaxosomes and delivers processed dna to the mating bridge lin et al 2016 schroder and lanka 2003 moreover trag is a putative transmembrane atpase which binds atp and serves as an active motor for secretion schroder and lanka 2003 the significant suppression of trag expression that was observed in this study 12 6 of the control is therefore indicative of the inactivation of the cp system on the other hand traf is responsible for the processing of pilus assembly which is essential in the formation of a mating pair grahn et al 2000 zhang et al 2018 the repression of traf together with the inhibition of trbbp transcription both suggest the dysfunction of the mpf system this was further evidenced by the down regulation of ompa and ompc expression which play a considerable role in stabilization of the mating pair dreiseikelmann 1994 taken together fna causes failure of the rp4 encoded transfer apparatus which may explain the observed inhibition of conjugation 3 5 application validation and environmental implications to validate the inhibitory effects of fna on conjugation in aquatic environments we investigated microorganisms in the influent of a wwtp as potential plasmid recipients as figure s7 supporting information shows the number of transconjugants decreased following exposure to 0 02 mgn l fna to only 9 6 of the control this confirms the capability of fna to restrict the transfer of plasmid rp4 to indigenous bacteria in wwtps as an example of one of many self transmissible plasmids that have been isolated from wwtp bacteria guo et al 2015 schluter et al 2007 plasmid rp4 has been reported to be permissible to more than 46 of the genera in activated sludge li et al 2018a the transfer of plasmid rp4 among bacteria could be facilitated by particular contaminants which tend to accumulate in wwtps qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 even worse the resilient communities within wwtps may rely on hgt especially conjugation to survive and adapt to anthropogenic stresses such as heavy metal antibiotics and engineered nanoparticles berendonk et al 2015 eckert et al 2019 huang et al 2019 our results concerning the inhibitory efficiency of fna fig 1 and s7 therefore suggest a promising strategy toward the control of conjugation in wwtps the application of fna to treat wastewater and sludge within wwtps is widely accepted for example wang et al 2014 proposed that fna can be used to selectively eliminate nitrite oxidizing bacteria without affecting ammonium oxidizing bacteria to achieve the nitrite pathway additionally fna can be applied as a pretreatment for waste sludge to enhance the yields of valuable products such as short chain fatty acid methane and hydrogen wang et al 2013 2018b zhao et al 2015 more importantly it has been suggested that fna can be produced within wwtps using anaerobic digestion liquor wang et al 2013 hence application of fna seems a practicable and sustainable method to control plasmid mediated args dissemination in wwtps more studies including field trials are needed in the future 4 conclusion this study demonstrates the inhibitory effects of fna on the plasmid mediated dissemination of args we elucidated the underlying mechanisms for this restricted process through the use of fluorescence indicators and ion chelator fig 6 and suggest the following fna treatments leads to the liberation of intracellular fe2 which triggers a reduction in intracellular mg2 levels these shifts in ion concentrations affect the enzymatic metabolism limiting the energy that is available for conjugation together with the down regulation of transfer apparatus the transfer of plasmids between bacteria is therefore inhibited by validating the utility of fna treatment in wastewater microorganisms fna could offer an approach with which control the spread of args among sludge bacteria in wwtps acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the

18829,recently the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args via plasmid mediated conjugation has been reported to be facilitated by a series of contaminants this has highlighted potential challenges to the effective control of this principal mode of horizontal transfer in the present study we found that low levels 0 02 mgn l of free nitrous acid fna remarkably inhibited over 90 the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 a model broad host range plasmid between escherichia coli the antimicrobial role of fna at the applied dosages was firstly ruled out since no dramatic reductions in viabilities of donor or recipient were observed instead fna appeared to reduce the available intracellular free mg2 which was confirmed to be triggered by the liberation of intracellular fe2 these alterations in intracellular mg2 and fe2 concentrations were found to significantly limit the available energy for conjugative transfer through suppression of glycolysis by decreasing the activities of glycogen phosphorylase and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and also by diverting the glycolytic flux into the pentose phosphate pathway via activation of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase towards the generation of nadph rather than atp moreover rp4 encoding genes responsible for dna transfer and replication trai traj and trfap coupling trag and mating pair formation traf and trbbp were all significantly down regulated after fna treatment indicating that the transfer apparatus required for plasmid processing and delivery was deactivated by validating the inhibitory effects of fna on conjugation in real wastewater this study highlights a promising method for controlling the dissemination of args in systems such as wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords free nitrous acid conjugative transfer intracellular ions energy driving force transfer apparatus dissemination control 1 introduction the emergence of antibiotic resistance is a pervasive global threat to modern health care vikesland et al 2017 this issue is getting worse due to the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer hgt among diverse microorganisms normally hgt occurs through three genetic mechanisms conjugation via cell to cell contact transformation from the uptake of extracellular dna and transduction via the infection of phages andersson and hughes 2010 among them plasmid mediated conjugation especially that involving the broad host range plasmid is the dominant routine this process has attracted significant attentions as it enables the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes args across bacterial species and even between bacteria and larger organisms klumper et al 2015 sorensen et al 2005 as one of the most well studied broad host range plasmids encoding multi antibiotic resistance plasmid rp4 has been reported to be transferable from donor strains to indigenous bacteria in situ in wastewater treatment plants wwtps guo et al 2015 soda et al 2008 moreover the host ranges of extraneous plasmids within the microbial community of wwtps have been reported to cover up to 13 phyla indicating that wwtps are hotspots for the plasmid mediated args exchange huang et al 2019 li et al 2018b munck et al 2015 in addition engineered nanoparticles qiu et al 2012 ionic liquid wang et al 2015 disinfectants guo et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 non antibiotic pharmaceuticals wang et al 2018a and petroleum exhaust particles zhang et al 2018 which are readily released into wwtps have all been proven to facilitate conjugative transfer of plasmids as a consequence the risks of args dissemination and propagation via plasmids in wwtps or the downstream environment that are receiving the effluent are high since wwtps are now regarded as the hotspots of mobile genetic elements including plasmids guo et al 2017 on the other hand successful transport of plasmids compromises the efficiency of removal conventional wastewater contaminants for instance zou et al 2016 observed that propagation of plasmid rp4 inhibited the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria in a lab scale granular sequencing batch reactor and diminished nh4 n removal efficiency temporarily therefore the development of an efficient strategy to reduce conjugative transfer is crucial it is widely reported that conjugation involves the transmembrane transport of genetic dna from donor to recipient cells chen et al 2005 the successful transfer of plasmid rp4 for example depends on the proper functioning of rp4 encoded transfer apparatus which consists of three major components the dna transfer and replication dtr system the mating pair formation mpf system and a coupler connecting the two systems grahn et al 2000 wang et al 2015 2018a as a result previous studies has focused mainly on cell membrane permeability pilus generation and transcriptional expression of the transfer apparatus and have elucidated the underlying mechanisms of promoted conjugation induced by environmental stimuli qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 2018a zhang et al 2017 there is increasing evidence that atp is needed to energize the transfer of substrate dna and induce the structural transition of the conjugative system however no studies have investigated the energy supply for conjugation it is well known that cellular energy metabolism is reliant on particular intracellular ions for instance intracellular mg2 has been reported to be the cofactor for over 600 enzymes including those involved in atp generation feeney et al 2016 the level of intracellular fe2 is the key trigger of oxidative stress dixon and stockwell 2014 wang et al 2017 which tends to result in the depletion of atp brookes et al 2004 moreover the efficiency of the function of transfer apparatus can be affected by concentrations of intracellular ions for example the in vitro function of relaxosomes which play a key role in the dtr system by initiating the first step of rp4 transfer relies on mg2 lujan et al 2007 pansegrau et al 1990 it has been suggested that inhibition of conjugative dna relaxosomes could disrupt the propagation of args via conjugation lujan et al 2007 therefore any factors which cause changes in the concentrations of these intracellular ions can influence the function of the transfer systems and potentially the conjugative transfer however related studies have never been reported to date in this study a new method for effective inhibition of the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 by using free nitrous acid fna to alter intracellular ions and disable transfer apparatus was reported as fna had been applied as an antimicrobial agent gao et al 2016 the possibility of fna to kill donor recipient at applied dosages was firstly ruled out then the effects of fna on the levels of intracellular mg2 and fe2 as well as their connections were explored via fluorescence indicators also the possible mechanisms for fna inhibiting conjugation were identified by evaluating the activity of metabolic enzymes and the transcriptional expressions of transfer apparatus encoded by plasmid rp4 finally the inhibitory effects of fna on conjugation was validate in real wastewater to our knowledge this is the first study reporting the inhibitory efficiency of fna on the dissemination of args mediated by conjugative plasmid 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains to carry out conjugation experiments strains with different resistant types were purchased from biovector science lab inc beijing china escherichia coli e coli k12 which harbors the self transferable plasmid rp4 encoding resistance to ampicillin amp kanamycin km and tetracycline tc was applied as the donor it should be noted that this strain has already been observed in the influent of wwtps in shanghai guo et al 2015 e coli hb101 which exhibits resistance to streptomycin str was chosen as the recipient both strains were preserved in the glycerin tubes and stored at 20 c for subsequent researches 2 2 effects of fna on the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 between e coli or from e coli to wastewater microorganisms the procedures of conjugation experiments were according the previous studies guo et al 2015 wang et al 2015 briefly all strains were firstly cultured to middle exponential phase at 37 c in lb medium with the appropriate antibiotics amp 100 mg l km 50 mg l tc 10 mg l for the donor and str 30 mg l for the recipient second the cultures were washed three times with sterile phosphate buffered saline pbs 137 mm nacl 2 7 mm kcl 10 mm na2hpo4 and 2 mm kh2po4 before being diluted to specific concentration od600 0 5 subsequently 4 75 ml of donor and recipient strains were mixed then to obtain fna with different concentrations 0 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 0 5 ml of sterile nitrite whose concentration was calculated according to equation 1 was added to the mixture finally the mixture was placed in a climate cabinet at 30 c after gentle vortex 1 f n a a s h n o 2 n n o 2 n k a 10 p h k a e 2300 270 t c after a 24 h mating period the cultures were vigorously mixed and appropriately diluted the numbers cfu ml of transconjugants donors and recipients were obtained by plating on solid lb medium containing appropriate antibiotics in detail the lb selective plates for transconjugants contained 100 mg l of amp 50 mg l of km 10 mg l of tc and 30 mg l of str those for donors or recipients were supplemented with amp km tc or str respectively in addition both donor and recipients were separately plated on the selective medium for transconjugants to rule out the possibility of spontaneous mutations the transfer frequency f was calculated using the formula f number of transconjugants number of recipients the presence of plasmid rp4 in transconjugants was confirmed via horizontal gel electrophoresis to examine the size as well as pcr to examine the appearance of rp4 specific trag like gene guo et al 2015 to validate the effects of fna on conjugation wastewater was collected from the influent of a municipal wwtp in shanghai the obtained influent was firstly settled at room temperature for 12 h then the supernatant was applied as the reaction mixture and the contained microorganisms were the potential recipients the main characteristics of the supernatant are as followings ph 7 2 0 1 total viable bacteria number 2 55 0 3 108 cfu ml to carry out the conjugation experiment the supernatant was mixed with e coli k12 od600 0 5 followed by the addition of different dosages of fna 0 0 02 mgn l reactors with only e coli k12 or supernatant were used as the negative control other details about the conjugation process were the same as that presented above 2 3 flow cytometry assays in the current study flow cytometry was applied to provide the insights of intracellular states of e coli k12 and hb101 in responses to fna treatments fluorescent reagents such as propidium iodide pi h2dcf da calcein am fluo 3 am and mag fluo 4 am were used as the indicators of cell membrane permeability and intracellular levels of reactive oxide species ros iron calcium and magnesium respectively hong et al 2017 li et al 2017 wan et al 2016 wang et al 2015 details about flow cytometry assays were presented in the supporting information text 1 2 4 in vitro enzyme assays in this study the activities of 12 key enzymes responsible for the energy metabolic from glycogen were assessed in vitro these enzymes included glycogen phosphorylase glgp phosphohexose isomerase gpi phosphofructokinase pfk aldolase ald triosephosphate isomerase tpi glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh phosphoglycerate kinase pgk phosphoglyceromutase pgm enolase enl and pyruvate kinase pk which are involved in the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway as well as glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pdh and 6 phosphogluconic dehydrogenase 6pgdh which participate in the pentose phosphate ppp pathway table s1 supporting information briefly fna treated 0 01 mgn l as well as fna untreated strains were firstly washed three times with pbs and sonicated 20 khz in ice bath for 5 min to extract crude enzymes then cell lysates of each sample were added to the corresponding reaction mixtures detailed in table s1 supporting information the spectrophotometrical changes at 340 nm were measured immediately the enzyme activities were normalized on the basis of protein concentration and presented as u mg protein 2 5 the mrna expression analysis rna was isolated from mating mixtures using the takara minibest universal rna extraction kit then a two step real time rt pcr was carried out that is rna was firstly transcribed to cdna using the primescript rt master mix kit takara subsequently qualitative pcr qpcr assays were performed using sybr green enzymes sybr premix ex taq ii takara to quantify target genes given that the rp4 conjugative transfer apparatus usually contains three major components grahn et al 2000 genes such as trfap traj trai dtr trbbp and traf mpf as well as trag coupling were chose as the representative genes in addition porin genes including ompa and ompc were also assessed the protocols and reaction mixtures were according to our previous study huang et al 2016 the primers for each target gene were detailed in table s2 supporting information 2 6 other analytical methods and statistical analysis cellular atp and glycogen levels were measured using the promega bactiter glo kit promega and enzychrom glycogen assay kit bioassay systems respectively according to the manufacturer s instructions the measurements of protein content cell viability lactate dehydrogenase ldh extracellular levels of mg2 as well as fe2 and reactive nitrogen species rns were according to our previous studies huang et al 2017 su et al 2016 zheng et al 2013 2018 pretreating strains with arsenate 1 mm for 30 min or 2 2 bipyridyl bip 0 05 mm for 10 min was applied to decrease initial atp level or restrict intracellular free fe2 accordingly conlon et al 2016 hong et al 2017 shatalin et al 2011 all tests in this study were performed in triplicate student t tests have been applied to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant marked with between different samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 fna inhibits the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 the occurrence of transconjugants is considered to be an indicator of successful conjugative transfer of plasmids from donor to recipient in this study a total of 4800 cfu ml transconjugants were detected after the conjugation process in the absence of fna accordingly the transfer frequency of plasmid rp4 from e coli k12 to hb101 was found to be 2 12 10 4 this rate is slightly higher than that reported in a previous study in which natural conjugation between e coli was applied as the transfer model wang et al 2018a the discrepancy might be attributable to the physiological differences the strains used in each study lopatkin et al 2016 however fna treatments caused the corresponding transconjugant numbers and transfer frequencies to decrease in a dose dependent manner for example the numbers of transconjugants were significantly declined to 1520 470 and 350 cfu ml p 0 01 in response to fna dosages of 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 mgn l respectively fig 1 a and the transfer frequencies were decreased to 6 6 10 5 2 1 10 5 and 1 8 10 5 accordingly fig 1b it is clear that he conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 is effectively inhibited by fna it has been reported that conjugative frequencies are influenced by the initial cell densities of the donor and recipient guo et al 2015 lin et al 2016 given that fna can be applied as an antimicrobial agent to wash out unwanted microbes gao et al 2016 it seems plausible that inhibited plasmid transfer might be attributed to the fna induced decrease in donor or recipient numbers to evaluate this possibility we assessed the viabilities of the strains used in this study after fna treatments fig 1c illustrates fna dosages of 0 0 01 mgn l caused only a slight decrease in donor and recipient viabilities p 0 05 at 0 02 mgn l fna caused the viabilities of both donor and recipient to decrease to 85 of the control no fna treatment similar observations were recorded with regards to donor and recipient numbers in the conjugation mixture after 24 h of mating fig 1d the inhibitory effects of fna on viability of cells are usually only observed at high dosages for example the threshold of fna to repress nitrite oxidizing bacteria is approximately 0 02 mgn l zhou et al 2011 while that for ammonia oxidizing bacteria is nearly 0 1 mgn l gao et al 2016 according to our data the inhibitory effect of fna towards conjugation is not related to the antimicrobial role of fna at lower dosages 3 2 fna induces shifts in intracellular levels of free mg2 and fe2 to explore the underlying mechanisms of fna induced inhibition of conjugation we assessed the level of intracellular mg2 using the fluorescent indicator mag fluo 4 am li et al 2017 since mg2 has been reported to be crucial to the initiation of conjugation through its role in the specific relaxation of supercoiled plasmid dna pansegrau et al 1990 as is shown in fig 2 a the fluorescence intensity in e coli k12 donor decreased once fna was added for example the average fluorescence intensity declined from 946 control to 335 after treatment with 0 01 mgn l fna indicating that fna reduced the availability of intracellular mg2 a similar trend was observed in the recipient figure s1a supporting information in the literature the bio effects of fna on cells have been mainly attributed to its uncoupler activities or to the reaction of fna with specific groups within key enzymes gao et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 although mg2 is one of the most abundant ions in cells and is the cofactor for more than 600 enzymatic reactions feeney et al 2016 few studies have focused on the responses of intracellular mg2 to fna to our knowledge this is the first study to report the regulatory effects of fna on intracellular mg2 levels the intracellular content of calcein chelatable iron fe2 was also affected by fna fig 2b and s1b the average fluorescence levels within the donor strain increased to 118 154 and 170 of the control level in response to 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 mgn l of fna respectively suggesting that the concentration of the cellular labile iron pool lip increases following fna exposure these effects might be attributable to the fact that fna and its derivatives can directly damage intracellular iron stores such as fe s clusters and bacterioferritin gao et al 2016 laloo et al 2018 facilitating the liberation of labile fe2 the liberated iron would in turn catalyze the generation of radicals via fenton chemistry dixon and stockwell 2014 shatalin et al 2011 wang et al 2017 which may explain the increased levels of ros and rns figure s2 supporting information caused by fna based on the above results it is clear that the intracellular mg2 and fe2 show opposing responses to fna treatments however in terms of extracellular levels similar trends were observed for both ions as figure s3 shows supporting information the concentration of extracellular mg2 increased significantly when either donor or recipient were treated with 0 01 mg l of fna with respect to extracellular fe2 a slight increase in concentration was observed to rule out the possibility that the increased extracellular levels were due to fna induced cell membrane damage both ldh release and pi fluorescence intensity in response to fna were evaluated it was observed that 0 01 mg l fna resulted in no significant differences in the values of ldh release and pi intensity p 0 05 figure s4 supporting information collectively these results indicate that the transport of mg2 is activated by fna recently laloo et al 2018 found that nitrosomonas sp showed resistance to fna induced oxidative stress via up regulation of enzymes involved in iron transport savigni and morgan 2003 reported that intracellular mg2 could compete for the low affinity iron transport system for transfer outside the cell therefore we proposed that the fna induced increase in lip might trigger the reduction in intracellular mg2 levels to confirm this speculation strains were pretreated with bip a widely applied chelator for intracellular free fe2 before exposure to fna shatalin et al 2011 it is interesting to note that the contribution of fna to decreased intracellular mg2 levels was limited when labile fe2 was chelated indicating that labile fe2 might be the regulator of intracellular mg2 fig 3 a moreover it should be noted that bip pretreatment reduced the levels of ros rns that were induced by fna fig 3b and c a finding that is consistent with the reported roles of intracellular mg2 and fe2 in maintaining and mediating the oxidative status dixon and stockwell 2014 hartwig 2001 more importantly the corresponding conjugation frequency recovered to 1 03 10 4 with bip pretreatment of both donor and recipient which was close to that of the control fig 1b taken together our data suggest that the changes in intracellular mg2 and fe2 levels are keys in the inhibition of conjugation by fna 3 3 fna limits the energy driving force for conjugative transfer conjugation is an atp consuming process as energy is required for the transfer of dna and for the induction of morphogenesis of the conjugation machines chen et al 2005 lu et al 2018 macdonald et al 1992 in order to examine the relationship between intracellular ions and inhibited conjugation more deeply atp levels in response to fna were monitored as fig 4 a illustrates fna caused a sharp dose dependent decline in atp within both strains for example 0 01 mgn l fna resulted in significantly decreased p 0 05 atp contents of donor and recipient at 37 8 and 41 2 of the control respectively more severe atp depletion 20 1 and 23 7 of the control in donor and recipient respectively was observed when the fna dosage was increased to 0 02 mgn l it has been reported that a particular level of intracellular atp represents the switch between cell necrosis and apoptosis under oxidant stress lelli et al 1998 it is therefore possible that the reduced atp following treatment with 0 01 mgn l fna was below the threshold for apoptosis thus no significant reduction in cell viabilities or numbers were observed fig 1c and d as revealed in figure s5 supporting information when intracellular atp was depleted by arsenate pretreatment via the formation of a hydrolysable adenosine diphosphate as conlon et al 2016 a similar inhibitory effect on the conjugative frequency was observed hence the decline in transfer frequencies that we recorded is likely due to the depletion of atp by fna as the mating experiments were carried out in pbs the energy atp required for cell maintenance and conjugation was mainly produced from internal energy stores such as intracellular glycogen macdonald et al 1992 an fna dosage of 0 01 mgn l caused the increased accumulation of glycogen by 32 5 and 28 7 compared with the control in donor and recipient respectively fig 4b reduced glycogen degradation may therefore represent a vital mechanism for the reduction in atp the influence of fna on cellular atp had been studied and fna has been reported to mainly serve as the uncoupler inhibiting atp synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation gao et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 however uncouplers such as carbonyl cyanide 3 chlorophenylhydrazone cccp have been proven to exert no inhibitory effects on glycogen degradation gomezfoix et al 1992 therefore fna might play additional roles to the protonophore in inhibiting the energy supply for conjugation the catabolism of glycogen in e coli proceeds via two main glycolytic routes the emp pathway and the ppp fig 4c perrenoud and sauer 2005 the emp pathway which is generally superior and consumes around 80 of glycolytic fluxes perrenoud and sauer 2005 yields two molecules of atp per molecules of glucose which are subsequently coupled to phosphorylation of adp flamholz et al 2013 the ppp however consumes available glucose to generate nadph without any atp generation jiang et al 2011 a number of key enzymes are involved in both pathways fig 4c in the present study it was found that only two of twelve target enzymes were significantly affected by exposure to fna fig 4d glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh which catalyzes the generation of atp as well as providing reducing power in the form of nadh in the emp pathway was inhibited by 48 1 and 30 8 in the donor and recipient respectively on the other hand the activity of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase g6pdh the first and rate limiting enzyme of the ppp jiang et al 2011 was dramatically increased to 5 fold and 2 89 fold in donor and recipient accordingly it can be concluded that the presence of fna contributes to the inhibition of glycolysis and facilitates of pentose shunt which together result in a decrease in cellular atp interestingly the decreased activities of gapdh and g6pdh following fna exposure were partly relieved when bip pretreatment was applied figure s6 supporting information this suggests that intracellular mg2 and fe2 play important roles in regulating the activities of these enzymes this might be explained by corresponding levels of ros rns figures s3 and 3 as both gapdh and g6pdh have been reported to be sensitive to oxidative stress for instance yun et al 2015 suggested that the suppression of gapdh by vitamin c in cancer cells can be attributed to the ros that form which modifies the active site cysteine cys152 of gapdh via s glutathionylation or sulfonylation chen et al 2007 found that the ppp was activated during oxidative stress since indicated by the observation that regeneration of the redox couple i e gsh gssg relies on the supply of nadph in the current study we observed that fna induced oxidative stress contributed to the inhibition of conjugation however recent studies have suggested that the generated ros facilitate the conjugative transfer of plasmid rp4 by damaging cell membranes and triggering sos responses wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2017 2018 these discrepancies could be explained as follows fna may not necessary cause oxidative damage to cell gao et al 2016 a suggestion that is confirmed by our results in fig 1c and d rather the significant decline in atp that is caused by fna fig 4a may limit the available energy for the transcriptional expression of genes involved in the sos response with respect to other enzymes that were tested in this study pfk pgk and pk are well known glycolytic kinases which rely on the activation of intracellular mg2 heaton 1990 in addition enzymes such as glgp and enl which catalyze the rate limiting step of glycogen degradation and formation of phosphoenolpyruvate containing the high energy phosphate bond respectively are both suggested to be positively regulated by intracellular free mg2 gaussin et al 1997 heaton 1990 mathieu et al 2016 hence the accumulated glycogen that can be seen in fig 4b can be concluded to be a result of glgp inhibition due to the fna induced reduction in intracellular mg2 with the presence of fna fig 2a as is shown in fig 4d the in vitro activities of glgp and other mg2 related enzymes were not significantly affected by 0 01 mgn l of fna p 0 05 this could be explained by the fact that sufficient mg2 applied in in vitro tests table s2 masked the inhibitory effects of decreased intracellular mg2 on these enzymes in vivo study of pseudomonas aeruginosa treated with fna has revealed that the transcriptional levels of genes pgk enl and pk in the emp pathway are down regulated gao et al 2016 our finding concerning the reduction of intracellular mg2 therefore offers a possible explanation in summary fna exposure blocks the emp pathway but facilitates the ppp and significantly limits the available energy for conjugative transfer 3 4 fna suppresses transcriptional expression of conjugative transfer genes as a well known self transmissible plasmid plasmid rp4 encodes a membrane spanning transfer apparatus to regulate the conjugative transfer the precise apparatus bridges the inner and outer membranes of the donor cell and in order to transports processed dna to potential recipients chen et al 2005 frost and koraimann 2010 grahn et al 2000 the dtr and mpf systems of the transfer apparatus are controlled by a series of regulatory genes alteration of expression of these genes therefore affects the transfer frequency lin et al 2016 qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 2018 in the current study a number of representative genes for dtr mpf and coupler cp systems were assessed it was found that the mrna expression levels of dtr genes i e trai traj and trfap were all significantly suppressed by fna fig 5 it has been reported that trai is the dna relaxase that initiates conjugative transfer by introducing site and strand specific nick at the transfer origin orit lujan et al 2007 pansegrau et al 1990 on the other hand traj acts as an assistant to trai facilitating the recognition of orit and the formation of relaxosomes pansegrau et al 1990 in addition the function of relaxosomes depends on the level of intracellular mg2 pansegrau et al 1990 therefore our findings that trai and traj were down regulated and intracellular mg2 levels were decreased indicate that the first and key step of plasmid rp4 cleavage into a transferable strand was inhibited in the present study similar trends were also observed for the cp and mpf systems the product of trag trag has been proposed to be a membrane anchored oligomer that binds relaxosomes and delivers processed dna to the mating bridge lin et al 2016 schroder and lanka 2003 moreover trag is a putative transmembrane atpase which binds atp and serves as an active motor for secretion schroder and lanka 2003 the significant suppression of trag expression that was observed in this study 12 6 of the control is therefore indicative of the inactivation of the cp system on the other hand traf is responsible for the processing of pilus assembly which is essential in the formation of a mating pair grahn et al 2000 zhang et al 2018 the repression of traf together with the inhibition of trbbp transcription both suggest the dysfunction of the mpf system this was further evidenced by the down regulation of ompa and ompc expression which play a considerable role in stabilization of the mating pair dreiseikelmann 1994 taken together fna causes failure of the rp4 encoded transfer apparatus which may explain the observed inhibition of conjugation 3 5 application validation and environmental implications to validate the inhibitory effects of fna on conjugation in aquatic environments we investigated microorganisms in the influent of a wwtp as potential plasmid recipients as figure s7 supporting information shows the number of transconjugants decreased following exposure to 0 02 mgn l fna to only 9 6 of the control this confirms the capability of fna to restrict the transfer of plasmid rp4 to indigenous bacteria in wwtps as an example of one of many self transmissible plasmids that have been isolated from wwtp bacteria guo et al 2015 schluter et al 2007 plasmid rp4 has been reported to be permissible to more than 46 of the genera in activated sludge li et al 2018a the transfer of plasmid rp4 among bacteria could be facilitated by particular contaminants which tend to accumulate in wwtps qiu et al 2012 wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 even worse the resilient communities within wwtps may rely on hgt especially conjugation to survive and adapt to anthropogenic stresses such as heavy metal antibiotics and engineered nanoparticles berendonk et al 2015 eckert et al 2019 huang et al 2019 our results concerning the inhibitory efficiency of fna fig 1 and s7 therefore suggest a promising strategy toward the control of conjugation in wwtps the application of fna to treat wastewater and sludge within wwtps is widely accepted for example wang et al 2014 proposed that fna can be used to selectively eliminate nitrite oxidizing bacteria without affecting ammonium oxidizing bacteria to achieve the nitrite pathway additionally fna can be applied as a pretreatment for waste sludge to enhance the yields of valuable products such as short chain fatty acid methane and hydrogen wang et al 2013 2018b zhao et al 2015 more importantly it has been suggested that fna can be produced within wwtps using anaerobic digestion liquor wang et al 2013 hence application of fna seems a practicable and sustainable method to control plasmid mediated args dissemination in wwtps more studies including field trials are needed in the future 4 conclusion this study demonstrates the inhibitory effects of fna on the plasmid mediated dissemination of args we elucidated the underlying mechanisms for this restricted process through the use of fluorescence indicators and ion chelator fig 6 and suggest the following fna treatments leads to the liberation of intracellular fe2 which triggers a reduction in intracellular mg2 levels these shifts in ion concentrations affect the enzymatic metabolism limiting the energy that is available for conjugation together with the down regulation of transfer apparatus the transfer of plasmids between bacteria is therefore inhibited by validating the utility of fna treatment in wastewater microorganisms fna could offer an approach with which control the spread of args among sludge bacteria in wwtps acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the
