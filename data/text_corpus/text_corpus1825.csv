9125,in the context of global warming drought is a crucial factor affecting agricultural production especially for the oasis farming areas of northwestern china where water resources are extremely scarce to reveal the response of watermelon water consumption wc yield quality and water use efficiency wue to water deficit wd and to determine the optimal mode of irrigation in the desert oasis areas of hexi we applied different wd treatments on a field oasis watermelon in 2020 and 2021 the experiments employed two gradients of light l and moderate m wd treatments during the seedling s vine v expansion e and maturity m stages except for flowering and fruiting f stage with full irrigation during the entire growth period as the control ck the results showed that the wc of oasis watermelon at each growth stage was in the order e v s m f in which wc by e stage accounted for 33 15 40 33 compared with the ck wd had an obvious effect on water saving and wd during the v or e stages inhibited the growth of vine leaves to a certain extent the sl treatment light wd during s stage had the highest yield and wue with significant increases of 5 23 5 38 and 7 10 7 37 p 0 05 respectively in the two years while the mm treatment moderate wd during the m stage resulted in the best overall nutritional quality of watermelon with soluble solids soluble sugars vitamin c and soluble protein contents increasing by 11 31 33 43 24 03 and 10 31 p 0 05 respectively however an integrated evaluation that coupled grey relation analysis gra with a technique for determining order preference by its similarity to an ideal solution topsis model considering growth yield quality and efficiency indicators concluded that the ml treatment light wd during the m stage achieved the highest comprehensive score followed by the sl treatment therefore it is recommended that the optimal deficit irrigation mode for oasis watermelon is the ml treatment which can balance water savings yields and quality improvements while the sl treatment can be considered as a backup mode this study provides theoretical and technical support for achieving efficient water saving cultivation and scale development of watermelon production in desert oasis areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords deficit irrigation sub membrane drip irrigation water consumption yield fruit quality oasis watermelon data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction watermelon citrullus lanatus first originated in africa wehner et al 2001 and its flesh is rich in sugars mineral salts and vitamins which are essential for human metabolism and have high nutritional and medicinal value ozmen et al 2015 qin and leskovar 2020 it is also a good product for quenching thirst in the summer heat and has the reputation of being the king of summer fruits kyriacou et al 2018 the volumes of watermelon produced and consumed in china are the highest in the world and the area cultivated has been stable at approximately 1 8 million hectares ha in recent years with not only a long history of cultivation but also a wide geographical distribution committee 2016 li et al 2018 the irrigated farming area of the hexi oasis in gansu province possesses abundant light and heat resources with a large day night temperature difference and a typical continental desert steppe climate zhang and lai 2003 and this unique geographical environment with its distinct locational advantages provide a high quality open air watermelon production base as of 2015 the area of watermelon and melon cultivation reached 0 22 million ha with a total output of 20 6 million tonnes t qi et al 2016 in recent years with the construction of the one belt and one road economic trading route and the strategy of rural revitalization watermelon and other special local cash crops have been promoted on a large scale because of their short planting cycles high yields and rapidly yielding benefits kirnak and dogan 2009 however as the scale of planting continues to expand the demand for irrigation continues to increase and the district itself is located in an arid region with a severe shortage of water resources limited rainfall and high evaporation intensity which all further intensify water utilization conflicts deng et al 2006 yavuz et al 2020 zheng et al 2013a moreover outdated irrigation methods and haphazard irrigation management practices have also resulted in an imbalance between nutritional and reproductive growth yielding the dilemma of poor watermelon quality and low yields over a large area chen et al 2013 reddy 2016 a lack of scientific based irrigation management limits the development of the local watermelon industry with serious consequences for economic and social benefits deficit irrigation during certain crop growth stages not only can save irrigation water but also can improve fruit quality while still maintaining high yields chai et al 2016 fereres and soriano 2007 forey et al 2016 currently this technique can be used to aid water conservation and efficient utilization by implementing different gradients of water regulation modes based on the water consumption wc characteristics of the crop stages which has been widely employed in the cultivation of potato solanum tuberosum li et al 2021 onion allium cepa l zheng et al 2013b pepper capsicum annuum yang et al 2018 and other crops in oasis areas with excellent yields and water saving results ruiz sanchez et al 2010 related studies of watermelon production have also been conducted for example pang 2005 established a water production function for watermelon under mulched furrow irrigation which concluded that the water sensitivity index for watermelon was maximum at the fruiting expansion stage followed by the expansion ripening stage and minimum at the sowing flowering stage but the yield of mild wd at the fruiting expansion stage was 3 81 higher than that of the control instead of being reduced wang 2007a found that moderate wd improved watermelon yield and wue in an arid zone and that fruit vitamin c and soluble solids content were increased in the wd treatment more recently scholars at home and abroad have studied the effects of regional varietal irrigation and cultivation method differences on watermelon deficit irrigation systems abdelkhalik et al 2019 suggested that adequate water supply should be used under sufficient irrigation conditions for seedless watermelon in the mediterranean region while in the case of insufficient irrigation deficit regulation can be applied at the fruit ripening stage yang et al 2017 showed that water use efficiency and quality were better for greenhouse watermelon grown in winter and spring with a total irrigation volume of 114 mm and allocations of 25 12 62 and 15 mm at seedling s vine v expansion e and maturity m stages in northwest china kuscu et al 2015 showed that water deficit caused a significant reduction of watermelon yield in their experiment of semi humid areas with the water deficit treatment during the whole reproductive period reducing yield by up to 31 compared with full water supply but saving 50 of water and having a higher content of soluble solids and total sugars the water stress trial results of mo et al 2016a on wild watermelon m20 and domesticated watermelon y34 showed that water stress inhibited the growth of both varieties but the rhizomes of m20 increased significantly compared with those of y34 and the leaf water status of m20 was higher yu et al 2012 on two main planting varieties of ningnongke 1 and sh204 in gravel mulched sand with wd indicated that under 10 water stress the trend of photosynthetic physiological characteristics of the two test materials was the same while under 5 water stress photosynthetic rate of ningnongke 1 showed a uniform decrease while transpiration rate and stomatal conductance decreased less than that of sh204 i e the former displayed a better adaptation ability liu 2015 concluded that the optimal drip irrigation frequency strategy for watermelon was one drip every 4 day during both the seedling and expansion stages and one drip every 2 and 6 day at the blossom and the ripening stage respectively compared to mulched border irrigation under mulched drip irrigation for watermelon saved about 67 7 of the water used increased yield by 30 7 and enhanced wue to about 0 9 while greatly improving the soil ecology xing et al 2003 and for intercropped watermelon under mulched drip irrigation saved 62 9 mm of water compared with traditional furrow irrigation increasing yield and water productivity by 14 9 and 40 39 respectively qiang et al 2015 saraiva et al 2017 conducted a deficit regulation experiment on watermelons of different ground cover types and concluded that under rice husk or white plastic film cover watermelons treated with sufficient water supply showed the highest yields and relatively good quality meanwhile yavuz et al 2020 and yang and he 2022 also researched water consumption laws and water saving and high yield irrigation systems for grafted watermelon which has expanded watermelon deficit regulation cultivation techniques in summary the above mentioned studies provide possible options for the development of deficit regulating cultivation techniques for watermelon cultivation using sub membrane drip irrigation in arid oases which can guide the development of the watermelon industry and the efficient utilization of regional water resources most previous studies on this topic have focused mainly on watermelon yields and wue by considering the effects of deficit regulating however comprehensive studies on the growth wc yield and quality characteristics of watermelon with sub membrane drip irrigation is still less concerned and the research on multi level integrated decision making of deficit irrigation modes based on coupling model is rarely reported meanwhile hydro meteorological situations in different areas may also affect the application of irrigation technique as such it is a long term task to continuously develop and improve the study of under mulched drip irrigation deficit regulating cultivation systems in arid oasis areas and the objectives of this study were as follows i to investigate the effects of under mulched drip irrigation deficit regulation on wc characteristics quality yield and wue of watermelon crops by comparing the results with those obtained under adequate irrigation conditions ii to evaluate the comprehensive nutritional quality of watermelon by using principal component analysis pca and iii based on an improved topsis model to establish a comprehensive evaluation model of watermelon growth thereby optimizing the best deficit irrigation mode for oasis watermelon production which aims to provide some technical support for the efficient cultivation of oasis watermelon in the arid regions of northwestern china in the study we hypothesized that there is a significant advantage to improving crop productivity and quality when deficit mulched drip irrigation technique is applied to watermelon cultivation in desert oasis region 2 materials and methods 2 1

in table 1 2 2 experimental design the variety of watermelon tested was xinong 8 the seeds were sown on april 30th and harvested on august 19th 2020 and on may 1st and august 15th 2021 the planting rate and planting densities were 2 0 kg ha 1 and 27 000 plants ha 1 respectively in north south rows with plots of melons climbing east west against each other at a spacing of 30 35 cm the test field was tilled deeply mechanically 20 30 cm one week before sowing with weeds and debris removed manually at the time of sowing 760 kg ha 1 of compound fertilizer was applied using a one time manual trenching method according to the local standard conditions with no subsequent fertilizer being applied each plot had an area of 16 8 m2 2 4 m 7 m and an effective area of 573 3 m2 the drip irrigation pipes were controlled using the plot branching method i e each plot was connected to a drip irrigation pipe with a gate valve and water meter accuracy 0 001 m3 at the entrance to the drip irrigation pipe to accurately measure the volume of irrigation of each treatment following the laying of the drip irrigation strips manually a film was placed over the top and a 60 cm wide film separated neighboring plots to prevent interference with the soil moisture infiltration distribution between plots the field experiment is shown in fig 2 according to the irrigation experiment specification sl 13 2015 and following the actual growth process of watermelon in local fields the entire growing season was divided into five stages seedling stage about 30 d denoted as s vine stage about 25 d denoted as v flowering and fruiting stage about 4 6 d denoted as f expansion stage 25 d denoted as e and maturity stage 12 d denoted as m the division of the growth stages and the effective rainfall for each stage in 2020 2021 are listed in table 2 as watermelon is a highly water consuming crop the wd levels were designed to avoid heavy wd as much as possible and to integrate the results of previous studies with the actual situation of the region by applying two gradients light l and moderate m deficit irrigation levels for each of the remaining periods except for the f stage yavuz et al 2021 yesim and nedim 2003 two irrigation levels were set based on soil moisture content smc light wd 60 70 field capacity fc and medium wd 50 60 fc according to relevant data watermelon is highly drought tolerant and grows best when the relative smc is in the range of 70 80 wu and wang 2008 so the appropriate irrigation level 70 80 fc was used as a control during the entire reproductive period with a total of nine treatments each replicated three times in a completely randomized design field management was the same single vine grooming for all treatments except for inconsistencies in the level of soil moisture regulation the water regulation schemes for different growth stages of watermelon are listed in table 2 the irrigation method employed was under mulched drip irrigation with two drip pipes 2 m spacing laid manually in each plot the drip head was a labyrinth flow channel with an internal diameter of 16 mm and the working pressure of the system was 0 1 mpa the spacing and average flow rate of the emitter were 300 mm and 2 0 l h 1 respectively with strong resistance to blockage the irrigation volume was controlled by a water meter at the pivot point the specific irrigation times and volumes are shown in fig 3 2 3 test items and calculation methods 2 3 1 meteorological data meteorological data were obtained from fully automated weather stations at the test site including temperature relative air humidity atmospheric pressure solar radiation intensity wind speed wind direction and rainfall amount total rainfall amounts were 176 and 102 5 mm during the watermelon growing seasons of 2020 and 2021 respectively with effective rainfall 5 mm of 68 0 mm in 2020 and 61 4 mm in 2021 the average temperatures were 17 28 c and 17 63 c in 2020 and 2021 respectively with maximum temperatures of 26 6 c 2020 and 28 5 c 2021 and a minimum temperature of 7 4 c in both years fig 4 2 3 2 growth indicators once the watermelon crop had reached the m stage six plants of uniform length were randomly selected to mark each plot to ensure accurate and reliable data main vine length 3 m long steel tape measure graduations 0 1 cm from the base of the stem to the tip main vine thickness measured with a digital vernier caliper with a range of 300 mm graduations 0 01 mm based on the diameter of the first joint of the stem at the base of the main vine of the melon seedling following watermelon ripening and harvesting the longitudinal and cross diameter of the watermelon was measured in each plot using a digital vernier caliper leaf area measured with the aid of a ymj b handheld living leaf area meter type zhejiang topyun technology co ltd zhejiang china the leaf area index lai is equal to the ratio of the total leaf area per unit of land to the area per unit of land 2 3 3 soil moisture content swc swc was measured using the dry method at the midpoint of the line connecting two consecutive watermelon plants randomly selected in each plot following the start of treatment soil samples were taken from the 0 100 cm profile of the field layer by layer at 20 cm intervals using a soil auger as the root mass of watermelon is distributed mainly between 40 and 50 cm the average moisture content of the 0 60 cm soil layer was taken as the planned wet layer while the change in soil moisture within the 0 100 cm layer was used to calculate the crop water consumption smc was measured one time only before sowing and every 7 10 d during the following period with additional measurements following irrigation and before and after rainfall each time at a depth of 100 cm when the measured smc was lower than the lower limit of moisture content in the experimental design table 3 irrigation was applied immediately the equations for calculating soil mass moisture content and irrigation volume are 1 θ swc m a m b m b 2 m 10 γ hp θ i θ j η where θ swc is the soil mass moisture content m a and m b are the fresh and dry soil weights g m is the irrigation volume mm γ is the soil bulk density of the planned wetted layer g cm 3 h is the planned wetted layer depth taken as 60 cm θ i and θ j are the design upper limit and pre irrigation soil mass moisture content and p and η are the drip irrigation design wetting ratio 65 and irrigation water utilization rate taken as 95 respectively wang et al 2018 2 3 4 yield yields were measured by plot weighing at the m stage and were statistically analyzed with the average of three replicates taken as the actual fruit yield t ha 1 for each treatment while the fresh weights of individual fruit were also recorded 2 3 5 nutritional quality the nutritional quality indicators of the watermelons were measured within one week of harvesting the flesh was washed and cut lengthwise and then the central and marginal flesh was removed from the seeds and mixed and pulped for measurement the nutritional quality indicators were determined using a way 2s abbey refractometer shanghai chongfeng scientific instruments co shanghai china for soluble solid g 250 staining with thomas leucoxanthin for soluble protein 2 6 dichloroindophenol titration for vitamin c and acid base titration for organic acid gao 2000 2 3 6 water consumption and wue the water balance method was used to calculate the water consumption characteristics of watermelons during the growing season based on the irrigation test specification data for swc measured periodically by the dry method were substituted into the following equation greaves and wang 2017 3 et 1 2 w 1 w 2 m p k c where et 1 2 is the stage water consumption of watermelon mm w 1 and w 2 are the soil water storage values at the beginning and end of a particular period and m p k and c are the amounts of irrigation precipitation deep soil water replenishment and drainage mm respectively during the period the test area was arid and the drip irrigation doesn t saturate the soil so no seepage occurred c is taken as 0 wue is calculated using the following formula 4 wue y et where wue is the water use efficiency of watermelon t ha 1 mm 1 y is the watermelon yield per unit area t ha 1 and et is the water consumption of watermelon during the entire reproductive period mm 2 4 comprehensive evaluation of watermelon nutritional quality based on principal component analysis pca pca is a multivariate statistical method that takes original indicators with certain correlations and applies the idea of dimensionality reduction to transform multiple indicators into several composite indicators with less loss of information ben et al 2016 pca was used to make a comprehensive evaluation of the nutritional quality of watermelon under deficit irrigation conditions and the specific steps were referred to liu et al 2018 2 5 gra topsis comprehensive evaluation method to carry out a rational comprehensive evaluation the component factors were first classified to establish a progressive hierarchical structure for the system and then the relationships between those system factors were analyzed 2 5 1 determination of weights 1 hierarchical analysis the evaluation system was constructed based on the analytic hierarchy process ahp albayrak and erensal 2004 to determine the subjective weights sw the importance of the component factors was determined by comparing the scores for the various component indicators with each other using the expert survey method and the judgment matrix was constructed using 1 9 and the reciprocal as the scoring value according to their importance satisfaction the consistency index ci was then calculated and the corresponding average random consistency index ri was found the consistency ratio cr was obtained from the ratio of ci to ri if cr 0 1 the consistency of the judgment matrix was considered acceptable otherwise it needed to be revised finally the weight vector of the component indicators was calculated from the consistency matrix 2 correlation of indicator importance based on the method of criteria importance though intercriteria correlation critic diakoulaki et al 1995 the objective weights ow of the factors indicators were determined the amount of information c j contained in the factor is obtained by considering the strength of the comparison between the schemes treatments in which the factor was located and the conflicting nature of the factor the greater the amount of information the more important the factor was i e the greater the corresponding weight the specific formula for calculating the amount of information and weight is as follows 5 c j δ j i 1 n 1 r i j 6 θ j c j j 1 m c j where c j denotes the amount of information contained in the j th evaluation factor θ j denotes the normalized weight of the j th factor δ j is the standard deviation of the results of each scheme for the same factor r ij is the correlation coefficient between the evaluation factors and i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 3 determination of combination weights based on game theory gt based on the combination weights method of gt shan et al 2012 the comprehensive weights cw of the evaluation factor were determined to avoid the subjective preferences of decision makers and to reflect the weight of objective data contribution to decision making which improves the scientific weighting of the evaluation factors and the reliability of evaluation conclusions in this paper the weight set was constructed based on two kinds of assignments subjective ahp and objective critic the methodology is as follows the set of basis weight vectors w k w k1 w k2 w kn k 1 2 l was constructed by assigning weights to each of the indicators with l different assignment methods and any linear combination of these l different vectors was notated as 7 w k 1 l α k w k t α 0 k 1 l α k 1 where w is one possible weight vector for the set of weights and α k is a linear combining coefficient the gt method was applied to optimize the l linear combining coefficients with the aim of minimizing the deviation of w from the individual w i e the objective function is 8 min k 1 l α k w k t w j 2 j 1 2 l the optimal first order derivative condition of eq 8 can be converted into a system of equations 9 w 1 w 1 t w 1 w 2 t w 1 w l t w 2 w 1 t w 2 w 2 t w 2 w l t w l w 1 t w l w 2 t w l w l t α 1 α 2 α l w 1 w 1 t w 2 w 2 t w l w l t the α i derived from eq 9 is normalized by eq

distance the original data matrix of m evaluation indicators and n evaluation objects was set as x x ij m n matrix x was normalized to obtain z 12 z z i j m n where z i j x i j i 1 n x i j 2 the maximum value z was defined as z 1 z 2 z m and the minimum value z was defined as z 1 z 2 z m the weighted euclidean distance of the i th i 1 2 n evaluation object from the positive ideal solution z j and the weighted euclidean distance of the negative ideal solution z j are d i and d i respectively 13 d i j 1 m w j z j z i j 2 the score of the i th evaluation object was calculated as s i and the normalized composite score was s i 14 s i d i d i d i 15 s i s i i 1 n s i 2 gra method for determining grey relation degree the grey relation degree of each moisture treatment was calculated based on the grey system theory zhao et al 2020 the grey relation coefficient matrix r of each indicator of the weighting matrix z with the reference series positive or negative ideal solution set was calculated according to eq 18 16 r i j min n min m z 0 j z i j ρ max n max m z 0 j z i j z 0 j z i j ρ max n max m z 0 j z i j 17 r r 11 r 12 r 1 m r 21 r 22 r 2 m r n 1 r n 2 r n m where ρ denotes the resolution factor and denotes or i e the grey relation coefficient matrix with the positive ideal solution set or the grey relation coefficient matrix with the negative ideal solution set the grey correlation degrees of the i th treatment in the matrix z with the positive and negative ideal solution sets were further obtained as r i and r i 18 r i 1 m j 1 m r i j i 1 2 n the euclidean distances

2017b mathworks corp natick ma usa were used for building the evaluation system and parsing model 3 results 3 1 biological characteristics of watermelon under wd from table 3 it can be seen that different wd treatments at different growth stages had different effects on the various growth indicators of watermelon compared with the ck the main vine length was reduced by different degrees in all treatments except sl of which el and em had a significant effect on main vine length p 0 05 while the remaining wd treatments did not have a significant effect on main vine length p 0 05 in 2020 and 2021 the main vine lengths of the ck were 159 59 and 169 87 cm respectively while those of el were 148 53 and 150 27 cm respectively with reductions of 6 93 and 7 52 respectively and those of em were 139 33 and 150 27 cm respectively with reduction of 12 70 and 11 54 respectively in 2020 and 2021 the main vine thicknesses of sl increased compared with those of the ck but the difference was not significant while the rest of the treatments showed different reductions of which the main vine thicknesses of sm el ml and mm were not significantly p 0 05 different from that of the ck the differences in main vine thickness compared with that of the ck were not significant for sm el ml or mm while vl vm and em decreased significantly p 0 05 by 7 21 11 81 in 2020 and 7 55 11 78 in 2021 the trend in leaf area index lai was the same as that for main vine length with sl having the largest lai 1 02 in 2020 and 1 03 in 2021 followed by the ck ml and mm with vm showing the greatest reductions by 7 00 and 6 93 p 0 05 respectively this indicated that wd has a greater effect on the main vine and lai of watermelon during v and e stages than during other reproductive periods and the extent of the effect increases with the magnitude of the regulation deficit wd had different effects on the cross and longitudinal diameters of watermelon fruits with sl having the largest fruit diameter with an increase of 5 12 5 55 in cross diameter and 4 57 4 65 in longitudinal diameter compared with the ck p 0 05 while sm and ml showed slight reductions of which none were significant p 0 05 the em was the smallest with a decrease of 3 24 3 28 and 3 24 p 0 05 in cross and longitudinal diameter respectively followed by el and mm both of which reached significant levels of difference this indicated that wd during the e period is detrimental to fruit growth 3 2 water consumption characteristics of watermelon under wd fig 5 shows the water consumption wc of watermelon at each growth stage for the different wd treatments in 2020 and 2021 as can be seen from fig 5 the wc of watermelon in all treatments ranged from 280 50 to 323 23 mm and 290 35 331 41 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively with significant water savings arising from deficit irrigation compared with full irrigation p 0 05 the degrees of water saving in 2020 and 2021 ranged from 0 86 to 13 21 and 0 58 12 39 respectively with wc in the order e v s f m for each growth stage of watermelon under different treatments the wc of the s stage accounted for approximately 15 of the total wc of the whole reproductive period the v stage accounted for approximately 25 the f stage accounted for approximately 5 and the m stage accounted for approximately 10 while the wc of the e stage accounted for 40 of the wc of the whole reproductive period higher than those of other four growth stages this was probably because this stage is a critical period for watermelon reproductive growth with conditions of high temperatures and long hours of sunshine hours which promote fruit expansion and rapid leaf growth resulting in stronger evapotranspiration and higher cumulative water consumption in addition the effects of different stages of wd gradient on wc of watermelon were different in which water consumption decreased with increasing levels of wd during the same period such as the wc of sm was significantly lower than that of sl by 6 63 and 6 77 p 0 05 respectively while the magnitude of the effect of the same level of wd on water consumption differed during different periods with those of sl significantly decreasing by 6 56 and 6 45 p 0 05 respectively compared with the ck while those of el decreased by 15 48 and 23 75 respectively 3 3 yield and wue of watermelon under wd fig 6 shows the yield and wue of watermelon under different deficit irrigation conditions in 2020 and 2021 as can be seen from fig 6 there was not a simple linear relationship between watermelon wc and yield the ck with the highest wc did not have the highest yield and the sl treatment in 2a increased watermelon yield significantly p 0 05 compared with the ck while sm only decreased by 2 27 and 2 77 respectively but the differences were not significant p 0 05 this period is the initial stage of the growth of watermelon vine leaves and other plant organs involved with nutrition mainly to accumulate more water for bud differentiation while the slower development of the effects of wd can promote the root system to lay the foundation for later growth to a certain extent by comparing the watermelon yield of the ck with those of the vl and vm treatments in both years we found that the wd applied during the v stage of watermelon did not have a significant effect on yield p 0 05 which was a critical stage of nutrient organ growth in watermelon and this wd significantly inhibited vine leaf growth and favored the formation of the fruit later after the watermelon yield of the ck with those of the el and em treatments were compared it was found that the yield was significantly lower p 0 05 than that of the ck treatment during the e period with the yield of the el and em treatments being 11 29 and 22 35 lower respectively than that of the ck in 2020 and 10 22 and 20 97 lower respectively in 2021 lower this is due to the removal of the main vine growth point commonly known as topping at the beginning of the e period following which the lai reaches its maximum and growth stops water consumption is mainly for fruit growth and development but wd at this stage has a significant impact on the elongation of watermelon fruit cells which directly impacts the economic yield of watermelon by the m stage the watermelon fruit size was largely stable due mainly to the transformation of flesh color and the synthesis and accumulation of associated nutrients although wd reduced watermelon yield to some extent all differences were non significant compared to that of the ck except for the 2021 mm treatment which may be caused by wd reducing the water content of the fruit during this period by comparing the watermelon wue data shown in fig 6 the wue values for the ck in 2020 and 2021 were 0 390 and 0 381 t ha 1 mm 1 respectively while the wue values were greatest for sl and vm both no less than 0 410 t ha 1 mm 1 followed by those of sm and vl with the smallest wue for the em treatment both at 0 35 t ha 1 mm 1 for 2a the wue values of both the sm and vl treatments were at higher levels a comparison of watermelon yield and wue showed that both yield and wue were lower for wd during the e period therefore wd treatments should not be applied during this period and adequate irrigation should be maintained instead however the best time to apply deficit irrigation is during the s stage which obtains relatively high watermelon yield and wue 3 4 nutritional quality characteristics of watermelon under wd the effects of under membrane drip irrigation deficit on the nutritional quality indicators of watermelon are listed in table 4 the results of the trials in both years showed that wd during the s and v stages had no significant impact p 0 05 on soluble solid and soluble sugar content but wd during the e and m stages significantly increased soluble solid content p 0 05 with the mm treatment having the highest soluble solid and soluble sugar contents with increases of 11 15 and 33 41 in 2020 and 11 46 and 33 45 in 2021 respectively compared with the ck wd significantly increased organic acid content during the e period in 2020 and 2021 by 15 79 16 67 and 21 05 27 78 p 0 05 respectively and the remaining treatments were at the same levels as the ck the results for vitamin c and soluble protein content of 2a fruit in response to different water treatments were generally consistent with the trend for soluble matter i e watermelon fruiting stages e and m stages both had significantly increased contents of both vitamin c and soluble protein in conclusion the appropriate wd treatments during different stages of watermelon can affect the nutritional quality of the fruit deficit irrigation increased mainly the soluble solid soluble sugar and soluble protein content of the fruit indicating that deficit irrigation treatments can improve watermelon quality specifically wd treatment during the m stage significantly p 0 05 increased the content of all nutritional quality indicators except organic acid resulting in sweeter tasting flesh hence deficit irrigation treatment during the m stage had a positive effect on watermelon quality with mm having the best effect followed by ml 3 5 comprehensive nutritional quality of watermelon evaluated by pca to make a reasonable and reliable evaluation of the nutritional quality of watermelon we used the above mentioned soluble solid soluble sugar organic acid vitamin c and soluble protein which represent nutritional attributes as reference indicators to evaluate the overall nutritional quality of deficit irrigation watermelon by pca the cumulative variance contribution of the first and second principal components exceeded 90 fig 7 indicating that the first two principal components reflected all the information of the nutritional quality indicators the principal component functions were constructed as follows 25 y1 0 475x1 0 474x2 0 471x3 0 453x4 0 352x5 26 y2 0 032x1 0 082x2 0 153x3 0 416x4 0 892x5 30 y 0 884y1 0 116y2 where y1 and y2 are the first and second principal component scores y is the composite score and x1 x2 x3 x4 and x5 are the standardized values for soluble solid soluble sugar vitamin c organic acid and soluble protein content respectively in terms of the principal component function soluble solid soluble sugar vitamin c and organic acid had higher weights than soluble protein in y1 and soluble protein had the highest weight in y2 we concluded that both y1 and y2 represent information about the changes in nutritional quality as shown in fig 7 the highest overall evaluation index of nutritional quality was found for the mm treatment followed by that for the ml treatment which indicates that deficit irrigation during the m stage of watermelon can improve the overall nutritional quality of the fruit 3 6 comprehensive evaluation of watermelon growth based on improved topsis 3 6 1 correlation analysis of single indicator table 5 shows the averages of the measured results of each treatment component indicator for the two growing seasons to establish a reasonable evaluation system we carried out a simple correlation analysis of watermelon indicators fig 8 the results showed that main vine length was significantly and positively correlated with lai highly significantly and positively correlated with vine thickness fruit diameter fresh weight per fruit total yield and wue and highly and negatively correlated with organic acid main vine thickness was significantly and positively correlated with lai fresh weight per fruit and total yield lai was significantly and positively correlated with fresh weight per fruit and total yield the cross diameter was significantly and positively correlated with longitudinal diameter fresh weight per fruit total yield and wue and highly and negatively correlated with soluble solid total yield and wue it was significantly positively correlated with longitudinal diameter fresh weight per fruit total yield and wue and negatively correlated with soluble solid soluble sugar and vitamin c total yield was significantly and positively correlated with wue and negatively correlated with soluble solid and soluble sugar soluble solid was significantly and positively correlated with soluble sugar vitamin c organic acid and soluble protein and negatively correlated with wue this suggests that there is some overlap between the information provided by the single indicators of watermelon but that each indicator is irreplaceable in reflecting the overall growth of watermelon to this end a multi level comprehensive evaluation system comprising a target level a criterion level and an indicator level was constructed by dividing the watermelon growth indicators yield indicators quality indicators and efficiency indicators into four broad categories considering economic ecological and resource utilization aspects the specific stepwise hierarchy is shown in fig 9 3 6 2 determination of indicator weights the results for the sw determined based on the ahp method are listed in table 6 the maximum eigenvalue was λ max and the maximum weights of the primary indicators of watermelon were the yield indicators 0 324 followed by the growth and quality indicators and the smallest weight of the efficiency indicator was only 0 171 the maximum weight of the secondary indicators was the total yield c3 which was 0 216 followed by the wue c13 the lowest vitamin c was only 0 016 the results for the ow based on critic are shown in table 7 in which soluble solid c8 was given the greatest weight 0 104 followed by soluble protein c12 0 102 the cws of the watermelon indicators were determined by the gt combination weighting method and are listed in table 7 total yield c6 had the highest cw of 0 180 followed by wue c13 0 152 and soluble sugar content 0 098 and main vine length c1 was the smallest at 0 028 3 6 3 comprehensive evaluation of watermelon growth first the euclidean distances d i and d i were calculated for each wd treatment based on topsis as d i 0 124 0 128 0 122 0 124 0 119 0 063 0 026 0 125 and d i 0 040 0 040 0 044 0 041 0 050 0 091 0 131 0 023 0 131 0 023 second the grey relation degrees r i and r i for each wd treatment were determined based on gra as r i 0 471 0 458 0 483 0 478 0 494 0 514 0 554 0 485 and r i 0 686 0 687 0 688 0 687 0 692 0 616 0 597 0 597 on this basis topsis was coupled with a grey relation scheme to construct a composite closeness by weighting h i 0 261 0 255 0 276 0 265 0 294 0 405 0 518 and h i 0 366 0 371 0 363 0 365 0 358 0 253 table 8 are the comprehensive evaluation scores and the ranking results of each treatment in 2020 and 2021 according to the normalized scores the score rankings of the gra topsis and the topsis method were generally consistent from best to worst ml sl ck vl sm vm mm el em also the evaluation results were in line with the objective reality of the experiment meanwhile the spearman correlation coefficient of 0 9 p 0 01 indicated that the degree of correlation between the two evaluation methods was very high confirming that the gra topsis method is feasible and simple to understand in the comprehensive evaluation of water saving irrigation benefits for watermelon thus the best deficit irrigation mode for watermelon under sub membrane drip irrigation in the hexi oasis was treatment ml i e a light 60 70 fc wd during the m stage while if only yield was considered the sl treatment could be used as an alternative mode i e a light 60 70 fc wd during the s stage 4 discussion 4 1 effects of wd on watermelon growth indicators watermelon has a high yield high economic value and is the main fruit consumed by people in summer however due to its high levels of water consumption mo et al 2016b rashidi and gholami 2008 its water demand characteristics are different during different growth stages in different regions so it is important to explore these growth effects and water consumption characteristics deficit irrigation is used to control the root growth of plants through soil water management thus manipulating the growth of the above ground parts to achieve stable yields water conservation and quality regulation akbarzadeh et al 2022 wang et al 2020b the deficit mulched drip irrigation technique has a significant effect on watermelon growth liu et al 2014 in this study we found that water deficit wd during the vine v and expansion e stages significantly reduced watermelon main vine length main vine thickness and leaf area index lai while wd during the seedling s and maturity m stages were not significant i e the effect of wd during the middle of the entire growth period was significantly greater than those in the early and late stages this is in agreement with the findings of abdelkhalik et al 2019 on water regulation in seedless watermelons this is because in the early stages the plants are small and the temperature is low so the intensity of water demand is also low and the crop is affected by wd at a slower rate of development while during the m stage stem and leaf growth stagnates and wd has a greater impact on fruit quality yet during the middle stage of crop growth watermelon is in a critical period of nutrient reproduction and requires a lot of water so wd inhibits the normal growth and is detrimental to fruit formation 4 2 effects of wd on watermelon water consumption water consumption during each growth stage of crop growth can indicate its water requirements and can also reflect the water sensitivity of the crop during each period thus indicating the critical and peak water requirements of the crop wang et al 2020a in this study the water consumption of watermelon during the five reproductive periods of its growth cycle was found to be in the order e v s m f flowering and fruiting stage this is because the water demand pattern of the crop was affected mainly by growth characteristics meteorology and agricultural management practices but also followed the corresponding habit and volume patterns in the hexi oasis irrigation area during the watermelon s stage the temperature was relatively low and light intensity was weak while the initial growth of leaves flower bud differentiation and rapid root expansion occurred mainly during this stage evapotranspiration was relatively low the duration of this stage was relatively long approximately 25 d and water consumption was relatively moderate accounting for approximately 15 of total water consumption during the entire reproductive period at the end of may and the beginning of june when the v stage began the temperature rose gradually the above ground vine started to grow prostrate and the internodes elongated while the leaves also entered a rapid growth period and flower buds were formed in the axils of each node ushering in the first peak of water demand accounting for approximately 25 of total water consumption from early july to the f period i e from the opening of the second female flower fruiting node to the thinning of the ovary hairs the growth of watermelon roots vines and leaves was very vigorous evaporation and transpiration were significant but because the growing period lasted for a relatively short time about a week water consumption was relatively minimal accounting for approximately 5 of total water consumption entering the e stage in mid july water consumption in this stage of our study accounted for 37 70 and 38 83 of the entire growing season in 2020 and 2021 respectively which was much higher than in other reproductive periods this is due to the high temperatures and solar radiation during this period resulting in a large influx of nutrients which promotes fruit development and rapid leaf growth consequently transpiration and evaporation are stronger and the cumulative value of water consumption is greater over a longer period at the beginning of august when the fruit was maturing the size of the fruit was fixed and no longer grew significantly during this period but the flesh changed color and the transformation and accumulation of metabolic substances in the fruit was significant followed by a cessation in the growth rate of all nutrient organs when the basal leaves gradually withered and fell off so that water consumption during this stage was relatively low below 35 mm accounting for approximately 10 of total water consumption in addition wd during the different growth stages led to a decrease in the intensity of overall water consumption by watermelon and the more water was consumed during each stage the more significant the effect of decreased water consumption was caused by wd this is consistent with the findings of zhao et al 2017 and cheng et al 2012 that water consumption during different growth stages decreases with increasing wd this may be since when the root system is under wd conditions the crop changes its distribution of photosynthetic products between the roots and the crown with the roots receiving more assimilated products and relatively favorable growth while crown growth is inhibited resulting in a reduction in leaf area meaning that the crop consumes less water through transpiration even at the same transpiration rate which in turn will result in a reduction in water demand boland et al 1993 furthermore deficit irrigation reduces inter tree evaporation from the crop chalmers and wilson 1978 4 3 effects of wd on watermelon nutritional quality a study by yesim and nedim 2003 showed that wd was able to increase the soluble solid and soluble sugar content of watermelon fruit in the field but had less effect on acidity in this study we found that different wd treatments had significant effects on the various nutritional quality indicators of watermelon deficit irrigation contributed to the enhancement of fruit soluble solid and vitamin c content especially during the water control stage of fruit development liu et al 2016 where the soluble solid and vitamin c contents of treatments sl sm vl and vm ranged from 11 58 to 11 78 and 7 50 8 08 mg 100 g 1 which were not significantly different compared with the ck the wds during the e and m stages except for treatment el showed significant increases in soluble solid and vitamin c contents compared with the ck ranging from 8 47 to 11 46 and 13 27 23 79 respectively similarly both the moderate wd treatment during the e stage and the wd during the m stage significantly increased the soluble protein content of the fruit while the soluble protein contents of the fruit under the wd treatment during the s and v stages were basically close to that of the ck this is consistent with the findings of liu et al 2014 for watermelon in greenhouses and contrary to the findings of cui et al 2009 and ma 2005 for pear pyrus spp and date phoenix dactylifera which may be related to crop type and climatic environment this study also found that moderate wd treatment during the e stage significantly increased the organic acid content of watermelon while wd during the remainder of the stage had no significant effect which is similar to the results of deng 2009 and yang et al 2007 s trials on citrus citrus spp and loquat eriobotrya japonica fruit where water stress increases the organic acid content of the fruit 4 4 effects of wd on watermelon yield and wue related studies have shown that crops are adaptive to a certain degree of water stress that wd does not always reduce yield and that moderate wd during the early stages is beneficial for increasing yields khanthavong et al 2021 turner 1990 our study of watermelon deficit irrigation found that fruit yield was highest under conditions of light wd during the s stage of watermelon which increased significantly by 5 23 5 38 compared with the ck this is similar to the results obtained in previous studies the watermelon yields of the other wd treatments were reduced by different degrees among which the effect of light wd on yield during the v and m stages was not significant while wd during the e stage el and em differed significantly from that of the ck with decreases ranging from 10 22 to 22 35 this is consistent with the findings of zheng et al 2009 in their experiment on deficit irrigation of small watermelons in greenhouses low level water treatment during the s stage stimulates root growth to a certain extent inhibits plant nutrient growth and facilitates plant growth following rehydration but the application of low level water treatment during the e stage is detrimental to yield in contrast wang et al 2007b concluded that the yield of light wd treatment during the fruit set expansion stage is significantly higher than that of the full irrigation treatment which may be related to crop variety climatic conditions and management practices the results of a related study deng et al 2020 showed that a light wd treatment could improve the wue of the crop in our study similar findings were obtained wd treatments with different deficit levels during different growth stages had a significant effect on the water productivity of watermelon with wd treatments during the s sl and sm and v vl and vm stages significantly increasing the wue of watermelon by 4 90 7 37 and 6 19 10 17 respectively compared with the ck the wue of all other treatments decreased compared with the ck with treatments el ml and mm showing a decrease of 0 47 3 82 but no significant difference between them otherwise while treatment em showed a significant decrease of 9 12 10 53 this is related mainly to the growth and development of watermelon stages and water demand characteristics the watermelon plant during the s stage is small and the fruit of the m stage has been established mainly for the transformation of sugars and the accumulation of other nutrients both of which stages have a relatively low water demand and consequently deficit irrigation has a relatively small impact on the yield however the fruit is the center of growth during the fruiting stage especially the e stage which is dominated by cell expansion and water demand increases dramatically while water stress leads to a reduction in cell expansion pressure and severe stress leads to hardening of the cell walls 5 conclusion experiments applying water deficit wd of different levels during the varying stages of watermelon growth showed that water consumption of the deficit irrigation treatment was significantly reduced compared with the control ck our results revealed that the growth and development were inhibited by wd during the middle of the whole reproductive period vine and expansion stages and biological indicators such as main vine length main vine thickness and fruit diameter were significantly reduced but the effect of deficit irrigation during the early part of the whole reproductive period was less significant besides we also confirmed that deficit irrigation had a significant effect on watermelon yield quality and water use efficiency wue with a light wd treatment during the s stage improving yield and wue while a deficit treatment during the m stage improved watermelon quality and yield and it was not significantly different from the ck in addition the comprehensive evaluation results for the coupled topsis gra model which considered the four attribute indicators of watermelon growth yield quality and efficiency indicated that watermelon subjected to a light wd treatment during the m stage achieved the best overall results therefore for open field watermelon cultivation with sub membrane drip irrigation in the hexi oasis farming region under water saving conditions if only yield is considered the irrigation mode employing light wd during the s stage should be chosen for optimal results and if both yield and quality are considered the irrigation mode employing light wd during the m stage is best chosen however our study investigated only the implementation of deficit irrigation during a single stage of oasis watermelon cultivation hence further research is needed to study the effects of watermelon yield and quality under compound and multistage wd alternative wd and the combined effects of water and fertilizers declaration of competing

9125,in the context of global warming drought is a crucial factor affecting agricultural production especially for the oasis farming areas of northwestern china where water resources are extremely scarce to reveal the response of watermelon water consumption wc yield quality and water use efficiency wue to water deficit wd and to determine the optimal mode of irrigation in the desert oasis areas of hexi we applied different wd treatments on a field oasis watermelon in 2020 and 2021 the experiments employed two gradients of light l and moderate m wd treatments during the seedling s vine v expansion e and maturity m stages except for flowering and fruiting f stage with full irrigation during the entire growth period as the control ck the results showed that the wc of oasis watermelon at each growth stage was in the order e v s m f in which wc by e stage accounted for 33 15 40 33 compared with the ck wd had an obvious effect on water saving and wd during the v or e stages inhibited the growth of vine leaves to a certain extent the sl treatment light wd during s stage had the highest yield and wue with significant increases of 5 23 5 38 and 7 10 7 37 p 0 05 respectively in the two years while the mm treatment moderate wd during the m stage resulted in the best overall nutritional quality of watermelon with soluble solids soluble sugars vitamin c and soluble protein contents increasing by 11 31 33 43 24 03 and 10 31 p 0 05 respectively however an integrated evaluation that coupled grey relation analysis gra with a technique for determining order preference by its similarity to an ideal solution topsis model considering growth yield quality and efficiency indicators concluded that the ml treatment light wd during the m stage achieved the highest comprehensive score followed by the sl treatment therefore it is recommended that the optimal deficit irrigation mode for oasis watermelon is the ml treatment which can balance water savings yields and quality improvements while the sl treatment can be considered as a backup mode this study provides theoretical and technical support for achieving efficient water saving cultivation and scale development of watermelon production in desert oasis areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords deficit irrigation sub membrane drip irrigation water consumption yield fruit quality oasis watermelon data availability

essential for human metabolism and have high nutritional and medicinal value ozmen et al 2015 qin and leskovar 2020 it is also a good product for quenching thirst in the summer heat and has the reputation of being the king of summer fruits kyriacou et al 2018 the volumes of watermelon produced and consumed in china are the highest in the world and the area cultivated has been stable at approximately 1 8 million hectares ha in recent years with not only a long history of cultivation but also a wide geographical distribution committee 2016 li et al 2018 the irrigated farming area of the hexi oasis in gansu province possesses abundant light and heat resources with a large day night temperature difference and a typical continental desert steppe climate zhang and lai 2003 and this unique geographical environment with its distinct locational advantages provide a high quality open air watermelon production base as of 2015 the area of watermelon and melon cultivation reached 0 22 million ha with a total output of 20 6 million tonnes t qi et al 2016 in recent years with the construction of the one belt and one road economic trading route and the strategy of rural revitalization watermelon and other special local cash crops have been promoted on a large scale because of their short planting cycles high yields and rapidly yielding benefits kirnak and dogan 2009 however as the scale of planting continues to expand the demand for irrigation continues to increase and the district itself is located in an arid region with a severe shortage of water resources limited rainfall and high evaporation intensity which all further intensify water utilization conflicts deng et al 2006 yavuz et al 2020 zheng et al 2013a moreover outdated irrigation methods and haphazard irrigation management practices have also resulted in an imbalance between nutritional and reproductive growth yielding the dilemma of poor watermelon quality and low yields over a large area chen et al 2013 reddy 2016 a lack of scientific based irrigation management limits the development of the local watermelon industry with serious consequences for economic and social benefits deficit irrigation during certain crop growth stages not only can save irrigation water but also can improve fruit quality while still maintaining high yields chai et al 2016 fereres and soriano 2007 forey et al 2016 currently this technique can be used to aid water conservation and efficient utilization by implementing different gradients of water regulation modes based on the water consumption wc characteristics of the crop stages which has been widely employed in the cultivation of potato solanum tuberosum li et al 2021 onion allium cepa l zheng et al 2013b pepper capsicum annuum yang et al 2018 and other crops in oasis areas with excellent yields and water saving results ruiz sanchez et al 2010 related studies of watermelon production have also been conducted for example pang 2005 established a water production function for watermelon under mulched furrow irrigation which concluded that the water sensitivity index for watermelon was maximum at the fruiting expansion stage followed by the expansion ripening stage and minimum at the sowing flowering stage but the yield of mild wd at the fruiting expansion stage was 3 81 higher than that of the control instead of being reduced wang 2007a found that moderate wd improved watermelon yield and wue in an arid zone and that fruit vitamin c and soluble solids content were increased in the wd treatment more recently scholars at home and abroad have studied the effects of regional varietal irrigation and cultivation method differences on watermelon deficit irrigation systems abdelkhalik et al 2019 suggested that adequate water supply should be used under sufficient irrigation conditions for seedless watermelon in the mediterranean region while in the case of insufficient irrigation deficit regulation can be applied at the fruit ripening stage yang et al 2017 showed that water use efficiency and quality were better for greenhouse watermelon grown in winter and spring with a total irrigation volume of 114 mm and allocations of 25 12 62 and 15 mm at seedling s vine v expansion e and maturity m stages in northwest china kuscu et al 2015 showed that water deficit caused a significant reduction of watermelon yield in their experiment of semi humid areas with the water deficit treatment during the whole reproductive period reducing yield by up to 31 compared with full water supply but saving 50 of water and having a higher content of soluble solids and total sugars the water stress trial results of mo et al 2016a on wild watermelon m20 and domesticated watermelon y34 showed that water stress inhibited the growth of both varieties but the rhizomes of m20 increased significantly compared with those of y34 and the leaf water status of m20 was higher yu et al 2012 on two main planting varieties of ningnongke 1 and sh204 in gravel mulched sand with wd indicated that under 10 water stress the trend of photosynthetic physiological characteristics of the two test materials was the same while under 5 water stress photosynthetic rate of ningnongke 1 showed a uniform decrease while transpiration rate and stomatal conductance decreased less than that of sh204 i e the former displayed a better adaptation ability liu 2015 concluded that the optimal drip irrigation frequency strategy for watermelon was one drip every 4 day during both the seedling and expansion stages and one drip every 2 and 6 day at the blossom and the ripening stage respectively compared to mulched border irrigation under mulched drip irrigation for watermelon saved about 67 7 of the water used increased yield by 30 7 and enhanced wue to about 0 9 while greatly improving the soil ecology xing et al 2003 and for intercropped watermelon under mulched drip irrigation saved 62 9 mm of water compared with traditional furrow irrigation increasing yield and water productivity by 14 9 and 40 39 respectively qiang et al 2015 saraiva et al 2017 conducted a deficit regulation experiment on watermelons of different ground cover types and concluded that under rice husk or white plastic film cover watermelons treated with sufficient water supply showed the highest yields and relatively good quality meanwhile yavuz et al 2020 and yang and he 2022 also researched water consumption laws and water saving and high yield irrigation systems for grafted watermelon which has expanded watermelon deficit regulation cultivation techniques in summary the above mentioned studies provide possible options for the development of deficit regulating cultivation techniques for watermelon cultivation using sub membrane drip irrigation in arid oases which can guide the development of the watermelon industry and the efficient utilization of regional water resources most previous studies on this topic have focused mainly on watermelon yields and wue by considering the effects of deficit regulating however comprehensive studies on the growth wc yield and quality characteristics of watermelon with sub membrane drip irrigation is still less concerned and the research on multi level integrated decision making of deficit irrigation modes based on coupling model is rarely reported meanwhile hydro meteorological situations in different areas may also affect the application of irrigation technique as such it is a long term task to continuously develop and improve the study of under mulched drip irrigation deficit regulating cultivation systems in arid oasis areas and the objectives of this study were as follows i to investigate the effects of under mulched drip irrigation deficit regulation on wc characteristics quality yield and wue of watermelon crops by comparing the results with those obtained under adequate irrigation conditions ii to evaluate the comprehensive nutritional quality of watermelon by using principal component analysis pca and iii based on an improved topsis model to establish a comprehensive evaluation model of watermelon growth thereby optimizing the best deficit irrigation mode for oasis watermelon production which aims to provide some technical support for the efficient cultivation of oasis watermelon in the arid regions of northwestern china in the study we hypothesized that there is a significant advantage to improving crop productivity and quality when deficit mulched drip irrigation technique is applied to watermelon cultivation in desert oasis region 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the study site our experiments were conducted between may and august of 2020 and 2021 at the joint teaching and research training base of gansu agricultural university 38 39 n 100 43 e

frost free period is 136 d the upper level of groundwater began below 20 m the soil at the test site is a light loam of medium fertility and the dry capacity and field capacity of the soil are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental design the variety of watermelon tested was xinong 8 the seeds were sown on april 30th and harvested on august 19th 2020 and on may 1st and august 15th 2021 the planting rate and planting densities were 2 0 kg ha 1 and 27 000 plants ha 1 respectively in north south rows with plots of melons climbing east west against each other at a spacing of 30 35 cm the test field was tilled deeply mechanically 20 30 cm one week before sowing with weeds and debris removed manually at the time of sowing 760 kg ha 1 of compound fertilizer was applied using a one time manual trenching method according to the local standard conditions with no subsequent fertilizer being applied each plot had an area of 16 8 m2 2 4 m 7 m and an effective area of 573 3 m2 the drip irrigation pipes were controlled using the plot branching method i e each plot was connected to a drip irrigation pipe with a gate valve and water meter accuracy 0 001 m3 at the entrance to the drip irrigation pipe to accurately measure the volume of irrigation of each treatment following the laying of the drip irrigation strips manually a film was placed over the top and a 60 cm wide film separated neighboring plots to prevent interference with the soil moisture infiltration distribution between plots the field experiment is shown in fig 2 according to the irrigation experiment specification sl 13 2015 and following the actual growth process of watermelon in local fields the entire growing season was divided into five stages seedling stage about 30 d denoted as s vine stage about 25 d denoted as v flowering and fruiting stage about 4 6 d denoted as f expansion stage 25 d denoted as e and maturity stage 12 d denoted as m the division of the growth stages and the effective rainfall for each stage in 2020 2021 are listed in table 2 as watermelon is a highly water consuming crop the wd levels were designed to avoid heavy wd as much as possible and to integrate the results of previous studies with the actual situation of the region by applying two gradients light l and moderate m deficit irrigation levels for each of the remaining periods except for the f stage yavuz et al 2021 yesim and nedim 2003 two irrigation levels were set based on soil moisture content smc light wd 60 70 field capacity fc and medium wd 50 60 fc according to relevant data watermelon is highly drought tolerant and grows best when the relative smc is in the range of 70 80 wu and wang 2008 so the appropriate irrigation level 70 80 fc was used as a control during the entire reproductive period with a total of nine treatments each replicated three times in a completely randomized design field management was the same single vine grooming for all treatments except for inconsistencies in the level of soil moisture regulation the water regulation schemes for different growth stages of watermelon are listed in table 2 the irrigation method employed was under mulched drip irrigation with two drip pipes 2 m spacing laid manually in each plot the drip head was a labyrinth flow channel with an internal diameter of 16 mm and the working pressure of the system was 0 1 mpa the spacing and average flow rate of the emitter were 300 mm and 2 0 l h 1 respectively with strong resistance to blockage the irrigation volume was controlled by a water meter at the pivot point the specific irrigation times and volumes are shown in fig 3 2 3 test items and calculation methods 2 3 1 meteorological data meteorological data were obtained from fully automated weather stations at the test site including temperature relative air humidity atmospheric pressure solar radiation intensity wind speed wind direction and rainfall amount total rainfall amounts were 176 and 102 5 mm during the

the start of treatment soil samples were taken from the 0 100 cm profile of the field layer by layer at 20 cm intervals using a soil auger as the root mass of watermelon is distributed mainly between 40 and 50 cm the average moisture content of the 0 60 cm soil layer was taken as the planned wet layer while the change in soil moisture within the 0 100 cm layer was used to calculate the crop water consumption smc was measured one time only before sowing and every 7 10 d during the following period with additional measurements following irrigation and before and after rainfall each time at a depth of 100 cm when the measured smc was lower than the lower limit of moisture content in the experimental design table 3 irrigation was applied immediately the equations for calculating soil mass

the m stage and were statistically analyzed with the average of three replicates taken as the actual fruit yield t ha 1 for each treatment while the fresh weights of individual fruit were also recorded 2 3 5 nutritional quality the nutritional quality indicators of the watermelons were measured within one week of harvesting the flesh was washed and cut lengthwise and then the central and marginal flesh was removed from the seeds and mixed and pulped for measurement the nutritional quality indicators were determined using a way 2s abbey refractometer shanghai chongfeng scientific

indicators with certain correlations and applies the idea of dimensionality reduction to transform multiple indicators into several composite indicators with less loss of information ben et al 2016 pca was used to make a comprehensive evaluation of the nutritional quality of watermelon under deficit irrigation conditions and the specific steps were referred to liu et al 2018 2 5 gra topsis comprehensive evaluation method to carry out a rational comprehensive evaluation the component factors were first classified to establish a progressive hierarchical structure for the system and then the relationships between those system factors were analyzed 2 5 1 determination of weights 1 hierarchical analysis the evaluation system was constructed based on the analytic hierarchy process ahp albayrak and erensal 2004 to determine the subjective weights sw the importance of the component factors was determined by comparing the scores for the various component indicators with each other using the expert survey method and the judgment matrix was constructed using 1 9 and the reciprocal as the scoring value according to their importance satisfaction the consistency index ci was then calculated and the corresponding average random consistency index ri was found the consistency ratio cr was obtained from the ratio of ci to ri if cr 0 1 the consistency of the judgment matrix was considered acceptable otherwise it needed to be revised finally the weight vector of the component indicators was calculated from the consistency matrix 2 correlation of indicator importance based on the method of criteria importance though intercriteria correlation critic diakoulaki et al 1995 the objective weights ow of the factors indicators were determined the amount of information c j contained in the factor is obtained by considering the strength of the comparison between the schemes treatments in which the factor was located and the conflicting nature of the factor the greater the amount of information the more important the factor was i e the greater the corresponding weight the specific formula for calculating the amount of information and weight is as follows 5 c j δ j i 1 n 1 r i j 6 θ j c j j 1 m c j where c j denotes the amount of information contained in the j th evaluation factor θ j denotes the normalized weight of the j th factor δ j is the standard deviation

based on the combination weights method of gt shan et al 2012 the comprehensive weights cw of the evaluation factor were determined to avoid the subjective preferences of decision makers and to reflect the weight of objective data contribution to decision making which improves the scientific weighting of the evaluation factors and the reliability of evaluation conclusions in this paper the weight set was constructed based on two kinds of assignments subjective ahp and objective critic the methodology is as follows the set of basis weight vectors w k w k1 w k2 w kn k 1 2 l was constructed by assigning weights to each of the indicators with l different assignment methods and any linear combination of these l different vectors was notated as 7 w k 1 l α k w k t α 0 k 1 l α k 1 where w is one possible weight vector for the set of weights and α k is a linear combining coefficient the gt method was applied to optimize the l linear combining coefficients with the aim of minimizing the deviation of w from the individual w i e the objective function is 8 min k 1 l α k w k t w j 2 j 1 2 l the optimal first order derivative condition of eq 8 can be converted into a

distance the original data matrix of m evaluation indicators and n evaluation objects was set as x x ij m n matrix x was normalized to obtain z 12 z z i j m n where z i j x i j i 1 n x i j 2 the maximum value z was defined as z 1 z 2 z m and the minimum value z was defined as z 1 z 2 z m the weighted euclidean distance of the i th i 1 2 n evaluation object from the positive ideal solution z j and the weighted euclidean distance of the negative ideal solution z j are d i and d i respectively 13 d i j 1 m w j z j z i j 2 the score of the i th evaluation object was calculated as s i and the normalized composite score was s i 14 s i d i d i d i 15 s i s i i 1 n s i 2 gra method for determining grey relation degree the grey relation degree of each moisture treatment was calculated based on the grey system theory zhao et al 2020 the grey relation coefficient matrix r of each indicator of the weighting matrix z with the reference series positive or negative ideal solution set was calculated according to eq 18 16 r i j min n min m z 0 j z i j ρ max n max m z 0 j z i j z 0 j z i j ρ max n max m z 0 j z i j 17 r r 11 r 12 r 1 m r 21 r 22 r 2 m r n 1 r n 2 r n m where ρ denotes the resolution factor and denotes or i e the grey relation coefficient matrix with the positive ideal solution set or the grey relation coefficient matrix with the negative ideal solution set the grey correlation degrees of the i th treatment in the matrix z with the positive and negative ideal solution sets were further obtained as r i and r i 18 r i 1 m j 1 m r i j i 1 2 n the euclidean distances

2017b mathworks corp natick ma usa were used for building the evaluation system and parsing model 3 results 3 1 biological characteristics of watermelon under wd from table 3 it can be seen that different wd treatments at different growth stages had different effects on the various growth indicators of watermelon compared with the ck the main vine length was reduced by different degrees in all treatments except sl of which el and em had a significant effect on main vine length p 0 05 while the remaining wd treatments did not have a significant effect on main vine length p 0 05 in 2020 and 2021 the main vine lengths of the ck were 159 59 and 169 87 cm respectively while those of el were 148 53 and 150 27 cm respectively with reductions of 6 93 and 7 52 respectively and those of em were 139 33 and 150 27 cm respectively with reduction of 12 70 and 11 54 respectively in 2020 and 2021 the main vine thicknesses of sl increased compared with those of the ck but the difference was not significant while the rest of the treatments showed different reductions of which the main vine thicknesses of sm el ml and mm were not significantly p 0 05 different from that of the ck the differences in main vine thickness compared with that of the ck were not significant for sm el ml or mm while vl vm and em decreased significantly p 0 05 by 7 21 11 81 in 2020 and 7 55 11 78 in 2021 the trend in leaf area index lai was the same as that for main vine length with sl having the largest lai 1 02 in 2020 and 1 03 in 2021 followed by the ck ml and mm with vm showing the greatest reductions by 7 00 and 6 93 p 0 05 respectively this indicated that wd has a greater effect on the main vine and lai of watermelon during v and e stages than during other reproductive periods and the extent of the effect increases with the magnitude of the regulation deficit wd had different effects on the cross and longitudinal diameters of watermelon fruits with sl having the largest fruit diameter with an increase of 5 12 5 55 in cross diameter and 4 57 4 65 in longitudinal diameter compared with the ck p 0 05 while sm and ml showed slight reductions of which none were significant p 0 05 the em was the smallest with a decrease of 3 24 3 28 and 3 24 p 0 05 in cross and longitudinal diameter respectively followed by el and mm both of which reached significant levels of difference this indicated that wd during the e period is detrimental to fruit growth 3 2 water consumption characteristics of watermelon under wd fig 5 shows the water consumption wc of watermelon at each growth stage for the different wd treatments in 2020 and 2021 as can be seen from fig 5 the wc of watermelon in all treatments ranged from 280 50 to 323 23 mm and 290 35 331 41 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively with significant water savings arising from deficit irrigation compared with full irrigation p 0 05 the degrees of water saving in 2020 and 2021 ranged from 0 86 to 13 21 and 0 58 12 39 respectively with wc in the order e v s f m for each growth stage of watermelon under different treatments the wc of the s stage accounted for approximately 15 of the total wc of the whole reproductive period the v stage accounted for approximately 25 the f stage accounted for approximately 5 and the m stage accounted for approximately 10 while the wc of the e stage accounted for 40 of the wc of the whole reproductive period higher than those of other four growth stages this was probably because this stage is a critical period for watermelon reproductive growth with conditions of high temperatures and long hours of sunshine hours which promote fruit expansion and rapid leaf growth resulting in stronger evapotranspiration and higher cumulative water consumption in addition the effects of different stages of wd gradient on wc of watermelon were different in which water consumption decreased with increasing levels of wd during the same period such as the wc of sm was significantly lower than that of sl by 6 63 and 6 77 p 0 05 respectively while the magnitude of the effect of the same level of wd on water consumption differed during different periods with those of sl significantly decreasing by 6 56 and 6 45 p 0 05 respectively compared with the ck while those of el decreased by 15 48 and 23 75 respectively 3 3 yield and wue of watermelon under wd fig 6 shows the yield and wue of watermelon under different deficit irrigation conditions in 2020 and 2021 as can be seen from fig 6 there was not a simple linear relationship between watermelon wc and yield the ck with the highest wc did not have the highest yield and the sl treatment in 2a increased watermelon yield significantly p 0 05 compared with the ck while sm only decreased by 2 27 and 2 77 respectively but the differences were not significant p 0 05 this period is the initial stage of the growth of watermelon vine leaves and other plant organs involved with nutrition mainly to accumulate more water for bud differentiation while the slower development of the effects of wd can promote the root system to lay the foundation for later growth to a certain extent by comparing the watermelon yield of the ck with those of the vl and vm treatments in both years we found that the wd applied during the v stage of watermelon did not have a significant effect on yield p 0 05 which was a critical stage of nutrient organ growth in watermelon and this wd significantly inhibited vine leaf growth and favored the formation of the fruit later after the watermelon yield of the ck with those of the el and em treatments were compared it was found that the yield was significantly lower p 0 05 than that of the ck treatment during the e period with the yield of the el and em treatments being 11 29 and 22 35 lower respectively than that of the ck in 2020 and 10 22 and 20 97 lower respectively in 2021 lower this is due to the removal of the main vine growth point commonly known as topping at the beginning of the e period following which the lai reaches its maximum and growth stops water consumption is mainly for fruit growth and development but wd at this stage has a significant impact on the elongation of watermelon fruit cells which directly impacts the economic yield of watermelon by the m stage the watermelon fruit size was largely stable due mainly to the transformation of flesh color and the synthesis and accumulation of associated nutrients although wd reduced watermelon yield to some extent all differences were non significant compared to that of the ck except for the 2021 mm treatment which may be caused by wd reducing the water content of the fruit during this period by comparing the watermelon wue data shown in fig 6 the wue values for the ck in 2020 and 2021 were 0 390 and 0 381 t ha 1 mm 1 respectively while the wue values were greatest for sl and vm both no less than 0 410 t ha 1 mm 1 followed by those of sm and vl with the smallest wue for the em treatment both at 0 35 t ha 1 mm 1 for 2a the wue values of both the sm and vl treatments were at higher levels a comparison of watermelon yield and wue showed that both yield and wue were lower for wd during the e period therefore wd treatments should not be applied during this period and adequate irrigation should be maintained instead however the best time to apply deficit irrigation is during the s stage which obtains relatively high watermelon yield and wue 3 4 nutritional quality characteristics of watermelon under wd the effects of under membrane drip irrigation deficit on the nutritional quality indicators of watermelon are listed in table 4 the results of the trials in both years showed that wd during the s and v stages had no significant impact p 0 05 on soluble solid and soluble sugar content but wd during the e and m stages significantly increased soluble solid content p 0 05 with the mm treatment having the highest soluble solid and soluble sugar contents with increases of 11 15 and 33 41 in 2020 and 11 46 and 33 45 in 2021 respectively compared with the ck wd significantly increased organic acid content during the e period in 2020 and 2021 by 15 79 16 67 and 21 05 27 78 p 0 05 respectively and the remaining treatments were at the same levels as the ck the results for vitamin c and soluble protein content of 2a fruit in response to different water treatments were generally consistent with the trend for soluble matter i e watermelon fruiting stages e and m stages both had significantly increased contents of both vitamin c and soluble protein in conclusion the appropriate wd treatments during different stages of watermelon can affect the nutritional quality of the fruit deficit irrigation increased mainly the soluble solid soluble sugar and soluble protein content of the fruit indicating that deficit irrigation treatments can improve watermelon quality specifically wd treatment during the m stage significantly p 0 05 increased the content of all nutritional quality indicators except organic acid resulting in sweeter tasting flesh hence deficit irrigation treatment during the m stage had a positive effect on watermelon quality with mm having the best effect followed by ml 3 5 comprehensive nutritional quality of watermelon evaluated by pca to make a reasonable and reliable evaluation of the nutritional quality of watermelon we used the above mentioned soluble solid soluble sugar organic acid vitamin c and soluble protein which represent nutritional attributes as reference indicators to evaluate the overall nutritional quality of deficit irrigation watermelon by pca the cumulative variance contribution of the first and second principal components exceeded 90 fig 7 indicating that the first two principal components reflected all the information of the nutritional quality indicators the principal component functions were constructed as follows 25 y1 0 475x1 0 474x2 0 471x3 0 453x4 0 352x5 26 y2 0 032x1 0 082x2 0 153x3 0 416x4 0 892x5 30 y 0 884y1 0 116y2 where y1 and y2 are the first and second principal component scores y is the composite score and x1 x2 x3 x4 and x5 are the standardized values for soluble solid soluble sugar vitamin c organic acid and soluble protein content respectively in terms of the principal component function soluble solid soluble sugar vitamin c and organic acid had higher weights than soluble protein in y1 and soluble protein had the highest weight in y2 we concluded that both y1 and y2 represent information about the changes in nutritional quality as shown in fig 7 the highest overall evaluation index of nutritional quality was found for the mm treatment followed by that for the ml treatment which indicates that deficit irrigation during the m stage of watermelon can improve the overall nutritional quality of the fruit 3 6 comprehensive evaluation of watermelon growth based on improved topsis 3 6 1 correlation analysis of single indicator table 5 shows the averages of the measured results of each treatment component indicator for the two growing seasons to establish a reasonable evaluation system we carried out a simple correlation analysis of watermelon indicators fig 8 the results showed that main vine length was significantly and positively correlated with lai highly significantly and positively correlated with vine thickness fruit diameter fresh weight per fruit total yield and wue and highly and negatively correlated with organic acid main vine thickness was significantly and positively correlated with lai fresh weight per fruit and total yield lai was significantly and positively correlated with fresh weight per fruit and total yield the cross diameter was significantly and positively correlated with longitudinal diameter fresh weight per fruit total yield and wue and highly and negatively correlated with soluble solid total yield and wue it was significantly positively correlated with longitudinal diameter fresh weight per fruit total yield and wue and negatively correlated with soluble solid soluble sugar and vitamin c total yield was significantly and positively correlated with wue and negatively correlated with soluble solid and soluble sugar soluble solid was significantly and positively correlated with soluble sugar vitamin c organic acid and soluble protein and negatively correlated with wue this suggests that there is some overlap between the information provided by the single indicators of watermelon but that each indicator is irreplaceable in reflecting the overall growth of watermelon to this end a multi level comprehensive evaluation system comprising a target level a criterion level and an indicator level was constructed by dividing the watermelon growth indicators yield indicators quality indicators and efficiency indicators into four broad categories considering economic ecological and resource utilization aspects the specific stepwise hierarchy is shown in fig 9 3 6 2 determination of indicator weights the results for the sw determined based on the ahp method are listed in table 6 the maximum eigenvalue was λ max and the maximum weights of the primary indicators of watermelon were the yield indicators 0 324 followed by the growth and quality indicators and the smallest weight of the efficiency indicator was only 0 171 the maximum weight of the secondary indicators was the total yield c3 which was 0 216 followed by the wue c13 the lowest vitamin c was only 0 016 the results for the ow based on critic are shown in table 7 in which soluble solid c8 was given the greatest weight 0 104 followed by soluble protein c12 0 102 the cws of the watermelon indicators were determined by the gt combination weighting method and are listed in table 7 total yield c6 had the highest cw of 0 180 followed by wue c13 0 152 and soluble sugar content 0 098 and main vine length c1 was the smallest at 0 028 3 6 3 comprehensive evaluation of watermelon growth first the euclidean distances d i and d i were calculated for each wd treatment based on topsis as d i 0 124 0 128 0 122 0 124 0 119 0 063 0 026 0 125 and d i 0 040 0 040 0 044 0 041 0 050 0 091 0 131 0 023 0 131 0 023 second the grey relation degrees r i and r i for each wd treatment were determined based on gra as r i 0 471 0 458 0 483 0 478 0 494 0 514 0 554 0 485 and r i 0 686 0 687 0 688 0 687 0 692 0 616 0 597 0 597 on this basis topsis was coupled with a grey relation scheme to construct a composite closeness by weighting h i 0 261 0 255 0 276 0 265 0 294 0 405 0 518 and h i 0 366 0 371 0 363 0 365 0 358 0 253 table 8 are the comprehensive evaluation scores and the ranking results of each treatment in 2020 and 2021 according to the normalized scores the score rankings of the gra topsis and the topsis method were generally consistent from best to worst ml sl ck vl sm vm mm el em also the evaluation results were in line with the objective reality of the experiment meanwhile the spearman correlation coefficient of 0 9 p 0 01 indicated that the degree of correlation between the two evaluation methods was very high confirming that the gra topsis method is feasible and simple to understand in the comprehensive evaluation of water saving irrigation benefits for watermelon thus the best deficit irrigation mode for watermelon under sub membrane drip irrigation in the hexi oasis was treatment ml i e a light 60 70 fc wd during the m stage while if only yield was considered the sl treatment could be used as an alternative mode i e a light 60 70 fc wd during the s stage 4 discussion 4 1 effects of wd on watermelon growth indicators watermelon has a high yield high economic value and is the main fruit consumed by people in summer however due to its high levels of water consumption mo et al 2016b rashidi and gholami 2008 its water demand characteristics are different during different growth stages in different regions so it is important to explore these growth effects and water consumption characteristics deficit irrigation is used to control the root growth of plants through soil water management thus manipulating the growth of the above ground parts to achieve stable yields water conservation and quality regulation akbarzadeh et al 2022 wang et al 2020b the deficit mulched drip irrigation technique has a significant effect on watermelon growth liu et al 2014 in this study we found that water deficit wd during the vine v and expansion e stages significantly reduced watermelon main vine length main vine thickness and leaf area index lai while wd during the seedling s and maturity m stages were not significant i e the effect of wd during the middle of the entire growth period was significantly greater than those in the early and late stages this is in agreement with the findings of abdelkhalik et al 2019 on water regulation in seedless watermelons this is because in the early stages the plants are small and the temperature is low so the intensity of water demand is also low and the crop is affected by wd at a slower rate of development while during the m stage stem and leaf growth stagnates and wd has a greater impact on fruit quality yet during the middle stage of crop growth watermelon is in a critical period of nutrient reproduction and requires a lot of water so wd inhibits the normal growth and is detrimental to fruit formation 4 2 effects of wd on watermelon water consumption water consumption during each growth stage of crop growth can indicate its water requirements and can also reflect the water sensitivity of the crop during each period thus indicating the critical and peak water requirements of the crop wang et al 2020a in this study the water consumption of watermelon during the five reproductive periods of its growth cycle was found to be in the order e v s m f flowering and fruiting stage this is because the water demand pattern of the crop was affected mainly by growth characteristics meteorology and agricultural management practices but also followed the corresponding habit and volume patterns in the hexi oasis irrigation area during the watermelon s stage the temperature was relatively low and light intensity was weak while the initial growth of leaves flower bud differentiation and rapid root expansion occurred mainly during this stage evapotranspiration was relatively low the duration of this stage was relatively long approximately 25 d and water consumption was relatively moderate accounting for approximately 15 of total water consumption during the entire reproductive period at the end of may and the beginning of june when the v stage began the temperature rose gradually the above ground vine started to grow prostrate and the internodes elongated while the leaves also entered a rapid growth period and flower buds were formed in the axils of each node ushering in the first peak of water demand accounting for approximately 25 of total water consumption from early july to the f period i e from the opening of the second female flower fruiting node to the thinning of the ovary hairs the growth of watermelon roots vines and leaves was very vigorous evaporation and transpiration were significant but because the growing period lasted for a relatively short time about a week water consumption was relatively minimal accounting for approximately 5 of total water consumption entering the e stage in mid july water consumption in this stage of our study accounted for 37 70 and 38 83 of the entire growing season in 2020 and 2021 respectively which was much higher than in other reproductive periods this is due to the high temperatures and solar radiation during this period resulting in a large influx of nutrients which promotes fruit development and rapid leaf growth consequently transpiration and evaporation are stronger and the cumulative value of water consumption is greater over a longer period at the beginning of august when the fruit was maturing the size of the fruit was fixed and no longer grew significantly during this period but the flesh changed color and the transformation and accumulation of metabolic substances in the fruit was significant followed by a cessation in the growth rate of all nutrient organs when the basal leaves gradually withered and fell off so that water consumption during this stage was relatively low below 35 mm accounting for approximately 10 of total water consumption in addition wd during the different growth stages led to a decrease in the intensity of overall water consumption by watermelon and the more water was consumed during each stage the more significant the effect of decreased water consumption was caused by wd this is consistent with the findings of zhao et al 2017 and cheng et al 2012 that water consumption during different growth stages decreases with increasing wd this may be since when the root system is under wd conditions the crop changes its distribution of photosynthetic products between the roots and the crown with the roots receiving more assimilated products and relatively favorable growth while crown growth is inhibited resulting in a reduction in leaf area meaning that the crop consumes less water through transpiration even at the same transpiration rate which in turn will result in a reduction in water demand boland et al 1993 furthermore deficit irrigation reduces inter tree evaporation from the crop chalmers and wilson 1978 4 3 effects of wd on watermelon nutritional quality a study by yesim and nedim 2003 showed that wd was able to increase the soluble solid and soluble sugar content of watermelon fruit in the field but had less effect on acidity in this study we found that different wd treatments had significant effects on the various nutritional quality indicators of watermelon deficit irrigation contributed to the enhancement of fruit soluble solid and vitamin c content especially during the water control stage of fruit development liu et al 2016 where the soluble solid and vitamin c contents of treatments sl sm vl and vm ranged from 11 58 to 11 78 and 7 50 8 08 mg 100 g 1 which were not significantly different compared with the ck the wds during the e and m stages except for treatment el showed significant increases in soluble solid and vitamin c contents compared with the ck ranging from 8 47 to 11 46 and 13 27 23 79 respectively similarly both the moderate wd treatment during the e stage and the wd during the m stage significantly increased the soluble protein content of the fruit while the soluble protein contents of the fruit under the wd treatment during the s and v stages were basically close to that of the ck this is consistent with the findings of liu et al 2014 for watermelon in greenhouses and contrary to the findings of cui et al 2009 and ma 2005 for pear pyrus spp and date phoenix dactylifera which may be related to crop type and climatic environment this study also found that moderate wd treatment during the e stage significantly increased the organic acid content of watermelon while wd during the remainder of the stage had no significant effect which is similar to the results of deng 2009 and yang et al 2007 s trials on citrus citrus spp and loquat eriobotrya japonica fruit where water stress increases the organic acid content of the fruit 4 4 effects of wd on watermelon yield and wue related studies have shown that crops are adaptive to a certain degree of water stress that wd does not always reduce yield and that moderate wd during the early stages is beneficial for increasing yields khanthavong et al 2021 turner 1990 our study of watermelon deficit irrigation found that fruit yield was highest under conditions of light wd during the s stage of watermelon which increased significantly by 5 23 5 38 compared with the ck this is similar to the results obtained in previous studies the watermelon yields of the other wd treatments were reduced by different degrees among which the effect of light wd on yield during the v and m stages was not significant while wd during the e stage el and em differed significantly from that of the ck with decreases ranging from 10 22 to 22 35 this is consistent with the findings of zheng et al 2009 in their experiment on deficit irrigation of small watermelons in greenhouses low level water treatment during the s stage stimulates root growth to a certain extent inhibits plant nutrient growth and facilitates plant growth following rehydration but the application of low level water treatment during the e stage is detrimental to yield in contrast wang et al 2007b concluded that the yield of light wd treatment during the fruit set expansion stage is significantly higher than that of the full irrigation treatment which may be related to crop variety climatic conditions and management practices the results of a related study deng et al 2020 showed that a light wd treatment could improve the wue of the crop in our study similar findings were obtained wd treatments with different deficit levels during different growth stages had a significant effect on the water productivity of watermelon with wd treatments during the s sl and sm and v vl and vm stages significantly increasing the wue of watermelon by 4 90 7 37 and 6 19 10 17 respectively compared with the ck the wue of all other treatments decreased compared with the ck with treatments el ml and mm showing a decrease of 0 47 3 82 but no significant difference between them otherwise while treatment em showed a significant decrease of 9 12 10 53 this is related mainly to the growth and development of watermelon stages and water demand characteristics the watermelon plant during the s stage is small and the fruit of the m stage has been established mainly for the transformation of sugars and the accumulation of other nutrients both of which stages have a relatively low water demand and consequently deficit irrigation has a relatively small impact on the yield however the fruit is the center of growth during the fruiting stage especially the e stage which is dominated by cell expansion and water demand increases dramatically while water stress leads to a reduction in cell expansion pressure and severe stress leads to hardening of the cell walls 5 conclusion experiments applying water deficit wd of different levels during the varying stages of watermelon growth showed that water consumption of the deficit irrigation treatment was significantly reduced compared with the control ck our results revealed that the growth and development were inhibited by wd during the middle of the whole reproductive period vine and expansion stages and biological indicators such as main vine length main vine thickness and fruit diameter were significantly reduced but the effect of deficit irrigation during the early part of the whole reproductive period was less significant besides we also confirmed that deficit irrigation had a significant effect on watermelon yield quality and water use efficiency wue with a light wd treatment during the s stage improving yield and wue while a deficit treatment during the m stage improved watermelon quality and yield and it was not significantly different from the ck in addition the comprehensive evaluation results for the coupled topsis gra model which considered the four attribute indicators of watermelon growth yield quality and efficiency indicated that watermelon subjected to a light wd treatment during the m stage achieved the best overall results therefore for open field watermelon cultivation with sub membrane drip irrigation in the hexi oasis farming region under water saving conditions if only yield is considered the irrigation mode employing light wd during the s stage should be chosen for optimal results and if both yield and quality are considered the irrigation mode employing light wd during the m stage is best chosen however our study investigated only the implementation of deficit irrigation during a single stage of oasis watermelon cultivation hence further research is needed to study the effects of watermelon yield and quality under compound and multistage wd alternative wd and the combined effects of water and fertilizers declaration of competing

9126,water shortage and soil salinization are the key limiting factors in agricultural production of arid and semi arid regions located in western inner mongolia of china the hetao irrigation district hid is one of the top three largest irrigation districts in china irrigation water overuse and high level of soil salinity have curbed the agricultural productivity adversely affected farmers revenues and threatened long term sustainability of irrigated farming in the hid nevertheless opportunities still exist to improve the situation irrigation water allocation salt accumulation and leaching crop productivity and farming decisions are intrinsically connected and thus require taking a holistic approach to investigate into the interactions among all those factors and devise appropriate technological management and policy interventions towards this goal we develop an integrated hydro agro economic optimization model to reconcile agricultural net revenue irrigation practices and environmental sustainability in the hid positive mathematical programming is used for model calibration to ensure the model can replicate the base year observations of crop acreage making the model suitable for evaluating alternative scenarios scenario analyses are conducted to analyze the effects of water supply reduction reducing winter irrigation water saving irrigation and crop commodity price change on optimal agricultural water management practices results show that water supply reduction without complementary measures increases land fallow exacerbates soil salinization and reduces net benefits winter irrigation can conserve soil moisture and increase the net salt leaching in the root zone and a reduction in winter irrigation will incur a benefit loss to the hid water saving irrigation can stabilize planting areas under water shortage but exacerbate soil salinization price increase of a cash crop if it has a large area share tends to crowd out grain crops growing in the

et al 2018 godfray et al 2010 irrigation is especially indispensable for agricultural production in arid and semi arid environment where deficiencies in rainfall require irrigation to enable and stabilize agricultural production many well managed irrigation systems in arid and semi arid regions exemplify that irrigation can enhance both agricultural productivity and profitability boost regional economy and contribute to sustainable prosperity rosegrant et al 2009 nevertheless irrigated agriculture in arid and semi arid environment often face major challenges that potentially endanger its profitability and sustainability zhu et al 2019 among them water shortage and soil salinization are the main limiting factors for irrigated agricultural production in semi arid and arid regions hammecker et al 2012 x li et al 2020a xue et al 2018 water scarcity is a basic fact in arid environment where human habitation and economic activities demand for water sometimes at the cost of local ecosystems gorelick and zheng 2015 niu et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 however excessive irrigation may still happen due to improper management which may exacerbate soil salinization in arid climate scanlon et al 2006 without effective drainage salts introduced by irrigation water remain within crop root zone meanwhile irrigation deep percolation and canal leakage can raise groundwater table which driven by capillary rise cause shallow groundwater evapotranspiration that brings salt to the surface soil karimov et al 2014 xu et al 2010 xue et al 2020 yeh and famiglietti 2009 these two mechanisms can compound soil salinization rengasamy 2006 water shortage and irrigation salinization are found in irrigated agriculture of many arid and semi arid regions around the world such as the san joaquin valley of california schoups et al 2005 the nile delta in egypt kotb et al 2000 the yizre el valley in israel banin and fish 1995 the aral sea basin in central asia cai et al 2003 in china irrigated areas account for 49 cultivated land but produce more than 90 of cash crops and 75 of grain crops of the country kang et al 2017 located in arid and semi arid western inner mongolia the hetao irrigation district hid is a major grain and oil seed production region and one of the top three largest irrigation districts in china it is also the largest gravity fed irrigation district in asia the hid is facing complex and evolving challenges of water scarcity and soil salinization overuse of water for irrigation was rather common which raised groundwater table and consequently led to soil salinization because of groundwater evapotranspiration and inadequate drainage wen et al 2020 xue et al 2020 soil salinization has long been considered a major threat to crop productivity and agroecosystem sustainability in the region mao et al 2022 sun et al 2019 managing soil salinity at the end of crop growth period is especially important because soil salinity rises to high level at that time due to high evapotranspiration during the growing period x li et al 2020b to leach salts out of the root zone and increase soil moisture before planting crops winter irrigation is widely practiced in the hid which takes place from october to november when there is no crop in the field and it uses nearly 40 of annual irrigation water however the capacity of the drainage system in the hid is inadequate and therefore over irrigation poor drainage and intensive groundwater evapotranspiration collectively exacerbate soil salination in the hid most existing irrigation and soil salinization studies of the hid focused on field scale experiments and numerical simulations using process oriented models these include field experiments and hydrus 1d model simulations of vertical distribution of soil water salt li et al 2010 simulation of evapotranspiration and soil salinity under different groundwater table depths and irrigation schemes using the hydrus dualkc model ren et al 2018 groundwater and salt dynamics simulation using the saltmod model at well canal combined irrigated area mao et al 2017 just to list a few however these simulation models are for answering what if questions thus limiting the choices of management decision makings to only several pre specified alternative scenarios harou et al 2009 singh 2014 besides simulation models usually include more process details and thus require more data and computational resources optimization based scenario analysis can be used to narrow down the preferred scenarios selected for process based modeling to save time and data cost hydro economic optimization models are typically developed to understand the optimal economic beneﬁts from water allocation water infrastructure or policies an extensive literature survey on various applications of hydro economic modeling was given by harou et al 2009 zooming in on irrigated agricultural production studies marques et al 2005 developed a two stage economic production model to analyze the effects of irrigation water supply uncertainty and water prices on cropping patterns crop production and irrigation technology adoption also using two stage stochastic optimization zhu et al 2015 analytically derived necessary conditions for optimal water and land allocation among crops and for optimal water transfers and conjunctive use of surface and groundwater besides numerical solutions ward and pulido velazquez 2008 demonstrated that adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies does not guarantee reduced irrigation water uses with a basin scale hydro economic optimization model by linking the economic agricultural production model to a detailed groundwater model for the california s central valley medellín azuara et al 2015 and macewan et al 2017 analyzed economic costs of pumping replacement groundwater during drought for the central valley and the hydrological and economic impacts of alternative groundwater stabilization policies in the kings and tulare lake subbasins of california respectively relatively few hydro economic models considered salinity management to explore the economic and environmental consequences of various policy choices in the syr darya river basin of central asia where irrigation induced salinity is severe cai et al 2003 explicitly included root zone salt balance and effects of salinity on crop yields in a hydro agro economic model treating groundwater as a common property knapp and baerenklau 2006 developed a hydrologic economic model to analyze groundwater salinization caused by surface water imports and restricted drainage in irrigated agricultural regions and derived irrigation decision rules notably yao 2020 embedded a short term stochastic model which includes quadratic pmp production cost function into a long term dynamic programming model to develop optimal long term management decisions on perennial and annual crop acreages and conjunctive water use strategies for recovering groundwater storage and maximizing agricultural profit in a study area of the northern san joaquin valley california u s a so far there are relatively few existing studies that address the irrigation system improvement for the hid using water allocation and agricultural benefit optimization models for instance li et al 2020b developed a simulation optimization model at field level that simulates agro hydrological processes and optimizes irrigation water allocation considering uncertainties in crop prices maximum yields and irrigation water availability li et al 2020a set up a field scale irrigation drainage collaborative optimal allocation model to integrate the water salt balance physical processes into a genetic algorithm based optimization model to optimize irrigation and drainage simultaneously improving irrigation water use efficiency controlling soil salinity and maximizing farmland economic benefits in a maize field notably zhang et al 2021 developed a fuzzy multi objective dependent chance programming model that optimizes water allocation to maximize economic benefits and ensure food security considering soil water balance physical processes and the sensitivities of crop yield to water deficit for the entire hid however these model are normative mathematical programming models in the sense that they search for optimal solution driven by prescribed objective function but ignore the differences between model generated optimal solution and observations cai and wang 2006 howitt 1995 thus these normative programming models cannot replicate the input and output observations of a base year in its optimal solution and the model results may deviate significantly from observations if a normative programming model is tightly constrained to force model solution to be close to observations such as adding tight bounds to crop areas then the optimal solutions would be largely guided by constraints rather than the model objective in either case the capability of a normative model in predicting farmers behavior responses to external changes such as water supply adjustment or crop commodity price change is limited water and agricultural policy formulation for the hid and other similar irrigation districts requires a model that has the predictive power to investigate how farmers respond under different conditions there are several critical challenges confronted by the hid nowadays first the hid is required to reduce its annual water diversion from the yellow river due to water shortage in the basin people s government of bayannur municipality 2012 second the practice of winter irrigation is often questioned and sometimes regarded as a wasteful use of water third water saving irrigation is widely considered a solution for water scarcity but potential side effects are not well understood at the irrigation district level fourth the crop mix of the hid has undergone considerable changes over the past two decades it is important to understand the potential impacts of crop commodity market price changes on planting areas to answer these strategic management and policy questions requires an integrated model that represents water and salt balance decision making behaviors of the farmers and the interactions between the physical processes and human decisions moreover such a model needs to be calibrated to base year observations including land and water uses cropping patterns and agricultural production costs and revenues such that the model is supported by an empirical foundation and can provide structural information for policy response howitt 1995 towards this goal we develop an integrated hydro agro economic optimization model for the hid which maximizes net agricultural benefits while integrating irrigation water allocation water and salt balance in crop root zone effects of salinity stress on crop yields water saving investment and effectiveness and crop production costs and revenues into a coherent framework positive mathematical programming pmp approach howitt 1995 is used to calibrate the model such that it can replicate base year observations of input and output quantities making the model suitable for evaluating alternative management and policy scenarios the model robustness to uncertainties in salinity related parameters is verified through sensitivity analysis scenario analysis is conducted to answer each of the four above mentioned critical challenges that the hid are confronted with 2 description of the study area as a major grain and oil seed production region in china the hid spans over 250 km from west to east and 50 km from south to north in 2019 the actual irrigated area of hid reaches 576 thousand ha including 524 thousand ha 91 irrigated by surface water diverted from the yellow river the remaining 52 thousand ha 9 is well irrigated or well canal combined area from west to east the hid is divided into five sub irrigation districts namely wulanbuhe wlbh 47 2 thousand ha jiefangzha jfz 111 4 thousand ha yongji yj 102 2 thousand ha yichang yc 170 7 thousand ha and wulate wlt 77 5 thousand ha which are distributed largely in parallel from the upper to lower hid fig 1 this study is focused on the surface irrigation area of these five sub irrigation districts in the hid which diverts water from the yellow river and considers six main grain and cash crops i e summer crops of wheat melon and tomato and fall crops of maize sunflowers and cucurbit which collectively account for 97 of the gross crop areas in the surface irrigation area the average annual precipitation is 130 210 mm in the hid of which 70 concentrates in the three months from july to september annual potential evaporation ranges from 2 100 to 2 300 mm agricultural production depends almost entirely on irrigation diversion from the yellow river in the hid irrigated agriculture is the largest water user and accounts for 95 of the total diversion from yellow river in 2019 gross irrigation diversion from the yellow river was about 4 2 billion m3 in the hid other water diversions from the yellow river including domestic forestry and animal husbandry industrial and ecological water uses was 0 496 billion m3 thus making a total water diversion of about 4 7 billion m3 in 2019 water shortage and soil salinization are main limitation factors for irrigated agriculture production in the hid soil survey data show that 63 6 of irrigated area is saline in the hid with 45 5 in slightly saline area 16 0 in moderately saline area and 3 1 in heavily saline area d li et al 2020 a calendar year can be divided into four periods in the hid based on crop production and irrigation activities there is neither crop production nor irrigation in the december march period when the top soil is frozen thus this period is excluded from the model the remaining three periods are i the april june period when summer crops are grown and irrigated with yellow river water diversion the spring irrigation occurs in may for increasing soil water for fall crops ii the july september period when fall crops are irrigated and iii the october november period when the winter irrigation is conducted notably winter irrigation is applied after fall crops are harvested and it is for leaching salts out of crop root zone and for increasing soil water content for the summer crops to be planted in next april unique to the hid winter irrigation accounts for about 40 of the total annual diversion of hid from the yellow river the winter irrigation area accounts for about 77 of the irrigated area in the hid 3 data and methods 3 1 data the precipitation data used in this paper are from the linhe meteorological station in the hid the base year observations are taken from reports prepared by local governmental agencies bayannur bureau of statistics 2019 bayannur water conservancy bureau 2019 hetao irrigation district administration 2019 national bureau of statistics 2019 these base year data include cropping patterns of six main grain and cash crops irrigation water diversion from the yellow river irrigation quota irrigation water use efficiency groundwater table and salinity soil salinity crop yield and prices the adopted values of key parameters in the model are provided in table 1 and table 2 3 2 model structure and assumptions in this paper we develop a regional hydro agro economic optimization model that integrates water allocation across sub districts and crops root zone salt balance effects of soil salinity on crop yields and production costs and revenues into a holistic framework fig 2 shows the model structure based on irrigation and farming practices in the hid the following assumptions are made for necessary model simplification without compromising model fidelity 1 full irrigation is practiced based on crop specific irrigation quota 2 one harvest per year there is neither multiple planting nor interplanting 3 in the root zone salt is drained out through vertical water movement alone mao et al 2022 lateral movement of water and salt is negligible in the crop root zone because the soil is unsaturated most of the time ji et al 2007 salt discharge through irrigation runoff and crop absorption is negligible too x li et al 2020a wen et al 2017 4 fall crops do not benefit from winter irrigation of last october november because winter irrigation water stored in soil has already been evaporated before fall crops are planted spring irrigation augments soil moisture content for fall crops 5 soil salinity which adversely affects crop productivity is estimated with salt balance in a homogenous 1 meter root zone this assumption is necessary given that the hydro agro economic model is spatially aggregated at the sub irrigation district level and does not consider soil texture shallow groundwater depth irrigation drainage infrastructure and so forth in a spatially explicit manner 3 3 hydro agro economic

respectively snir ki and fnir ki are net irrigation requirements i e in situ observed net irrigation quota for summer and fall crops respectively assuming winter irrigation and spring irrigation practices are retained the purpose of winter irrigation and spring irrigation is to increase soil moisture content before crops are planted in the next season if the quota of winter or spring irrigation is reduced as in the scenario analysis of this paper there will be less moisture retained in root zone soil when crops are planted in the next season and as such the original irrigation quota for summer and fall crops become inadequate in meeting crop irrigation requirements and the net crop irrigation requirements in the next season i e the irrigation quota need to increase by the amount of reduced soil water retained from winter or spring irrigation this makes the value of δ in eqs 3 and 4 to increase from zero in baseline condition besides spring irrigation i e k s i w k s i

infrastructures to improve irrigation water use efficiency in the hid include canal lining and high efficiency field water saving irrigation technologies such as pipe irrigation sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation canal lining accounts for 88 of the total water saving irrigation area in hid the close interlacing of the seven levels of water saving irrigation drainage infrastructure system was constructed as a dense network to ensure irrigation water deliveries to irrigated farmland in hid we define the irrigation water use efficiency for crop i in the k th sub irrigation district wue ki as ratio of the amount of beneficial irrigation water use in the field which includes irrigation deep percolation that is critical for salt leaching to total irrigation water withdrawal at the sub irrigation district level the value of irrigation water use efficiency is calculated as field irrigation water use efficiency multiplied by the canal water conveyance efficiency e g water saving technology here refers to canal lining water saving infrastructures the in situ measurements of field irrigation water use efficiency and canal water conveyance efficiency were obtained from qu et al 2018 and bayannur water conservancy bureau 2019 the wue ki in the base year in the hid is given in table 3 and the average irrigation water use efficiency in the whole hid is 0 405 in the base year bayannur water conservancy bureau 2019 given the relatively low canal conveyance efficiency 0 51 0 55 and water saving potential analysis conducted for the hid future irrigation investment need to give priority to the main canal and the secondary canals qu et al 2018 water saving irrigation investment can improve irrigation water use efficiency wue reduce water consumption and alleviate water shortage in the hid the non linear empirical relationship between wue and annualized irrigation investment in the hid is estimated by qu et al 2018 7 a m i c a k i w u e k i k i 2 b k i w u e k i k i c r 1 r n 1 r n 1 where amic is the annualized irrigation investment k and i are the total numbers of sub irrigation districts and crop types respectively r is discount rate n is the service life span of water saving irrigation infrastructure and a b and c are empirical parameters estimated with historical statistical data 3 3 5 land availability total crop planting area in each sub irrigation district cannot exceed the available cultivated area in the sub irrigation district 8 i a ki ka k k where ka k is the available cultivated area for sub irrigation district k in ha for ensuring food security and stabilizing cropping patterns of grain crops and cash crops crop planting areas should not expand or shrink drastically therefore lower and upper limits of crop planting area are applied 9 λ min a ki base a ki λ max a ki base k i where a ki base is the observed crop planting area in the base year in ha and λ max and λ min are coefficients for applying the crop planting area limits in fact the upper and lower bounds used form a large range and they rarely constrain model solution 3 4 pmp calibration as above discussed most existing mathematical programming models of water management and agricultural production are uncalibrated normative models those models suffer from either unrealistic model solution or from being so tightly constrained for calibrating to observed behavior that they could not react to policy scenarios as such they are not suitable for policy analysis because models failed to be accurately calibrated are unlikely to be believed by policy makers cai and wang 2006 mérel and howitt 2014 by introducing nonlinearity in the objective function which reflects unobserved activity specific costs or benefits and is calibrated using shadow values of the calibration constraints pmp can replicate base year activity levels and resource allocation without artificial constraints while generating smooth responses to changes in the economic environment frahan et al 2007 garnache et al 2017 mérel and howitt 2014 with explicit technology representation pmp can be conveniently linked with biophysical models for policy analysis heckelei et al 2012 howitt et al 2012 medellín azuara et al 2012 the pmp cost functions in this model are calibrated using observed base year crop areas water uses production costs and crop revenues following the procedures in howitt 1995 and zhu et al 2015 we take 2019 as the base year because it represents the most recent situation and water use and crop production data in the hid are well documented for 2019 the pmp approach is applied to each of the five sub irrigation districts in the hid separately to estimate quadratic production cost functions using base year observations the calibration is conducted in three steps i the first step solves a linear programming model of farm profit maximization to derive the marginal values of land under calibration and resource constraints the calibration constraints are set to observed values of land use in the base year with all other production inputs normalized to land howitt et al 2012 ii the pmp calibration treats the least profitable crop among all crops modeled as the marginal crop and estimates its cost function slope using an empirical area supply elasticity and observed area and gross margin of this crop for the remaining crops their cost functions are estimated using marginal values of land adjusted by a factor that reflects the difference of marginal and average production cost of the marginal crop at its observed area howitt 1995 zhu et al 2015 the estimated pmp cost function is used to establish a non linear optimization model and iii solve the non linear optimization model to calibrate the decision variables e g crop areas to the base year observations as the pmp calibration use the observed crop yields which already reflect the effects of salt stress in the base year the calibration steps do not explicitly incorporate salt stress terms in fact the yield changes relative to the base year yield due to salt stress is one in the first term of the rhs of eq 1 for the base year itself therefore the pmp calibration is done first following the above described three steps and then the estimated pmp cost functions are incorporated into the benefit function described in eq 1 the calibrated cost function reflects the decision making behaviors of the farmers maneta and howitt 2014 medellín azuara et al 2012 2010 the detailed pmp calibration procedure can be found in previous studies howitt 1995 maneta and howitt 2014 marques et al 2005 medellín azuara et al 2012 2010 zhu et al 2015 quadratic function is typically used as a non linear pmp cost function marques et al 2005 medellín azuara et al 2012 nevertheless there are other non linear pmp cost functions such as exponential function that have been verified as effective alternatives howitt et al 2012 medellín azuara et al 2010 here we adopt the classical pmp quadratic cost function 10 c p k i α k i 0 5 γ k i a k i a k i where cp is the gross production cost α ki and γ ki are the intercept and slope of pmp cost function respectively with subscript k denoting sub irrigation district and i denoting crop the observed data used for the pmp cost function calibration include crop areas yields crop commodity prices land and water costs available land and water resources etc zhu et al 2015 the model is solved with the conopt solver in the general algebraic modeling systems gams arki consulting and development 2021 4 results and discussions 4 1 baseline model and sensitivity analysis the model is calibrated to the base year observations taking the pmp approach the effects of the salinity related parameters on model robustness including initial groundwater depth and salinity initial soil salinity in root zone and irrigation leaching coefficient are assessed through sensitivity analysis 4 1 1 baseline model calibration the pmp approach is applied to the hid considering i the hid is located in semi arid and arid climate with irrigation water diverted from the yellow river ii full irrigation is regularly practiced in the hid because irrigation water can be guaranteed in the upper reaches of the yellow river iii the irrigated farmland area per capita or per household is large in the hid and as such most of the produced crops are sold on the market rather than for own consumption therefore agricultural production and management decisions are directly affected by the prices of crop inputs on the market results indicate the optimal cropping patterns match the existing base year observations the percent differences between model solved and observed base year crop areas are within the range of 4 after taking into consideration of the crop relative yield reduction due to salinity stress in addition the baseline model fidelity is further supported by the following 1 the total groundwater evapotranspiration reported for the base year in the model is 546 million m3 over irrigated cropland in the hid which is equivalent to a water depth of 107 3 mm this is close to the estimated 138 9 mm of average annual groundwater evapotranspiration of irrigated land from 2006 to 2012 in the hid by yu et al 2016 the difference between the 138 9 mm averaged over 2006 2012 and the 107 3 mm estimated for 2019 is likely due to decline in groundwater table in recent years 2 the net drainage from the root zone is equal to the deep percolation of precipitation and irrigation minus the groundwater evapotranspiration the model estimates that net drainage out of the root zone in the wlt sub irrigation district is 54 3 mm which is consistent with the result of 48 5 mm using bromide tracer experiment from yang et al 2018 3 the net salt accumulation of the 1 meter depth root zone in the jfz sub irrigation district is estimated to be 31 73 thousand tons per year by the model which is largely consistent with the 56 05 thousand tons per year for 2007 2011 estimated by chang et al 2018 the difference is likely due to the soil salinity alleviation in irrigated arable land in the hid in recent years yu et al 2016 the salt concentration change in the root zone by sub irrigation district of hid in a hydrologic year ranges from 1 385 mg l in jfz to 155 mg l in wlbh or from 0 216 g kg to 0 025 g kg which is comparable to the 0 4 0 05 g kg in the maize field in the hid reported by li et al 2020a here salt concentration refers to milligrams of salts per little of water solution in soil 4 1 1 1 salt balance in the root zone due to the parallelly layout irrigation and drainage systems of sub irrigation districts in the hid see fig 1 the salt balance analysis is conducted separately in each sub irrigation district and results are shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows salt accumulates slightly in wlbh and jfz by 16 88 thousand tons and 31 72 thousand tons respectively over the one year period however significant amount of salt is leached out of crop root zone in yj yc and wlt by 223 67 thousand tons 544 06 thousand tons and 182 46 thousand tons respectively and the electrical conductivity of root zone saturation extract moderately decreases and soil salinization in the root zone are gradually alleviated fig 3a the yc sub irrigation district has the highest net salt leaching per unit area at 1 385 mg l 0 216 g kg the main reasons are i compared to wlbh jfz and yj higher leaching water salinity in yc causes more salt leaching and ii the groundwater table depth in yc 2 28 m is higher than that of wlt 2 00 m thus having less salt imported to root zone from groundwater evapotranspiration the net salt leaching in root zone in irrigated farmland is 901 59 thousand tons for the entire hid in the base year which is consistent with the previous conclusions that the salt in root zone of irrigated land can be continuously transported to non cultivated land salinized wasteland or leached into groundwater through deep percolation wang et al 2020 yu et al 2016 the results show that salt leaching by precipitation is not significant due to low precipitation in the hid see fig 3a salt balance in the root zone is controlled by i net salt leaching out of the root zone through excess irrigation which is affected by irrigation water salinity soil salinity and the drainage ability of root zone and ii salt import through groundwater evapotranspiration which is controlled by groundwater depth and salinity winter irrigation is more effective in leaching salt than crop growing period irrigation due to its higher irrigation percolation therefore to alleviate soil salinization in the hid we need to consider increasing net salt leaching through irrigation reducing salt import through groundwater evapotranspiration by regulating groundwater table such as through conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water for irrigation and lowering groundwater salinity through improving irrigation and drainage infrastructure 4 1 1 2 crop yield reduction under salt stress soil salinization can significantly reduce crop productivity in the hid zeng et al 2021 the crop relative yield y ki y max ki is the ratio between yield under salt stress to yield without any salt stress and its value ranges from 0 to 1 crop yield reduction due to salt stress is common in the hid spatially yield reduction due to salt stress becomes more serious from upper to lower sub irrigation districts among the six crops modeled wheat is the most salt resistent crop fig 3b in wlt the most downstream sub irrigation district along the main irrigation canal of the hid soil salinization is the severest and crop yield is reduced by 30 due to higher soil salinity intensive groundwater evapotranspiration poorer drainage infrastructure and relative lower topography fig 3b 4 1 1 3 agricultural net benefits fig 3b shows the net agricultural benefit in each sub irrigation district is mainly determined by total irrigated area but with exception the planting area in wlt is larger than that in wlbh but the net benefit is in the opposite the main reasons are i differences in cropping patterns of the two sub irrigation districts and ii significant crop yield reduction caused by higher soil salinity in wlt fig 3b therefore agriculture net benefit at the sub irrigation district level is determined by total irrigated area cropping pattern and yield reduction due to soil salinization to sum up the model can replicate the base year observations of crop areas in the hid representing water allocation and balance root zone salt balance salt stress induced yield reduction and production and revenue in a holistic optimization modeling framework thus the model is suitable for analyzing potential impacts of external factors such as changes in allowable water diversion from the yellow river and crop commodity prices besides management interventions such as reducing winter irrigation and investing in irrigation water saving among others 4 1 2 sensitivity analysis of salinity related parameters salinity related parameter values adopted in the model appear to be subject to considerable level of uncertainties because of the spatial aggregation nature of the model i e at sub irrigation district level and the spatial heterogeneity of these parameter values thus we select four parameters in the model including initial groundwater depth initial groundwater salinity initial root zone soil salinity and irrigation leaching coefficient of root zone for sensitivity analysis groundwater depth can regulate plant root water uptake and thus affect groundwater associated salinity ibrahimi et al 2014 rengasamy 2006 xu et al 2010 and influence crop yield and agricultural revenues groundwater depth is prevalently above 2 5 m in the hid see fig 1c and 82 of groundwater discharge in the hid is direct evaporation and plant root uptake xu et al 2010 thus groundwater depth and salinity can significantly affect the salt import into the root zone through groundwater evapotranspiration in the hid besides root zone soil salinity and leeching coefficient determine the net salt leaching ability of irrigation due to the data limitation we use average groundwater depth and soil salinity of each sub irrigation district and average groundwater salinity and leaching coefficient of the entire hid dou et al 2020 miao et al 2016 ren et al 2019 here we vary salinity related sensitivity parameter values by 30 20 10 10 20 and 30 relative to their base year values one parameter each time as shown in fig 4 agriculture net benefits increase with groundwater depth and leeching coefficient while decreases with soil salinity and groundwater salinity fig 4 the percent changes of agriculture net benefits in the entire hid is in the range of 8 75 3 62 for groundwater depth 10 43 to 11 98 for soil salinity 1 84 to 1 83 for groundwater salinity and 4 14 4 08 for leaching coefficient fig c1 therefore the model is moderately sensitive to initial soil salinity marginally sensitive to groundwater depth and insensitive to leaching coefficient and groundwater salinity this is because i root zone salinity directly determines the crop salt stress that affects crop yield planting area and agricultural net benefits besides it can also directly affect salt leaching ability of irrigation which is the dominant way to leach out salt from root zone and ii groundwater depth directly determines the intensity of shallow groundwater evapotranspiration which brings the most salt import into the root zone in the hid see fig 3a overall the sensitivity analysis results indicate that the sensitivity of agriculture net benefits to salinity related parameters are within an acceptable range supporting model robustness 4 2 scenario analysis 4 2 1 water supply reduction in crop growing season in the yellow river basin water shortage is the most important limiting factor for socioeconomic development and the competition for water between the upper and lower reaches and across different water users has become increasingly intensified water diversion to the hid is reliable due to the sanshenggong irrigation dam that raises water level in the river for gravitational irrigation in the hid and upstream storage reservoirs that regulate river flow however to improve water supply in the downstream the hid was required to reduce its water diversion people s government of bayannur municipality 2012 to analyze the impacts of water diversion reduction we design the scenario that reduces net diversion from the yellow river by 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 respectively relative to its actual water diversion in 2019 i e the base year fig 5a shows the optimal cropping patterns and land fallow in each sub irrigation district under various water supply reduction scenarios in the hid increasing water shortage caused by water supply reduction leads to increased land follow area in each sub irrigation district fig 5a with 30 water supply reduction the crop with most area decline in each sub irrigation district are maize by 6 072 ha in wlbh wheat by 11 454 ha in jfz sunflower by 14 959 ha in yj sunflower by 30 136 ha in yc and maize by 10 446 ha in wlt respectively for the entire hid the land fallow areas by crop are 60 778 ha for sunflowers 48 339 ha for maize 19 631 ha for wheat 1 571 ha for tomato 1 065 ha for melon and 1 025 ha for cucurbit sunflowers has the largest area reduction with reduced water supply due to its planting area being the largest in base year 231 thousand ha in terms of percent area reduction however they are wheat maize sunflowers tomato cucurbit and melon from the largest to the smallest fig c2 this is because wheat and maize have higher irrigation water requirements but lower market prices thus their areas are reduced firstly when water shortage worsens off the planting area reduction percentage can be as high as 42 51 and 34 25 for wheat and maize respectively when water supply is reduced by 30 fig c2 in contrast the planting area of high value cash crops decrease only by 2 47 8 79 4 16 for melon tomato and cucurbit respectively under 30 water supply reduction fig c2 thus with water supply reduction grain crops are preferentially abandoned whereas high value added cash crops are retained to the largest extent possible to maximize agricultural net benefits this has food security implications for the hid and beyond and as such policy interventions may be required to boost staple crop production the marginal value of irrigation water derived from the model reflects the willingness to pay of irrigators in the hid it increases as water supply declines fig 5b the marginal value of water from irrigation diversion in april june and july september is 0 037 and 0 032 yuan m3 respectively in the baseline fig 5b which is approximately equal to the unit irrigation water cost 0 030 yuan m3 with reduced water availability land fallow area increases fig 5b reducing agriculture revenues fig 9a with water availability reduced by 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 relative to the baseline the corresponding marginal value of irrigation water in april june increases to 0 182 0 287 0 391 0 496 0 601 and 0 705 yuan m3 respectively while the marginal value of irrigation water in july september becomes 0 358 0 538 0 717 0 896 1 075 1 255 yuan m3 fig 5b thus the marginal value of irrigation water in july september is significantly higher than that in april june reflecting the irrigation water in july september is much scarcer it is contrary to general understanding that water scarcity in april june is severer than july september because 70 of precipitation occurs in july september the main reason is that the gross planting area of fall crops in july september is approximately four times that of summer crops in april june irrigation water consumption of fall crops in july september exacerbates water scarcity and increases the marginal value of irrigation water in july september therefore from the perspective of crop water requirements and marginal value of water the agricultural water shortage in july september is much severer than april june in the hid to further explore the relationships between water supply availability agricultural net benefits and the soil salinity in root zone under various water supply reduction scenarios the original model is converted to a multi objective optimization model by adding a second objective function which minimizes gross irrigation water use the pareto optimal front is derived using the constraint method the results show that due to the net salt leaching of irrigation being the main channel of salt export out of the root zone when water supply is reduced the net irrigation salt leaching decrease and agriculture net revenues declines fig 5c water supply reduction will exacerbate water shortage and soil salinization in the hid thus reducing agriculture benefit therefore water saving irrigation aimed at improving irrigation water use efficiency needs to be considered when water supply reduction occurs 4 2 2 winter irrigation reduction with growing water demand in the yellow river basin and increasingly intensified competition for water between the riparian provinces and across water users the necessity of winter irrigation in the hid draws lots of attention therefore we design a scenario that reduces winter irrigation quota by 25 50 75 100 respectively to analyze the impacts on i crop areas ii salt leaching and iii net agricultural benefits fig 6 shows that land fallow area of summer crops i e wheat melon and tomato increases due to reduced winter irrigation that is supposed to augment soil moisture in root zone for summer crops with a 100 winter irrigation reduction wheat area decreases the most by approximately 28 0 for the entire hid tomato area declines by 8 1 and melon area declines by 2 2 fig 6 that is grain crop i e wheat is preferentially abandoned due to its high water requirement and low price whereas the areas of high value cash crops i e tomato and melon are only moderately reduced without winter irrigation nevertheless wheat area reduction leads to reduced wheat production which has food security implications for the hid and beyond the soil salt storage in root zone increases by 780 thousand tons for the entire hid when winter irrigation is completely abandoned the amount of increased net soil salt storage due to winter irrigation reduction in each sub irrigation district depends on the area and quota of winter irrigation the comprehensive irrigation recharge coefficient and the leaching water salinity in a descending order the net salt leaching of winter irrigation at the sub irrigation district level is in turn yc jfz yj wlt and wlbh fig 6 shows soil salt storage of root zone increases as winter irrigation amount is reduced thus the direct effects of winter irrigation reduction are land fallow increased soil salinity and decreased agriculture revenues fig 9a in the hid this scenario analysis confirms that winter irrigation is essential for maintaining agricultural productivity and benefits and reducing winter irrigation will incur a benefit loss to the hid thus to respond to the controversy of winter irrigation in the hid namely whether to reduce winter irrigation and by how much policy makers must consider the tradeoff between the benefit loss of reducing winter irrigation in hid and the new benefit that the saved winter irrigation can generate elsewhere 4 2 3 irrigation water saving water supply reduction policy urges the hid to adopt water saving irrigation to improve irrigation water use efficiency wue to explore the impacts of water saving irrigation on agricultural revenues and environmental sustainability we set up water saving irrigation scenarios which increase wue by 5 15 25 and 35 under the baseline water supply and a 30 water supply reduction from the base year supply respectively as shown in fig 7a and b when wue increases under the two water supply conditions both the import of salt into the root zone and the export of salt out of the root zone decrease but the net salt storage significantly increases with wue increased by 25 and 35 the root zone salt in the yj yc and wlt sub irrigation districts show net accumulation in contrast to net salt leaching in the baseline with higher wue the deep percolation of irrigation water decreases and thus there is less net salt leaching of irrigation besides the water saving and the net salt accumulation in root zone in the entire hid significantly increase with higher wue fig 7c notably when wue increases the planting area slightly declines under the baseline water supply fig 7a while significantly increases under the 30 water supply reduction fig 7b in all sub irrigation districts this is because i under the baseline water supply wue increase exacerbates soil salinization and thus reduces crop yields via salinity stress effects land fallow occurs when the unit gross revenue of crop planting is less than the unit planting cost for the entire hid land fallow area accounts for 0 05 0 53 2 44 and 4 96 when wue increases by 5 15 25 and 35 respectively under the baseline water supply ii however under the 30 water supply reduction water shortage limits crop planting area whereas water saving reduces crop water use per unit area alleviating water shortage and thus increasing irrigated area for the entire hid when wue increase by 35 the planting area increase from 328 thousand ha to 476 thousand ha under 30 water supply reduction reflecting an area increase of 45 fig 7b concerns exist with regard to the rebound effect of adopting new irrigation water saving technologies in china and elsewhere li and zhao 2018 song et al 2018 this effect has been confirmed and analyzed for the hid in a recent study xu and song 2022 which identified sown area expansion planting structure adjustment irrigation proportion expansion and increase in irrigation intensity as the reasons of growing irrigation water use under irrigation efficiency improvement although change in irrigation intensity is not considered in our model due to its fixed irrigation quota by crop the scenario results fig 7b reflect irrigated area expansion and planting structural changes when irrigation water use efficiency increases under water scarcity i e 30 irrigation water supply reduction in addition irrigation modernization represented by wue increase in the irrigation water saving scenario modifies water and salt balance leading to less irrigation percolation and more salt accumulation in root zone soil and groundwater under the baseline water supply water saving irrigation which improves wue results in net benefit losses in hid fig 9a this is consistent with the negative relationship between wue and agriculture benefit in hid reported in x li et al 2020a the net benefits in entire hid will decrease from 6 578 billion yuan in base year to 6 371 5 930 5 455 and 4 947 billion yuan when wue increases by 5 15 25 and 35 respectively fig 9a the net benefit losses are contributed by i increased irrigation investment fig 7d and ii yield decline due to worsened soil salinization fig 7c the unit cost of water saving is 1 11 1 22 1 33 and 1 46 yuan m3 when wue increases by 5 15 25 and 35 fig 7d respectively significantly higher than the water cost of 0 03 yuan m3 in base year indicating water saving irrigation will significantly increase unit cost of irrigation water in hid thus there is no incentive for the farmers to adopt or expand water saving irrigation under the baseline water supply condition however with 30 water supply reduction the net benefit change from 5 135 billion yuan to 5 696 5 697 5 384 and 4 942 billion yuan when wue increases by 5 15 25 and 35 respectively showing a first increasing and then decreasing trend fig 7e results show water saving irrigation can increase economic benefits when water shortage limits agricultural production and an optimal level of water saving investment exists and can be identified by this model water saving by improving wue in the hid may reduce water diversion from the yellow river and leave more water for the downstream however it will likely exacerbate soil salinization besides agriculture net benefits may increase or decrease depending on the severity of water shortage and the level of water saving investment an optimal level of water saving irrigation exists for a given level of water shortage as suggested by the convex net benefit curves in fig 7e with water supply at the baseline level farmers may be disincentivized to adopt water saving irrigation given net benefit losses and worsened soil salinization and as such water saving irrigation will have to rely on investment from the government in this circumstance however water shortage in the hid can make water saving irrigation beneficial fig 7e thus incentivizing farmers to invest in water saving irrigation therefore irrigation water saving or raising wue in the hid should not be considered separately from irrigation water availability namely the amount of yellow river diversion 4 2 4 alternative crop commodity prices crop commodity market prices directly affect farmers land use decisions water allocation and crop revenues in irrigated agriculture jiang et al 2016 li et al 2018 to examine the effects of crop price change on planting areas and revenues we vary crop price from 25 to 300 of the base year price of a crop at an interval of 25 base year price and re run the optimization model for each price change this procedure is repeated for each of the six crops fig 8a shows percent planting area changes in the hid under the crop price scenarios results show when crop commodity market prices increase planting area of each price increasing crop will increase accordingly but with different levels the curve slopes in fig 8a reflect the sensitivity of each crop planting area change to crop commodity prices increase fig 8b shows the average planting area percent changes of all crops in entire hid when each crop commodity market prices are 25 and 200 of the base year values when crop prices double the planting areas of wheat melon tomato maize sunflowers and cucurbit increase by 8 87 179 41 44 and 81 respectively the area of tomato is mostly sensitive to price changes followed by melon cucurbit sunflowers maize and wheat this indicates high value cash crops are much more sensitive to crop market price increase than staple crops so as to maximize agriculture net benefits thus the sensitivity of crop planting area to crop market price increase depend on the economic value of crops the magnitude of price change of a crop positively affects planting area of the crop fig 8a in addition we find that the summer crops i e tomato wheat and melon are more sensitive to own price changes than fall crops i e cucurbit maize and sunflowers indicating farmers decision making behavior on summer crop planting area are more susceptible to external market prices decrease the main reason is the fall crops have approximately four times of planting area than summer crops and is more robust and resilient to crop commodity prices decrease from fig 8b when own prices reduces to 25 base year prices the average planting areas reduce by 70 60 70 57 58 and 58 for wheat melon tomato maize sunflowers and cucurbit respectively however the effects of price decline of a crop on the areas of other crops are rather small ranging from 1 5 thus price decline of a crop commodity can significantly reduce the planting area of the crop itself but does not substantially affect other crops however an increase in the price of one crop commodity can produce significant crowding out effects on other crops and significantly affect agricultural benefits as shown in figs 8b and 9b respectively the results show i an increase in cucurbit price does not generate obvious impacts on the areas of other crops due to the small share of cucurbit area in the hid however when sunflowers price doubles the planting areas of wheat tomato maize and cucurbit reduce by 51 34 39 and 19 respectively indicating the obvious crowding out effects the reason is the planting area of sunflowers is the largest and it accounts for about 45 of gross planting area in the surface water irrigation area of hid therefore the share of planting area is one of the factors affecting the crowding out effects ii when the commodity market prices of melon tomato and sunflowers double wheat area reduces most seriously fig 8b from the perspective of farmers decision making behavior the market price increases of cash crops namely melon or tomato significantly reduce the planting area of low value wheat which competes for land and water with these two cash crops in the summer growing season leading to pronounced crowding out effects therefore necessary policy intervention such as wheat planting subsidies should be considered to alleviate wheat planting area reduction to enhance food security in the hid when market prices of cash crops rise significantly besides results indicate crop price is one of the factors affecting the crowding out effects iii when market price of maize doubles the planting area of maize increases by 41 while that of sunflowers reduces by 36 fig 8b when market prices of sunflowers doubles the planting area of sunflowers increase by 44 while that of maize reduce by 36 thus there are significant mutual crowding out effects between maize and sunflowers due to water competition between maize and sunflowers which share the same scarce water supply source in july september thus the existence of water competition among crops i e same growing season is one of the factors affecting the crowding out effects therefore the crowding out effects of price increasing crops on other crops is controlled by their shares in total planting area crop prices and water competition among crops price decline of a crop can lead to significant area reduction of that particular crop but cannot generate major impacts on the areas of other crops however an increase in the price of a cash crop can significantly reduce the planting area of wheat suggesting that policy interventions such as subsidies may be required from a food security perspective in this circumstance 5 conclusions in this study we develop a regional integrated hydro agro economic optimization model to explore effective management and policy solutions for the challenges confronted with irrigation districts in arid or semi arid regions using the hid as an example besides optimizing water allocation and crop areas the model simulates salt balance in crop root zone and the effects of soil salinity on crop yields it is verified to be robust against uncertainties of the values of several key parameters such as initial groundwater depth and salinity initial root zone soil salinity and irrigation leaching coefficient of root zone through sensitivity analysis the model is calibrated using the positive mathematical programming approach and can reliably replicate base year observations of input and output quantities four critical challenges confronted with the case study area in the yellow river basin are analyzed including the effects of water supply reduction winter irrigation effectiveness of water saving irrigation and crop commodity market risks we attain the following conclusions through scenario analysis 1 water supply reduction if implemented without complementary measures such as water saving irrigation will reduce crop planting areas and exacerbate soil salinization leading to reduced agricultural net benefits in the hid the areas of grain crops will be preferentially reduced whereas the areas of high value cash crops will be less affected the marginal value of irrigation water in july september with high crop water requirement becomes significantly higher than that of april june under the same level of water supply reduction 2 winter irrigation can increase soil moisture retention and summer crop planting areas it also increases net salt leaching from crop root zone reduces crop salt stress and improves net benefits and environmental sustainability in the hid a decision on whether to reduce winter irrigation in the hid and the magnitude of reduction must consider the benefit that the saved water can generate elsewhere in the yellow river basin 3 water saving irrigation which improves irrigation water use efficiency can alleviate water shortage but may significantly reduce net salt leaching due to less irrigation percolation with adequate amount of irrigation water supply as specified in the baseline i e 2019 observations water saving irrigation incurs a net benefit loss in the hid due to the cost of investing in water saving technologies and crop yield reduction under increased soil salinity caused by reduced salt leaching however with water shortage water saving irrigation can help maintain crop planting areas and stabilize agricultural benefit 4 the crowding out effect of price increase of one crop on other crops is controlled by area share of the crop crop price and the water shortage and water competition among crops an increase in the price of a cash crop in the summer growing season namely melon or tomato can significantly reduce the planting area of wheat which competes for land and water with these two cash crops and may jeopardize food security policy intervention may need to be considered to ensure food security when crop commodity prices fluctuate drastically although the model presented in this paper is developed using data from the hid it can be modified to analyze arid and semi arid region irrigated agricultural production elsewhere without substantial changes in model structure as a modeling framework for screening effective technological management and policy interventions for enhancing profitability and environmental sustainability of irrigated farming in arid and semi arid environment it provides a holistic perspective and useful insights for water land and salinity management water saving irrigation investment and market risk management nevertheless this study is not without limitation first the model runs for a single year considering salt balance in crop root zone and groundwater however given the intertemporal nature of soil salinity accumulation multi year analysis is required to analyze the long term cumulative effects of water management and crop plating structure on salinization and agricultural production second we focus on the surface irrigation area of the hid which accounts for 91 of the total irrigated area the well irrigated and combined well canal irrigated areas which is in northern hid and accounts for the rest 9 of the gross irrigated areas is not modeled the groundwater table in the northern hid has been gradually decreasing due to increasing groundwater pumping for irrigation groundwater table decline negatively affects natural vegetation which is strongly dependent on groundwater and is the important ecological security barrier in the hid therefore future research needs to analyze conjunctive use of surface and groundwater and impacts of groundwater irrigation on groundwater dependent ecosystems in the hid third we treat each sub irrigation district as a spatially homogenous area in the model to represent the spatial heterogeneity of land productivity soil salinity and groundwater table future research may consider combining distributed hydrological models especially a groundwater model with the hydro agro economic optimization model those models can take advantage of geographic information system gis and remote sensing information to improve the representation of spatial heterogeneity in the integrated model addressing the dual challenge of water scarcity and salinization in semi arid and arid region irrigated agricultural production requires taking a holistic approach in water and salinity management pursuing more crop per drop through irrigation water saving is naturally important however reduced irrigation deep percolation lessens salt leaching and can seriously impair crop productivity and production beyond the biophysical factors price fluctuation of agricultural market can alter planting structure and scale amid these intertwinedness and uncertainty hydro agro economic optimization provides a means to explore effective management alternatives towards the goals of maximizing profitability while maintaining environmental sustainability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

9126,water shortage and soil salinization are the key limiting factors in agricultural production of arid and semi arid regions located in western inner mongolia of china the hetao irrigation district hid is one of the top three largest irrigation districts in china irrigation water overuse and high level of soil salinity have curbed the agricultural productivity adversely affected farmers revenues and threatened long term sustainability of irrigated farming in the hid nevertheless opportunities still exist to improve the situation irrigation water allocation salt accumulation and leaching crop productivity and farming decisions are intrinsically connected and thus require taking a holistic approach to investigate into the interactions among all those factors and devise appropriate technological management and policy interventions towards this goal we develop an integrated hydro agro economic optimization model to reconcile agricultural net revenue irrigation practices and environmental sustainability in the hid positive mathematical programming is used for model calibration to ensure the model can replicate the base year observations of crop acreage making the model suitable for evaluating alternative scenarios scenario analyses are conducted to analyze the effects of water supply reduction reducing winter irrigation water saving irrigation and crop commodity price change on optimal agricultural water management practices results show that water supply reduction without complementary measures increases land fallow exacerbates soil salinization and reduces net benefits winter irrigation can conserve soil moisture and increase the net salt leaching in the root zone and a reduction in winter irrigation will incur a benefit loss to the hid water saving irrigation can stabilize planting areas under water shortage but exacerbate soil salinization price increase of a cash crop if it has a large area share tends to crowd out grain crops growing in the

et al 2018 godfray et al 2010 irrigation is especially indispensable for agricultural production in arid and semi arid environment where deficiencies in rainfall require irrigation to enable and stabilize agricultural production many well managed irrigation systems in arid and semi arid regions exemplify that irrigation can enhance both agricultural productivity and profitability boost regional economy and contribute to sustainable prosperity rosegrant et al 2009 nevertheless irrigated agriculture in arid and semi arid environment often face major challenges that potentially endanger its profitability and sustainability zhu et al 2019 among them water shortage and soil salinization are the main limiting factors for irrigated agricultural production in semi arid and arid regions hammecker et al 2012 x li et al 2020a xue et al 2018 water scarcity is a basic fact in arid environment where human habitation and economic activities demand for water sometimes at the cost of local ecosystems gorelick and zheng 2015 niu et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 however excessive irrigation may still happen due to improper management which may exacerbate soil salinization in arid climate scanlon et al 2006 without effective drainage salts introduced by irrigation water remain within crop root zone meanwhile irrigation deep percolation and canal leakage can raise groundwater table which driven by capillary rise cause shallow groundwater evapotranspiration that brings salt to the surface soil karimov et al 2014 xu et al 2010 xue et al 2020 yeh and famiglietti 2009 these two mechanisms can compound soil salinization rengasamy 2006 water shortage and irrigation salinization are found in irrigated agriculture of many arid and semi arid regions around the world such as the san joaquin valley of california schoups et al 2005 the nile delta in egypt kotb et al 2000 the yizre el valley in israel banin and fish 1995 the aral sea basin in central asia cai et al 2003 in china irrigated areas account for 49 cultivated land but produce more than 90 of cash crops and 75 of grain crops of the country kang et al 2017 located in arid and semi arid western inner mongolia the hetao irrigation district hid is a major grain and oil seed production region and one of the top three largest irrigation districts in china it is also the largest gravity fed irrigation district in asia the hid is facing complex and evolving challenges of water scarcity and soil salinization overuse of water for irrigation was rather common which raised groundwater table and consequently led to soil salinization because of groundwater evapotranspiration and inadequate drainage wen et al 2020 xue et al 2020 soil salinization has long been considered a major threat to crop productivity and agroecosystem sustainability in the region mao et al 2022 sun et al 2019 managing soil salinity at the end of crop growth period is especially important because soil salinity rises to high level at that time due to high evapotranspiration during the growing period x li et al 2020b to leach salts out of the root zone and increase soil moisture before planting crops winter irrigation is widely practiced in the hid which takes place from october to november when there is no crop in the field and it uses nearly 40 of annual irrigation water however the capacity of the drainage system in the hid is inadequate and therefore over irrigation poor drainage and intensive groundwater evapotranspiration collectively exacerbate soil salination in the hid most existing irrigation and soil salinization studies of the hid focused on field scale experiments and numerical simulations using process oriented models these include field experiments and hydrus 1d model simulations of vertical distribution of soil water salt li et al 2010 simulation of evapotranspiration and soil salinity under different groundwater table depths and irrigation schemes using the hydrus dualkc model ren et al 2018 groundwater and salt dynamics simulation using the saltmod model at well canal combined irrigated area mao et al 2017 just to list a few however these simulation models are for answering what if questions thus limiting the choices of management decision makings to only several pre specified alternative scenarios harou et al 2009 singh 2014 besides simulation models usually include more process details and thus require more data and computational resources optimization based scenario analysis can be used to narrow down the preferred scenarios selected for process based modeling to save time and data cost hydro economic optimization models are typically developed to understand the optimal economic beneﬁts from water allocation water infrastructure or policies an extensive literature survey on various applications of hydro economic modeling was given by harou et al 2009 zooming in on irrigated agricultural production studies marques et al 2005 developed a two stage economic production model to analyze the effects of irrigation water supply uncertainty and water prices on cropping patterns crop production and irrigation technology adoption also using two stage stochastic optimization zhu et al 2015 analytically derived necessary conditions for optimal water and land allocation among crops and for optimal water transfers and conjunctive use of surface and groundwater besides numerical solutions ward and pulido velazquez 2008 demonstrated that adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies does not guarantee reduced irrigation water uses with a basin scale hydro economic optimization model by linking the economic agricultural production model to a detailed groundwater model for the california s central valley medellín azuara et al 2015 and macewan et al 2017 analyzed economic costs of pumping replacement groundwater during drought for the central valley and the hydrological and economic impacts of alternative groundwater stabilization policies in the kings and tulare lake subbasins of california respectively relatively few hydro economic models considered salinity management to explore the economic and environmental consequences of various policy choices in the syr darya river basin of central asia where irrigation induced salinity is severe cai et al 2003 explicitly included root zone salt balance and effects of salinity on crop yields in a hydro agro economic model treating groundwater as a common property knapp and baerenklau 2006 developed a hydrologic economic model to analyze groundwater salinization caused by surface water imports and restricted drainage in irrigated agricultural regions and derived irrigation decision rules notably yao 2020 embedded a short term stochastic model which includes quadratic pmp production cost function into a long term dynamic programming model to develop optimal long term management decisions on perennial and annual crop acreages and conjunctive water use strategies for recovering groundwater storage and maximizing agricultural profit in a study area of the northern san joaquin valley california u s a so far there are relatively few existing studies that address the irrigation system improvement for the hid using water allocation and agricultural benefit optimization models for instance li et al 2020b developed a simulation optimization model at field level that simulates agro hydrological processes and optimizes irrigation water allocation considering uncertainties in crop prices maximum yields and irrigation water availability li et al 2020a set up a field scale irrigation drainage collaborative optimal allocation model to integrate the water salt balance physical processes into a genetic algorithm based optimization model to optimize irrigation and drainage simultaneously improving irrigation water use efficiency controlling soil salinity and maximizing farmland economic benefits in a maize field notably zhang et al 2021 developed a fuzzy multi objective dependent chance programming model that optimizes water allocation to maximize economic benefits and ensure food security considering soil water balance physical processes and the sensitivities of crop yield to water deficit for the entire hid however these model are normative mathematical programming models in the sense that they search for optimal solution driven by prescribed objective function but ignore the differences between model generated optimal solution and observations cai and wang 2006 howitt 1995 thus these normative programming models cannot replicate the input and output observations of a base year in its optimal solution and the model results may deviate significantly from observations if a normative programming model is tightly constrained to force model solution to be close to observations such as adding tight bounds to crop areas then the optimal solutions would be largely guided by constraints rather than the model objective in either case the capability of a normative model in predicting farmers behavior responses to external changes such as water supply adjustment or crop commodity price change is limited water and agricultural policy formulation for the hid and other similar irrigation districts requires a model that has the predictive power to investigate how farmers respond under different conditions there are several critical challenges confronted by the hid nowadays first the hid is required to reduce its annual water diversion from the yellow river due to water shortage in the basin people s government of bayannur municipality 2012 second the practice of winter irrigation is often questioned and sometimes regarded as a wasteful use of water third water saving irrigation is widely considered a solution for water scarcity but potential side effects are not well understood at the irrigation district level fourth the crop mix of the hid has undergone considerable changes over the past two decades it is important to understand the potential impacts of crop commodity market price changes on planting areas to answer these strategic management and policy questions requires an integrated model that represents water and salt balance decision making behaviors of the farmers and the interactions between the physical processes and human decisions moreover such a model needs to be calibrated to base year observations including land and water uses cropping patterns and agricultural production costs and revenues such that the model is supported by an empirical foundation and can provide structural information for policy response howitt 1995 towards this goal we develop an integrated hydro agro economic optimization model for the hid which maximizes net agricultural benefits while integrating irrigation water allocation water and salt balance in crop root zone effects of salinity stress on crop yields water saving investment and effectiveness and crop production costs and revenues into a coherent framework positive mathematical programming pmp approach howitt 1995 is used to calibrate the model such that it can replicate base year observations of input and output quantities making the model suitable for evaluating alternative management and policy scenarios the model robustness to uncertainties in salinity related parameters is verified through sensitivity analysis scenario analysis is conducted to answer each of the four above mentioned critical challenges that the hid are confronted with 2 description of the study area as a major grain and oil seed production region in china the hid spans over 250 km from west to east and 50 km from south to north in 2019 the actual irrigated area of hid reaches 576 thousand ha including 524 thousand ha 91 irrigated by surface water diverted from the yellow river the remaining 52 thousand ha 9 is well irrigated or well canal combined area from west to east the hid is divided into five sub irrigation districts namely wulanbuhe wlbh 47 2 thousand ha jiefangzha jfz 111 4 thousand ha yongji yj 102 2 thousand ha yichang yc 170 7 thousand ha and wulate wlt 77 5 thousand ha which are distributed largely in parallel from the upper to lower hid fig 1 this study is focused on the surface irrigation area of these five sub irrigation districts in the hid which diverts water from the yellow river and considers six main grain and cash crops i e summer crops of wheat melon and tomato and fall crops of maize sunflowers and cucurbit which collectively account for 97 of the gross crop areas in the surface irrigation area the average annual precipitation is 130 210 mm in the hid of which 70 concentrates in the three months from july to september annual potential evaporation ranges from 2 100 to 2 300 mm agricultural production depends almost entirely on irrigation diversion from the yellow river in the hid irrigated agriculture is the largest water user and accounts for 95 of the total diversion from yellow river in 2019 gross irrigation diversion from the yellow river was about 4 2 billion m3 in the hid other water diversions from the yellow river including domestic forestry and animal husbandry industrial and ecological water uses was 0 496 billion m3 thus making a total water diversion of about 4 7 billion m3 in 2019 water shortage and soil salinization are main limitation factors for irrigated agriculture production in the hid soil survey data show that 63 6 of irrigated area is saline in the hid with 45 5 in slightly saline area 16 0 in moderately saline area and 3 1 in heavily saline area d li et al 2020 a calendar year can be divided into four periods in the hid based on crop production and irrigation activities there is neither crop production nor irrigation in the december march period when the top soil is frozen thus this period is excluded from the model the remaining three periods are i the april june period when summer crops are grown and irrigated with yellow river water diversion the spring irrigation occurs in may for increasing soil water for fall crops ii the july september period when fall crops are irrigated and iii the october november period when the winter irrigation is conducted notably winter irrigation is applied after fall crops are harvested and it is for leaching salts out of crop root zone and for increasing soil water content for the summer crops to be planted in next april unique to the hid winter irrigation accounts for about 40 of the total annual diversion of hid from the yellow river the winter irrigation area accounts for about 77 of the irrigated area in the hid 3 data and methods 3 1 data the precipitation data used in this paper are from the linhe meteorological station in the hid the base year observations are taken from reports prepared by local governmental agencies bayannur bureau of statistics 2019 bayannur water conservancy bureau 2019 hetao irrigation district administration 2019 national bureau of statistics 2019 these base year data include cropping patterns of six main grain and cash crops irrigation water diversion from the yellow river irrigation quota irrigation water use efficiency groundwater table and salinity soil salinity crop yield and prices the adopted values of key parameters in the model are provided in table 1 and table 2 3 2 model structure and assumptions in this paper we develop a regional hydro agro economic optimization model that integrates water allocation across sub districts and crops root zone salt balance effects of soil salinity on crop yields and production costs and revenues into a holistic framework fig 2 shows the model structure based on irrigation and farming practices in the hid the following assumptions are made for necessary model simplification without compromising model fidelity 1 full irrigation is practiced based on crop specific irrigation quota 2 one harvest per year there is neither multiple planting nor interplanting 3 in the root zone salt is drained out through vertical water movement alone mao et al 2022 lateral movement of water and salt is negligible in the crop root zone because the soil is unsaturated most of the time ji et al 2007 salt discharge through irrigation runoff and crop absorption is negligible too x li et al 2020a wen et al 2017 4 fall crops do not benefit from winter irrigation of last october november because winter irrigation water stored in soil has already been evaporated before fall crops are planted spring irrigation augments soil moisture content for fall crops 5 soil salinity which adversely affects crop productivity is estimated with salt balance in a homogenous 1 meter root zone this assumption is necessary given that the hydro agro economic model is spatially aggregated at the sub irrigation district level and does not consider soil texture shallow groundwater depth irrigation drainage infrastructure and so forth in a spatially explicit manner 3 3 hydro agro economic

practices are retained the purpose of winter irrigation and spring irrigation is to increase soil moisture content before crops are planted in the next season if the quota of winter or spring irrigation is reduced as in the scenario analysis of this paper there will be less moisture retained in root zone soil when crops are planted in the next season and as such the original irrigation quota for summer and fall crops become inadequate in meeting crop irrigation requirements and the net crop irrigation requirements in the next season i e the irrigation quota need to increase by the amount of reduced soil water retained from winter or spring irrigation this makes the value of δ in eqs 3 and 4 to increase from zero in baseline condition besides spring irrigation i e k s i w k s i

infrastructures to improve irrigation water use efficiency in the hid include canal lining and high efficiency field water saving irrigation technologies such as pipe irrigation sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation canal lining accounts for 88 of the total water saving irrigation area in hid the close interlacing of the seven levels of water saving irrigation drainage infrastructure system was constructed as a dense network to ensure irrigation water deliveries to irrigated farmland in hid we define the irrigation water use efficiency for crop i in the k th sub irrigation district wue ki as ratio of the amount of beneficial irrigation water use in the field which includes irrigation deep percolation that is critical for salt leaching to total irrigation water withdrawal at the sub irrigation district level the value of irrigation water use efficiency is calculated as field irrigation water use efficiency multiplied by the canal water conveyance efficiency e g water saving technology here refers to canal lining water saving infrastructures the in situ measurements of field irrigation water use efficiency and canal water conveyance efficiency were obtained from qu et al 2018 and bayannur water conservancy bureau 2019 the wue ki in the base year in the hid is given in table 3 and the average irrigation water use efficiency in the whole hid is 0 405 in the base year bayannur water conservancy bureau 2019 given the relatively low canal conveyance efficiency 0 51 0 55 and water saving potential analysis conducted for the hid future irrigation investment need to give priority to the main canal and the secondary canals qu et al 2018 water saving irrigation investment can improve irrigation water use efficiency wue reduce water consumption and alleviate water shortage in the hid the non linear empirical relationship between wue and annualized irrigation investment in the hid is estimated by qu et al 2018 7 a m i c a k i w u e k i k i 2 b k i w u e k i k i c r 1 r n 1 r n 1 where amic is the annualized irrigation investment k and i are the total numbers of sub irrigation districts and crop types respectively r is discount rate n is the service life span of water saving irrigation infrastructure and a b and c are empirical parameters estimated with historical statistical data 3 3 5 land availability total crop planting area in each sub irrigation district cannot exceed the available cultivated area in the sub irrigation district 8 i a ki ka k k where ka k is the available cultivated area for sub irrigation district k in ha for ensuring food security and stabilizing cropping patterns of grain crops and cash crops crop planting areas should not expand or shrink drastically therefore lower and upper limits of crop planting area are applied 9 λ min a ki base a ki λ max a ki base k i where a ki base is the observed crop planting area in the base year in ha and λ max and λ min are coefficients for applying the crop planting area limits in fact the upper and lower bounds used form a large range and they rarely constrain model solution 3 4 pmp calibration as above discussed most existing mathematical programming models of water management and agricultural production are uncalibrated normative models those models suffer from either unrealistic model solution or from being so tightly constrained for calibrating to observed behavior that they could not react to policy scenarios as such they are not suitable for policy analysis because models failed to be accurately calibrated are unlikely to be believed by policy makers cai and wang 2006 mérel and howitt 2014 by introducing nonlinearity in the objective function which reflects unobserved activity specific costs or benefits and is calibrated using shadow values of the calibration constraints pmp can replicate base year activity levels and resource allocation without artificial constraints while generating smooth responses to changes in the economic environment frahan et al 2007 garnache et al 2017 mérel and howitt 2014 with explicit technology representation pmp can be conveniently linked with biophysical models for policy analysis heckelei et al 2012 howitt et al 2012 medellín azuara et al 2012 the pmp cost functions in this model are calibrated using observed base year crop areas water uses production costs and crop revenues following the procedures in howitt 1995 and zhu et al 2015 we take 2019 as the base year because it represents the most recent situation and water use and crop production data in the hid are well documented for 2019 the pmp approach is applied to each of the five sub irrigation districts in the hid separately to estimate quadratic production cost functions using base year observations the calibration is conducted in three steps i the first step solves a linear programming model of farm profit maximization to derive the marginal values of land under calibration and resource constraints the calibration constraints are set to observed values of land use in the base year with all other production inputs normalized to land howitt et al 2012 ii the pmp calibration treats the least profitable crop among all crops modeled as the marginal crop and estimates its cost function slope using an empirical area supply elasticity and observed area and gross margin of this crop for the remaining crops their cost functions are estimated using marginal values of land adjusted by a factor that reflects the difference of marginal and average production cost of the marginal crop at its observed area howitt 1995 zhu et al 2015 the estimated pmp cost function is used to establish a non linear optimization model and iii solve the non linear optimization model to calibrate the decision variables e g crop areas to the base year observations as the pmp calibration use the observed crop yields which already reflect the effects of salt stress in the base year the calibration steps do not explicitly incorporate salt stress terms in fact the yield changes relative to the base year yield due to salt stress is one in the first term of the rhs of eq 1 for the base year itself therefore the pmp calibration is done first following the above described three steps and then the estimated pmp cost functions are incorporated into the benefit function described in eq 1 the calibrated cost function reflects the decision making behaviors of the farmers maneta and howitt 2014 medellín azuara et al 2012 2010 the detailed pmp calibration procedure can be found in previous studies howitt 1995 maneta and howitt 2014 marques et al 2005 medellín azuara et al 2012 2010 zhu et al 2015 quadratic function is typically used as a non linear pmp cost function marques et al 2005 medellín azuara et al 2012 nevertheless there are other non linear pmp cost functions such as exponential function that have been verified as effective alternatives howitt et al 2012 medellín azuara et al 2010 here we adopt the classical pmp quadratic cost function 10 c p k i α k i 0 5 γ k i a k i a k i where cp is the gross production cost α ki and γ ki are the intercept and slope of pmp cost function respectively with subscript k denoting sub irrigation district and i denoting crop the observed data used for the pmp cost function calibration include crop areas yields crop commodity prices land and water costs available land and water resources etc zhu et al 2015 the model is solved with the conopt solver in the general algebraic modeling systems gams arki consulting and development 2021 4 results and discussions 4 1 baseline model and sensitivity analysis the model is calibrated to the base year observations taking the pmp approach the effects of the salinity related parameters on model robustness including initial groundwater depth and salinity initial soil salinity in root zone and irrigation leaching coefficient are assessed through sensitivity analysis 4 1 1 baseline model calibration the pmp approach is applied to the hid considering i the hid is located in semi arid and arid climate with irrigation water diverted from the yellow river ii full irrigation is regularly practiced in the hid because irrigation water can be guaranteed in the upper reaches of the yellow river iii the irrigated farmland area per capita or per household is large in the hid and as such most of the produced crops are sold on the market rather than for own consumption therefore agricultural production and management decisions are directly affected by the prices of crop inputs on the market results indicate the optimal cropping patterns match the existing base year observations the percent differences between model solved and observed base year crop areas are within the range of 4 after taking into consideration of the crop relative yield reduction due to salinity stress in addition the baseline model fidelity is further supported by the following 1 the total groundwater evapotranspiration reported for the base year in the model is 546 million m3 over irrigated cropland in the hid which is equivalent to a water depth of 107 3 mm this is close to the estimated 138 9 mm of average annual groundwater evapotranspiration of irrigated land from 2006 to 2012 in the hid by yu et al 2016 the difference between the 138 9 mm averaged over 2006 2012 and the 107 3 mm estimated for 2019 is likely due to decline in groundwater table in recent years 2 the net drainage from the root zone is equal to the deep percolation of precipitation and irrigation minus the groundwater evapotranspiration the model estimates that net drainage out of the root zone in the wlt sub irrigation district is 54 3 mm which is consistent with the result of 48 5 mm using bromide tracer experiment from yang et al 2018 3 the net salt accumulation of the 1 meter depth root zone in the jfz sub irrigation district is estimated to be 31 73 thousand tons per year by the model which is largely consistent with the 56 05 thousand tons per year for 2007 2011 estimated by chang et al 2018 the difference is likely due to the soil salinity alleviation in irrigated arable land in the hid in recent years yu et al 2016 the salt concentration change in the root zone by sub irrigation district of hid in a hydrologic year ranges from 1 385 mg l in jfz to 155 mg l in wlbh or from 0 216 g kg to 0 025 g kg which is comparable to the 0 4 0 05 g kg in the maize field in the hid reported by li et al 2020a here salt concentration refers to milligrams of salts per little of water solution in soil 4 1 1 1 salt balance in the root zone due to the parallelly layout irrigation and drainage systems of sub irrigation districts in the hid see fig 1 the salt balance analysis is conducted separately in each sub irrigation district and results are shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows salt accumulates slightly in wlbh and jfz by 16 88 thousand tons and 31 72 thousand tons respectively over the one year period however significant amount of salt is leached out of crop root zone in yj yc and wlt by 223 67 thousand tons 544 06 thousand tons and 182 46 thousand tons respectively and the electrical conductivity of root zone saturation extract moderately decreases and soil salinization in the root zone are gradually alleviated fig 3a the yc sub irrigation district has the highest net salt leaching per unit area at 1 385 mg l 0 216 g kg the main reasons are i compared to wlbh jfz and yj higher leaching water salinity in yc causes more salt leaching and ii the groundwater table depth in yc 2 28 m is higher than that of wlt 2 00 m thus having less salt imported to root zone from groundwater evapotranspiration the net salt leaching in root zone in irrigated farmland is 901 59 thousand tons for the entire hid in the base year which is consistent with the previous conclusions that the salt in root zone of irrigated land can be continuously transported to non cultivated land salinized wasteland or leached into groundwater through deep percolation wang et al 2020 yu et al 2016 the results show that salt leaching by precipitation is not significant due to low precipitation in the hid see fig 3a salt balance in the root zone is controlled by i net salt leaching out of the root zone through excess irrigation which is affected by irrigation water salinity soil salinity and the drainage ability of root zone and ii salt import through groundwater evapotranspiration which is controlled by groundwater depth and salinity winter irrigation is more effective in leaching salt than crop growing period irrigation due to its higher irrigation percolation therefore to alleviate soil salinization in the hid we need to consider increasing net salt leaching through irrigation reducing salt import through groundwater evapotranspiration by regulating groundwater table such as through conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water for irrigation and lowering groundwater salinity through improving irrigation and drainage infrastructure 4 1 1 2 crop yield reduction under salt stress soil salinization can significantly reduce crop productivity in the hid zeng et al 2021 the crop relative yield y ki y max ki is the ratio between yield under salt stress to yield without any salt stress and its value ranges from 0 to 1 crop yield reduction due to salt stress is common in the hid spatially yield reduction due to salt stress becomes more serious from upper to lower sub irrigation districts among the six crops modeled wheat is the most salt resistent crop fig 3b in wlt the most downstream sub irrigation district along the main irrigation canal of the hid soil salinization is the severest and crop yield is reduced by 30 due to higher soil salinity intensive groundwater evapotranspiration poorer drainage infrastructure and relative lower topography fig 3b 4 1 1 3 agricultural net benefits fig 3b shows the net agricultural benefit in each sub irrigation district is mainly determined by total irrigated area but with exception the planting area in wlt is larger than that in wlbh but the net benefit is in the opposite the main reasons are i differences in cropping patterns of the two sub irrigation districts and ii significant crop yield reduction caused by higher soil salinity in wlt fig 3b therefore agriculture net benefit at the sub irrigation district level is determined by total irrigated area cropping pattern and yield reduction due to soil salinization to sum up the model can replicate the base year observations of crop areas in the hid representing water allocation and balance root zone salt balance salt stress induced yield reduction and production and revenue in a holistic optimization modeling framework thus the model is suitable for analyzing potential impacts of external factors such as changes in allowable water diversion from the yellow river and crop commodity prices besides management interventions such as reducing winter irrigation and investing in irrigation water saving among others 4 1 2 sensitivity analysis of salinity related parameters salinity related parameter values adopted in the model appear to be subject to considerable level of uncertainties because of the spatial aggregation nature of the model i e at sub irrigation district level and the spatial heterogeneity of these parameter values thus we select four parameters in the model including initial groundwater depth initial groundwater salinity initial root zone soil salinity and irrigation leaching coefficient of root zone for sensitivity analysis groundwater depth can regulate plant root water uptake and thus affect groundwater associated salinity ibrahimi et al 2014 rengasamy 2006 xu et al 2010 and influence crop yield and agricultural revenues groundwater depth is prevalently above 2 5 m in the hid see fig 1c and 82 of groundwater discharge in the hid is direct evaporation and plant root uptake xu et al 2010 thus groundwater depth and salinity can significantly affect the salt import into the root zone through groundwater evapotranspiration in the hid besides root zone soil salinity and leeching coefficient determine the net salt leaching ability of irrigation due to the data limitation we use average groundwater depth and soil salinity of each sub irrigation district and average groundwater salinity and leaching coefficient of the entire hid dou et al 2020 miao et al 2016 ren et al 2019 here we vary salinity related sensitivity parameter values by 30 20 10 10 20 and 30 relative to their base year values one parameter each time as shown in fig 4 agriculture net benefits increase with groundwater depth and leeching coefficient while decreases with soil salinity and groundwater salinity fig 4 the percent changes of agriculture net benefits in the entire hid is in the range of 8 75 3 62 for groundwater depth 10 43 to 11 98 for soil salinity 1 84 to 1 83 for groundwater salinity and 4 14 4 08 for leaching coefficient fig c1 therefore the model is moderately sensitive to initial soil salinity marginally sensitive to groundwater depth and insensitive to leaching coefficient and groundwater salinity this is because i root zone salinity directly determines the crop salt stress that affects crop yield planting area and agricultural net benefits besides it can also directly affect salt leaching ability of irrigation which is the dominant way to leach out salt from root zone and ii groundwater depth directly determines the intensity of shallow groundwater evapotranspiration which brings the most salt import into the root zone in the hid see fig 3a overall the sensitivity analysis results indicate that the sensitivity of agriculture net benefits to salinity related parameters are within an acceptable range supporting model robustness 4 2 scenario analysis 4 2 1 water supply reduction in crop growing season in the yellow river basin water shortage is the most important limiting factor for socioeconomic development and the competition for water between the upper and lower reaches and across different water users has become increasingly intensified water diversion to the hid is reliable due to the sanshenggong irrigation dam that raises water level in the river for gravitational irrigation in the hid and upstream storage reservoirs that regulate river flow however to improve water supply in the downstream the hid was required to reduce its water diversion people s government of bayannur municipality 2012 to analyze the impacts of water diversion reduction we design the scenario that reduces net diversion from the yellow river by 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 respectively relative to its actual water diversion in 2019 i e the base year fig 5a shows the optimal cropping patterns and land fallow in each sub irrigation district under various water supply reduction scenarios in the hid increasing water shortage caused by water supply reduction leads to increased land follow area in each sub irrigation district fig 5a with 30 water supply reduction the crop with most area decline in each sub irrigation district are maize by 6 072 ha in wlbh wheat by 11 454 ha in jfz sunflower by 14 959 ha in yj sunflower by 30 136 ha in yc and maize by 10 446 ha in wlt respectively for the entire hid the land fallow areas by crop are 60 778 ha for sunflowers 48 339 ha for maize 19 631 ha for wheat 1 571 ha for tomato 1 065 ha for melon and 1 025 ha for cucurbit sunflowers has the largest area reduction with reduced water supply due to its planting area being the largest in base year 231 thousand ha in terms of percent area reduction however they are wheat maize sunflowers tomato cucurbit and melon from the largest to the smallest fig c2 this is because wheat and maize have higher irrigation water requirements but lower market prices thus their areas are reduced firstly when water shortage worsens off the planting area reduction percentage can be as high as 42 51 and 34 25 for wheat and maize respectively when water supply is reduced by 30 fig c2 in contrast the planting area of high value cash crops decrease only by 2 47 8 79 4 16 for melon tomato and cucurbit respectively under 30 water supply reduction fig c2 thus with water supply reduction grain crops are preferentially abandoned whereas high value added cash crops are retained to the largest extent possible to maximize agricultural net benefits this has food security implications for the hid and beyond and as such policy interventions may be required to boost staple crop production the marginal value of irrigation water derived from the model reflects the willingness to pay of irrigators in the hid it increases as water supply declines fig 5b the marginal value of water from irrigation diversion in april june and july september is 0 037 and 0 032 yuan m3 respectively in the baseline fig 5b which is approximately equal to the unit irrigation water cost 0 030 yuan m3 with reduced water availability land fallow area increases fig 5b reducing agriculture revenues fig 9a with water availability reduced by 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 relative to the baseline the corresponding marginal value of irrigation water in april june increases to 0 182 0 287 0 391 0 496 0 601 and 0 705 yuan m3 respectively while the marginal value of irrigation water in july september becomes 0 358 0 538 0 717 0 896 1 075 1 255 yuan m3 fig 5b thus the marginal value of irrigation water in july september is significantly higher than that in april june reflecting the irrigation water in july september is much scarcer it is contrary to general understanding that water scarcity in april june is severer than july september because 70 of precipitation occurs in july september the main reason is that the gross planting area of fall crops in july september is approximately four times that of summer crops in april june irrigation water consumption of fall crops in july september exacerbates water scarcity and increases the marginal value of irrigation water in july september therefore from the perspective of crop water requirements and marginal value of water the agricultural water shortage in july september is much severer than april june in the hid to further explore the relationships between water supply availability agricultural net benefits and the soil salinity in root zone under various water supply reduction scenarios the original model is converted to a multi objective optimization model by adding a second objective function which minimizes gross irrigation water use the pareto optimal front is derived using the constraint method the results show that due to the net salt leaching of irrigation being the main channel of salt export out of the root zone when water supply is reduced the net irrigation salt leaching decrease and agriculture net revenues declines fig 5c water supply reduction will exacerbate water shortage and soil salinization in the hid thus reducing agriculture benefit therefore water saving irrigation aimed at improving irrigation water use efficiency needs to be considered when water supply reduction occurs 4 2 2 winter irrigation reduction with growing water demand in the yellow river basin and increasingly intensified competition for water between the riparian provinces and across water users the necessity of winter irrigation in the hid draws lots of attention therefore we design a scenario that reduces winter irrigation quota by 25 50 75 100 respectively to analyze the impacts on i crop areas ii salt leaching and iii net agricultural benefits fig 6 shows that land fallow area of summer crops i e wheat melon and tomato increases due to reduced winter irrigation that is supposed to augment soil moisture in root zone for summer crops with a 100 winter irrigation reduction wheat area decreases the most by approximately 28 0 for the entire hid tomato area declines by 8 1 and melon area declines by 2 2 fig 6 that is grain crop i e wheat is preferentially abandoned due to its high water requirement and low price whereas the areas of high value cash crops i e tomato and melon are only moderately reduced without winter irrigation nevertheless wheat area reduction leads to reduced wheat production which has food security implications for the hid and beyond the soil salt storage in root zone increases by 780 thousand tons for the entire hid when winter irrigation is completely abandoned the amount of increased net soil salt storage due to winter irrigation reduction in each sub irrigation district depends on the area and quota of winter irrigation the comprehensive irrigation recharge coefficient and the leaching water salinity in a descending order the net salt leaching of winter irrigation at the sub irrigation district level is in turn yc jfz yj wlt and wlbh fig 6 shows soil salt storage of root zone increases as winter irrigation amount is reduced thus the direct effects of winter irrigation reduction are land fallow increased soil salinity and decreased agriculture revenues fig 9a in the hid this scenario analysis confirms that winter irrigation is essential for maintaining agricultural productivity and benefits and reducing winter irrigation will incur a benefit loss to the hid thus to respond to the controversy of winter irrigation in the hid namely whether to reduce winter irrigation and by how much policy makers must consider the tradeoff between the benefit loss of reducing winter irrigation in hid and the new benefit that the saved winter irrigation can generate elsewhere 4 2 3 irrigation water saving water supply reduction policy urges the hid to adopt water saving irrigation to improve irrigation water use efficiency wue to explore the impacts of water saving irrigation on agricultural revenues and environmental sustainability we set up water saving irrigation scenarios which increase wue by 5 15 25 and 35 under the baseline water supply and a 30 water supply reduction from the base year supply respectively as shown in fig 7a and b when wue increases under the two water supply conditions both the import of salt into the root zone and the export of salt out of the root zone decrease but the net salt storage significantly increases with wue increased by 25 and 35 the root zone salt in the yj yc and wlt sub irrigation districts show net accumulation in contrast to net salt leaching in the baseline with higher wue the deep percolation of irrigation water decreases and thus there is less net salt leaching of irrigation besides the water saving and the net salt accumulation in root zone in the entire hid significantly increase with higher wue fig 7c notably when wue increases the planting area slightly declines under the baseline water supply fig 7a while significantly increases under the 30 water supply reduction fig 7b in all sub irrigation districts this is because i under the baseline water supply wue increase exacerbates soil salinization and thus reduces crop yields via salinity stress effects land fallow occurs when the unit gross revenue of crop planting is less than the unit planting cost for the entire hid land fallow area accounts for 0 05 0 53 2 44 and 4 96 when wue increases by 5 15 25 and 35 respectively under the baseline water supply ii however under the 30 water supply reduction water shortage limits crop planting area whereas water saving reduces crop water use per unit area alleviating water shortage and thus increasing irrigated area for the entire hid when wue increase by 35 the planting area increase from 328 thousand ha to 476 thousand ha under 30 water supply reduction reflecting an area increase of 45 fig 7b concerns exist with regard to the rebound effect of adopting new irrigation water saving technologies in china and elsewhere li and zhao 2018 song et al 2018 this effect has been confirmed and analyzed for the hid in a recent study xu and song 2022 which identified sown area expansion planting structure adjustment irrigation proportion expansion and increase in irrigation intensity as the reasons of growing irrigation water use under irrigation efficiency improvement although change in irrigation intensity is not considered in our model due to its fixed irrigation quota by crop the scenario results fig 7b reflect irrigated area expansion and planting structural changes when irrigation water use efficiency increases under water scarcity i e 30 irrigation water supply reduction in addition irrigation modernization represented by wue increase in the irrigation water saving scenario modifies water and salt balance leading to less irrigation percolation and more salt accumulation in root zone soil and groundwater under the baseline water supply water saving irrigation which improves wue results in net benefit losses in hid fig 9a this is consistent with the negative relationship between wue and agriculture benefit in hid reported in x li et al 2020a the net benefits in entire hid will decrease from 6 578 billion yuan in base year to 6 371 5 930 5 455 and 4 947 billion yuan when wue increases by 5 15 25 and 35 respectively fig 9a the net benefit losses are contributed by i increased irrigation investment fig 7d and ii yield decline due to worsened soil salinization fig 7c the unit cost of water saving is 1 11 1 22 1 33 and 1 46 yuan m3 when wue increases by 5 15 25 and 35 fig 7d respectively significantly higher than the water cost of 0 03 yuan m3 in base year indicating water saving irrigation will significantly increase unit cost of irrigation water in hid thus there is no incentive for the farmers to adopt or expand water saving irrigation under the baseline water supply condition however with 30 water supply reduction the net benefit change from 5 135 billion yuan to 5 696 5 697 5 384 and 4 942 billion yuan when wue increases by 5 15 25 and 35 respectively showing a first increasing and then decreasing trend fig 7e results show water saving irrigation can increase economic benefits when water shortage limits agricultural production and an optimal level of water saving investment exists and can be identified by this model water saving by improving wue in the hid may reduce water diversion from the yellow river and leave more water for the downstream however it will likely exacerbate soil salinization besides agriculture net benefits may increase or decrease depending on the severity of water shortage and the level of water saving investment an optimal level of water saving irrigation exists for a given level of water shortage as suggested by the convex net benefit curves in fig 7e with water supply at the baseline level farmers may be disincentivized to adopt water saving irrigation given net benefit losses and worsened soil salinization and as such water saving irrigation will have to rely on investment from the government in this circumstance however water shortage in the hid can make water saving irrigation beneficial fig 7e thus incentivizing farmers to invest in water saving irrigation therefore irrigation water saving or raising wue in the hid should not be considered separately from irrigation water availability namely the amount of yellow river diversion 4 2 4 alternative crop commodity prices crop commodity market prices directly affect farmers land use decisions water allocation and crop revenues in irrigated agriculture jiang et al 2016 li et al 2018 to examine the effects of crop price change on planting areas and revenues we vary crop price from 25 to 300 of the base year price of a crop at an interval of 25 base year price and re run the optimization model for each price change this procedure is repeated for each of the six crops fig 8a shows percent planting area changes in the hid under the crop price scenarios results show when crop commodity market prices increase planting area of each price increasing crop will increase accordingly but with different levels the curve slopes in fig 8a reflect the sensitivity of each crop planting area change to crop commodity prices increase fig 8b shows the average planting area percent changes of all crops in entire hid when each crop commodity market prices are 25 and 200 of the base year values when crop prices double the planting areas of wheat melon tomato maize sunflowers and cucurbit increase by 8 87 179 41 44 and 81 respectively the area of tomato is mostly sensitive to price changes followed by melon cucurbit sunflowers maize and wheat this indicates high value cash crops are much more sensitive to crop market price increase than staple crops so as to maximize agriculture net benefits thus the sensitivity of crop planting area to crop market price increase depend on the economic value of crops the magnitude of price change of a crop positively affects planting area of the crop fig 8a in addition we find that the summer crops i e tomato wheat and melon are more sensitive to own price changes than fall crops i e cucurbit maize and sunflowers indicating farmers decision making behavior on summer crop planting area are more susceptible to external market prices decrease the main reason is the fall crops have approximately four times of planting area than summer crops and is more robust and resilient to crop commodity prices decrease from fig 8b when own prices reduces to 25 base year prices the average planting areas reduce by 70 60 70 57 58 and 58 for wheat melon tomato maize sunflowers and cucurbit respectively however the effects of price decline of a crop on the areas of other crops are rather small ranging from 1 5 thus price decline of a crop commodity can significantly reduce the planting area of the crop itself but does not substantially affect other crops however an increase in the price of one crop commodity can produce significant crowding out effects on other crops and significantly affect agricultural benefits as shown in figs 8b and 9b respectively the results show i an increase in cucurbit price does not generate obvious impacts on the areas of other crops due to the small share of cucurbit area in the hid however when sunflowers price doubles the planting areas of wheat tomato maize and cucurbit reduce by 51 34 39 and 19 respectively indicating the obvious crowding out effects the reason is the planting area of sunflowers is the largest and it accounts for about 45 of gross planting area in the surface water irrigation area of hid therefore the share of planting area is one of the factors affecting the crowding out effects ii when the commodity market prices of melon tomato and sunflowers double wheat area reduces most seriously fig 8b from the perspective of farmers decision making behavior the market price increases of cash crops namely melon or tomato significantly reduce the planting area of low value wheat which competes for land and water with these two cash crops in the summer growing season leading to pronounced crowding out effects therefore necessary policy intervention such as wheat planting subsidies should be considered to alleviate wheat planting area reduction to enhance food security in the hid when market prices of cash crops rise significantly besides results indicate crop price is one of the factors affecting the crowding out effects iii when market price of maize doubles the planting area of maize increases by 41 while that of sunflowers reduces by 36 fig 8b when market prices of sunflowers doubles the planting area of sunflowers increase by 44 while that of maize reduce by 36 thus there are significant mutual crowding out effects between maize and sunflowers due to water competition between maize and sunflowers which share the same scarce water supply source in july september thus the existence of water competition among crops i e same growing season is one of the factors affecting the crowding out effects therefore the crowding out effects of price increasing crops on other crops is controlled by their shares in total planting area crop prices and water competition among crops price decline of a crop can lead to significant area reduction of that particular crop but cannot generate major impacts on the areas of other crops however an increase in the price of a cash crop can significantly reduce the planting area of wheat suggesting that policy interventions such as subsidies may be required from a food security perspective in this circumstance 5 conclusions in this study we develop a regional integrated hydro agro economic optimization model to explore effective management and policy solutions for the challenges confronted with irrigation districts in arid or semi arid regions using the hid as an example besides optimizing water allocation and crop areas the model simulates salt balance in crop root zone and the effects of soil salinity on crop yields it is verified to be robust against uncertainties of the values of several key parameters such as initial groundwater depth and salinity initial root zone soil salinity and irrigation leaching coefficient of root zone through sensitivity analysis the model is calibrated using the positive mathematical programming approach and can reliably replicate base year observations of input and output quantities four critical challenges confronted with the case study area in the yellow river basin are analyzed including the effects of water supply reduction winter irrigation effectiveness of water saving irrigation and crop commodity market risks we attain the following conclusions through scenario analysis 1 water supply reduction if implemented without complementary measures such as water saving irrigation will reduce crop planting areas and exacerbate soil salinization leading to reduced agricultural net benefits in the hid the areas of grain crops will be preferentially reduced whereas the areas of high value cash crops will be less affected the marginal value of irrigation water in july september with high crop water requirement becomes significantly higher than that of april june under the same level of water supply reduction 2 winter irrigation can increase soil moisture retention and summer crop planting areas it also increases net salt leaching from crop root zone reduces crop salt stress and improves net benefits and environmental sustainability in the hid a decision on whether to reduce winter irrigation in the hid and the magnitude of reduction must consider the benefit that the saved water can generate elsewhere in the yellow river basin 3 water saving irrigation which improves irrigation water use efficiency can alleviate water shortage but may significantly reduce net salt leaching due to less irrigation percolation with adequate amount of irrigation water supply as specified in the baseline i e 2019 observations water saving irrigation incurs a net benefit loss in the hid due to the cost of investing in water saving technologies and crop yield reduction under increased soil salinity caused by reduced salt leaching however with water shortage water saving irrigation can help maintain crop planting areas and stabilize agricultural benefit 4 the crowding out effect of price increase of one crop on other crops is controlled by area share of the crop crop price and the water shortage and water competition among crops an increase in the price of a cash crop in the summer growing season namely melon or tomato can significantly reduce the planting area of wheat which competes for land and water with these two cash crops and may jeopardize food security policy intervention may need to be considered to ensure food security when crop commodity prices fluctuate drastically although the model presented in this paper is developed using data from the hid it can be modified to analyze arid and semi arid region irrigated agricultural production elsewhere without substantial changes in model structure as a modeling framework for screening effective technological management and policy interventions for enhancing profitability and environmental sustainability of irrigated farming in arid and semi arid environment it provides a holistic perspective and useful insights for water land and salinity management water saving irrigation investment and market risk management nevertheless this study is not without limitation first the model runs for a single year considering salt balance in crop root zone and groundwater however given the intertemporal nature of soil salinity accumulation multi year analysis is required to analyze the long term cumulative effects of water management and crop plating structure on salinization and agricultural production second we focus on the surface irrigation area of the hid which accounts for 91 of the total irrigated area the well irrigated and combined well canal irrigated areas which is in northern hid and accounts for the rest 9 of the gross irrigated areas is not modeled the groundwater table in the northern hid has been gradually decreasing due to increasing groundwater pumping for irrigation groundwater table decline negatively affects natural vegetation which is strongly dependent on groundwater and is the important ecological security barrier in the hid therefore future research needs to analyze conjunctive use of surface and groundwater and impacts of groundwater irrigation on groundwater dependent ecosystems in the hid third we treat each sub irrigation district as a spatially homogenous area in the model to represent the spatial heterogeneity of land productivity soil salinity and groundwater table future research may consider combining distributed hydrological models especially a groundwater model with the hydro agro economic optimization model those models can take advantage of geographic information system gis and remote sensing information to improve the representation of spatial heterogeneity in the integrated model addressing the dual challenge of water scarcity and salinization in semi arid and arid region irrigated agricultural production requires taking a holistic approach in water and salinity management pursuing more crop per drop through irrigation water saving is naturally important however reduced irrigation deep percolation lessens salt leaching and can seriously impair crop productivity and production beyond the biophysical factors price fluctuation of agricultural market can alter planting structure and scale amid these intertwinedness and uncertainty hydro agro economic optimization provides a means to explore effective management alternatives towards the goals of maximizing profitability while maintaining environmental sustainability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

agriculture and technology nairobi kenya jomo kenyatta university of agriculture and technology nairobi kenya handling editor dr b e clothier farmer led irrigation development flid is not a new phenomenon and has been happening throughout the centuries in all countries where irrigation is practised despite this planners policy makers funders including engineers have generally taken the perception that irrigation development occurs mainly in irrigation schemes although farmer led irrigation happens in formal irrigation schemes there is a substantive amount of irrigation development implemented quietly by self motivated individual farmers on their own initiatives such irrigation remains unrecognized un recorded and thus ignored in the realm of the irrigation sector decision makers the term flid was coined just recently in 2017 and through it there is emerging a wealth of knowledge on the technologies practices economic marketing financing and social components regarding how this sub sector operates indeed flid is not tacitly captured in kenya s policies statutes and development plans its extent is largely unknown since it has not been targeted in any mapping exercise yet as irrigation transitions more from public to private investment flid is the next big thing pushing the growth of irrigation in kenya this paper therefore highlights some of the salient features of flid a sub sector of interest towards enhancing irrigation development and food security in kenya keywords irrigation farmer led institutions kenya policies data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there is renewed impetus to expand and promote irrigation development in kenya over the next decade and beyond according to the national water master plan 2030 gok 2013 irrigation potential in kenya without water storage is estimated at 1 2 million ha but this differs slightly with the potential of 1 342 million ha as per fao 2018 but the kenya vision 2030 gok 2007 goes further and points out that additionally there are some 9 2 million hectares in arid and semi arid lands asals which have the potential for crop production if irrigated this is a powerful statement that gets omitted in most planning and policy documents including the current national irrigation policy gok 2017 it therefore means that the irrigation potential is underestimated and much greater than listed in most reports generally only 15 of potential irrigable area of kenya has been developed nia 2019 indeed the future growth and development of the agricultural sector in kenya will rely on developing the 83 of land that is asal as well as intensifying production in the other arable areas through irrigation irrigation development is a viable option for increasing agricultural production through resource mobilization improved water productivity as well as food security however investments in irrigation go beyond food security as they can be used to address poverty alleviation wealth and employment creation in the country yet poverty reduction through irrigation is not very evident as a policy objective in kenya despite the fact that farmers who have access to irrigation are likely to attain better crop productivity and higher incomes furthermore the importance of irrigation is becoming critical with emerging climate change and climate variability which render rain fed farming risky these considerations mean that there should be greater policy support funding capacity development and promotion of flid as an important irrigation sub sector 2 irrigation as defined in kenya s laws and policies irrigation in kenya is viewed in terms of irrigation schemes indeed the former irrigation act cap 347 republic of kenya 1966 defined scheme as any area designated to be a national irrigation scheme under section 14 of the act the idea that irrigation only happens in schemes seems to have permeated across the decades to the present time even contemporary policies laws and guidelines have this connotation for instance the current irrigation act 2019 republic of kenya 2019 defines irrigation scheme as a systematic and orderly irrigation system covering a defined area of land regardless of the type or system of irrigation employed the same irrigation act 2019 further defines irrigation as any process other than by natural precipitation which supplies water to crops or any other cultivated plants livestock aquaculture and desired forest trees as a technical definition this is fine but does not introduce the fact that irrigation in kenya exists in the absence of a scheme inherently an individual irrigator is construed to be a scheme this is still not accommodating of individual irrigators when tallying the areas under irrigation and thus policy support 3 water scarcity in the face of irrigation expansion the available policies and statutes do not classify irrigation according to water use big or small users or types of use in kenya e g full control irrigation supplemental irrigation and other scales of water use a clear understanding of these scales is necessary in terms of water allocation and supplies which are core components of irrigation development and management this is because water use and users have been increasing rapidly this is associated with demand for fresh produce due to increasing urbanization leading to expansion of irrigated areas in addition there is higher per capita water usage from domestic commercial and industrial sectors all of which utilize more water an assessment conducted by world bank s water resources group 2030 wrg 2016 revealed that kenya faces absolute water scarcity with respect to availability of renewable freshwater driven by population growth kenya s renewable internal freshwater per capita has decreased by an average of 2 6 annually from 556 cubic meters in 2007 461 cubic meters in 2014 over the same period annual freshwater withdrawals per capita have increased by 2 0 annually from 62 to 72 cubic meters given the growing water scarcity there is need for interventions that support the uptake of water efficient irrigation technologies as well as developing unconventional sources water e g rainfall runoff harvesting and storage flid is quietly taking up this space but there is little data as evidence due to invisibility of the sub sector 4 characterization of irrigation schemes by ownership and management irrigated areas in kenya are classified according to the size of a scheme as defined in irrigation act 2019 republic of kenya 2019 and expounded by the irrigation guidelines mwsandi 2020a the guidelines further categorize irrigation schemes by ownership and management namely public and national community based and private owned these are described as follows a public and national irrigation schemes these are schemes developed on public land and managed by public institutions more specifically these schemes are developed and managed by the national irrigation authority nia regional development authorities rdas the agricultural development corporation the national youth service the prisons universities colleges and other state entities the size of public scheme range from 40 to 12 000 ha in area altogether public schemes cover 22 028 ha in area which is about 10 9 of all irrigated lands table 1 examples of public irrigation schemes include mwea bura hola perkerra ahero and west kano which are managed by nia as settlement schemes generally there are shared mandates for the management of these schemes through irrigation water users associations iwuas nia provides advisory services operation and maintenance while the farmers pay irrigation service fees through their respective iwuas b community based irrigation schemes are schemes owned by individual farmers or groups sharing an irrigation facility e g a canal pipeline or pump these schemes are managed through iwuas cooperatives or self help groups the irrigation regulations 2020 mwsandi 2020b require that self help groups should transit into iwuas there are over 3600 community based irrigation schemes in kenya covering over 99 964 ha of land equivalent to 49 5 of the country s developed irrigable area community based schemes produce the bulk of horticultural produce for domestic and export markets other crops grown include grain staples and tubers these schemes provide economic empowerment of rural communities and farmers as it becomes possible to bridge rainfall deficits by irrigating niche crops community based schemes have lower overhead construction and management costs and are relatively sustainable c private irrigation schemes are developed by private companies or individuals and tend to be large scale in area and or highly commercialized they cover over 79 970 ha accounting for 39 6 of irrigated land most private schemes utilize high technology and produce high value crops for the local and export market especially flowers fruits and vegetables they offer employment to local people and also support small scale irrigators by sub contracting them as out growers for some of their produce 5 classification of irrigation schemes by scale of holding size generally irrigation in kenya is typified by size of land holding under fully managed water systems according to the irrigation act 2019 republic of kenya 2019 kenya s irrigation sector is classified as into three types by area of schemes i e large medium or small scale viz i large scale irrigation scheme a scheme which acreage size covers over 1200 ha and is developed and managed by nia and is established for national strategic purposes or such schemes as implemented by the private sector ii medium scale irrigation scheme a scheme which in acreage size covers over 40 1200 ha and is implemented by nia or another state agency in collaboration with county government or such schemes as implemented by a private entity iii small scale irrigation scheme a scheme which in acreage size covers less than 40 ha and is implemented by a county government or by the national government through authority in case of trans boundary or inter county schemes or strategic schemes or such schemes as implemented by a private entity from the foregoing it is apparent that flid has not been tacitly factored in the irrigation act 2019 6 small scale farming vs smallholder irrigation a small scale farm under rainfed agriculture is different from the scales under irrigated systems the agriculture sector development strategy asds gok 2010 described small scale farming as production carried out on farms averaging 0 2 3 ha mainly in the high potential areas neither the agriculture fisheries and food authority act affa republic of kenya 2013 nor the agricultural transformation and growth strategy astgs 2019 2029 provide a definition for smallholder irrigated agriculture but the closest the astgs gets to define small scale farmers is clustering them under small medium enterprise sme defined as both formal and informal businesses concentrated in urban and peri urban areas kenyan smes have 10 100 employees and an annual turnover of less than us 5000 50 000 in 2019 per year there is therefore need for a clear understanding of what constitutes a small scale farmer under rainfed agriculture as compared to that under irrigated agriculture the irrigation act republic of kenya 2019 defines smallholder irrigation and drainage scheme as an irrigation scheme that is developed owned and managed by communities as irrigation water user groups or individual farmers the act did not allocate the command area for this sub sector thus smallholder irrigation is inherently presumed to be small scale in size the word scheme runs through and individual irrigators are presumed to be schemes but therein lies the disconnect because there exists large numbers of small scale individual irrigators who may not belong to a scheme and are thus not adequately accommodated by being defined as a scheme 7 small scale irrigation has been increasing there is ample evidence to show that small scale irrigation ssi has been increasing despite the lack of clarity on the exact areas irrigated or the number of farmers benefitting a study by hornum and bolwig 2020 documented that ssi was steadily growing overtaking both large public schemes and commercial schemes to cover about 110 000 ha data from the ministry of water sanitation and irrigation showed that ssi commands 54 of irrigated land in kenya mwsandi 2020c meanwhile other organizations and farmers themselves have been developing irrigation this is referred to as farmer led irrigation development flid the extra irrigation expansion under flid has not been mapped nor quantified thus the overall irrigated area crops produced number of farmers engaged and activities outside of formal irrigation schemes are generally unknown and are expected to be higher than what is quoted in government reports 8 farmer led irrigation development flid defined farmer led irrigation development flid has been defined wiggins and lankford 2019 as when farmers drive the establishment improvement and or expansion of irrigated agriculture and influence the location purpose and design of irrigation development through small scale on farm locally relevant and market oriented solutions the term flid was coined in 2017 and described as a process where farmers alone or as a collective take the driving seat to improve irrigation development by acquiring technologies for agricultural water use and by developing associated input and output linkages woodhouse et al 2017 yet a clearer definition has been proffered by the african union 2020 which describes flid as a process where farmers assume a driving role in improving their water use for agriculture by bringing about changes in knowledge production technology use investment patterns and market linkages and the governance of land and water flid does not include highly commercial farms some of which are small in size e g flower farms as those are already clustered under private schemes all these definitions agree that flid relates to irrigation developed by farmer s for the farmer s through mostly individual or collective initiatives and investments 9 characteristics of flid flid initiatives cut across existing irrigation types in terms of scale technologies crops and governance arrangements farmers bring in or develop new ideas and technologies change investment patterns and create new knowledge inevitably involving other actors such as local communities government or private sector they are also widely diverse in their scale technology applications and farming methods the operation and management decisions and actions under flid are fully controlled by farmers typically farmer led irrigation enterprises have the following characteristics world bank 2021 1 typically grow high value crops for urban peri urban and in some cases export markets 2 is small scale 40 ha and typically irrigate small fields of 0 5 2 ha 3 includes both individual initiatives and group schemes 4 is self funded mostly and largely managed by farmers 5 tends to adopt multiple cropping 6 usually adopts market oriented crop enterprises 7 often but not necessarily use pumped systems manual small petrol or solar pumps 8 high reliance on shallow wells in the case of individual irrigation systems water harvesting storages or direct river pumping 9 farmers grow mainly horticultural or high value crops 10 family labor on smaller plots and use of employed paid labor on larger farms flid encompasses beyond just a technology e g small pumps it is about a dynamic and unfolding development process recognition of this process requires a reflexive approach that first aims to understand local diversity strengths and weaknesses of the system then identifies opportunities and interventions that may catalyse positive change world bank 2021 granted that highly commercial privately owned irrigated farms e g flower farms are developed through farmers initiatives but these are already recognized as private irrigation schemes in kenya and thus are not considered to be flid 10 basic typologies of flid generally two typologies of flid are distinguished african union 2020 as follows i individual private irrigation for high value crops these are farmers who assume a driving role in improving their water use for agriculture in particular irrigation they are characterized by their independent entrepreneurial nature private financing and ability to take risk thus amenable to try new initiatives ii small scale community based irrigation schemes these are small group schemes quite often developed through integrated rural development natural resources management community driven development cdd self help groups or social fund projects regardless of typology farmer led irrigation initiatives cut across diverse scales technologies crops management and governance arrangements flid is not limited to a defined range of farm sizes but typically involves farmers on less than 10 ha of land but a majority cultivate less than 2 ha the main focus of flid is smallholders because they are generally less equipped financially technically and in their access to knowledge to overcome the constraints posed by unfavorable operating environments this does not mean that flid has a small impact on the contrary while individual farms are usually small flid is spread throughout the country to the extent that collectively its impacts on food production the economy and livelihoods is substantive however the extent of flid in kenya has not been unmapped and thus remains unknown 11 opportunities in farmer led irrigation development the rapid growth and entrepreneurial nature of flid offers inherent opportunities for developing the infrastructure technologies water markets and commercialization of irrigated agriculture within africa flid has gained traction in recent years and is identified as the dominant process driving agricultural water expansion in the continent african union 2020 at the farm level water availability within or close to farmlands usually facilitates adoption of irrigation with or without external support flid thus provides opportunity for farmers to invest in their own irrigation systems as simple and affordable irrigation methods to be used otherwise uptake of irrigation technologies is sometimes limited by high initial capital investment and operating costs as is common in large scale public irrigation schemes flid is relatively sustainable as it is free from undue pressures that slow down decision making in large public schemes flid farmers are normally innovative and ready to take risks through own funded initiatives they sometimes use funds from other sources to try new ideas and technologies and are able to overcome various challenges faced in smallholder irrigation and increase the profitability of their crops in addition the inherent unregulated character of farmer led irrigation means that they operate with minimal government interference and decision making is at an individual level that way technology adoption is more rapid and the farmer adapts to changing circumstances easily within africa there is growing evidence that flid has recorded better success rates and fewer failures than schemes under public sector management in essence flid systems take up the largest share of irrigated land in many countries in sub saharan africa accounting for at least 83 of irrigation development over the last 20 years world bank 2021 12 drivers of flid kenya is urbanizing rapidly with migration of mainly youth from rural to urban areas this is driven by limited rural income opportunities that are compounded by low labor productivity due to low intensity farming urbanization is associated with higher incomes and changing lifestyles which leads to shifts in food preferences mainly increased demand for high value products such as meat dairy fruit and vegetables the changes in food preferences leads to increased markets for crops from irrigated agriculture which in turn require commanded water for production the pull factor of urbanization thus accelerates irrigation uptake and presents opportunity for introduction of new irrigation technologies such as energy efficient solar pumps or improved water application systems associated with peri urban farming this demand is mostly met by smallholder market oriented producers typically farming horticultural crops through irrigation these market oriented entrepreneurial small scale farmers have been at the forefront of irrigation expansion across africa over the last two decades woodhouse et al 2017 the main drivers of flid include 1 availability of appropriate irrigation technologies including water supplies control and efficient application methods 2 land tenure and water security 3 access to finance credit and investment opportunities usually through appropriate business models for farmers operating at different scales 4 affordable irrigation equipment to generate greater economic returns 5 input market value chains making it easier to access input markets for technology buyers spares fertilizers seeds and irrigation equipment 6 easy access to output markets and favorable farm gate pricing of irrigated produce 7 information and knowledge flows through opportunities such as the internet radio tv mobile phones print media and farmer to farmer visits 8 highly developed mobile money transfer e g m pesa enabling remote farming financial transactions and knowledge flows more versatile and practical and 9 a relatively well educated farming clientele willing to invest funds from other sources e g employment retirement benefits other businesses in irrigated agriculture 13 main challenges facing flid in kenya one of the major challenges facing flid is its lack of recognition in the policies and institutions responsible for irrigated agriculture in kenya although flid is not new having been practiced over many years the sub sector got recognition at the international level just recently woodhouse et al 2017 within kenya the equating of irrigation development to infer irrigation scheme has meant that flid misses out on policy support resource allocation as well as planning alongside other sectors although apex policies e g kenya vision 2030 support small scale irrigation and private enterprise but flid had not been defined at the time of its formulation the water act 2016 republic of kenya 2016 heavily dwells on drinking water including environmental flows but completely omits irrigation the agricultural sector transformation for growth strategy gok 2019b tends to favor large scale irrigation at the expense of ssi and flid even then a number of statutes articulate small scale irrigation ssi e g irrigation act 2019 republic of kenya 2019 but it is silent on flid despite this the largest cluster of small scale irrigators are individual farmers flid is almost invisible in kenya s policies legal regulatory and planning instruments and thus misses out on development support meanwhile non governmental organizations ngos and various private sector actors e g banks microfinance institutions equipment supplier off takers and other value chain actors support or interact with flid directly and indirectly however it is not clear who is doing what where as a census of the key actors in flid has not been conducted despite the challenges flid has continued to grow with minimal policy support e g the benefits accorded to ssi in publicly developed irrigation schemes do not reach individual irrigators institutional support e g capacity building subsidies access to information and other incentives are not always availed to flid most individual farmers do not belong to groups hence have no means to express their problems or gain from group marketing or extension services generally flid doesn t feature when irrigation is being enumerated the contribution of flid to irrigation largely remains unknown yet it is huge and growing and thus not adequately accounted for or factored in development planning individual farmers engaged in flid operate almost their own 14 guidelines for irrigation design and development irrigation development in kenya is guided by the irrigation general regulations 2020 mwsandi 2020b which are in turn pegged on the broader water resources regulations gok 2020 on their part the irrigation regulations outline modalities for irrigation development licensing management and financing alongside these regulations the government also developed the irrigation guidelines mows i 2020a which guide the promotion development and management of irrigation schemes in kenya both the regulations and guidelines clearly articulate who can initiate an irrigation scheme or investment and how they allow that an individual a developer a community county or national government can initiate an irrigation scheme also an owner developer or any other person intending to construct an irrigation scheme is supposed to submit to the supervising entity the following mowsi 2020a a pre feasibility study report or initial project identification concept note showing viability b minutes of resolutions of stakeholders meetings endorsing or requesting for development of the irrigation scheme where applicable c feasibility study report d irrigation project design report e an authorization for construction from the water resources authority f land use authorization from the county or national ministry responsible for land and physical planning and g an environmental impact assessment license from national environmental management authority h evidence of relevant easements from relevant agencies and entities i in respect to irrigation within private and community based smallholder schemes provide proof of land ownership which may consist of a certified copy of title deed or lease agreement and j for community based smallholder irrigation schemes evidence of existence of an irrigation water users association generally according to the regulations all small scale county public and county initiated irrigation schemes should be supervised by the county irrigation development units cidus while all other schemes are supervised by the national irrigation authority however this is more in theory than in practice there are many instances where irrigation is developed through individual or community initiatives with little or no involvement of nia or county government generally most flid is un supervised at construction and largely un regulated at operational level the result is water abstractions that are unknown or not accounted for many irrigated areas in eastern and central kenya are faced with water shortages as a result this underscores the need to accord flid some recognition both to support the sub sector as well as to streamline its operations including water allocation marketing and capacity growth 15 conclusions flid like other modes of irrigation requires proper design development operation and management design and respective reviews are made during planning of the irrigation system this task is supposed to be the responsibility of qualified preferably certified engineers working with agronomists hydrologists and other professionals they are expected to check the functionality of infrastructure water supplies and distribution systems water storage control structures measuring devices on farm irrigation works and drainage designs are expected to be made along with cost estimates in addition water allocation and availability should be determined ifad and ifc 2022 in addition water supply rates should match crop water requirements as embedded in the irrigation design for system efficiency infrastructure development involves construction works that prepare land and bring the water for irrigation the main activities include development of water sources conveyance infrastructure e g canals pipe layouts as well as field levelling laying field pipe networks and drainage works it also includes selection of water application equipment e g sprinklers drip lines and their accessories the construction and operation of irrigation system should factor all hydrological processes so as to ensure environmental flows are retained in water courses but this is sometimes overlooked under flid irrigation design may also involve water harvesting and storage infrastructure as well as construction and rehabilitation of community small dams water pans and auxiliary infrastructure it is usually necessary to support establishment of farmer groups which in turn take over the operation management and maintenance of schemes the expansion of flid is premised on the realization that it has grown into a vibrant and expanding sub sector that can attract investments with good returns moreover opportunities are emerging to expand irrigation in peri urban farming and asset management is better assured under flid than conventional public schemes 16 recommendations there is need to support farmer led irrigation development given the growing evidence that flid has recorded better success rates and fewer failures than schemes under public sector management this sub sector comprises individuals and small groups who make their own investments to advance irrigation in addition flid has unique entrepreneurial self financing and market oriented niche seeking interventions which are relatively low cost as compared to large scale irrigation schemes the scope for irrigation expansion using private finance is huge through flid within kenya the extent of flid has not been mapped in ways that accommodate individual irrigation for this reason flid sub sector requires targeted assessment including mapping to explore its extent impacts and opportunities for upscaling it was noted that flid misses out on various subsidies incentives and opportunities accorded publicly funded irrigation schemes in kenya due to its being invisible as a specific irrigation typology it is therefore necessary to deliberately channel resources to support flid through projects subsidies incentives capacity building and access to information for flid farmers there is need to adopt water efficient irrigation systems in the past irrigation schemes were designed with little concern for water wastage or losses but in modern times as water scarcity becomes more acute there is need to improve the water productivity of crops and the overall efficiency of irrigation especially under flid there are many options to achieve this such as efficient new designs rehabilitation of old water conveyance and application systems e g lining canals or using piped conveyance others include converting water application methods from basin to furrow or from sprinkler to drip irrigation water saving practices such as choice of crop variety agronomic management prevention of excessive evaporation losses e g use of mulches and shade nets wind breaks or use of sunken beds planting basins to concentrate soil moisture absorption among other techniques flid requires institutional support across all fronts this could be in the design water pans wells gravity diversion works efficient water application methods such as drip systems energy for water pumping such as solar powered pumps improving water productivity and ultimately economic returns from flid data and information is scanty on flid as research has not been focused on the sub sector there is need for research on flid across all its components to advice policy and other actors in the irrigated agriculture space declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

agriculture and technology nairobi kenya jomo kenyatta university of agriculture and technology nairobi kenya handling editor dr b e clothier farmer led irrigation development flid is not a new phenomenon and has been happening throughout the centuries in all countries where irrigation is practised despite this planners policy makers funders including engineers have generally taken the perception that irrigation development occurs mainly in irrigation schemes although farmer led irrigation happens in formal irrigation schemes there is a substantive amount of irrigation development implemented quietly by self motivated individual farmers on their own initiatives such irrigation remains unrecognized un recorded and thus ignored in the realm of the irrigation sector decision makers the term flid was coined just recently in 2017 and through it there is emerging a wealth of knowledge on the technologies practices economic marketing financing and social components regarding how this sub sector operates indeed flid is not tacitly captured in kenya s policies statutes and development plans its extent is largely unknown since it has not been targeted in any mapping exercise yet as irrigation transitions more from public to private investment flid is the next big thing pushing the growth of irrigation in kenya this paper therefore highlights some of the salient features of flid a sub sector of interest towards enhancing irrigation development and food security in kenya keywords irrigation farmer led institutions kenya policies data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there is renewed impetus to expand and promote irrigation development in kenya over the next decade and beyond according to the national water master plan 2030 gok 2013 irrigation potential in kenya without water storage is estimated at 1 2 million ha but this differs slightly with the potential of 1 342 million ha as per fao 2018 but the kenya vision 2030 gok 2007 goes further and points out that additionally there are some 9 2 million hectares in arid and semi arid lands asals which have the potential for crop production if irrigated this is a powerful statement that gets omitted in most planning and policy documents including the current national irrigation policy gok 2017 it therefore means that the irrigation potential is underestimated and much greater than listed in most reports generally only 15 of potential irrigable area of kenya has been developed nia 2019 indeed the future growth and development of the agricultural sector in kenya will rely on developing the 83 of land that is asal as well as intensifying production in the other arable areas through irrigation irrigation development is a viable option for increasing agricultural production through resource mobilization improved water productivity as well as food security however investments in irrigation go beyond food security as they can be used to address poverty alleviation wealth and employment creation in the country yet poverty reduction through irrigation is not very evident as a policy objective in kenya despite the fact that farmers who have access to irrigation are likely to attain better crop productivity and higher incomes furthermore the importance of irrigation is becoming critical with emerging climate change and climate variability which render rain fed farming risky these considerations mean that there should be greater policy support funding capacity development and promotion of flid as an important irrigation sub sector 2 irrigation as defined in kenya s laws and policies irrigation in kenya is viewed in terms of irrigation schemes indeed the former irrigation act cap 347 republic of kenya 1966 defined scheme as any area designated to be a national irrigation scheme under section 14 of the act the idea that irrigation only happens in schemes seems to have permeated across the decades to the present time even contemporary policies laws and guidelines have this connotation for instance the current irrigation act 2019 republic of kenya 2019 defines irrigation scheme as a systematic and orderly irrigation system covering a defined area of land regardless of the type or system of irrigation employed the same irrigation act 2019 further defines irrigation as any process other than by natural precipitation which supplies water to crops or any other cultivated plants livestock aquaculture and desired forest trees as a technical definition this is fine but does not introduce the fact that irrigation in kenya exists in the absence of a scheme inherently an individual irrigator is construed to be a scheme this is still not accommodating of individual irrigators when tallying the areas under irrigation and thus policy support 3 water scarcity in the face of irrigation expansion the available policies and statutes do not classify irrigation according to water use big or small users or types of use in kenya e g full control irrigation supplemental irrigation and other scales of water use a clear understanding of these scales is necessary in terms of water allocation and supplies which are core components of irrigation development and management this is because water use and users have been increasing rapidly this is associated with demand for fresh produce due to increasing urbanization leading to expansion of irrigated areas in addition there is higher per capita water usage from domestic commercial and industrial sectors all of which utilize more water an assessment conducted by world bank s water resources group 2030 wrg 2016 revealed that kenya faces absolute water scarcity with respect to availability of renewable freshwater driven by population growth kenya s renewable internal freshwater per capita has decreased by an average of 2 6 annually from 556 cubic meters in 2007 461 cubic meters in 2014 over the same period annual freshwater withdrawals per capita have increased by 2 0 annually from 62 to 72 cubic meters given the growing water scarcity there is need for interventions that support the uptake of water efficient irrigation technologies as well as developing unconventional sources water e g rainfall runoff harvesting and storage flid is quietly taking up this space but there is little data as evidence due to invisibility of the sub sector 4 characterization of irrigation schemes by ownership and management irrigated areas in kenya are classified according to the size of a scheme as defined in irrigation act 2019 republic of kenya 2019 and expounded by the irrigation guidelines mwsandi 2020a the guidelines further categorize irrigation schemes by ownership and management namely public and national community based and private owned these are described as follows a public and national irrigation schemes these are schemes developed on public land and managed by public institutions more specifically these schemes are developed and managed by the national irrigation authority nia regional development authorities rdas the agricultural development corporation the national youth service the prisons universities colleges and other state entities the size of public scheme range from 40 to 12 000 ha in area altogether public schemes cover 22 028 ha in area which is about 10 9 of all irrigated lands table 1 examples of public irrigation schemes include mwea bura hola perkerra ahero and west kano which are managed by nia as settlement schemes generally there are shared mandates for the management of these schemes through irrigation water users associations iwuas nia provides advisory services operation and maintenance while the farmers pay irrigation service fees through their respective iwuas b community based irrigation schemes are schemes owned by individual farmers or groups sharing an irrigation facility e g a canal pipeline or pump these schemes are managed through iwuas cooperatives or self help groups the irrigation regulations 2020 mwsandi 2020b require that self help groups should transit into iwuas there are over 3600 community based irrigation schemes in kenya covering over 99 964 ha of land equivalent to 49 5 of the country s developed irrigable area community based schemes produce the bulk of horticultural produce for domestic and export markets other crops grown include grain staples and tubers these schemes provide economic empowerment of rural communities and farmers as it becomes possible to bridge rainfall deficits by irrigating niche crops community based schemes have lower overhead construction and management costs and are relatively sustainable c private irrigation schemes are developed by private companies or individuals and tend to be large scale in area and or highly commercialized they cover over 79 970 ha accounting for 39 6 of irrigated land most private schemes utilize high technology and produce high value crops for the local and export market especially flowers fruits and vegetables they offer employment to local people and also support small scale irrigators by sub contracting them as out growers for some of their produce 5 classification of irrigation schemes by scale of holding size generally irrigation in kenya is typified by size of land holding under fully managed water systems according to the irrigation act 2019 republic of kenya 2019 kenya s irrigation sector is classified as into three types by area of schemes i e large medium or small scale viz i large scale irrigation scheme a scheme which acreage size covers over 1200 ha and is developed and managed by nia and is established for national strategic purposes or such schemes as implemented by the private sector ii medium scale irrigation scheme a scheme which in acreage size covers over 40 1200 ha and is implemented by nia or another state agency in collaboration with county government or such schemes as implemented by a private entity iii small scale irrigation scheme a scheme which in acreage size covers less than 40 ha and is implemented by a county government or by the national government through authority in case of trans boundary or inter county schemes or strategic schemes or such schemes as implemented by a private entity from the foregoing it is apparent that flid has not been tacitly factored in the irrigation act 2019 6 small scale farming vs smallholder irrigation a small scale farm under rainfed agriculture is different from the scales under irrigated systems the agriculture sector development strategy asds gok 2010 described small scale farming as production carried out on farms averaging 0 2 3 ha mainly in the high potential areas neither the agriculture fisheries and food authority act affa republic of kenya 2013 nor the agricultural transformation and growth strategy astgs 2019 2029 provide a definition for smallholder irrigated agriculture but the closest the astgs gets to define small scale farmers is clustering them under small medium enterprise sme defined as both formal and informal businesses concentrated in urban and peri urban areas kenyan smes have 10 100 employees and an annual turnover of less than us 5000 50 000 in 2019 per year there is therefore need for a clear understanding of what constitutes a small scale farmer under rainfed agriculture as compared to that under irrigated agriculture the irrigation act republic of kenya 2019 defines smallholder irrigation and drainage scheme as an irrigation scheme that is developed owned and managed by communities as irrigation water user groups or individual farmers the act did not allocate the command area for this sub sector thus smallholder irrigation is inherently presumed to be small scale in size the word scheme runs through and individual irrigators are presumed to be schemes but therein lies the disconnect because there exists large numbers of small scale individual irrigators who may not belong to a scheme and are thus not adequately accommodated by being defined as a scheme 7 small scale irrigation has been increasing there is ample evidence to show that small scale irrigation ssi has been increasing despite the lack of clarity on the exact areas irrigated or the number of farmers benefitting a study by hornum and bolwig 2020 documented that ssi was steadily growing overtaking both large public schemes and commercial schemes to cover about 110 000 ha data from the ministry of water sanitation and irrigation showed that ssi commands 54 of irrigated land in kenya mwsandi 2020c meanwhile other organizations and farmers themselves have been developing irrigation this is referred to as farmer led irrigation development flid the extra irrigation expansion under flid has not been mapped nor quantified thus the overall irrigated area crops produced number of farmers engaged and activities outside of formal irrigation schemes are generally unknown and are expected to be higher than what is quoted in government reports 8 farmer led irrigation development flid defined farmer led irrigation development flid has been defined wiggins and lankford 2019 as when farmers

all these definitions agree that flid relates to irrigation developed by farmer s for the farmer s through mostly individual or collective initiatives and investments 9 characteristics of flid flid initiatives cut across existing irrigation types in terms of scale technologies crops and governance arrangements farmers bring in or develop new ideas and technologies change investment patterns and create new knowledge inevitably involving other actors such as local communities government or private sector they are also widely diverse in their scale technology applications and farming methods the operation and management decisions and actions under flid are fully controlled by farmers typically farmer led irrigation enterprises have the following characteristics world bank 2021 1 typically grow high value crops for urban peri urban and in some cases export markets 2 is small scale 40 ha and typically irrigate small fields of 0 5 2 ha 3 includes both individual initiatives and group

manual small petrol or solar pumps 8 high reliance on shallow wells in the case of individual irrigation systems water harvesting storages or direct river pumping 9 farmers grow mainly horticultural

development process recognition of this process requires a reflexive approach that first aims to understand local diversity strengths and weaknesses of the system then identifies opportunities and interventions that may catalyse positive change world bank 2021 granted that highly commercial privately owned irrigated farms e g flower farms are developed through farmers initiatives but these are already recognized as private irrigation schemes in kenya and thus are not considered to be flid 10 basic typologies of flid generally two typologies of flid are distinguished african union 2020 as follows i individual private irrigation for high value crops these are farmers who assume a driving role in improving their water use for agriculture in particular irrigation they are characterized by their independent entrepreneurial nature private financing and ability to take risk thus amenable to try new initiatives ii small scale community based irrigation schemes these are small group schemes quite often developed through integrated rural development natural resources management community driven development cdd self help groups or social fund projects regardless of typology farmer led irrigation initiatives cut across diverse scales technologies crops management and governance arrangements flid is not limited to a defined range of farm sizes but typically involves farmers on less than 10 ha of land but a majority cultivate less than 2 ha the main focus of flid is smallholders because they are generally less equipped financially technically and in their access to knowledge to overcome the constraints posed by unfavorable operating environments this does not mean that flid has a small impact on the contrary while individual farms are usually small flid is spread throughout the country to the extent that collectively its impacts on food production the economy and livelihoods is substantive however the extent of flid in kenya has not been unmapped and thus remains unknown 11 opportunities in farmer led irrigation development the rapid growth and entrepreneurial nature of flid offers inherent opportunities for developing the infrastructure technologies water markets and commercialization of irrigated agriculture within africa flid has gained traction in recent years and is identified as the dominant process driving agricultural water expansion in the continent african union 2020 at the farm level water availability within or close to farmlands usually facilitates adoption of irrigation with or without external support flid thus provides opportunity for farmers to invest in their own irrigation systems as simple and affordable irrigation methods to be used otherwise uptake of irrigation technologies is sometimes limited by high initial capital investment and operating costs as is common in large scale public irrigation schemes flid is relatively sustainable as it is free from undue pressures that slow down decision making in large public schemes flid farmers are normally innovative and ready to take risks through own funded initiatives they sometimes use funds from other sources to try new ideas and technologies and are able to overcome various challenges faced in smallholder irrigation and increase the profitability of their crops in addition the inherent unregulated character of farmer led irrigation means that they operate with minimal government interference and decision making is at an individual level that way technology adoption is more rapid and the farmer adapts to changing circumstances easily within africa there is growing evidence that flid has recorded better success rates and fewer failures than schemes under public sector management in essence flid systems take up the largest share of irrigated land in many countries in sub saharan africa accounting for at least 83 of irrigation development over the last 20 years world bank 2021 12 drivers of flid kenya is urbanizing rapidly with migration of mainly youth from rural to urban areas this is driven by limited rural income opportunities that are compounded by low labor productivity due to low intensity farming urbanization is associated with higher incomes and changing lifestyles which leads to shifts in food preferences mainly increased demand for high value products such as meat dairy fruit and vegetables the changes in food preferences leads to increased markets for crops from irrigated agriculture which in turn require commanded water for production the pull factor of urbanization thus accelerates irrigation uptake and presents opportunity for introduction of new irrigation technologies such as energy efficient solar pumps or improved water application systems associated with peri urban farming this demand is mostly met by smallholder market oriented producers typically farming horticultural crops through irrigation these market oriented entrepreneurial small scale farmers have been at the forefront of irrigation expansion across africa over the last two decades woodhouse et al 2017 the main drivers of flid include 1 availability of appropriate irrigation technologies including water supplies control and efficient application methods 2 land tenure and water security 3 access to finance credit and investment opportunities usually through appropriate business models for farmers operating at different scales 4 affordable irrigation equipment to generate greater economic returns 5 input market value chains making it easier to access input markets for technology buyers spares fertilizers seeds and irrigation equipment 6 easy access to output markets and favorable farm gate pricing of irrigated produce 7 information and knowledge flows through opportunities such as the internet radio tv mobile phones print media and farmer to farmer visits 8 highly developed mobile money transfer e g m pesa enabling remote farming financial transactions and knowledge flows more versatile and practical and 9 a relatively well educated farming clientele willing to invest funds from other sources e g employment retirement benefits other businesses in irrigated agriculture 13 main challenges facing flid in kenya one of the major challenges facing flid is its lack of recognition in the policies and institutions responsible for irrigated agriculture in kenya although flid is not new having been practiced over many years the sub sector got recognition at the international level just recently woodhouse et al 2017 within kenya the equating of irrigation development to infer irrigation scheme has meant that flid misses out on policy support resource allocation as well as planning alongside other sectors although apex policies e g kenya vision 2030 support small scale irrigation and private enterprise but flid had not been defined at the time of its formulation the water act 2016 republic of kenya 2016 heavily dwells on drinking water including environmental flows but completely omits irrigation the agricultural sector transformation for growth strategy gok 2019b tends to favor large scale irrigation at the expense of ssi and flid even then a number of statutes articulate small scale irrigation ssi e g irrigation act 2019 republic of kenya 2019 but it is silent on flid despite this the largest cluster of small scale irrigators are individual farmers flid is almost invisible in kenya s policies legal regulatory and planning instruments and thus misses out on development support meanwhile non governmental organizations ngos and various private sector actors e g banks microfinance institutions equipment supplier off takers and other value chain actors support or interact with flid directly and indirectly however it is not clear who is doing what where as a census of the key actors in flid has not been conducted despite the challenges flid has continued to grow with minimal policy support e g the benefits accorded to ssi in publicly developed irrigation schemes do not reach individual irrigators institutional support e g capacity building subsidies access to information and other incentives are not always availed to flid most individual farmers do not belong to groups hence have no means to express their problems or gain from group marketing or extension services generally flid doesn t feature when irrigation is being enumerated the contribution of flid to irrigation largely remains unknown yet it is huge and growing and thus not adequately accounted for or factored in development planning individual farmers engaged in flid operate almost their own 14 guidelines for irrigation design and development irrigation development in kenya is guided by the irrigation general regulations 2020 mwsandi 2020b which are in turn pegged on the broader water resources regulations gok 2020 on their part the irrigation regulations outline modalities for irrigation development licensing management and financing alongside these regulations the government also developed the irrigation guidelines mows i 2020a which guide the promotion development and management of irrigation schemes in kenya both the regulations and guidelines clearly articulate who can initiate an irrigation scheme or investment and how they allow that an individual a developer a community county or national government can initiate an irrigation scheme also an owner developer or any other person intending to construct an irrigation scheme is supposed to submit to the supervising entity the following mowsi 2020a a pre feasibility study report or initial project identification concept note showing viability b minutes of resolutions of stakeholders meetings endorsing or requesting for development of the irrigation scheme where applicable c feasibility study report d irrigation project design report e an authorization for construction from the water resources authority f land use authorization from the county or national ministry responsible for land and physical planning and g an environmental impact assessment license from national environmental management authority h evidence of relevant easements from relevant agencies and entities i in respect to irrigation within private and community based smallholder schemes provide proof of land ownership which may consist of a certified copy of title deed or lease agreement and j for community based smallholder irrigation schemes evidence of existence of an irrigation water users association generally according to the regulations all small scale county public and county initiated irrigation schemes should be supervised by the county irrigation development units cidus while all other schemes are supervised by the national irrigation authority however this is more in theory than in practice there are many instances where irrigation is developed through individual or community initiatives with little or no involvement of nia or county government generally most flid is un supervised at construction and largely un regulated at operational level the result is water abstractions that are unknown or not accounted for many irrigated areas in eastern and central kenya are faced with water shortages as a result this underscores the need to accord flid some recognition both to support the sub sector as well as to streamline its operations including water allocation marketing and capacity growth 15 conclusions flid like other modes of irrigation requires proper design development operation and management design and respective reviews are made during planning of the irrigation system this task is supposed to be the responsibility of qualified preferably certified engineers working with agronomists hydrologists and other professionals they are expected to check the functionality of infrastructure water supplies and distribution systems water storage control structures measuring devices on farm irrigation works and drainage designs are expected to be made along with cost estimates in addition water allocation and availability should be determined ifad and ifc 2022 in addition water supply rates should match crop water requirements as embedded in the irrigation design for system efficiency infrastructure development involves construction works that prepare land and bring the water for irrigation the main activities include development of water sources conveyance infrastructure e g canals pipe layouts as well as field levelling laying field pipe networks and drainage works it also includes selection of water application equipment e g sprinklers drip lines and their accessories the construction and operation of irrigation system should factor all hydrological processes so as to ensure environmental flows are retained in water courses but this is sometimes overlooked under flid irrigation design may also involve water harvesting and storage infrastructure as well as construction and rehabilitation of community small dams water pans and auxiliary infrastructure it is usually necessary to support establishment of farmer groups which in turn take over the operation management and maintenance of schemes the expansion of flid is premised on the realization that it has grown into a vibrant and expanding sub sector that can attract investments with good returns moreover opportunities are emerging to expand irrigation in peri urban farming and asset management is better assured under flid than conventional public schemes 16 recommendations there is need to support farmer led irrigation development given the growing evidence that flid has recorded better success rates and fewer failures than schemes under public sector management this sub sector comprises individuals and small groups who make their own investments to advance irrigation in addition flid has unique entrepreneurial self financing and market oriented niche seeking interventions which are relatively low cost as compared to large scale irrigation schemes the scope for irrigation expansion using private finance is huge through flid within kenya the extent of flid has not been mapped in ways that accommodate individual irrigation for this reason flid sub sector requires targeted assessment including mapping to explore its extent impacts and opportunities for upscaling it was noted that flid misses out on various subsidies incentives and opportunities accorded publicly funded irrigation schemes in kenya due to its being invisible as a specific irrigation typology it is therefore necessary to deliberately channel resources to support flid through projects subsidies incentives capacity building and access to information for flid farmers there is need to adopt water efficient irrigation systems in the past irrigation schemes were designed with little concern for water wastage or losses but in modern times as water scarcity becomes more acute there is need to improve the water productivity of crops and the overall efficiency of irrigation especially under flid there are many options to achieve this such as efficient new designs rehabilitation of old water conveyance and application systems e g lining canals or using piped conveyance others include converting water application methods from basin to furrow or from sprinkler to drip irrigation water saving practices such as choice of crop variety agronomic management prevention of excessive evaporation losses e g use of mulches and shade nets wind breaks or use of sunken beds planting basins to concentrate soil moisture absorption among other techniques flid requires institutional support across all fronts this could be in the design water pans wells gravity diversion works efficient water application methods such as drip systems energy for water pumping such as solar powered pumps improving water productivity and ultimately economic returns from flid data and information is scanty on flid as research has not been focused on the sub sector there is need for research on flid across all its components to advice policy and other actors in the irrigated agriculture space declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9128,declining water levels in the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer necessitates research on the management practices that can reduce irrigation water use and improve irrigation water use efficiency a three year field study from 2019 to 2021 evaluated the effects of row spacing and irrigation management on soybean seed yield and quality irrigation water use efficiency iwue water productivity wp and profitability soybean was planted in two row spacings single sr and twin row tr and irrigated with three different methods every row irrigated eri alternate row irrigated ari non irrigated ni soybean yields were increased with application of irrigation either as eri or ari as compared to ni in all three years ranging from 20 to 79 the eri had 20 increase in yield over ari in

for about 90 of the u s oilseed production soybean is widely used for food oil animal feed industrial uses and biodiesel in the u s the u s is the leading producer and the second largest exporter of soybean globally in 2020 soybean was planted on 33 4 million ha and had an average yield of 3 78 t ha 1 with production totaling over 112 mmt usda nrcs 2022 the majority 60 of soybean produced in the u s is exported overseas soybean is the leading cash crop grown in mississippi ms and has gained its importance with the introduction of early soybean production system esps heatherly and hodges 1999 early soybean production system has allowed farmers to plant early maturing varieties maturity group iii and iv to capture early season rainfall achieve faster canopy closure avoid reproductive growth under hot summer temperatures prevent late season insect feeding and harvest early for higher profit hoeft et al 2000 alsajri et al 2020 2019 initially soybean was planted in a single row geometry on raised beds that were spaced 1 016 m apart like other cash crops cotton and corn in the mississippi state recently early maturing varieties of soybean started to be planted in a narrow or tr arrangement to take full advantage of esps smith et al 2019 soybean planted in tr typically consist of two rows 0 2 m apart on the same raised bed with the beds 1 016 m apart bruns 2011a the benefits of a tr involve cold tolerance high sunlight interception rapid canopy closure weed suppression especially amaranthus palmeri l and reduced evaporation under non irrigated conditions smith et al 2019 pinnamaneni et al 2020 such characteristics could result in a 12 23 increase in seed yield for determinate late july and indeterminate early april planted soybean bowers et al 2000 grichar 2007 mascagni et al 2008 bruns 2011b robles et al 2012 therefore early planting of soybean in tr or narrow rows gradually became a recommended practice in mississippi smith et al 2019 however yield increases associated with row spacings were inconsistent over time in the mid southern u s heatherly and hodges 1998 primarily due to variable rainfall patterns and soil moisture conditions bowers et al 2000 boquet et al 1982 devlin et al 1995 for instance taylor 1980 observed virtually no association of row geometry with yield in years receiving below average rainfall under average rainfall scenarios a substantial but not significant p 0 05 yield increase was observed with every 25 cm reduction in row spacing from 100 cm to 25 cm in contrast soybean planted in a 25 cm row spacing exhibited 17 higher yields than 100 cm row spacing under an above average rainfall scenario similarly bowers et al 2000 only observed a yield response to row spacing when july and august total rainfall was within 100 270 mm twin row soybean allows greater early season water use during vegetative growth such phenomenon in low rainfall areas may subject soybean to drought stress at critical reproductive stages which could negatively impact soybean yields devlin et al 1995 graterol et al 1996 therefore yield limiting scenarios including non irrigated conditions may have no yield advantage from narrow row spacing and instead may benefit from a wider row spacing the mississippi climate is characterized by higher temperatures and lower rainfall in july and august compared to other times of the year yang et al 2020 kebede et al 2014 soybean planted under a conventional system in ms coincides the pod development stages with these hot and dry environments which result in a severe reduction in seed yield and quality heatherly and hodges 1999 a large portion of soybean hectares 60 in the ms delta are irrigated every year due to the erratic distribution of rainfall during the growing season pinnamaneni et al 2020a the mississippi delta accounts for over 80 of the state farmland of which some 65 is irrigated every year with nearly half irrigated with polypipe furrow irrigation kebede et al 2014 among all cash crops soybean has the largest irrigated area 53 in this region the average annual groundwater use with furrow irrigation estimated 2 4 ml ha 1 9 4 in for soybean which is comparatively higher than 1 8 ml ha 1 estimated for cotton 7 1 in and lower than the 3 4 ml ha 1 estimated for corn 13 4 in in the ms delta the in season low rainfall coincides with continuous pumping for positive yield response in the irrigated acreage during the growing season has resulted in a low recharge rate of mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrvaa which is the main source of groundwater irrigation in the ms delta kebede et al 2014 individual and combined effects of irrigation water management practices including computerized hole selection surge flow irrigation and sensor based irrigation scheduling alternate row furrow irrigation and furrow disking have been evaluated for yield net returns and water use efficiency in delta row crops including soybean cotton peanut arachis hypogaea l and corn leininger et al 2019 bryant et al 2017 pinnamaneni et al 2020b spencer et al 2019 however the effect of integrating row spacing and irrigation water management on soybean is not well studied pinnamaneni et al 2021 quintana ashwell et al 2021 therefore this study evaluated individual and combined effects of row spacing and irrigation method on soybean yield quality wp irrigation water use efficiency and net returns the hypothesis is that altering irrigation and or row spacing will increase yield and irrigation use efficiency resulting in enhanced soybean productivity and more water savings 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted for three years 2019 2020 2021 at the national center for alluvial

considered fixed effects and replication as random effects the statistical differences among treatment means were tested at the 5 significance level using fisher s least significant difference the soil water potential data were analyzed by generating a linear relationship that explained soybean yield response to cumulative stress days drier than a given soil water potential threshold fig 3 the partial budget analyses were performed to compare the expected levels and variability of returns under each of the three irrigation treatments across the two planting geometries crop planning budgets mississippi state university s department of agricultural economics 2020 2021 2022 were used to estimate production costs for each of the six treatments evaluated over the three years of the experiment in all cases the published planning budget was modified to reflect actual grain hauling costs for twin row soybean the existing planning budgets were modified to reflect the financial and operation costs of a twin row planter for irrigated crops the planning budgets were modified to reflect actual pumping costs based on the applications recorded for each treatment finally the planning budget years were matched to reflect the year observations were recorded for example in the 2021 season we utilized the 2022 planning budgets which are the observed prices in 2021 to evaluate the relationship between risk and returns both the variability of observed yields as well as the variability in costs were evaluated the expected farm revenue was calculated by multiplying yields under each treatment by the average price for soybean at harvest which was 355 55 mg 1 in 2019 358 15 mg 1 in 2020 and 461 48 mg 1 in 2021 commodity prices for 2019 and 2020 were depressed due largely to retaliatory tariffs on u s agricultural exports imposed by several u s major trading partners adjemian et al 2021 3 results 3 1 weather and soil water potential the growing seasons were not significantly different for mean monthly maximum and minimum temperature fig 1 the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures over three years were 29 1 and 18 1 respectively and were consistent with the 30 yr average day night temperatures 29 6 17 8 fig 1a and b trends for a change in monthly maximum and minimum temperatures during a growing season over three years were within the trend the 30 yr average data the months of june to september coincided with late vegetative and pod development stages of soybean which had mean maximum and minimum temperatures of 33 and 22 respectively which are considered optimal for soybean growth yield and quality heatherly and hodges 1999 the 30 year average 1989 2018 maximum and minimum monthly temperatures during the growing season april october at the research site were 29 6 and 17 8 respectively total monthly rainfall varied over the three years such that 2019 received higher overall rainfall 100 mm than the following two years during the vegetative stages of soybean development while the opposite was true during the late vegetative and pod development stages fig 1c rainfall over the growing seasons was 1290 mm in 2019 followed by 1010 mm in 2020 and 940 mm in 2021 the highest and lowest rainfall occurred in may and september for 2019 october and may for 2020 and july and october for 2021 respectively fig 1c the average monthly rainfall received over the three years 160 mm was higher than the 30 year average 130 mm the average total rainfall received during the growing season over the three years was 180 mm more than the 30 year average the variability of monthly total rainfall pattern was 100 mm from the 30 yr average depending on the time of the growing season over 30 years average total rainfall received during the growing season from april to october at the research site was 763 mm the average maximum solar radiation during the growing seasons over 30 years was 19 mj m 2 day 1 solar radiation during the growing season was similar among the three years and long term historical data fig 1d the solar radiation received varied within 1 mj m 2 day 1 among three years and 30 yr averages the solar radiation ranged between 12 21 mj m 2 day 1 over a growing season the highest mean solar radiation 21 mj m 2 day 1 occurred between may and august across the three years and 30 year average fig 1d which are conducive for peak vegetative and reproductive growth of soybean in the u s midsouth heatherly and hodges 1999 over three years the soil water potential during the growing season vary between 20 kpa and 180 kpa fig 2 the regression analysis between the cumulative stress days drier than 20 kpa and soybean yield indicated reduction in soybean yield by 0 3401 kg ha 1 with each unit increase in cumulative stress fig 3 similarly soybean yield can be reduced by 0 3712 and 0 5651 kg ha 1 with each unit increase in cumulative stress for days with soil water potential drier than the 40 and 70 kpa respectively the estimated yield loss was 1 2084 kg ha 1 with increase in cumulative stress for days drier than the 100 kpa sensor thresholds fig 3 3 2 soybean plant population and seed yield there was no significant effect of row spacing or irrigation management on plant population in 2020 or 2021 tables 2 3 soybean seed yield was significantly affected by year irrigation management and their interaction table 2 soybean yield was not affected by the row spacing every row irrigation showed no statistically significant p 0 05 increase in the yield with twice the amount of water applied compared to ari in 2019 and 2020 table 3 the eri had 20 increase in yield over ari in 2021 in all three years the soybean yields were increased with application of irrigation either as eri or ari as compared to ni the eri had greater soybean yield than the ni by 26 30 and 79 in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the ari had 20 greater yield than ni in 2019 and 2020 whereas it had 50 greater yield than the ni in 2021 table 3 further yields with eri were similar in all three years while soybean yields significantly differed under the ari and ni among years for instance the yield obtained under ari and ni was higher in 2019 than in the following two years the pearson correlation between yields and wp showed that soybean yield was positively related to the wp under eri r 0 931 p 0 05 ari r 0 990 p 0 05 and ni r 0 996 p 0 05 soybean yield was positively but not strongly correlated to iwue for eri r 0 587 p 0 05 and ari r 0 442 p 0 05 3 3 soybean seed quality soybean test weight tw harvest moisture and 100 seed weight sw was significantly affected by the interaction of year and irrigation management the tw was also affected by the three way interaction effect of year row spacing and irrigation methods unlike 2019 and 2020 tw was different among irrigation systems in 2021 such that ni had 9 2 lower tw than the average tw obtained across eri and ari fig 4 also the years differed for tw among irrigation systems under eri tw was higher in 2020 than 2019 and 2021 for both sr and tr planted soybeans test weights obtained under ari and ni were highest in 2020 followed by 2019 and the lowest in 2021 fig 4 no change in tw was observed between eri and ari with a shift in row spacing from sr to tr the interaction effect of the year by irrigation showed that ni had higher grain harvest moisture than the ari and eri in 2021 but no differences were observed among irrigation systems in 2019 and 2020 table 3 overall grain moisture in 2020 97 9 g kg 1 was 30 5 lower than in 2021 141 4 g kg 1 there were no differences in sw were observed between eri and ari in 2020 and 2021 unlike tw sw and harvest moisture were greater in 2021 than 2020 across all three irrigation systems table 3 soybean oil concentration was affected by the main effects of irrigation management and year soybean seed protein was not impacted by the irrigation and row spacing treatments in our study but soybean protein content vary by years table 2 the protein concentration was 48 2 g kg 1 greater in 2020 compared to 2021 while the opposite was observed for harvest moisture sw and oil concentration fig 4 and table 3 the oil concentration was 16 5 g kg 1 greater in 2021 than 2020 the seed oil concentration was 1 8 and 4 7 lower with eri compared to the ari and ni respectively when data was averaged over years and row spacing table 3 3 4 water productivity and irrigation water use efficiency water applications totaled 186 mm in 2019 266 mm in 2020 and 170 mm in 2021 in sr plots with eri while half that amount was applied with ari the tr treatment received irrigation water amounts of 198 mm in 2019 284 mm in 2020 and 170 mm in 2021 under the eri treatments and half the amount of irrigation under ari a significant irrigation by year interaction was observed for wp and iwue table 2 the iwue in 2020 was 35 lower than 2019 or 2021 when data were averaged over irrigation methods and row spacings averaged over row spacing iwue was 66 91 greater with ari compared to eri fig 5 water productivity was 4 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 and 4 24 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2020 fig 6 the wp showed no significant differences among irrigation methods in 2019 and 2020 water supplied with a low rainfall scenario in 2021 was not enough to reach maximum wp compared to the previous two years and therefore wp increased with ari and eri than the ni fig 6 irrigation water from ari showed a 34 increase in wp over ni additional water supplied by eri showed no significant increase in wp compared to ari in all three years 3 5 risk and profit analysis the production costs expected revenues and profits for each treatment combination in each year are summarized in table 4 twin row soybean had higher expected returns in all cases except for the ni and eri in 2021 averaged over three years the tr had greater expected profits than the sr under all three irrigation methods tables 4 and 5 however the agronomic data was insufficient to show the yield differences observed under tr and sr soybeans overall eri showed the highest expected profit of 463 90 ha 1 and 457 05 ha 1 for tr and sr respectively table 5 alternate row irrigation averaged 361 58 ha 1 and 237 13 ha 1 for tr and sr respectively for ni plots the expected profits were 267 43 ha 1 for tr and 254 67 ha 1 for sr the relationship between expected returns and variability table 5 and fig 7 a measure of risk is an important consideration for farmers making decisions on these practices and conservation agencies providing incentives and policies related to irrigation water conservation considering eri as the benchmark to evaluate ari and ni cropping systems tr soybean produced the greatest average risk return than other treatments the ari with tr had the second highest overall risk return trade off for sr soybean ari resulted in an equivalent risk return production system as eri which is evident from the ray origin including both points fig 7 overall reducing groundwater use by 108 65 mm with ari was associated with an opportunity cost of 0 94 mm 1 table 6 for reference the implicit groundwater conservation cost from the usda natural conservation service nrcs was 0 97 mm 1 this implicit conservation price was calculated based on an nrcs investment of over 17 million over four years on the adoption of soil and water conservation practices which may save up to 178 854 ml year 1 of groundwater quintana et al 2021 however this funding might be insufficient to compensate for profit losses from ari such as in 2021 the year with the largest savings in terms of groundwater volume 2020 was the year associated with the lowest opportunity cost from groundwater savings this indicated that an incentive program to compensate for adopting ari over eri would be more attractive to those with the largest levels of water overuse 4 discussion 4 1 soybean seed yield the response of soybean yield quality wp and iwue to furrow irrigation and row spacing were evaluated over three years in this study the results supported the hypothesis that ari could optimize soybean productivity and profitability the influence of dynamic weather conditions could limit the potential of management practices on soybean growth and development pinnamaneni et al 2020 uneven rainfall over the three years of this research may have partly altered the irrigation effect on soybean production the soybean yields were highest in the 2019 followed by 2020 and 2021 under non irrigated conditions in accordance with the rainfall amount received in individual year the highest grain yield increase 33 with additional water applied through furrow irrigation was observed in 2021 which received the lowest rainfall among the three years in this study mississippi receives less in season rain therefore farmers opt for irrigation water management practices evaluated by researchers to optimize the soybean productivity bryant et al 2017 kebede et al 2019 leininger et al 2019 pinnamaneni et al 2020b spencer et al 2019 however the results indicated that soybean yield response decreases with increasing irrigation water supply the driest year evaluated 2021 exhibited a stepwise increase in yield with increasing supply of irrigation water from ni compared to eri the eri had higher yield than the ari only in one 2021 out of three years in 2020 soil water potential readings showed less differences numerically in the ari and eri treatments this indicates that soil moisture differences were not high among ari and eri which could have led to the no differences in soybean yield however the soil potential readings in the 2021 showed that eri had greater soil water potential readings than the ari indicating low moisture in the soil profile under ari which consequently resulted in the lower yields in the ari than eri in 2021 factors such as water uptake by plants greater runoff losses and low water infiltration due to soil crusting at the surface might cause differences in water utilization by soybeans among treatments and years low yields in the ni might have been due to moisture stress at critical growth stages which can result in poor plant growth and development lower stomatal conductance and photosynthetic activity and consequently lower pod numbers and incomplete pod filling pinnamaneni et al 2020a as shown in fig 3 each unit increase in cumulative stress for days with soil water potential drier than the 40 and 70 kpa can reduce soybean yield by 0 3712 and 0 5651 kg ha 1 respectively whereas each unit increase in cumulative stress for days with soil water potential drier than the 40 can result in estimated yield loss of 1 2084 kg ha 1 researchers in the region have also recognized increased yield and profitability with ari compared to eri or ni in other crops planted on a bosket very fine sandy loam for instance leininger et al 2019 reported 1 8 fold increase in peanut yield under irrigated conditions compared to rainfed conditions in cotton pinnamaneni et al 2020b reported lint yield with ari 1942 kg ha 1 was higher than eri 1903 kg ha 1 over two years cotton planted in trs had 13 8 higher lint yield under eri and 16 5 higher lint yield under ari when compared to ni however rainfall had a profound impact on the results of the above findings similar to our findings pinnamaneni et al 2020a obtained no change in soybean yield between fully irrigated conditions 4500 kg ha 1 and half irrigated conditions 4400 kg ha 1 over three years in the ms delta soybean yield was comparatively lower under rainfed conditions 3900 kg ha 1 than either of the irrigated conditions pinnamaneni et al 2020a pinnamaneni et al 2020a attributed highest yield obtained in fully irrigated soybean to higher leaf area index solar radiation interception higher net photosynthesis and higher pods plant 1 in that treatment row spacing sr vs tr did not impact soybean plant population and seed yield in our study although the importance of twin row production has been recognized in the ms delta under esps the benefits of narrow row spacing were found to be inconsistent over years heatherly and hodges 1998 quintana ashwell et al 2021 the tr planting geometry over sr provide many benefits including faster canopy closure that suppresses late season weed germination and establishment greater light interception higher plant survival rates and improved nutrient and water use efficiencies bellaloui et al 2015 bowers et al 2000 bruns 2011a 2011b grichar 2007 mascagni et al 2008 robles et al 2012 smith et al 2019 however previous studies have revealed that benefits from narrow row production were primarily driven by rainfall amounts in a manner that the highest yield gain was observed in seasons with above average rainfall and no to little gain was observed in seasons with below average rainfall taylor 1980 bowers et al 2000 faster canopy development with narrow row soybean can increase evapotranspiration during early growth which may expose critical growth stages during reproductive development to soil water deficit conditions under low rainfall scenarios devlin et al 1995 graterol et al 1996 and can result in reduced grain yield and quality like our results turner et al 2019 did not find differences among tr and sr on soybean yield in mississippi delta region smith et al 2019 reported no effect on soybean yield with tr compared to sr in stoneville ms although tr had higher canopy closure than the sr soybean however pinnamaneni et al 2020a reported that twin row soybean yielded 600 kg ha 1 greater than single rows in stoneville mississippi on a dundee silt loam fine silty mixed active thermic typic endoaqualfs soil series with growing seasons receiving higher rainfall which is conducive for tr soybean among all the traits measured only test weight was sensitive to row spacing such that tw was greater with sr than tr under ni treatments in 2021 however no differences were observed in tw due to row spacing in other two years the 2021 was the drier year compared to the 2019 and 2020 planting soybean in a wide row in sr under the water deficit region conditions might have resulted in more available soil water for plants than in tr in the ms delta a large portion of groundwater is available to crops for irrigation research in the region is focused on evaluating the benefits of integrating different irrigation water management options bryant et al 2017 spencer et al 2019 the interaction of irrigation water management and row spacing has been studied less in recent evaluations an interaction between irrigation amount and row spacing showed no effect on soybean seed yield nutrition or water use efficiency pinnamaneni et al 2020a 2021 likewise our results have shown soybean grain yield and quality were more sensitive to irrigation water management than row spacing 4 2 seed seed quality the composition of soybean seed is affected by the environmental conditions water and nutrient application depending upon the crop yield potential and availability of resources assefa et al 2019 in our study protein content was not impacted by the irrigation and row spacing treatments but it was greater in 2020 than in year 2021 however the trend was opposite for the oil content in soybean seed a negative correlation has been reported for protein and oil concentration in the soybean seed boydak et al 2002 ray et al 2006 rotundo and westgate 2009 concluded that temperature and water availability are the main reasons for temporal variation in soybean seed composition few studies have shown that the effect of irrigation on protein concentration vary by the soybean genotypes boydak et al 2002 bellaloui and mengistu 2008 carrera et al 2009 reported a reduction in soybean protein concentration with water deficit during reproductive stages whereas kumar et al 2006 reported an increase in protein concentration with decrease in precipitation a meta analysis for soybean seed composition by rotundo and westgate 2009 showed that water stress negatively impacts protein and oil content mg per seed in soybean soybean oil seed content was greater under water stress conditions as in ni or eri compared to fully irrigated conditions as in eri in our study rose 1988 reported that the oil and protein percentages of the dryland seed can vary as compared to the irrigated treatments depending upon the balance between the decline in seed weight and response of these constituents to the pattern of stress similar to our results rose 1988 found that severe stress at the very early pod fill stage increased oil content and reduced protein content whereas no changes were found for protein and oil content in high rainfall season due to more availability of soil water for growth 4 3 irrigation water use efficiency and water productivity increased utilization of groundwater for irrigation has resulted in decline in water levels in the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer therefore it is very important to develop practices for water management for this region that can reduce irrigation water use and increase iwue while improving or maintaining crop yields the iwue was calculated as ratio of yield and irrigation water applied in our study although no significant difference in soybean yields were found in first two years of the study the iwue was higher with ari than the eri in our study in all three years since ari received half the irrigation water amount than the eri this showed that ari saved irrigation water without hurting soybean yields row spacing showed no impact on wp and iwue many studies have reported similar benefits of ari than eri pinnamaneni et al 2020a 2020b leininger et al 2019 pinnamaneni et al 2020a recorded higher iwue under half irrigated soybean planted in tr 63 kg ha 1 mm 1 or sr 53 kg ha 1 mm 1 compared to fully irrigated soybean in tr 38 kg ha 1 mm 1 or sr 32 kg ha 1 mm 1 in cotton 57 higher iwue was obtained with ari 3 05 kg ha 1 mm 1 was than eri 1 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 when averaged over two years pinnamaneni et al 2020b leininger et al 2019 reported a 5 3 fold increase in iwue by ari compared to eri in 2019 and 2020 there was higher rainfall and wp did not show response to irrigation treatments this indicates that excess water may be detrimental to soybean production in these soils soybean and other cash crops in the ms delta have shown increased grain yield and quality in response to the amount of irrigation water based on rainfall amounts pinnamaneni et al 2020a b pinnamaneni et al 2021 leininger et al 2019 high rainfall seasons have exhibited improvement in irrigation water use efficiency of soybean with ari compared to eri 4 4 risk and profits analysis the expected profits under all three irrigation treatments were higher for twin rows although no significant statistical differences were found for the agronomic production data of soybean with tr and sr p 0 05 the economic analysis indicates significant groundwater savings from ari 50 reduction come with a significant opportunity cost to farmers 0 94 mm 1 saved who produce soybean on fine sandy loam soils in humid areas such as the delta region of mississippi this opportunity cost is less than the average implicit incentive payment by nrcs in mississippi for the potential volume of groundwater saved because of those programs this relatively lower cost may make this an attractive practice to include in conservation programs furthermore the fact that the cost of these savings is the least for the cases in which there is a higher use of irrigation water would make such a program more attractive for high use growers than for those with lower levels of groundwater use i e actual self selection could result in much lower cost per volume of groundwater saved a caveat of such a policy would be that many farmers do not have records of groundwater use so they cannot evaluate the merits of the practice vis à vis their use of potential incentive programs 5 conclusions this study revealed a positive soybean yield quality and wp response to a conservation furrow irrigation practice however the amount of water required through furrow irrigation could be modified according to the rainfall amounts for instance ari was the most suitable option to optimize soybean yield quality and wp in an average or high rainfall season any additional water supplied from eri would benefit producers experiencing a season with low rainfall only a 20 increase in yield was observed using twice the amount of irrigation water supplied from eri even under low rainfall scenarios ari showed a 50 increase in yield compared to soybean grown under ni conditions water productivity and iwue were higher with ari across all three years the changes in row spacing had no significant improvement on soybean yields and did not show an interaction with irrigation management except for grain test weight in terms of risk return planting soybean in tw and irrigating every row presents the best risk return proposition for sr planting both irrigated systems offered an equivalent risk return proposition as the reduction in expected returns is associated with a reduction in the variability of those expected returns funding this publication is a contribution of the

9128,declining water levels in the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer necessitates research on the management practices that can reduce irrigation water use and improve irrigation water use efficiency a three year field study from 2019 to 2021 evaluated the effects of row spacing and irrigation management on soybean seed yield and quality irrigation water use efficiency iwue water productivity wp and profitability soybean was planted in two row spacings single sr and twin row tr and irrigated with three different methods every row irrigated eri alternate row irrigated ari non irrigated ni soybean yields were increased with application of irrigation either as eri or ari as compared to ni in all three years ranging from 20 to 79 the eri had 20 increase in yield over ari in 2021 whereas no significant differences were found between eri and ari in 2019 and 2020 averaged over row spacing iwue was 66 91 greater with ari compared to eri only 2021 showed an increase 34 in wp with irrigation applied as ari than ni differences in rainfall amount among years and amount of irrigation applied under different treatments affected the soybean yields soybean yield showed reduction

in all cases except for the ni and eri in 2021 the tr soybean produced the greatest average risk return than other treatments the ari with tr had the second highest overall risk return trade off the

every row irrigation ari alternate row irrigation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction soybean is a dominant oilseed crop of the united states accounting for about 90 of the u s oilseed production soybean is widely used for food oil animal feed industrial uses and biodiesel in the u s the u s is the leading producer and the second largest exporter of soybean globally in 2020 soybean was planted on 33 4 million ha and had an average yield of 3 78 t ha 1 with production totaling over 112 mmt usda nrcs 2022 the majority 60 of soybean produced in the u s is exported overseas soybean is the leading cash crop grown in mississippi ms and has gained its importance with the introduction of early soybean production system esps heatherly and hodges 1999 early soybean production system has allowed farmers to plant early maturing varieties maturity group iii and iv to capture early season rainfall achieve faster canopy closure avoid reproductive growth under hot summer temperatures prevent late season insect feeding and harvest early for higher profit hoeft et al 2000 alsajri et al 2020 2019 initially soybean was planted in a single row geometry on raised beds that were spaced 1 016 m apart like other cash crops cotton and corn in the mississippi state recently early maturing varieties of soybean started to be planted in a narrow or tr arrangement to take full advantage of esps smith et al 2019 soybean planted in tr typically consist of two rows 0 2 m apart on the same raised bed with the beds 1 016 m apart bruns 2011a the benefits of a tr involve cold tolerance high sunlight interception rapid canopy closure weed suppression especially amaranthus palmeri l and reduced evaporation under non irrigated conditions smith et al 2019 pinnamaneni et al 2020 such characteristics could result in a 12 23 increase in seed yield for determinate late july and indeterminate early april planted soybean bowers et al 2000 grichar 2007 mascagni et al 2008 bruns 2011b robles et al 2012 therefore early planting of soybean in tr or narrow rows gradually became a recommended practice in mississippi smith et al 2019 however yield increases associated with row spacings were inconsistent over time in the mid southern u s heatherly and hodges 1998 primarily due to variable rainfall patterns and soil moisture conditions bowers et al 2000 boquet et al 1982 devlin et al 1995 for instance taylor 1980 observed virtually no association of row geometry with yield in years receiving below average rainfall under average rainfall scenarios a substantial but not significant p 0 05 yield increase was observed with every 25 cm reduction in row spacing from 100 cm to 25 cm in contrast soybean planted in a 25 cm row spacing exhibited 17 higher yields than 100 cm row spacing under an above average rainfall scenario similarly bowers et al 2000 only observed a yield response to row spacing when july and august total rainfall was within 100 270 mm twin row soybean allows greater early season water use during vegetative growth such phenomenon in low rainfall areas may subject soybean to drought stress at critical reproductive stages which could negatively impact soybean yields devlin et al 1995 graterol et al 1996 therefore yield limiting scenarios including non irrigated conditions may have no yield advantage from narrow row spacing and instead may benefit from a wider row spacing the mississippi climate is characterized by higher temperatures and lower rainfall in july and august compared to other times of the year yang et al 2020 kebede et al 2014 soybean planted under a conventional system in ms coincides the pod development stages with these hot and dry environments which result in a severe reduction in seed yield and quality heatherly and hodges 1999 a large portion of soybean hectares 60 in the ms delta are irrigated every year due to the erratic distribution of rainfall during the growing season pinnamaneni et al 2020a the mississippi delta accounts for over 80 of the state farmland of which some 65 is irrigated every year with nearly half irrigated with polypipe furrow irrigation kebede et al 2014 among all cash crops soybean has the largest irrigated area 53 in this region the average annual groundwater use with furrow irrigation estimated 2 4 ml ha 1 9 4 in for soybean which is comparatively higher than 1 8 ml ha 1 estimated for cotton 7 1 in and lower than the 3 4 ml ha 1 estimated for corn 13 4 in in the ms delta the in season low rainfall coincides with continuous pumping for positive yield response in the irrigated acreage during the growing season has resulted in a low recharge rate of mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrvaa which is the main source of groundwater irrigation in the ms delta kebede et al 2014 individual and combined effects of irrigation water management practices including computerized hole selection surge flow irrigation and sensor based irrigation scheduling alternate row furrow irrigation and furrow disking have been evaluated for yield net returns and water use efficiency in delta row crops including soybean cotton peanut arachis hypogaea l and corn leininger et al 2019 bryant et al 2017 pinnamaneni et al 2020b spencer et al 2019 however the effect of integrating row spacing and irrigation water management on soybean is not well studied pinnamaneni et al 2021 quintana ashwell et al 2021 therefore this study evaluated individual and combined effects of row spacing and irrigation method on soybean yield quality wp irrigation water use efficiency and net returns the hypothesis is that altering irrigation and or row spacing will increase yield and irrigation use efficiency resulting in enhanced soybean productivity and more water savings 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted for three years 2019 2020 2021 at the national center for alluvial

considered fixed effects and replication as random effects the statistical differences among treatment means were tested at the 5 significance level using fisher s least significant difference the soil water potential data were analyzed by generating a linear relationship that explained soybean yield response to cumulative stress days drier than a given soil water potential threshold fig 3 the partial budget analyses were performed to compare the expected levels and variability of returns under each of the three irrigation treatments across the two planting geometries crop planning budgets mississippi state university s department of agricultural economics 2020 2021 2022 were used to estimate production costs for each of the six treatments evaluated over the three years of the experiment in all cases the published planning budget was modified to reflect actual grain hauling costs for twin row soybean the existing planning budgets were modified to reflect the financial and operation costs of a twin row planter for irrigated crops the planning budgets were modified to reflect actual pumping costs based on the applications recorded for each treatment finally the planning budget years were matched to reflect the year observations were recorded for example in the 2021 season we utilized the 2022 planning budgets which are the observed prices in 2021 to evaluate the relationship between risk and returns both the variability of observed yields as well as the variability in costs were evaluated the expected farm revenue was calculated by multiplying yields under each treatment by the average price for soybean at harvest which was 355 55 mg 1 in 2019 358 15 mg 1 in 2020 and 461 48 mg 1 in 2021 commodity prices for 2019 and 2020 were depressed due largely to retaliatory tariffs on u s agricultural exports imposed by several u s major trading partners adjemian et al 2021 3 results 3 1 weather and soil water potential the growing seasons were not significantly different for mean monthly maximum and minimum temperature fig 1 the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures over three years were 29 1 and 18 1 respectively and were consistent with the 30 yr average day night temperatures 29 6 17 8 fig 1a and b trends for a change in monthly maximum and minimum temperatures during a growing season over three years were within the trend the 30 yr average data the months of june to september coincided with late vegetative and pod development stages of soybean which had mean maximum and minimum temperatures of 33 and 22 respectively which are considered optimal for soybean growth yield and quality heatherly and hodges 1999 the 30 year average 1989 2018 maximum and minimum monthly temperatures during the growing season april october at the research site were 29 6 and 17 8 respectively total monthly rainfall varied over the three years such that 2019 received higher overall rainfall 100 mm than the following two years during the vegetative stages of soybean development while the opposite was true during the late vegetative and pod development stages fig 1c rainfall over the growing seasons was 1290 mm in 2019 followed by 1010 mm in 2020 and 940 mm in 2021 the highest and lowest rainfall occurred in may and september for 2019 october and may for 2020 and july and october for 2021 respectively fig 1c the average monthly rainfall received over the three years 160 mm was higher than the 30 year average 130 mm the average total rainfall received during the growing season over the three years was 180 mm more than the 30 year average the variability of monthly total rainfall pattern was 100 mm from the 30 yr average depending on the time of the growing season over 30 years average total rainfall received during the growing season from april to october at the research site was 763 mm the average maximum solar radiation during the growing seasons over 30 years was 19 mj m 2 day 1 solar radiation during the growing season was similar among the three years and long term historical data fig 1d the solar radiation received varied within 1 mj m 2 day 1 among three years and 30 yr averages the solar radiation ranged between 12 21 mj m 2 day 1 over a growing season the highest mean solar radiation 21 mj m 2 day 1 occurred between may and august across the three years and 30 year average fig 1d which are conducive for peak vegetative and reproductive growth of soybean in the u s midsouth heatherly and hodges 1999 over three years the soil water potential during the growing season vary between 20 kpa and 180 kpa fig 2 the regression analysis between the cumulative stress days drier than 20 kpa and soybean yield indicated reduction in soybean yield by 0 3401 kg ha 1 with each unit increase in cumulative stress fig 3 similarly soybean yield can be reduced by 0 3712 and 0 5651 kg ha 1 with each unit increase in cumulative stress for days with soil water potential drier than the 40 and 70 kpa respectively the estimated yield loss was 1 2084 kg ha 1 with increase in cumulative stress for days drier than the 100 kpa sensor thresholds fig 3 3 2 soybean plant population and seed yield there was no significant effect of row spacing or irrigation management on plant population in 2020 or 2021 tables 2 3 soybean seed yield was significantly affected by year irrigation management and their interaction table 2 soybean yield was not affected by the row spacing every row irrigation showed no statistically significant p 0 05 increase in the yield with twice the amount of water applied compared to ari in 2019 and 2020 table 3 the eri had 20 increase in yield over ari in 2021 in all three years the soybean yields were increased with application of irrigation either as eri or ari as compared to ni the eri had greater soybean yield than the ni by 26 30 and 79 in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the ari had 20 greater yield than ni in 2019 and 2020 whereas it had 50 greater yield than the ni in 2021 table 3 further yields with eri were similar in all three years while soybean yields significantly differed under the ari and ni among years for instance the yield obtained under ari and ni was higher in 2019 than in the following two years the pearson correlation between yields and wp showed that soybean yield was positively related to the wp under eri r 0 931 p 0 05 ari r 0 990 p 0 05 and ni r 0 996 p 0 05 soybean yield was positively but not strongly correlated to iwue for eri r 0 587 p 0 05 and ari r 0 442 p 0 05 3 3 soybean seed quality soybean test weight tw harvest moisture and 100 seed weight sw was significantly affected by the interaction of year and irrigation management the tw was also affected by the three way interaction effect of year row spacing and irrigation methods unlike 2019 and 2020 tw was different among irrigation systems in 2021 such that ni had 9 2 lower tw than the average tw obtained across eri and ari fig 4 also the years differed for tw among irrigation systems under eri tw was higher in 2020 than 2019 and 2021 for both sr and tr planted soybeans test weights obtained under ari and ni were highest in 2020 followed by 2019 and the lowest in 2021 fig 4 no change in tw was observed between eri and ari with a shift in row spacing from sr to tr the interaction effect of the year by irrigation showed that ni had higher grain harvest moisture than the ari and eri in 2021 but no differences were observed among irrigation systems in 2019 and 2020 table 3 overall grain moisture in 2020 97 9 g kg 1 was 30 5 lower than in 2021 141 4 g kg 1 there were no differences in sw were observed between eri and ari in 2020 and 2021 unlike tw sw and harvest moisture were greater in 2021 than 2020 across all three irrigation systems table 3 soybean oil concentration was affected by the main effects of irrigation management and year soybean seed protein was not impacted by the irrigation and row spacing treatments in our study but soybean protein content vary by years table 2 the protein concentration was 48 2 g kg 1 greater in 2020 compared to 2021 while the opposite was observed for harvest moisture sw and oil concentration fig 4 and table 3 the oil concentration was 16 5 g kg 1 greater in 2021 than 2020 the seed oil concentration was 1 8 and 4 7 lower with eri compared to the ari and ni respectively when data was averaged over years and row spacing table 3 3 4 water productivity and irrigation water use efficiency water applications totaled 186 mm in 2019 266 mm in 2020 and 170 mm in 2021 in sr plots with eri while half that amount was applied with ari the tr treatment received irrigation water amounts of 198 mm in 2019 284 mm in 2020 and 170 mm in 2021 under the eri treatments and half the amount of irrigation under ari a significant irrigation by year interaction was observed for wp and iwue table 2 the iwue in 2020 was 35 lower than 2019 or 2021 when data were averaged over irrigation methods and row spacings averaged over row spacing iwue was 66 91 greater with ari compared to eri fig 5 water productivity was 4 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2019 and 4 24 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2020 fig 6 the wp showed no significant differences among irrigation methods in 2019 and 2020 water supplied with a low rainfall scenario in 2021 was not enough to reach maximum wp compared to the previous two years and therefore wp increased with ari and eri than the ni fig 6 irrigation water from ari showed a 34 increase in wp over ni additional water supplied by eri showed no significant increase in wp compared to ari in all three years 3 5 risk and profit analysis the production costs expected revenues and profits for each treatment combination in each year are summarized in table 4 twin row soybean had higher expected returns in all cases except for the ni and eri in 2021 averaged over three years the tr had greater expected profits than the sr under all three irrigation methods tables 4 and 5 however the agronomic data was insufficient to show the yield differences observed under tr and sr soybeans overall eri showed the highest expected profit of 463 90 ha 1 and 457 05 ha 1 for tr and sr respectively table 5 alternate row irrigation averaged 361 58 ha 1 and 237 13 ha 1 for tr and sr respectively for ni plots the expected profits were 267 43 ha 1 for tr and 254 67 ha 1 for sr the relationship between expected returns and variability table 5 and fig 7 a measure of risk is an important consideration for farmers making decisions on these practices and conservation agencies providing incentives and policies related to irrigation water conservation considering eri as the benchmark to evaluate ari and ni cropping systems tr soybean produced the greatest average risk return than other treatments the ari with tr had the second highest overall risk return trade off for sr soybean ari resulted in an equivalent risk return production system as eri which is evident from the ray origin including both points fig 7 overall reducing groundwater use by 108 65 mm with ari was associated with an opportunity cost of 0 94 mm 1 table 6 for reference the implicit groundwater conservation cost from the usda natural conservation service nrcs was 0 97 mm 1 this implicit conservation price was calculated based on an nrcs investment of over 17 million over four years on the adoption of soil and water conservation practices which may save up to 178 854 ml year 1 of groundwater quintana et al 2021 however this funding might be insufficient to compensate for profit losses from ari such as in 2021 the year with the largest savings in terms of groundwater volume 2020 was the year associated with the lowest opportunity cost from groundwater savings this indicated that an incentive program to compensate for adopting ari over eri would be more attractive to those with the largest levels of water overuse 4 discussion 4 1 soybean seed yield the response of soybean yield quality wp and iwue to furrow irrigation and row spacing were evaluated over three years in this study the results supported the hypothesis that ari could optimize soybean productivity and profitability the influence of dynamic weather conditions could limit the potential of management practices on soybean growth and development pinnamaneni et al 2020 uneven rainfall over the three years of this research may have partly altered the irrigation effect on soybean production the soybean yields were highest in the 2019 followed by 2020 and 2021 under non irrigated conditions in accordance with the rainfall amount received in individual year the highest grain yield increase 33 with additional water applied through furrow irrigation was observed in 2021 which received the lowest rainfall among the three years in this study mississippi receives less in season rain therefore farmers opt for irrigation water management practices evaluated by researchers to optimize the soybean productivity bryant et al 2017 kebede et al 2019 leininger et al 2019 pinnamaneni et al 2020b spencer et al 2019 however the results indicated that soybean yield response decreases with increasing irrigation water supply the driest year evaluated 2021 exhibited a stepwise increase in yield with increasing supply of irrigation water from ni compared to eri the eri had higher yield than the ari only in one 2021 out of three years in 2020 soil water potential readings showed less differences numerically in the ari and eri treatments this indicates that soil moisture differences were not high among ari and eri which could have led to the no differences in soybean yield however the soil potential readings in the 2021 showed that eri had greater soil water potential readings than the ari indicating low moisture in the soil profile under ari which consequently resulted in the lower yields in the ari than eri in 2021 factors such as water uptake by plants greater runoff losses and low water infiltration due to soil crusting at the surface might cause differences in water utilization by soybeans among treatments and years low yields in the ni might have been due to moisture stress at critical growth stages which can result in poor plant growth and development lower stomatal conductance and photosynthetic activity and consequently lower pod numbers and incomplete pod filling pinnamaneni et al 2020a as shown in fig 3 each unit increase in cumulative stress for days with soil water potential drier than the 40 and 70 kpa can reduce soybean yield by 0 3712 and 0 5651 kg ha 1 respectively whereas each unit increase in cumulative stress for days with soil water potential drier than the 40 can result in estimated yield loss of 1 2084 kg ha 1 researchers in the region have also recognized increased yield and profitability with ari compared to eri or ni in other crops planted on a bosket very fine sandy loam for instance leininger et al 2019 reported 1 8 fold increase in peanut yield under irrigated conditions compared to rainfed conditions in cotton pinnamaneni et al 2020b reported lint yield with ari 1942 kg ha 1 was higher than eri 1903 kg ha 1 over two years cotton planted in trs had 13 8 higher lint yield under eri and 16 5 higher lint yield under ari when compared to ni however rainfall had a profound impact on the results of the above findings similar to our findings pinnamaneni et al 2020a obtained no change in soybean yield between fully irrigated conditions 4500 kg ha 1 and half irrigated conditions 4400 kg ha 1 over three years in the ms delta soybean yield was comparatively lower under rainfed conditions 3900 kg ha 1 than either of the irrigated conditions pinnamaneni et al 2020a pinnamaneni et al 2020a attributed highest yield obtained in fully irrigated soybean to higher leaf area index solar radiation interception higher net photosynthesis and higher pods plant 1 in that treatment row spacing sr vs tr did not impact soybean plant population and seed yield in our study although the importance of twin row production has been recognized in the ms delta under esps the benefits of narrow row spacing were found to be inconsistent over years heatherly and hodges 1998 quintana ashwell et al 2021 the tr planting geometry over sr provide many benefits including faster canopy closure that suppresses late season weed germination and establishment greater light interception higher plant survival rates and improved nutrient and water use efficiencies bellaloui et al 2015 bowers et al 2000 bruns 2011a 2011b grichar 2007 mascagni et al 2008 robles et al 2012 smith et al 2019 however previous studies have revealed that benefits from narrow row production were primarily driven by rainfall amounts in a manner that the highest yield gain was observed in seasons with above average rainfall and no to little gain was observed in seasons with below average rainfall taylor 1980 bowers et al 2000 faster canopy development with narrow row soybean can increase evapotranspiration during early growth which may expose critical growth stages during reproductive development to soil water deficit conditions under low rainfall scenarios devlin et al 1995 graterol et al 1996 and can result in reduced grain yield and quality like our results turner et al 2019 did not find differences among tr and sr on soybean yield in mississippi delta region smith et al 2019 reported no effect on soybean yield with tr compared to sr in stoneville ms although tr had higher canopy closure than the sr soybean however pinnamaneni et al 2020a reported that twin row soybean yielded 600 kg ha 1 greater than single rows in stoneville mississippi on a dundee silt loam fine silty mixed active thermic typic endoaqualfs soil series with growing seasons receiving higher rainfall which is conducive for tr soybean among all the traits measured only test weight was sensitive to row spacing such that tw was greater with sr than tr under ni treatments in 2021 however no differences were observed in tw due to row spacing in other two years the 2021 was the drier year compared to the 2019 and 2020 planting soybean in a wide row in sr under the water deficit region conditions might have resulted in more available soil water for plants than in tr in the ms delta a large portion of groundwater is available to crops for irrigation research in the region is focused on evaluating the benefits of integrating different irrigation water management options bryant et al 2017 spencer et al 2019 the interaction of irrigation water management and row spacing has been studied less in recent evaluations an interaction between irrigation amount and row spacing showed no effect on soybean seed yield nutrition or water use efficiency pinnamaneni et al 2020a 2021 likewise our results have shown soybean grain yield and quality were more sensitive to irrigation water management than row spacing 4 2 seed seed quality the composition of soybean seed is affected by the environmental conditions water and nutrient application depending upon the crop yield potential and availability of resources assefa et al 2019 in our study protein content was not impacted by the irrigation and row spacing treatments but it was greater in 2020 than in year 2021 however the trend was opposite for the oil content in soybean seed a negative correlation has been reported for protein and oil concentration in the soybean seed boydak et al 2002 ray et al 2006 rotundo and westgate 2009 concluded that temperature and water availability are the main reasons for temporal variation in soybean seed composition few studies have shown that the effect of irrigation on protein concentration vary by the soybean genotypes boydak et al 2002 bellaloui and mengistu 2008 carrera et al 2009 reported a reduction in soybean protein concentration with water deficit during reproductive stages whereas kumar et al 2006 reported an increase in protein concentration with decrease in precipitation a meta analysis for soybean seed composition by rotundo and westgate 2009 showed that water stress negatively impacts protein and oil content mg per seed in soybean soybean oil seed content was greater under water stress conditions as in ni or eri compared to fully irrigated conditions as in eri in our study rose 1988 reported that the oil and protein percentages of the dryland seed can vary as compared to the irrigated treatments depending upon the balance between the decline in seed weight and response of these constituents to the pattern of stress similar to our results rose 1988 found that severe stress at the very early pod fill stage increased oil content and reduced protein content whereas no changes were found for protein and oil content in high rainfall season due to more availability of soil water for growth 4 3 irrigation water use efficiency and water productivity increased utilization of groundwater for irrigation has resulted in decline in water levels in the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer therefore it is very important to develop practices for water management for this region that can reduce irrigation water use and increase iwue while improving or maintaining crop yields the iwue was calculated as ratio of yield and irrigation water applied in our study although no significant difference in soybean yields were found in first two years of the study the iwue was higher with ari than the eri in our study in all three years since ari received half the irrigation water amount than the eri this showed that ari saved irrigation water without hurting soybean yields row spacing showed no impact on wp and iwue many studies have reported similar benefits of ari than eri pinnamaneni et al 2020a 2020b leininger et al 2019 pinnamaneni et al 2020a recorded higher iwue under half irrigated soybean planted in tr 63 kg ha 1 mm 1 or sr 53 kg ha 1 mm 1 compared to fully irrigated soybean in tr 38 kg ha 1 mm 1 or sr 32 kg ha 1 mm 1 in cotton 57 higher iwue was obtained with ari 3 05 kg ha 1 mm 1 was than eri 1 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 when averaged over two years pinnamaneni et al 2020b leininger et al 2019 reported a 5 3 fold increase in iwue by ari compared to eri in 2019 and 2020 there was higher rainfall and wp did not show response to irrigation treatments this indicates that excess water may be detrimental to soybean production in these soils soybean and other cash crops in the ms delta have shown increased grain yield and quality in response to the amount of irrigation water based on rainfall amounts pinnamaneni et al 2020a b pinnamaneni et al 2021 leininger et al 2019 high rainfall seasons have exhibited improvement in irrigation water use efficiency of soybean with ari compared to eri 4 4 risk and profits analysis the expected profits under all three irrigation treatments were higher for twin rows although no significant statistical differences were found for the agronomic production data of soybean with tr and sr p 0 05 the economic analysis indicates significant groundwater savings from ari 50 reduction come with a significant opportunity cost to farmers 0 94 mm 1 saved who produce soybean on fine sandy loam soils in humid areas such as the delta region of mississippi this opportunity cost is less than the average implicit incentive payment by nrcs in mississippi for the potential volume of groundwater saved because of those programs this relatively lower cost may make this an attractive practice to include in conservation programs furthermore the fact that the cost of these savings is the least for the cases in which there is a higher use of irrigation water would make such a program more attractive for high use growers than for those with lower levels of groundwater use i e actual self selection could result in much lower cost per volume of groundwater saved a caveat of such a policy would be that many farmers do not have records of groundwater use so they cannot evaluate the merits of the practice vis à vis their use of potential incentive programs 5 conclusions this study revealed a positive soybean yield quality and wp response to a conservation furrow irrigation practice however the amount of water required through furrow irrigation could be modified according to the rainfall amounts for instance ari was the most suitable option to optimize soybean yield quality and wp in an average or high rainfall season any additional water supplied from eri would benefit producers experiencing a season with low rainfall only a 20 increase in yield was observed using twice the amount of irrigation water supplied from eri even under low rainfall scenarios ari showed a 50 increase in yield compared to soybean grown under ni conditions water productivity and iwue were higher with ari across all three years the changes in row spacing had no significant improvement on soybean yields and did not show an interaction with irrigation management except for grain test weight in terms of risk return planting soybean in tw and irrigating every row presents the best risk return proposition for sr planting both irrigated systems offered an equivalent risk return proposition as the reduction in expected returns is associated with a reduction in the variability of those expected returns funding this publication is a contribution of the

control and showed the highest value in t4 fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 quality of water the water quality parameters are the important environmental factors for maximizing the productivity in aquaponics as they affect fish physiology growth feed efficiency and plant nutrient requirements yildiz et al 2017 pangasius shows tolerance to a wide range of environmental parameters with the best response to temperature regimes of 28 and 32ºc demonstrating an accelerated metabolic rate and development islam et al 2019 nxawe et al 2009 reported that leaf length mm leaf number and total fresh and dry weights g per plant were higher in spinach s oleracea l grown in hydroponics at elevated temperatures with optimum growth being recorded at 28 c for the growth of nitrifying bacteria in biofilters a temperature range of 17 34ºc is optimum somerville et al 2014 in the present experiment the temperature recorded was within the acceptable limit 22 80 30 25ºc for plants fish and nitrifiers in aquaponics the bioavailability of iron is influenced by ph which also affects iron chelates stability somerville et al 2014 wongkiew et al 2017 zou et al 2016 the ph range between 5 8 and 6 5 guarantees the availability of nutrients to plants whereas for nitrifying bacteria the ph range between 7 0 and 9 0 is ideal rakocy et al 2006 the ideal ph range for fish is between 6 5 and 9 0 iron eddha is stable in ph range of 4 0 9 0 albano and miller 2001 a slight decrease in the ph over the course of the trial was observed the system s acid production during nitrification causes the ph to drop rakocy et al 2004 for aquaponics components the ph of the current study 7 20 8 09 was within the acceptable range fish plant roots and the system s microflora all depend on keeping an ideal level of do the do in an aquaponic system must be tuned to meet the unique needs of the fish being farmed because plant roots and microbes have a lower oxygen requirement lesser than 3 mg l than fish greater than 5 mg l lennard and goddek 2019 aquaponic systems work best with a do concentration of 5 8 mg l somerville et al 2014 the do values observed in this study were within a favourable range of 4 40 7 47 mg l the hardness level was within the allowable limit of 20 300 mg l santhosh and singh 2007 at the end of the study there was a modest drop in alkalinity which was accounted for by the increased nitrification which consumed alkalinity lastiri et al 2018 the alkalinity was determined to be within the suitable range of 5 500 mg l lawson 1995 most research suggests that aquaponic solution s electrical conductivity ec is typically between 300 and 1100 µs cm graber and junge 2009 rakocy et al 2006 the ideal range for tds in a hydroponic solution is 1000 1500 mg l because nutrients are generated continuously in an aquaponic system relatively lower concentrations of tds 200 400 mg l will produce good results rakocy et al 2006 ec 437 33 880 67 µs cm and tds 227 466 mg l was within favourable change in aquaponics the tolerable limit for ammonia was reported as 1 0 mg l graber and junge 2009 in the present study the tan 0 03 0 15 mg l was found to be within the permissible limit the nitrite nitrogen was observed within a tolerable limit of less than 0 2 mg l graber and junge 2009 nitrate the end product of nitrification is the least toxic and preferred form of nitrogen for plants somerville et al 2014 santhosh and singh 2007 reported that fish culture water should include 0 1 4 mg l of nitrate graber and junge 2009 suggested a tolerance limit of 150 mg l for nitrate in the aquaponic system nitrate nitrogen content in the present study ranged from 0 01 to 0 71 mg l the tan nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen were significantly decreased due to enhanced absorption rate by plants and increased activity of nitrifying bacteria hu et al 2015 hussain et al 2014 phosphorus an essential element is absorbed by the plant as ionic orthophosphate eck et al 2019 orthophosphate content in an untreated aquaponic system never increases above 2 0 mg l and frequently stays around 1 0 mg l cerozi and fitzsimmons 2016a in the present study the phosphate level was found within the desired range one of the main limiting and crucial macronutrients for plants in the aquaponic system is potassium seawright et al 1998 stathopoulou et al 2021 reported a mean potassium concentration of 112 00 mg l for the iron plus potassium supplemented water and 4 44 mg l for iron supplemented water in the rocket plant tilapia aquaponics the potassium concentration in the typical aquaponic nutrient solution was reported to be 12 mg l cerozi and fitzsimmons 2016b john et al 2022 suggested a potassium dosage of 150 mg l ideal for the pangasius spinach aquaponics since there was no external potassium supplementation in the current study the potassium concentration 4 03 17 80 mg l was lower calcium is significantly deficient in aquaponics seawright et al 1998 wurts and durborow 1992 recommended 25 100 mg l of free calcium as permissible in fish culture water dhal et al 2022 suggested a calcium level of 27 mg l to support fish growth without affecting the winter crops in the aquaponic solution in the current study the calcium concentration showed decreasing trend and ranged between 14 63 and 60 53 mg l iron is important for the growth and development of plants and fish the major cause of the system s iron deficiency is the lower level of iron in commercial fish feed seawright et al 1998 rakocy et al 2006 the increased iron level in the treatments t1 t4 from the 30th day onward is due to the addition of iron using iron eddha in three split dosages in the system the iron concentration in water varied from 0 09 to 1 98 mg l phippen et al 2008 recommended an optimum range of 0 35 1 0 mg l as the total iron concentration for aquatic organisms john et al 2022 reported lower iron concentration of 0 08 0 09 mg l in aquaponic water without any external iron supplementation 4 2 plant growth and chlorophyll estimation iron is one of the most essential nutrients for the growth and production of plant its availability affects various morphological physiological and biochemical parameters of plants steer and hocking 1984 the findings of the present study demonstrated that iron supplementation in aquaponics improved the growth of plant in terms of height leaf count diameter and dry and wet weight which was consistent with the findings of danaher 2013 the highest yield was observed in the treatment t2 1 5 mg l and the lowest in control unsupplemented the lowest growth in control may be due to insufficient iron which reduces crop quality and yields and generates iron shortage signs such as interveinal chlorosis and necrotic patches in leaves with distorted edges of the leaf kosegarten et al 1998 somerville et al 2014 spinach yield increased in five successive harvests but decreased in the sixth harvest revegetated spinach reportedly provided a higher yield with improved antioxidant activity and overall phenolic content bantis et al 2021 the lower yield in the first harvest is probably due to the sensitivity of plant roots to the system s nutritional properties licamele 2009 the lower yield in the sixth harvest could be attributed to higher temperature alleviating deficiency of nutrients with time and the short life span of spinach the plants nutrient deficiencies cause suboptimal plant production rates delaide et al 2017 graber and junge 2009 the higher yield in t2 in all six harvests after iron supplementation might be because of high nutrients due to iron supplementation which stabilized ph and allowed the presence of nitrate rono 2018 roosta and mohsenian 2012 however in the present study t3 and t4 had a lower yield than t2 but higher than the control therefore it can be concluded that an increased dose of iron decreases the yield of spinach the higher dose of iron had an adverse effect and reduced the dry weight of both leaves and roots of the plants şimşek and çelik 2021 the chlorophyll and carotenoid content in the leaves of spinach plants was increased by iron eddha chelate supplementation the present study s finding was concurrent with that of roosta and hamidpour 2013 and zhao et al 2011 who reported that supplementing fe alone or in combination with other micronutrients improved the chlorophyll content of plants borowski and michałek 2011 also found that foliar fertilization on beans with inorganic iron salts considerably increased the amount of chlorophyll and carotenoids in the leaves and their stomatal conductance photosynthesis and transpiration rate agarwal et al 2021 reported that spinach cultivated in a hydroponic system contained 1 37 0 03 mg g fw and 0 68 0 00 mg g fw of chlorophyll a and b respectively borowski and michałek 2011 observed that fe edta supplemented in french bean leaves had a carotenoid concentration of 0 27 mg l 4 3 nutrients in plant a potent increase in the nutrient content was observed in the spinach leaves due to iron supplementation in modern horticulture the plant s biofortification or boosting nutrient content has gained more recognition than total yield by virtue of improved nutritional quality and health benefits d imperio et al 2019 rivera et al 2009 nutrient antagonism and synergism among the different ions determine nutrient availability to plants in a soilless system maucieri et al 2017 şimşek and çelik 2021 reported that an increase in the amount of iron in the medium led to buildup of iron particularly in the roots which had a detrimental effect on the uptake and transportation of other nutrients the iron eddha fertilizer significantly enhanced the iron content of spinach leaves in treatments than the control and was found to vary between 159 67 and 278 33 mg l a sharp rise in iron content in spinach leaves was observed with increased iron fortification in hydroponics and tilapia spinach aquaponics by şimşek and çelik 2021 and rono 2018 respectively the increased iron supplementation could potentially improve the uptake of n p zn and cu however when the dose exceeds the requirement the interactive effect could negatively impact the plant growth and yield via reduced uptake of essential macronutrients n and p and micronutrients zn and cu in spinach şimşek and çelik 2021 a comparable observation was recorded in the present experiment wherein the highest concentration of nitrogen phosphorus copper and zinc content in leaves was observed in the treatment t2 1 5 mg l and in treatments t3 and t4 higher dosages of iron exhibited a reduced nutrient content and yield the potassium and calcium levels in the spinach leaves in the present study ranged between 2 37 and 3 29 and 2 11 2 83 respectively which were found to improve with an increased supplementation of iron upto 1 5 mg l whereas a higher dosage of 2 0 mg l t3 and 2 5 mg l t4 reduced the nutrient uptake which may be due to the antagonistic effect of high fe the increased fe dosage positively impacted the growth dry matter and nutrient content of potassium and calcium in spinach leaves şimşek and çelik 2021 john et al 2022 reported potassium and calcium levels of 1 99 3 34 and 0 21 0 31 in spinach leaves in pangasius spinach aquaponics a similar observation was recorded in t2 for manganese mn content which ranged from 29 35 to 38 36 mg l and significant reduction as the dosage increased i e in t3 and t4 the increased doses of fe enhanced the uptake of mn by spinach leaves şimşek and çelik 2021 however competition arises for absorption of fe and mn as an abundance of one of them makes the other less available to plant roots asati et al 2016 the magnesium content in spinach leaves in the present study ranged between 1 27 and 1 44 with treatment groups exhibiting an increased nutrient content than the control şimşek and çelik 2021 reported an elevated mg content in spinach leaves by iron supplementation due to increased transportation of mg to the leaves on the other hand the sulphur content exhibited an antagonistic effect and varied between 0 26 and 0 34 john et al 2022 reported the sulphur content of 0 10 0 33 in spinach leaves in pangasius spinach aquaponics iron deficit increases the need for sulphur by activating the absorption and assimilation of sulphur at a pace similar to that of sulphur deficiency fe deficiency increased 35so4 2 uptake rates by maize and barley roots astolfi et al 2006 4 4 proximate analysis of plant the proximate composition parameters of plant viz moisture crude protein crude fat ash crude fibre and carbohydrate content in the present study were found to be comparable to that of spinach grown in soil and hydroponically however higher ash content was observed in the treatments because of varying mineral content owing to iron supplementation higher ash content was observed in t2 because ash and mineral contents correlated fairly monti et al 2008 agarwal et al 2021 reported the crude protein carbohydrate and fibre content of 2 85 g 100 g 3 64 g 100 g and 2 20 g 100 g in s oleracea grown hydroponically hanif et al 2006 reported the moisture crude protein crude fat carbohydrates fibre and ash content of 91 00 g 100 g 2 10 g 100 g 0 38 g 100 g 4 00 g 100 g 0 60 g 100 g and 1 10 g 100 g respectively in soil gown s oleracea leaves kuti et al 1999 found the crude protein carbohydrate crude fat ash and crude fibre content of 3 20 g 100 g 3 80 g 100 g 0 40 g 100 g 1 90 g 100 g and 0 90 g 100 g respectively in s oleracea leaves grown in soil the iron fertilization significantly increased the iron content of spinach leaves in treatments than control and was found to vary between 159 67 and 278 33 mg l şimşek and çelik 2021 and rono 2018 reported an increase in iron content in spinach leaves with increased iron fortification in hydroponics and tilapia spinach aquaponics respectively 4 5 fish growth feeding disruption was observed in the study during initial iron supplementation due to the variation in the nutrient concentration of the culture environment resulting in stress in fish malnutrition either from nutrient related imbalance shortage or overabundance induce stress in fish and hence feeding disruption can occur harper and wolf 2009 hussain et al 2014 the subsequent dosage did not disrupt the fish feeding behaviour demonstrating that the fish gradually adapted to the higher iron content in the system despite the feeding disruption during the study the final weight gain was remarkably higher in the treatment groups compared to the control at the end of the experiment indicating that the iron supplementation had a positive effect on fish growth higher growth was observed in the treatment t2 and the lowest in the control c lower growth in control c compared to the treatments provided with iron is possibly due to low iron and high ammonia concentration which adversely affect the growth of the fish ammonia levels as low as 0 06 mg l slightly reduced the growth in channel catfish boyd and pillai 1984 the findings of this study are consistent with those of gemaque et al 2019 who reported that at concentrations below 3 0 mg l fe3 the organism might tolerate acute exposure without causing any mortality a safe level of dissolved iron content is suggested to be 1 69 mg l for aquatic organisms randall et al 1999 jahan et al 2015 indicated an excessive amount of iron could be hazardous to fish if exposed to it for an extended period which may cause lower growth in t3 and t4 at the end of the experiment some gill coagulation was seen in t3 and t4 treatments dalzell and macfarlane 1999 reported physical clogging of gills and gill damage during lethal and sub lethal exposure to iron in brown trout ru et al 2017 reported better plant growth and water quality in aquaponics with micro and macro nutrient supplementation than the control in the present study iron supplementation facilitated better plant growth in treatments than control as a result fish developed significantly in the treatments than control the fish growth parameter viz sgr of the present study was found to be higher than 1 per day sgr of more than 1 0 per day was reported for p hypophthalmus in recirculating aquaponic system meena et al 2022 roy et al 2013 reported sgr greater than 1 per day for p hypophthalmus in raft aquaponics in polyculture ponds 4 6 stress in fish plasma biomarkers including glucose and cortisol serve as broad indicators to track fish health physiological status and stress reaction adikesavalu et al 2020 these biomarkers in elevated levels indicate the primary responses of fish to stress nuwansi et al 2021 the plasma cortisol varied between 72 94 and 98 46 ng ml plasma levels of cortisol increased during acute exposure to various stressors the plasma glucose varied between 74 84 and 104 74 mg dl higher blood glucose level was recorded particularly in t4 and t3 john et al 2022 reported a glucose level of 67 93 110 50 mg dl in pangasius in aquaponics subjected to potassium supplementation the enhanced glucose level indicates an increased energy demand in 2 5 mg l and 2 0 mg l supplemented treatment groups this increased energy demand might have been contributed by the energy spent on regulating iron imbalance by adjusting other osmolytes 5 conclusions iron is a crucial component for the sustainable growth of plants and fish in aquaponics the present study demonstrated that increasing dosage of iron increased the uptaken amounts of iron in the leaves the lower amount of iron not only negatively affected the iron content in the spinach but also the uptake of other nutrients however elevation of iron dosage encouraged the plant growth increased yield and the nutrients uptake from spinach leaves in contrast the higher dose of iron in treatments t3 2 0 mg l and t4 2 5 mg l had a negative effect and decreased the dry weight of leaves of the plant the study also demonstrated that an excessive amount of iron could be hazardous to fish if exposed to it for an extended period hence close nutrition management is necessary for better results based on the results of the presnt experiment it could be concluded that an iron dose of 1 5 mg l is optimum for the overall efficiency of the nutrient film technique based pangasius spinach

spinach were stocked at 2 8 kg m3 and 28 plants m2 respectively in each aquaponic unit during the experimental period the spinach was harvested six times during the fifth harvest 90th day the highest yield was observed in t2 881 74 17 16 g followed by t1 t3 t4 c 563 67 57 85 g the nutrient analysis of plants revealed that the iron interacted with essential macronutrients and micronutrients and had a beneficial impact on their uptake which in turn affected the plant growth and the yield of crops a significant p 0 05 difference was found in the fish body weight among the treatments and control the highest fish body weight was observed in t2 16 34 0 63 g followed by t3 t4 t1 c 11 72 0 38 g higher plasma cortisol and glucose values were recorded in t4 and t3 based on water quality parameters

unit of icar central institute of fisheries education mumbai the setup of the experiment consisted one control and four treatments which included 15 individual and identical aquaponic units fig 1 every aquaponic unit had a nutrient film technique nft based hydroponic unit and 174 72 l 0 80 0 56 0 39 m capacity fish culture tanks 100 l water volume the nft hydroponic unit was constructed using pvc pipes 4 inch diameter attached to a rectangular plastic tub of capacity 9 36 l 0 30 0 24 0 13 m filled with construction gravel 0 5 1 0 cm the nft was placed above the fish tank the filtration unit was installed at a height of 1 5 m above ground water was circulated between the fish and hydroponic tank using a 15 w submersible pump t kango tk 380 hmax 1 6 m connected to a network of pipes that channelized water to the filtration unit constructed with filter cloth and gravel before entering the nft unit then water was drained freely from the hydroponic unit to the fish tank under gravity the frequency of pumping was controlled by an automatic timer omron h3cr connected to a power supply unit which pumped water for 10 min in intervals of 30 min 20 min hour the rate of water flow of 174 l h was kept for this experiment continuous aeration was given in fish culture tanks to keep optimum dissolved oxygen during the experiment new water was added to compensate for evapotranspiration loss 2 2 experimental design and procedure the experiment used a completely randomized design with three replicates for four treatments and one control four different iron

pots from each replicate were randomly selected to determine the plant growth the parameters viz spinach yield potassium sulfur phosphorus iron magnesium calcium copper manganese zinc etc were analysed as described by john et al 2022 and motsara and roy 2008 2 5 chlorophyll and carotenoid estimation chlorophyll was extracted by using dimethyl sulphoxide dmso gunes et al 2007 twenty five milligrams of leaf tissue was placed in a vial containing three millilitres of dmso and kept at room temperature until it was chlorophyll free 12 16 h the extract was transferred to a graduated tube and absorbance was measured at 665 645 and 454 nm on a spectrophotometer with a multiple wavelength program calculations for various pigments like chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoid were done using the following equations lichtenthaler 1987 1 chlorophyll a mg g 11 75 x a665 2 35 x a645 x 3 25 2 chlorophyll b mg g 18 61 x a645 3 96 x a665 x 3 25 3 carotenoid mg g 1000 x a454 2 27 x chl a 81

pelican india after acid digestion and lipids were measured by diethyl ether extraction in a method of soxhlet extraction ash content was measured by incineration in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 5 h the crude fibre content analysis of fat free samples was performed through acid and alkali digestion method using fibre tech tulin equipment india and digested samples were then incinerated in a muffle furnace at 550 c for 5 h carbohydrate content was calculated by subtracting the values of protein moisture ash fibre and fat content from 100 the iron content in leaves was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer using standard procedures prescribed by motsara and roy 2008 2 7 growth of fish the length and weight of pangasius were measured every fifteen days using a graduated ruler and an electronic balance atom electronic digital compact a123 respectively the fish growth parameters viz percentage weight gain wg specific growth rate sgr day and survival rate of p hypophthalmus

from the caudal vein with the addition of an anticoagulant the blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm after being left to stand for 3 h the obtained plasma was kept in a freezer at 20 c for further analysis the plasma cortisol and glucose were estimated using fish cortisol cor elisa kit krishgen biosystems and coral clinical systems glucose diagnostic kit and the values were expressed in ng ml and mg dl respectively the guidelines issued by the government of india for the care and use of fish for research were followed in the present experiment using spss version 26 0 the experimental data were statistically evaluated using one way analysis of variance anova and duncan s multiple range test to determine significant difference between the treatments and control 3 results 3 1 quality

recorded in c 159 67 9 30 mg l the difference in the content of other nutrients was observed due to the antagonism and synergism of these nutrients with iron ions in the solution the highest potassium content in spinach leaves was found in t2 3 29 0 17 and the lowest in c 2 37 0 22 the calcium content of leaves also exhibited a similar trend the nutrient antagonism was observed with the absorption

control and showed the highest value in t4 fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 quality of water the water quality parameters are the important environmental factors for maximizing the productivity in aquaponics as they affect fish physiology growth feed efficiency and plant nutrient requirements yildiz et al 2017 pangasius shows tolerance to a wide range of environmental parameters with the best response to temperature regimes of 28 and 32ºc demonstrating an accelerated metabolic rate and development islam et al 2019 nxawe et al 2009 reported that leaf length mm leaf number and total fresh and dry weights g per plant were higher in spinach s oleracea l grown in hydroponics at elevated temperatures with optimum growth being recorded at 28 c for the growth of nitrifying bacteria in biofilters a temperature range of 17 34ºc is optimum somerville et al 2014 in the present experiment the temperature recorded was within the acceptable limit 22 80 30 25ºc for plants fish and nitrifiers in aquaponics the bioavailability of iron is influenced by ph which also affects iron chelates stability somerville et al 2014 wongkiew et al 2017 zou et al 2016 the ph range between 5 8 and 6 5 guarantees the availability of nutrients to plants whereas for nitrifying bacteria the ph range between 7 0 and 9 0 is ideal rakocy et al 2006 the ideal ph range for fish is between 6 5 and 9 0 iron eddha is stable in ph range of 4 0 9 0 albano and miller 2001 a slight decrease in the ph over the course of the trial was observed the system s acid production during nitrification causes the ph to drop rakocy et al 2004 for aquaponics components the ph of the current study 7 20 8 09 was within the acceptable range fish plant roots and the system s microflora all depend on keeping an ideal level of do the do in an aquaponic system must be tuned to meet the unique needs of the fish being farmed because plant roots and microbes have a lower oxygen requirement lesser than 3 mg l than fish greater than 5 mg l lennard and goddek 2019 aquaponic systems work best with a do concentration of 5 8 mg l somerville et al 2014 the do values observed in this study were within a favourable range of 4 40 7 47 mg l the hardness level was within the allowable limit of 20 300 mg l santhosh and singh 2007 at the end of the study there was a modest drop in alkalinity which was accounted for by the increased nitrification which consumed alkalinity lastiri et al 2018 the alkalinity was determined to be within the suitable range of 5 500 mg l lawson 1995 most research suggests that aquaponic solution s electrical conductivity ec is typically between 300 and 1100 µs cm graber and junge 2009 rakocy et al 2006 the ideal range for tds in a hydroponic solution is 1000 1500 mg l because nutrients are generated continuously in an aquaponic system relatively lower concentrations of tds 200 400 mg l will produce good results rakocy et al 2006 ec 437 33 880 67 µs cm and tds 227 466 mg l was within favourable change in aquaponics the tolerable limit for ammonia was reported as 1 0 mg l graber and junge 2009 in the present study the tan 0 03 0 15 mg l was found to be within the permissible limit the nitrite nitrogen was observed within a tolerable limit of less than 0 2 mg l graber and junge 2009 nitrate the end product of nitrification is the least toxic and preferred form of nitrogen for plants somerville et al 2014 santhosh and singh 2007 reported that fish culture water should include 0 1 4 mg l of nitrate graber and junge 2009 suggested a tolerance limit of 150 mg l for nitrate in the aquaponic system nitrate nitrogen content in the present study ranged from 0 01 to 0 71 mg l the tan nitrite nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen were significantly decreased due to enhanced absorption rate by plants and increased activity of nitrifying bacteria hu et al 2015 hussain et al 2014 phosphorus an essential element is absorbed by the plant as ionic orthophosphate eck et al 2019 orthophosphate content in an untreated aquaponic system never increases above 2 0 mg l and frequently stays around 1 0 mg l cerozi and fitzsimmons 2016a in the present study the phosphate level was found within the desired range one of the main limiting and crucial macronutrients for plants in the aquaponic system is potassium seawright et al 1998 stathopoulou et al 2021 reported a mean potassium concentration of 112 00 mg l for the iron plus potassium supplemented water and 4 44 mg l for iron supplemented water in the rocket plant tilapia aquaponics the potassium concentration in the typical aquaponic nutrient solution was reported to be 12 mg l cerozi and fitzsimmons 2016b john et al 2022 suggested a potassium dosage of 150 mg l ideal for the pangasius spinach aquaponics since there was no external potassium supplementation in the current study the potassium concentration 4 03 17 80 mg l was lower calcium is significantly deficient in aquaponics seawright et al 1998 wurts and durborow 1992 recommended 25 100 mg l of free calcium as permissible in fish culture water dhal et al 2022 suggested a calcium level of 27 mg l to support fish growth without affecting the winter crops in the aquaponic solution in the current study the calcium concentration showed decreasing trend and ranged between 14 63 and 60 53 mg l iron is important for the growth and development of plants and fish the major cause of the system s iron deficiency is the lower level of iron in commercial fish feed seawright et al 1998 rakocy et al 2006 the increased iron level in the treatments t1 t4 from the 30th day onward is due to the addition of iron using iron eddha in three split dosages in the system the iron concentration in water varied from 0 09 to 1 98 mg l phippen et al 2008 recommended an optimum range of 0 35 1 0 mg l as the total iron concentration for aquatic organisms john et al 2022 reported lower iron concentration of 0 08 0 09 mg l in aquaponic water without any external iron supplementation 4 2 plant growth and chlorophyll estimation iron is one of the most essential nutrients for the growth and production of plant its availability affects various morphological physiological and biochemical parameters of plants steer and hocking 1984 the findings of the present study demonstrated that iron supplementation in aquaponics improved the growth of plant in terms of height leaf count diameter and dry and wet weight which was consistent with the findings of danaher 2013 the highest yield was observed in the treatment t2 1 5 mg l and the lowest in control unsupplemented the lowest growth in control may be due to insufficient iron which reduces crop quality and yields and generates iron shortage signs such as interveinal chlorosis and necrotic patches in leaves with distorted edges of the leaf kosegarten et al 1998 somerville et al 2014 spinach yield increased in five successive harvests but decreased in the sixth harvest revegetated spinach reportedly provided a higher yield with improved antioxidant activity and overall phenolic content bantis et al 2021 the lower yield in the first harvest is probably due to the sensitivity of plant roots to the system s nutritional properties licamele 2009 the lower yield in the sixth harvest could be attributed to higher temperature alleviating deficiency of nutrients with time and the short life span of spinach the plants nutrient deficiencies cause suboptimal plant production rates delaide et al 2017 graber and junge 2009 the higher yield in t2 in all six harvests after iron supplementation might be because of high nutrients due to iron supplementation which stabilized ph and allowed the presence of nitrate rono 2018 roosta and mohsenian 2012 however in the present study t3 and t4 had a lower yield than t2 but higher than the control therefore it can be concluded that an increased dose of iron decreases the yield of spinach the higher dose of iron had an adverse effect and reduced the dry weight of both leaves and roots of the plants şimşek and çelik 2021 the chlorophyll and carotenoid content in the leaves of spinach plants was increased by iron eddha chelate supplementation the present study s finding was concurrent with that of roosta and hamidpour 2013 and zhao et al 2011 who reported that supplementing fe alone or in combination with other micronutrients improved the chlorophyll content of plants borowski and michałek 2011 also found that foliar fertilization on beans with inorganic iron salts considerably increased the amount of chlorophyll and carotenoids in the leaves and their stomatal conductance photosynthesis and transpiration rate agarwal et al 2021 reported that spinach cultivated in a hydroponic system contained 1 37 0 03 mg g fw and 0 68 0 00 mg g fw of chlorophyll a and b respectively borowski and michałek 2011 observed that fe edta supplemented in french bean leaves had a carotenoid concentration of 0 27 mg l 4 3 nutrients in plant a potent increase in the nutrient content was observed in the spinach leaves due to iron supplementation in modern horticulture the plant s biofortification or boosting nutrient content has gained more recognition than total yield by virtue of improved nutritional quality and health benefits d imperio et al 2019 rivera et al 2009 nutrient antagonism and synergism among the different ions determine nutrient availability to plants in a soilless system maucieri et al 2017 şimşek and çelik 2021 reported that an increase in the amount of iron in the medium led to buildup of iron particularly in the roots which had a detrimental effect on the uptake and transportation of other nutrients the iron eddha fertilizer significantly enhanced the iron content of spinach leaves in treatments than the control and was found to vary between 159 67 and 278 33 mg l a sharp rise in iron content in spinach leaves was observed with increased iron fortification in hydroponics and tilapia spinach aquaponics by şimşek and çelik 2021 and rono 2018 respectively the increased iron supplementation could potentially improve the uptake of n p zn and cu however when the dose exceeds the requirement the interactive effect could negatively impact the plant growth and yield via reduced uptake of essential macronutrients n and p and micronutrients zn and cu in spinach şimşek and çelik 2021 a comparable observation was recorded in the present experiment wherein the highest concentration of nitrogen phosphorus copper and zinc content in leaves was observed in the treatment t2 1 5 mg l and in treatments t3 and t4 higher dosages of iron exhibited a reduced nutrient content and yield the potassium and calcium levels in the spinach leaves in the present study ranged between 2 37 and 3 29 and 2 11 2 83 respectively which were found to improve with an increased supplementation of iron upto 1 5 mg l whereas a higher dosage of 2 0 mg l t3 and 2 5 mg l t4 reduced the nutrient uptake which may be due to the antagonistic effect of high fe the increased fe dosage positively impacted the growth dry matter and nutrient content of potassium and calcium in spinach leaves şimşek and çelik 2021 john et al 2022 reported potassium and calcium levels of 1 99 3 34 and 0 21 0 31 in spinach leaves in pangasius spinach aquaponics a similar observation was recorded in t2 for manganese mn content which ranged from 29 35 to 38 36 mg l and significant reduction as the dosage increased i e in t3 and t4 the increased doses of fe enhanced the uptake of mn by spinach leaves şimşek and çelik 2021 however competition arises for absorption of fe and mn as an abundance of one of them makes the other less available to plant roots asati et al 2016 the magnesium content in spinach leaves in the present study ranged between 1 27 and 1 44 with treatment groups exhibiting an increased nutrient content than the control şimşek and çelik 2021 reported an elevated mg content in spinach leaves by iron supplementation due to increased transportation of mg to the leaves on the other hand the sulphur content exhibited an antagonistic effect and varied between 0 26 and 0 34 john et al 2022 reported the sulphur content of 0 10 0 33 in spinach leaves in pangasius spinach aquaponics iron deficit increases the need for sulphur by activating the absorption and assimilation of sulphur at a pace similar to that of sulphur deficiency fe deficiency increased 35so4 2 uptake rates by maize and barley roots astolfi et al 2006 4 4 proximate analysis of plant the proximate composition parameters of plant viz moisture crude protein crude fat ash crude fibre and carbohydrate content in the present study were found to be comparable to that of spinach grown in soil and hydroponically however higher ash content was observed in the treatments because of varying mineral content owing to iron supplementation higher ash content was observed in t2 because ash and mineral contents correlated fairly monti et al 2008 agarwal et al 2021 reported the crude protein carbohydrate and fibre content of 2 85 g 100 g 3 64 g 100 g and 2 20 g 100 g in s oleracea grown hydroponically hanif et al 2006 reported the moisture crude protein crude fat carbohydrates fibre and ash content of 91 00 g 100 g 2 10 g 100 g 0 38 g 100 g 4 00 g 100 g 0 60 g 100 g and 1 10 g 100 g respectively in soil gown s oleracea leaves kuti et al 1999 found the crude protein carbohydrate crude fat ash and crude fibre content of 3 20 g 100 g 3 80 g 100 g 0 40 g 100 g 1 90 g 100 g and 0 90 g 100 g respectively in s oleracea leaves grown in soil the iron fertilization significantly increased the iron content of spinach leaves in treatments than control and was found to vary between 159 67 and 278 33 mg l şimşek and çelik 2021 and rono 2018 reported an increase in iron content in spinach leaves with increased iron fortification in hydroponics and tilapia spinach aquaponics respectively 4 5 fish growth feeding disruption was observed in the study during initial iron supplementation due to the variation in the nutrient concentration of the culture environment resulting in stress in fish malnutrition either from nutrient related imbalance shortage or overabundance induce stress in fish and hence feeding disruption can occur harper and wolf 2009 hussain et al 2014 the subsequent dosage did not disrupt the fish feeding behaviour demonstrating that the fish gradually adapted to the higher iron content in the system despite the feeding disruption during the study the final weight gain was remarkably higher in the treatment groups compared to the control at the end of the experiment indicating that the iron supplementation had a positive effect on fish growth higher growth was observed in the treatment t2 and the lowest in the control c lower growth in control c compared to the treatments provided with iron is possibly due to low iron and high ammonia concentration which adversely affect the growth of the fish ammonia levels as low as 0 06 mg l slightly reduced the growth in channel catfish boyd and pillai 1984 the findings of this study are consistent with those of gemaque et al 2019 who reported that at concentrations below 3 0 mg l fe3 the organism might tolerate acute exposure without causing any mortality a safe level of dissolved iron content is suggested to be 1 69 mg l for aquatic organisms randall et al 1999 jahan et al 2015 indicated an excessive amount of iron could be hazardous to fish if exposed to it for an extended period which may cause lower growth in t3 and t4 at the end of the experiment some gill coagulation was seen in t3 and t4 treatments dalzell and macfarlane 1999 reported physical clogging of gills and gill damage during lethal and sub lethal exposure to iron in brown trout ru et al 2017 reported better plant growth and water quality in aquaponics with micro and macro nutrient supplementation than the control in the present study iron supplementation facilitated better plant growth in treatments than control as a result fish developed significantly in the treatments than control the fish growth parameter viz sgr of the present study was found to be higher than 1 per day sgr of more than 1 0 per day was reported for p hypophthalmus in recirculating aquaponic system meena et al 2022 roy et al 2013 reported sgr greater than 1 per day for p hypophthalmus in raft aquaponics in polyculture ponds 4 6 stress in fish plasma biomarkers including glucose and cortisol serve as broad indicators to track fish health physiological status and stress reaction adikesavalu et al 2020 these biomarkers in elevated levels indicate the primary responses of fish to stress nuwansi et al 2021 the plasma cortisol varied between 72 94 and 98 46 ng ml plasma levels of cortisol increased during acute exposure to various stressors the plasma glucose varied between 74 84 and 104 74 mg dl higher blood glucose level was recorded particularly in t4 and t3 john et al 2022 reported a glucose level of 67 93 110 50 mg dl in pangasius in aquaponics subjected to potassium supplementation the enhanced glucose level indicates an increased energy demand in 2 5 mg l and 2 0 mg l supplemented treatment groups this increased energy demand might have been contributed by the energy spent on regulating iron imbalance by adjusting other osmolytes 5 conclusions iron is a crucial component for the sustainable growth of plants and fish in aquaponics the present study demonstrated that increasing dosage of iron increased the uptaken amounts of iron in the leaves the lower amount of iron not only negatively affected the iron content in the spinach but also the uptake of other nutrients however elevation of iron dosage encouraged the plant growth increased yield and the nutrients uptake from spinach leaves in contrast the higher dose of iron in treatments t3 2 0 mg l and t4 2 5 mg l had a negative effect and decreased the dry weight of leaves of the plant the study also demonstrated that an excessive amount of iron could be hazardous to fish if exposed to it for an extended period hence close nutrition management is necessary for better results based on the results of the presnt experiment it could be concluded that an iron dose of 1 5 mg l is optimum for the overall efficiency of the nutrient film technique based pangasius spinach
