5505,flood discharge and its frequency is an important input to many infrastructure development management and decision making models however for a number of potential sites the data used for statistical analysis of flood discharge and its frequency are either insufficient or unavailable in such a situation empirical formulae are the only alternative method to provide an estimate of design flood dicken s formula is one of such empirical formulae used by practicing field engineers for flood estimation in spite of its simplicity and applicability dicken s formula is not capable of yielding flood volume at different desired frequency in the present study an attempt has been made to modify the dicken s coefficient so as to accommodate the frequency component in flood estimation for this purpose observed flood discharge data sixteen gauging points of ganga basin have been used to develop regional flood frequency curve using probability weighted method index flood method general extreme value and wakeby distribution modified dicken s coefficient ct shows a sharp gradient for sub catchments draining up to 5000 km2 further ct value ranges from 0 834 to 6 924 the ct values are lower when calculated by index flood method while these are higher by wakeby method in all of these methods ct values do not approach the values of 11 or 14 as suggested for northern indian catchments an analysis of flood volume corresponding to ct values of 11 or 14 reveals that these values yield high flood volume that correspond to return period of more than 1000 years and 3000 years respectively these values are certainly very high for any rational design best fit distribution is decided based on annual maximum discharge peak adf efficiency eff and standard error se parameters prediction accuracy of flood frequency analysis using revised dicken s formula is found to be above 85 for the best fit distribution general extreme value is found to be the best fit distribution for the upper ganga basin keywords flood estimation dicken s formula revised dicken s coefficient index flood method wakeby distribution gev distribution 1 introduction design of any important developmental project for example small hydropower projects or other hydraulic structures requires data of flood magnitudes and their frequencies suitable methodology to be adopted for estimation of design flood for a project depends upon importance of the project economic and safety consideration data availability and computational facilities etc an accurate assessment of the river flow is essential for estimating the design discharge for any hydraulic projects at the proposed site increasing trend in one or more flood characteristics have led researchers around the globe to find a way for more reliable flood prediction measures hall et al 2014 vormoor et al 2016 kundzewicz 2019 however for a number of potential sites there is either insignificant data or no data which can be used to estimate the flow statistics regional flood frequency analysis in ungauged basins have been a subject of interest various methods like l moments method and annual maximum series of mean daily streamflow has been used for reliable prediction of flood quantiles in various countries smithers and schulze 2001 hosking and wallis 2005 kumar and chatterjee 2005 malekinezhad and zare garizi 2014 hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2017 empirical formulas are the only alternative method to provide an estimate of the design flood in ungauged catchment and as such various empirical formulae have been devised for different regions of the country acreman 1985 commission 1980 greenwood et al 1979 huq et al 1986 most of these empirical formulae involve one or two physical characteristics for estimation of the flood peaks these formulae are essentially the regional formulae based on statistical correlation of the observed peaks and important catchments and climatologic characteristics however in the present form these formulae are not capable of providing flood estimates for a desired return period commission 1980 one of the empirical formula adopted for moderate size north indian catchments is dickens formula which is given as 1 q c a 0 75 where q is flood volume in cumecs a is catchments area in sq km and c is the dickens coefficient whose values for various regions are given in table 1 the coefficient c is chosen from the given range for the specific regions in spite of its simplicity and applicability dicken s formula is not capable of yielding flood volume at different desired frequency in this paper a methodology is being presented for the computation of revised coefficient of the dickens formula to estimate design flood of different return period by relating the frequency curves developed for hydro meteorologically homogeneous regions by fitting probability weighted moments pwm based index flood method general extreme value gev and wakeby distributions to the data of 16 gauging sites of ganga basin in himalayan region the floods of different return periods are computed for four test catchments for validation of the revised dickens formula this revised dicken s empirical formula will enhance its practical utility for computation of flood volume for upper ganga basins 2 geoidentity and data availability based on hydrological response india has been geographically categorized into seven major hydro meteorological zones these are further sub divided into 26 hydro meteorologicalsub zones the upper ganga basin is situated between latitude 32 34 n longitude 76 78 e the present study area falls into hydro meteorological zone 7 of india see fig 1 most of rivers and their tributaries of upper ganga basin are snow fed while the normal annual rainfall in this region varies between 700 mm and 1500 mm the elevation in the area ranges between 2500 m and 350 m and land slope in area is steep and varies frequently in upper reaches and along river course the climate of this basin is tropical monsoon type with precipitations due to southeastern monsoon as well as due to western disturbances during winter the southwestern monsoon generally lasts from june to september but occasionally extends up to october precipitation during this season falls as rain which is generally not heavy while the winter precipitation falls as rain or snow depending upon altitude and other meteorological conditions the sub basin characteristics are tabulated in table 2 stream flow is being measured at 16 gauging sites while the observed annual maximum peak flow at these sites for 20 years of record has been utilized in this study 3 methodology available methods for carrying out flood frequency analysis are listed in table 3 goswami 1972 greis and wood 1981 greis 1983 jakhade et al 1984 james et al 1987 the usgs methods have been used for testing the regional homogeneity the methods for development of regional flood frequency curves using probability weighted moments pwm index flood method general extreme value gev and wakeby distribution have been described in detail elsewhere kuczera 1982 kuczera 1983a b landwehr et al 1984 singh et

the methods for development of regional relationship for the estimation of mean annual peak flood and selection of robust method based on average of the relative deviation between computed and observed values of maximum annual discharge flood adf efficiency eff and standard error se see fig 2 methodology adopted for revision of dickens formula to accommodate flood frequency has been given in a flow chart as shown in fig 3 in order to decide the suitable methods for the present analysis the numerical values of adf eff and rmse have been calculated and tabulated in table 4 from the table 4 a graph fig 4 between adf eff and se for different distributions versus number of catchments have been plotted an analysis of table 4 and fig 4 revels that for most of the sites index flood method based on adf and eff and wakeby method based on rmse and eff have fitted well the second best method based on adf eff and se was found to be gev index flood gev and wakeby methods are being briefly described 3 1 regional flood frequency methods 3 1 1 index flood method the growth factor qt q is given by 2 q t q μ α y t where qt is t year return period flood estimate q the mean annual peak flood and yt is index μ and α are the index flood distribution parameter flood reduced variate corresponding to t year flood is given by 3 y t ln ln 1 1 t 3 1 2 gev method the growth factor q t q is given by 4 q t q μ α y t g where y tg is the reduced variate corresponding to t year return flood 5 y tg 1 ln 1 1 t k k where μ α and k are the gev distribution parameter 3 1 3 wakeby method the growth factor q t q is given by 6 q t q x t m a 1 1 t b c 1 1 t d where μ α k a b c d and m are the parameters used in respective methods these parameters are estimated using pwm technique proposed by greenwood et al 1979 and is shown in table 5 variation of growth factor is shown in fig 5 3 2 estimation of mean annual flow for estimation of qt at a site in a region the estimate of the mean annual peak flood is required for gauged catchments such estimate can be obtained based on mean of the annual maximum peak flood data however for ungauged catchments mean cannot be computed in absence of flow data in such a situation a relationship between the mean annual peak flood of the gauged catchments in the region and their pertinent physiographic characteristics is needed for the estimation of the mean annual peak flood generally catchment area is considered as one of the most prominent physiographic characteristics a relationship of the following form is developed in terms of catchments area for the estimation of mean annual peak flood for the ungauged sites 7 q a a b where q is mean annual flow in cumecs a is catchments area in sq km and a b are the coefficient to be estimated in the present study numerical value of constant a and b were determined from the historical data in least square sense their values are found to be 0 55 and 0 89 fig 6 4 revision of dicken s coefficient by indication the dicken s formula for t year return period can be written as 8 q t c t a 0 75 dividing eq 8 by eq 7 the equation obtained is 9 q t q c t a 0 75 a a b c t a 0 75 b a 10 therefore c t q t q a a b 0 75 substituting for q t q in the eq 10 from eq 2 4 and 6 the revised dickens coefficient ct can be written as shown in table 6 5 development of regional frequency curves observed annual maximum peak flood data were used for development of regional frequency curves for upper ganga basin these curves are shown in figs 7 9 an analysis of these curve reveal that for catchments draining up to 5000 km2 numerical value of ct shows a sharp gradient further ct value ranges between 0 834 and 6 924 the ct values are lower when calculated by index flood method while these are higher by wakeby method a plot of the growth factor in fig 5 of the manuscript shows that growth factor by index flood method is always lower than other methods for all return period this may be attributed to the lowest number only two of parameters involved in index flood method in comparison to other methods table 5 having more parameters since ct value is proportional to growth factor eq 10 therefore index flood method provides lower value for ct in comparison to other methods the ct values calculated by different flood frequency methods and corresponding dicken s flood estimations have been given in tables 7 9 for selected catchments in all of these methods ct values do not approach the values of 11 or 14 as suggested for northern indian catchments an analysis of table 10 reveals that these values yield high flood volume that too corresponding to return period more than 1000 years and 3000 years respectively these values are certainly very high for any rational design 6 model validation the historical data pertaining to gd13 gd14 gd15 and gd16 have been used to verify the developed flood frequency model for upper ganga basin from the historical records for these test sites the site parameters pertaining to index flood method gev and wakeby distribution were computed from these computed parameters the flood volumes at sites for different recurrence intervals have been computed using the regional flood model developed in present study and tabulated along with their adf in tables 11 14 comparison of at site and regional discharge for the four gauging sites have been presented in fig 10 after observing the results as shown in tables it may be concluded that frequency based dicken s formula gives quite low values 7 conclusion insignificant or no data for a number of potential sites present difficulty in estimating the flood volume and as such the flow statistics several empirical methods are available for this task but they are complex and computationally not efficient the proposed method of flood frequency analysis is based on dicken s formula and it is very simple and widely used for predicting the flood discharge at these ungauged sites and is used by practicing field engineers for flood estimation however the dicken s formula needs revision as it is not capable of yielding flood volume at different desired frequency the constant c in the dicken s formula has been revised to accommodate the concept of return period so as to accommodate the frequency component in flood estimation for upper ganga basin the observed flood discharge data from 16 sites in ganga basin has been used to develop regional flood frequency curve using probability weighted method index flood method general extreme value and wakeby distribution modified dicken s

extreme value is the best fit distribution for the ganga basin which is in line with nerc recommendations it is anticipated that the prediction accuracy of flood frequency analysis using revised dicken s formula will improve from present 85 if the additional data for the hydrological region would be available the proposed approach can be utilized to carry out flood frequency analysis for un

5506,modeling rainfall runoff processes in semi arid regions remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of rainfall soil type and topography the goal of this study is to develop an improved rainfall runoff model for flood forecast for semi arid regions a physically based infiltration distribution curve is developed and added to the green ampt based rainfall runoff ga pic model validation tests for two semi arid basins suggest that the ga pic model has lower forecast errors of runoff depth and peak flow than the traditional green ampt model as the physically based infiltration distribution curve effectively captures the impacts of spatiotemporal variability of rainfall and land surface conditions on runoff generation a higher density of rainfall stations and a smaller computational time step lead to improved flood forecasting accuracies for semi arid basins keywords semi arid basin rainfall runoff process green ampt infiltration model infiltration distribution curve 1 introduction hydrological models are simplified descriptions of natural hydrological processes that have been widely used for over 70 years chow et al 1988 dan and henrik 2005 maidment 1993 pinos and timble 2019 most models have shown good performances for humid basins world meteorological organization 1975 due to great spatial variations of rainfall with limited rain gauges pilgrim et al 1988 hassan et al 2014 mediero and kjeldsen 2014 wang et al 2020 hydrological models perform less satisfactorily for semi arid regions castillo et al 2003 li et al 2005 rozalis et al 2010 which has received little attention until recently howard et al 2007 wheater et al 2008 chao et al 2018 chao et al 2019 according to the unesco 1979 nearly half the countries of the world face problems of aridity floods in arid and semi arid areas are infrequent but extremely damaging and the threat from floods to lives and infrastructure is increasing due to urban development wheater et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 khaing et al 2019 thus understanding and modeling hydrological processes has even greater significance over arid and semi arid regions jothityangkoon et al 2001 applied a downward approach to study the water balance variability of a large semi arid catchment in western australia and found that spatial variability of soil depths appears to be the most important control on runoff variability at all time and space scales in this catchment followed by the spatial variability of climate and vegetation cover saito et al 2006 developed a numerical model to study the coupled water and heat transport in the vadose zone of arid and semi arid regions the simulated temperatures and water contents of this model were in good agreement with field observations they concluded that soil water dynamics are strongly associated with the soil temperature regime huang et al 2016 applied seven hydrological models to three semi arid catchments in the northern china and found that the dominant runoff generation mechanism for semi arid catchments is the infiltration excess surface runoff which is a nonlinear process for semi arid catchments a suitable model needs include at least one nonlinear component such as a parabolic infiltration curve to simulate the surface runoff generation qiao et al 2018 investigated the vertical distribution of soil water content and storage at five sites on the loess plateau in china their analysis showed that the profiles of soil water content change with not only soil depth but also soil bulk density in semi arid regions for semi arid regions the dominant runoff generation mechanism is infiltration excess process due to thick soil layer and low soil water content simmers 2003 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b infiltration models are classified into three groups mishra and singh 1999 physically based semi empirical and empirical the physically based infiltration models include the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 and the philip infiltration model philip 1957 1969 while common semi empirical models include these models developed by horton 1938 and holtan 1961 the model developed by huggins and monke 1966 and the modified kostiakov model smith 1972 are the typical empirical models the green ampt model is widely used in modeling infiltration processes due to its low computational cost and high computational accuracy scoging 1992 castillo et al 2003 muñoz carpena et al 2018 however the limitation of the green ampt model is that it assumes isotropic soil with uniform initial water content which causes inaccuracy for infiltration excess runoff calculation over heterogeneous soil bao 1993 introduced an empirical infiltration distribution curve into the green ampt rainfall runoff model in order to deal with the heterogeneity of rainfall topography and soil type hsu and hilpert 2011 generalized the green ampt model by introducing the concept of dynamic capillary pressure in terms of flow velocity stewart 2018 proposed a dynamic multi domain green ampt infiltration model by parameterizing the effect of soil shrinkage and swelling on the pore size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity compared with the classic green ampt model the multi domain model improves infiltration runoff partitioning at multiple scales gowdish and muñoz carpena 2018 developed a three dimensional green ampt model 3dmgar to simulate the three dimensional distribution of soil water of point source events previous studies using the green ampt model usually focused on infiltration and soil water distribution instead of runoff generation and flood forecast the objective of this study is to develop an improved green ampt rainfall runoff model with a physically based infiltration distribution curve ga pic model characterizing the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall controlled soil wetness and landscape to improve flood forecast for semi arid regions 2 rainfall runoff model 2 1 green ampt rainfall runoff model the green ampt rainfall runoff model is an infiltration excess runoff model based on the green ampt infiltration equation green and ampt 1911 the basic assumptions are that the soil profile and initial soil water content are homogeneous and that infiltration produces a sharp wetting front separating the soil layer into wetting and drying zone wetting zone soil is saturated while drying zone soil maintains its initial soil water content the green ampt infiltration equation is written as 1 f t k 1 ψ δ θ f t where f t is infiltration capacity mm h 1 f t the cumulative infiltration mm k the saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 ψ the wetting front capillary pressure head mm δ θ the change of soil water content across the wetting front and t the time h in the green ampt rainfall runoff model runoff is calculated as rainfall intensity minus infiltration capacity given in eq 1 when rainfall intensity is less than infiltration capacity all the rainwater infiltrates into soil without generating runoff the infiltrated rainwater replenishes the cumulative infiltration f t followed by the change of infiltration capacity f t which will influence runoff generation at the next time step evapotranspiration is calculated using a three layer soil water model zhao 1992 since this model is widely used in hydrological models and has been proved to be accurate in estimating evapotranspiration zhang and chiew 2009 yao et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 overland flow concentration is calculated using the linear reservoir method the surface runoff is considered to flow into a virtual reservoir in which outflow has a linear relationship with storage a detailed description of the linear reservoir method can be found in nash 1960 and zhao 1992 river flow concentration of the green ampt rainfall runoff model is calculated using the muskingum routing method mccarthy 1938 2 2 green ampt infiltration distribution curve in semi arid areas rainfall and underlying surface characteristics are highly heterogeneous to represent the effect of spatial heterogeneity on runoff process bao 1993 introduced an infiltration distribution curve fig 1 into the green ampt rainfall runoff model ga model where f m represents the infiltration capacity at a certain location a the basin area where the infiltration capacity is less than or equal to f m a the whole area of the basin pe the effective rain and r the runoff fig 2 shows an example to further illustrate the infiltration distribution curve in fig 2 a there are two different soil types with the corresponding coverage areas of 40 and 60 respectively when rainfall is homogeneous over the basin the infiltration capacity at a certain location f m will be the same for the same soil type but different for different soil types the infiltration distribution curve for this basin is shown in the right panel of fig 2 a which has a two ladder shape the value 0 4 of abscissa axis represents the percentage of a certain soil type if there are five different soil types in a basin and each soil type has the same coverage area i e 20 of the whole basin the infiltration distribution curve for this basin will be a five ladder shape as shown in fig 2 b for a basin with a large number of soil types the infiltration capacity f m changes with location and the infiltration distribution curve may be idealized by a smooth function as shown in fig 1 the infiltration distribution curve in the green ampt rainfall runoff model is formulated based on two assumptions zhao 1992 bao 1993 1 the distribution curve has a parabolic functional form 2 a a 1 1 f m f mm b where f mm is the basin maximum infiltration capacity and b 0 the exponent of the infiltration distribution curve which characterizes the heterogeneity of underlying surface when b 0 the infiltration distribution curve becomes a straight line parallel to the x axis indicating homogenous underlying surface when b 0 the curve becomes a parabolic shape and larger b indicating more heterogeneous underlying surface b is a parameter of the ga model valued by model calibration the basin mean infiltration capacity is 3 f t f mm 1 b 2 the shape of the infiltration distribution curve as in eq 2 holds for all times the basin mean infiltration capacity f t follows the green ampt equation as in eq 1 the runoff according to the green ampt model is computed as follows 1 calculate the basin mean infiltration capacity f t using eq 1 2 calculate the basin maximum infiltration capacity f mm using eq 3 3 calculate the basin runoff r from eq 2 4 r 0 pe a a d f m p e f mm pe f t p e f mm where pe is the effective rain the infiltration i at this time step is written as 5 i p e r and the cumulative infiltration at time τ 6 f t τ i t 1 i t 2 i t τ 4 repeat steps 1 to 3 for calculating r at the next time step the above infiltration distribution curve is empirical there are some problems with the two assumptions of the empirical curve 1 the distribution of infiltration capacity for a basin may not be a parabolic curve which satisfies eq 2 2 as time and rainfall induced soil moisture change the shape of this curve shall change in this study we propose a physically based infiltration distribution curve see fig 3 to improve runoff simulation over semi arid regions contrary to the empirical curve with empirical parameter b the new infiltration distribution curve is calculated using rainfall and soil type data the physical basis means that the infiltration capacity at a certain location and a certain time in a basin is calculated using the rainfall and soil data once the infiltration capacity for the whole basin for a flood event is obtained a time varying infiltration distribution curve is derived and used to calculate the infiltration excess runoff r this physically based infiltration distribution curve fully reflects the heterogeneity of rainfall controlled soil wetness and underlying surface characteristics for semi arid basins which is more realistic than the traditional empirical curve according to the soil classification of the united states department of agriculture usda rawls et al 1983 provided the calculated values of four parameters of the green ampt model including total porosity effective porosity wetting front capillary pressure head and saturated hydraulic conductivity using these parameters we can calculate a physically based infiltration distribution curve which is more accurate than the traditional empirical curve in this study the spatial resolution of soil type data is 1 km the soil and rainfall within a grid cell is considered to be homogeneous the calculation processes are as follows 1 calculate the initial infiltration capacity f m at all locations for the entire basin using eq 1 f m here equals to f t in eq 1 k and ψ in eq 1 are provided by table 2 δ θ θ s θ i where θ s is saturated soil water content and θ i is initial soil water content θ s is provided by table 2 and θ i is calibrated using the daily model as mentioned below initial infiltration f t is assigned a very small value of 0 001 in this study the infiltration capacities of all locations are ranked from small to large to obtain an initial infiltration distribution curve fig 3 the x axis represents the percentage of the basin where infiltration capacity is less than or equal to f m 2 calculate the runoff depth for each grid cell i e r 1 r 2 r n using the rainfall data and soil infiltration capacity the runoff of grid cell k r k k 1 n is computed as 7 r k p e k f k m 0 p e k f k m p e k f k m the total runoff r fig 3 of the whole basin is calculated as 8 r k 1 n r k where n is the number of grid cells p e k the effective rain in grid cell k the infiltration of grid cell k i k k 1 n is equal to 9 i k p e k r k as a result the total infiltration i of the whole basin is summed up as 10 i k 1 n i k p e r where pe k 1 n p e k the cumulative infiltration of grid cell k at time τ f k t τ is summed up as 11 f k t τ i k t 1 i k t 2 i k t τ 3 substitute the cumulative infiltration f k t τ into eq 1 and calculate the infiltration capacity f m of all locations and infiltration distribution curve for the basin at the next time step 4 repeat steps 2 and 3 for calculating the runoff depth r and infiltration distribution curve at each time during a flood process the shape of this physically based infiltration distribution curve is related to the rainfall and soil type distribution of a basin as shown in fig 3 the curve has a ladder shape each ladder corresponds to a certain soil type and its length is proportional to the area coverage of the soil type over the basin for uniform rainfall the infiltration capacities for the same soil type are nearly identical due to the same soil properties while the infiltration capacities are quite different for different soil types thus the physically based infiltration distribution curve has a ladder shape and it is constantly changing with the change of rainfall in order to compare the difference between the physically based infiltration distribution curve and the empirical infiltration distribution curve the evapotranspiration overland flow concentration and river flow concentration calculations of the revised green ampt model and the traditional green ampt model are all the same that is to say the only difference between the two models is the infiltration distribution curve thus although the infiltration capacity and runoff generation are calculated at each grid cell the runoff concentration in the revised green ampt rainfall runoff model is still computed at each sub basin i e a semi distributed method in this model basin is delineated into several sub basins and the overland flow concentration in each sub basin is calculated using the linear reservoir method the outflow q of a sub basin at time t is computed as 12 q t q t 1 c r t 1 c u where r is the total runoff of the sub basin calculated by eq 8 c the recession constant of overland flow the range of c is 0 1 smaller c value represents faster flow concentration and in this study c is 0 1 u is the unit conversion coefficient converting mm to m3 s the river flow concentration between the outlet of sub basins and the entire basin is calculated using the muskingum routing method 3 study domain and data two semi arid basins the caoping and zichang basin in the northern china in fig 4 are selected to evaluate the performances of the revised green ampt model with the physically based infiltration distribution curve ga pic model the 90 m 90 m digital elevation model dem of the study regions fig 4 are provided by the united states geological survey usgs the geophysical characteristics and data coverage of the two test basins are given in table 1 with the soil parameters in table 2 and 1 km usda soil type distribution in fig 5 the field observations from the two basins include discharge rainfall and daily potential evaporation provided by the local hydrological bureau in this study the two basins are delineated into several sub basins the infiltration distribution curves for the sub basins are assumed to be identical in the traditional green ampt model ga model while the infiltration distribution curves for the sub basins vary with soil types in the ga pic model 4 model calibration and evaluation statistics 4 1 parameters calibration in this study some parameters of the ga pic model were determined by soil texture including saturated water content θ s wetting front capillary pressure head ψ and saturated hydraulic conductivity k while the remaining model parameters were calibrated using an automatic optimization method combined with a manual optimization method huang et al 2016 huo et al 2019 the automatic optimization method has the advantage of high computational speed and accuracy but the optimal solutions may not be unique as they are the local instead of global optimal solutions compared with the automatic optimization method the manual optimization method has the drawback of relatively high computational cost and lower accuracy combining the two methods can overcome the difficulty as it can not only improve computational efficiency but also reduce the number of parameters for automatic optimization to avoid the parameter equifinality problem beven 2006 there are seven parameters in the green ampt model classified into sensitive and insensitive type table 3 except four parameters mentioned above three other parameters are listed in table 3 including the conversion coefficient of evapotranspiration e recession constant of channel flow cs and the coefficient of the muskingum routing method x e represents the ratio of the evapotranspiration capacity for basin to the pan evaporation cs reflects the recession speed of channel flood which is determined by the geomorphic characteristics of channel the range of cs is 0 1 smaller cs value represents faster flood recession x is a parameter of muskingum routing method which reflects the flood storage of the channel the value of x is related to the ratio of characteristic river length to actual river length the classification of sensitive vs insensitive parameters follows the common standards zhao 1992 brocca et al 2008 huang et al 2016 gan et al 2019 for example the sensitivities of the evapotranspiration parameter e the runoff generation parameter b and the flow concentration parameter cs and x were analyzed by alazzy et al 2015 using the glue method beven and binley 1992 the sensitivities of the remaining parameters are determined by our previous study huo et al 2019 and others researches huang et al 2016 gan et al 2019 the sensitive parameters were calibrated using the automatic optimization method of shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 1993 sorooshian et al 1994 which is a global optimization algorithm with high stability and fast convergence desirable for dealing with high dimensional problems it is more accurate and efficient to calibrate the sensitive parameters using the sce ua algorithm meanwhile the insensitive parameters were estimated by experience and adjusted manually using manual optimization method to calibrate the insensitive parameters can reduce the number of parameters optimized by the sce ua algorithm which is conducive to avoid the parameter equifinality problem and improve accuracy of the sensitive parameters the green ampt model was calibrated separately for simulating flood events and daily runoff in order to evaluate the impact of time step on the model simulations the event model uses time step of 5 min and 10 min respectively while the daily model uses time step of one day before running the event simulations the daily model was calibrated first to provide the initial states of soil water content θ i for each flood event table 4 lists the methods of determining

2006 were selected for model calibration and 7 floods between 2006 and 2010 for model validation two time steps 5 and 10 min were used to run both ga and ga pic models to reveal the effect of time step on simulated floods the simulation statistics of the four green ampt models are shown in table 5 with the calibrated model parameters in table 6 the ga pic model simulations with 10 min time step have higher qualification rate of peak flow qrpf and coefficient of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and lower relative error of runoff depth rerd and relative error of peak flow repf than the ga model for both calibration and validation periods the qualification rate of runoff depth qrrd of the two models are the same for both calibration 100 and validation 85 7 periods while the ga pic model has a lower time error of peak flow tepf value in calibration period but a higher tepf value in validation period than the ga model in general the ga pic model has a better performance than the ga model using 10 min time step especially in validation period the rerd and repf of the ga pic model are 38 3 and 40 5 respectively lower than those of the ga model 54 0 and 64 4 respectively the ga pic model simulations with 5 min time step also has higher qrpf and lower rerd and repf than the ga model for both calibration and validation periods the two models have the same qrrd and tepf 100 and 42 respectively for the calibration period for the validation period the qrrd of the two models are the same 71 4 while the ga pic model has a higher tepf 37 9 than that of the ga model 37 1 the ga pic model has a lower nse 0 09 than that of the ga model 0 17 in calibration period but a higher nse 0 46 than that of the ga model 0 38 in validation period overall the ga pic model also has a better performance than the ga model at 5 min time step comparison of the green ampt model simulations with 5 and 10 min time step indicates that both ga and ga pic model perform better measured by rerd and repf with smaller time step i e 5 min the time resolutions of the rainfall and discharge data for the caoping basin are 5 20 min and 5 10 min respectively during flood periods the 5 and 10 min green ampt model simulations indicate that reducing the simulation time step may improve its performance using high space time resolutions rainfall data to capture its space time variability over semi arid regions fig 6 shows the box plots of rerd repf tepf and nse of the calibration and validation period the 5 min ga pic model has the lowest median maximum and minimum rerd among the four models for the calibration period the 10 min ga pic model has the lowest median repf while the 5 min ga pic model has the lowest minimum repf among all the models the 10 min ga pic model has a similar performance with the 10 min ga model in terms of tepf while the minimum tepf of the ga pic model simulations is lower than that of the ga model the 5 min ga model has the highest minimum and maximum nse for the validation simulations the 5 min ga pic model has the lowest median rerd and repf while the 10 min ga pic model has the lowest minimum rerd and repf the 10 min ga model has the best performance for tepf and the two ga pic models have better performances in terms of nse than the ga models in general the ga pic models have better performances in simulating runoff depth and flood peak flow than the ga models fig 7 shows the hydrograph comparison of the four green ampt models for the flood event 2006081214 starting at 2006 8 12 14 00 00 and ending at 2006 8 13 4 00 00 the observed flood peak flow is 116 0 m3 s and the observed runoff depth is 2 83 mm the peak flow and runoff depth simulations of the 10 min ga pic model are 95 0 m3 s and 2 85 mm with an repf value of 18 1 and an rerd value of 0 71 the simulated peak flow and runoff depth of the 5 min ga pic model are 95 1 m3 s and 3 13 mm with the repf value of 18 0 and the rerd value of 10 6 the ga models simulated peak flow and runoff depth of the 10 min model are 26 7 m3 s and 0 78 mm with the repf value of 77 0 and the rerd value of 72 4 and the corresponding values of the 5 min model are 27 8 m3 s and 0 91 mm with repf 76 0 and rerd 67 8 the ga pic models perform better than the ga models for simulating peak flow and runoff depth mainly due to the more realistic infiltration distribution curves fig 8 shows the changes of infiltration distribution curves of the two green ampt models in liujiagua sub basin for the same flood event 2006081214 fig 8 a shows the empirical infiltration curve of the 10 min ga model although the infiltration capacity f m at a certain location is changing with time the shape of the infiltration distribution curve as in eq 2 holds for all times and the curves also have the same shape in different sub basins however the physically based infiltration curve of the 10 min ga pic model fig 8 b is calculated using the soil parameters and rainfall data thus this curve is constantly changing with the change of rainfall and the curves of different sub basins have different shapes due to various soil types since this sub basin has three soil types loam a loam b and loamy sand a with different infiltration capacities the infiltration distribution curve has three ladders at the beginning of the flood event the first sub figure in fig 8 b the infiltration capacities for the three soil types decreased gradually with the continuous rainfall towards the end of the flood event the fourth sub figure in fig 8 b the infiltration capacities of loam a and loam b were close and diminishing at faster rates than that of loamy sand a thus leading to a two ladder infiltration distribution curve the maximum runoff generation of liujiagua sub basin for this flood event occurred at 2006 8 12 15 20 00 the third sub figure in fig 8 a and fig 8 b the runoff generation at this time is 2 1 mm for the ga model and 5 mm for the ga pic model which is mainly influenced by the shape of infiltration distribution curve the simulated hydrograph for the ga pic model has higher peak flow and runoff depth and is in better agreement with the observations due to the more realistic infiltration distribution curve 5 2 the zichang basin among the 17 flood events of the zichang basin under study 10 floods between 2008 and 2012 were selected for model calibration and 7 floods between 2012 and 2014 for model validation two time steps 5 and 10 min were used to run both ga and ga pic models to reveal the effect of time step on simulated floods the simulation statistics of the four green ampt models are shown in table 7 with the calibrated model parameters in table 8 all the four green ampt models have the same qrrd 100 for both calibration and validation periods the main reason is that most flood events in zichang basin have relatively small runoff depths among the whole 17 flood events there are 15 flood events with runoff depths less than 3 mm according to the definition of the qrrd when the observed runoff depth is less than 15 mm the runoff depth simulation will be qualified if the gap between the observed and simulated runoff depth is less than 3 mm thus the qrrd cannot effectively evaluate the model performances for runoff depth in zichang basin and rerd is a more suitable indicator for evaluating the runoff depth simulations the ga and ga pic model simulations with 10 min time step have the same rerd 33 0 in calibration period while the rerd of the ga pic model for validation period is 37 4 lower than the corresponding value of the ga model 45 7 the repf and qrpf of the ga pic model for the calibration period are 52 3 and 30 0 respectively better than the corresponding values of the ga model 53 1 and 20 0 respectively the ga pic model has a lower repf 54 1 than that of the ga model 58 9 in validation period while both two models have the same qrpf 14 3 the ga pic model has higher tepf than those of the ga model for both calibration and validation periods and the ga pic model has a lower nse 0 27 than that of the ga model 0 31 in calibration period but a higher nse 0 10 than the corresponding value of the ga model 0 02 in validation period overall the two models have similar performances in calibration period while the ga pic model has a better performance than the ga model in validation period for the 5 min green ampt models the rerd repf qrpf and tepf of the ga pic model are better than those of the ga model in calibration period while the nse of the ga pic model 0 32 is lower than that of the ga model 0 36 the rerd repf and qrpf of the ga pic model are better than those of the ga model in validation period while the two green ampt models have the same tepf 68 6 and nse 0 07 in general the ga pic model has a better performance than the ga model at 5 min time step comparison of the green ampt model simulations with 5 and 10 min time step indicates that the two ga models have similar performances while the 5 min ga pic model have worse performances in rerd repf and tepf than the 10 min ga pic model reducing the simulation time step do not help improve the model performances in zichang basin mainly due to the inaccurate rainfall observations the time resolutions of the observed rainfall and discharge data for the zichang basin are 1 2 h and 5 15 min respectively and the flood processes from rise to end of retreating mostly occur within 1 2 h fig 9 shows the hydrograph comparison of the four green ampt models for the flood event 2010090212 tables 9 and 10 show the partial observed rainfall and discharge for the same flood the time resolution of observed rainfall is 2 h while the flood rose from starting to the peak in 24 min the rainfall during 2010 9 2 14 00 to 2010 9 2 16 00 is 30 8 mm when the rainfall data was interpolated into 10 min or 5 min it was severely averaged and the rainfall within 10 min or 5 min was very small since the green ampt model is an infiltration excess runoff model the runoff occurs only when rainfall intensity is greater than soil infiltration capacity a low rainfall intensity may not produce runoff thus all the four green ampt models have very small runoff simulations however the observed flood peak is 290 m3 s which indicates that the real rainfall intensity is high actually the rainfall during 2010 9 2 14 00 to 2010 9 2 16 00 may occurred in a few minutes and the rainfall intensity is very high but due to the low time resolution of observed rainfall there is no knowledge of the accurate time when the rainfall occurred leading to significant rainfall observation errors it indicates that when the time resolution of observed rainfall is low it cannot improve the model simulations through reducing the time step of hydrological models fig 10 shows the box plots of rerd repf tepf and nse of the calibration and validation period similar to the case of the caoping basin the ga pic models have better performance in simulating runoff depth than the ga models fig 11 shows the hydrograph comparison of the four green ampt models for the flood event 2013072501 starting at 2013 7 25 01 00 00 and ending at 2013 7 26 05 00 00 the observed flood peak flow is 41 6 m3 s and the observed runoff depth is 1 36 mm the peak flow and runoff depth simulations of the 5 min ga pic model are 30 8 m3 s and 1 16 mm with repf 26 0 and rerd 14 7 which are the best performances among the four models the simulated peak flow and runoff depth of the 5 min ga model are 22 0 m3 s and 0 78 mm with repf 47 1 and rerd 42 6 which are the worst performances among the four models the changes of infiltration distribution curves of two green ampt models in xinzhuangke sub basin for the same flood event 2013072501 are given in fig 12 with the empirical infiltration curve of the 5 min ga model in fig 12 a and the physically based infiltration curve of the 5 min ga pic model in fig 12 b the maximum runoff generation of xinzhuangke sub basin for this flood event occurred at 2013 7 25 07 35 00 the third sub figure in fig 12 a and fig 12 b the runoff generation at this time is 0 43 mm for the ga model and 0 73 mm for the ga pic model the different infiltration distribution curves of the two green ampt models lead to different runoff generations the simulated hydrograph for the ga pic model has higher peak flow and runoff depth and is in better agreement with the observations than that for the ga model similar to the case of flood event 2006081214 of the caoping basin fig 7 the four green ampt models have worse performances in the zichang basin than those in the caoping basin rerd repf and tepf values of the four models for the zichang basin are significantly higher than the corresponding values of the four models for the caoping basin one reason is that the time resolutions of the observed rainfall are different between the two basins the time step of the observed rainfall data is 5 20 min for the caoping basin while it is 1 2 h for the zichang basin when the observations are interpolated into 10 min or 5 min the interpolation error will have a great influence on the model simulations and the rainfall interpolation error for the zichang basin is much larger than that for the caoping basin another reason is the rainfall station density the area of caoping basin is 187 km2 with 13 rainfall stations and the rainfall station density is 14 4 km2 station meanwhile the area of zichang basin is 913 km2 with 8 rainfall stations and station density of 114 1 km2 station due to great heterogeneity of rainfall in semi arid areas high density of rainfall stations leads to accurate records of the rainfall distribution the simulation results of the two basins indicate that the accuracy of rainfall observation has a great influence on the flood forecast over semi arid basins high density of rainfall stations and smaller time steps lead to improved flood forecast for semi arid regions 6 conclusions we have shown that the green ampt rainfall runoff model coupled with the proposed physically based infiltration distribution curve ga pic may substantially improve flood forecast for semi arid areas specific findings of this study include 1 the ga pic model has better performances than the ga model in reducing forecast error of runoff depth and flood peak flow over semi arid areas the physically based infiltration curve of the ga pic model effectively describes the spatial and temporal variations of rainfall controlled soil wetness and underlying surface characteristics the shape of this curve is various in different sub basins and constantly changing with the change of time and soil wetness which is more realistic than the fixed empirical infiltration curve of the traditional green ampt model 2 rainfall intensity is a significant factor affecting runoff generation in semi arid areas reducing the simulation time step may improve its performance using high time resolution rainfall data if the time resolution of rainfall data is low the interpolation error will have a strong influence on the accuracy of rainfall intensity and runoff generation and reducing the simulation time step of hydrological model cannot improve flood forecast 3 accurately capturing the rainfall distribution with less rainfall stations is difficult in semi arid areas due to great heterogeneity of rainfall increasing rainfall station density is a significant and effective way for improving flood forecast over semi arid areas the physically based infiltration distribution curve has been shown to outperform the traditional empirical infiltration curve for semi arid areas however it still has some limitations 1 1 km soil type data may be insufficient for accurate calculating infiltration and runoff for small basins 2 the soil infiltration parameters we used may have biases 3 the proposed method to derive the infiltration distribution curve does not explicitly account for the impacts of water exchange between neighboring grid cells since the runoff concentration and routing in the ga pic model is still in a semi distributed fashion our method is based on an assumption that runoff yielded on each grid cell flows directly into the stream channel network in reality the runoff in particular surface runoff on an unsaturated grid cell flowing from the adjacent grid cells may infiltrate into the soil of this grid cell to alter its infiltration capacity thus the derived infiltration distribution curve without explicitly accounting for the contribution of runoff flowing from the adjacent grid cells on infiltration may overestimate the infiltration capacity and be more or less different from the actual distribution curve further studies can be carried on developing the ga pic model into a distributed model and explicitly accounting for the impacts of water exchange between neighboring grid cells the runoff calculation of the proposed ga pic model is based on the theory of infiltration excess runoff so this model can be used in arid and semi arid areas where the dominant runoff generation mechanism is infiltration excess runoff however it is not suitable for humid or semi humid areas where the dominant runoff generation mechanism is saturation excess runoff accurately capturing the spatial and temporal variations of rainfall and underlying surface characteristics has great significance for flood forecast over semi arid areas in addition although the dominant runoff generation mechanism of semi arid areas is infiltration excess runoff saturation excess runoff still exists in some cases more research is need to further improve our understanding of the runoff generation mechanism and the distribution of infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff over semi arid areas since using a physically based infiltration distribution curve may be an effective method for improving the green ampt model this study paved a way for further improvement of flood

5506,modeling rainfall runoff processes in semi arid regions remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of rainfall soil type and topography the goal of this study is to develop an improved rainfall runoff model for flood forecast for semi arid regions a physically based infiltration distribution curve is developed and added to the green ampt based rainfall runoff ga pic model validation tests for two semi arid basins suggest that the ga pic model has lower forecast errors of runoff depth and peak flow than the traditional green ampt model as the physically based infiltration distribution curve effectively captures the impacts of spatiotemporal variability of rainfall and land surface conditions on runoff generation a higher density of rainfall stations and a smaller computational time

2014 mediero and kjeldsen 2014 wang et al 2020 hydrological models perform less satisfactorily for semi arid regions castillo et al 2003 li et al 2005 rozalis et al 2010 which has received little attention until recently howard et al 2007 wheater et al 2008 chao et al 2018 chao et al 2019 according to the unesco 1979 nearly half the countries of the world face problems of aridity floods in arid and semi arid areas are infrequent but extremely damaging and the threat from floods to lives and infrastructure is increasing due to urban development wheater et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 khaing et al 2019 thus understanding and modeling hydrological processes has even greater significance over arid and semi arid regions jothityangkoon et al 2001 applied a downward approach to study the water balance variability of a large semi arid catchment in western australia and found that spatial variability of soil depths appears to be the most important control on runoff variability at all time and space scales in this catchment followed by the spatial variability of climate and vegetation cover saito et al 2006 developed a numerical model to study the coupled water and heat transport in the vadose zone of arid and semi arid regions the simulated temperatures and water contents of this model were in good agreement with field observations they concluded that soil water dynamics are strongly associated with the soil temperature regime huang et al 2016 applied seven hydrological models to three semi arid catchments in the northern china and found that the dominant runoff generation mechanism for semi arid catchments is the infiltration excess surface runoff which is a nonlinear process for semi arid catchments a suitable model needs include at least one nonlinear component such as a parabolic infiltration curve to simulate the surface runoff generation qiao et al 2018 investigated the vertical distribution of soil water content and storage at five sites on the loess plateau in china their analysis showed that the profiles of soil water content change with not only soil depth but also soil bulk density in semi arid regions for semi arid regions the dominant runoff generation mechanism is infiltration excess process due to thick soil layer and low soil water content simmers 2003 zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019b infiltration models are classified into three groups mishra and singh 1999 physically based semi empirical and empirical the physically based infiltration models include the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 and the philip infiltration model philip 1957 1969 while common semi empirical models include these models developed by horton 1938 and holtan 1961 the model developed by huggins and monke 1966 and the modified kostiakov model smith 1972 are the typical empirical models the green ampt model is widely used in modeling infiltration processes due to its low computational cost and high computational accuracy scoging 1992 castillo et al 2003 muñoz carpena et al 2018 however the limitation of the green ampt model is that it assumes isotropic soil with uniform initial water content which causes inaccuracy for infiltration excess runoff calculation over heterogeneous soil bao 1993 introduced an empirical infiltration distribution curve into the green ampt rainfall runoff model in order to deal with the heterogeneity of rainfall topography and soil type hsu and hilpert 2011 generalized the green ampt model by introducing the concept of dynamic capillary pressure in terms of flow velocity stewart 2018 proposed a dynamic multi domain green ampt infiltration model by parameterizing the effect of soil shrinkage and swelling on the pore size distribution and saturated hydraulic conductivity compared with the classic green ampt model the multi domain model improves infiltration runoff partitioning at multiple scales gowdish and muñoz carpena 2018 developed a three dimensional green ampt model 3dmgar to simulate the three dimensional distribution of soil water of point source events previous studies using the green ampt model usually focused on infiltration and soil water distribution instead of runoff generation and flood forecast the objective of this study is to develop an improved green ampt rainfall runoff model with a physically based infiltration distribution curve ga pic model characterizing the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall controlled soil wetness and landscape to improve flood forecast for semi arid regions 2 rainfall runoff model 2 1 green ampt rainfall runoff model the green ampt rainfall runoff model is an infiltration excess runoff model based on the green ampt infiltration equation green and ampt 1911 the basic assumptions are that the soil profile and initial soil water content are homogeneous and that infiltration produces a sharp wetting front separating the soil layer into wetting and drying zone wetting zone soil is saturated while drying zone soil maintains its initial soil water content the green ampt infiltration equation is written as 1 f t k 1 ψ δ θ f t where f t is infiltration capacity mm h 1 f t the cumulative infiltration mm k the saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 ψ the wetting front capillary pressure head mm δ θ the change of soil water content across the wetting front and t the time h in the green ampt rainfall runoff model runoff is calculated as rainfall intensity minus infiltration capacity given in eq 1 when rainfall intensity is less than infiltration capacity all the rainwater infiltrates into soil without generating runoff the infiltrated rainwater replenishes the cumulative infiltration f t followed by the change of infiltration capacity f t which will influence runoff generation at the next time step evapotranspiration is calculated using a three layer soil water model zhao 1992 since this model is widely used in hydrological models and has been proved to be accurate in estimating evapotranspiration zhang and chiew 2009 yao et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 overland flow concentration is calculated using the linear reservoir method the surface runoff is considered to flow into a virtual reservoir in which outflow has a linear relationship with storage a detailed description of the linear reservoir method can be found in nash 1960 and zhao 1992 river flow concentration of the green ampt rainfall runoff model is calculated using the muskingum routing method mccarthy 1938 2 2 green ampt infiltration distribution curve in semi arid areas rainfall and underlying surface characteristics are highly heterogeneous to represent the effect of spatial heterogeneity on runoff process bao 1993 introduced an infiltration distribution curve fig 1 into the green ampt rainfall runoff model ga model where f m represents the infiltration capacity at a certain location a the basin area where the infiltration capacity is less than or equal to f m a the whole area of the basin pe the effective rain and r the runoff fig 2 shows an example to further illustrate the infiltration distribution curve in fig 2 a there are two different soil types with the corresponding coverage areas of 40 and 60 respectively when rainfall is homogeneous over the basin the infiltration capacity at a certain location f m will be the same for the same soil type but different for different soil types the infiltration distribution curve for this basin is shown in the right panel of fig 2 a which has a two ladder shape the value 0 4 of abscissa axis represents the percentage of a certain soil type if there are five different soil types in a basin and each soil type has the same coverage area i e 20 of the whole basin the infiltration distribution curve for this basin will be a five ladder shape as shown in fig 2 b for a basin with a large number of soil types the infiltration capacity f m changes with location and the infiltration distribution curve may be idealized by a smooth function as shown in fig 1 the infiltration distribution curve in the green ampt rainfall runoff model is formulated based on two assumptions zhao 1992 bao 1993 1 the distribution curve has a parabolic functional form 2 a a 1 1 f m f mm b where f mm is the basin maximum infiltration capacity and b 0 the exponent of the infiltration distribution curve which characterizes the heterogeneity of underlying surface when b 0 the infiltration distribution curve becomes a straight line parallel to the x axis indicating homogenous underlying surface when b 0 the curve becomes a parabolic shape and larger b indicating more heterogeneous underlying surface b is a parameter of the ga model valued by model calibration the basin mean infiltration capacity is 3 f t f mm 1 b 2 the shape of the infiltration distribution curve as in eq 2 holds for all times the basin mean infiltration capacity f t follows the green ampt equation as in eq 1 the runoff according to the green ampt model is computed as follows 1 calculate the basin mean infiltration capacity f t using eq 1 2 calculate the basin maximum infiltration capacity f mm using eq 3 3 calculate the basin runoff r from eq 2 4 r 0 pe a a d f m p e f mm pe f t p e f mm where pe is the effective rain the infiltration i at this time step is written as 5 i p e r and the cumulative infiltration at time τ 6 f t τ i t 1 i t 2 i t τ 4 repeat steps 1 to 3 for calculating r at the next time step the above infiltration distribution curve is empirical there are some problems with the two assumptions of the empirical curve 1 the distribution of infiltration capacity for a basin may not be a parabolic curve which satisfies eq 2 2 as time and rainfall induced soil moisture change the shape of this curve shall change in this study we propose a physically based infiltration distribution curve see fig 3 to improve runoff simulation over semi arid regions contrary to the empirical curve with empirical parameter b the new infiltration distribution curve is calculated using rainfall and soil type data the physical basis means that the infiltration capacity at a certain location and a certain time in a basin is calculated using the rainfall and soil data once the infiltration capacity for the whole basin for a flood event is obtained a time varying infiltration distribution curve is derived and used to calculate the infiltration excess runoff r this physically based infiltration distribution curve fully reflects the heterogeneity of rainfall controlled soil wetness and underlying surface characteristics for semi arid basins which is more realistic than the traditional empirical curve according to the soil classification of the united states department of agriculture usda rawls et al 1983 provided the calculated values of four parameters of the green ampt model including total porosity effective porosity wetting front capillary pressure head and saturated hydraulic conductivity using these parameters we can calculate a physically based infiltration distribution curve which is more accurate than the traditional empirical curve in this study the spatial resolution of soil type data is 1 km the soil and rainfall within a grid cell is considered to be homogeneous the calculation processes are as follows 1 calculate the initial infiltration capacity f m at all locations for the entire basin using eq 1 f m here equals to f t in eq 1 k and ψ in eq 1 are provided by table 2 δ θ θ s θ i where θ s is saturated soil water content and θ i is initial soil water content θ s is provided by table 2 and θ i is calibrated using the daily model as mentioned below initial infiltration f t is assigned a very small value of 0 001 in this study the infiltration capacities of all locations are ranked from small to large to obtain an initial infiltration distribution curve fig 3 the x axis represents the percentage of the basin where infiltration capacity is less than or equal to f m 2 calculate the runoff depth for each grid cell i e r 1 r 2 r n using the rainfall data and soil infiltration capacity the runoff of grid cell k r k k 1 n is computed as 7 r k p e k f k m 0 p e k f k m p e k f k m the total runoff r fig 3 of the whole basin is calculated as 8 r k 1 n r k where n is the number of grid cells p e k the effective rain in grid cell k the infiltration of grid cell k i k k 1 n is equal to 9 i k p e k r k as a result the total infiltration i of the whole basin is summed up as 10 i k 1 n i k p e r where pe k 1 n p e k the cumulative infiltration of grid cell k at time τ f k t τ is summed up as 11 f k t τ i k t 1 i k t 2 i k t τ 3 substitute the cumulative infiltration f k t τ into eq 1 and calculate the infiltration capacity f m of all locations and infiltration distribution curve for the basin at the next time step 4 repeat steps 2 and 3 for calculating the runoff depth r and infiltration distribution curve at each time during a flood process the shape of this physically based infiltration distribution curve is related to the rainfall and soil type distribution of a basin as shown in fig 3 the curve has a ladder shape each ladder corresponds to a certain soil type and its length is proportional to the area coverage of the soil type over the basin for uniform rainfall the infiltration capacities for the same soil type are nearly identical due to the same soil properties while the infiltration capacities are quite different for different soil types thus the physically based infiltration distribution curve has a ladder shape and it is constantly changing with the change of rainfall in order to compare the difference between the physically based infiltration distribution curve and the empirical infiltration distribution curve the evapotranspiration overland flow concentration and river flow concentration calculations of the revised green ampt model and the traditional green ampt model are all the same that is to say the only difference between the two models is the infiltration distribution curve thus although the infiltration capacity and runoff generation are calculated at each grid cell the runoff concentration in the revised green ampt rainfall runoff model is still computed at each sub basin i e a semi distributed method in this model basin is delineated into several sub basins and the overland flow concentration in each sub basin is calculated using the linear reservoir method the outflow q of a sub basin at time t is computed as 12 q t q t 1 c r t 1 c u where r is the total runoff of the sub basin calculated by eq 8 c the recession constant of overland flow the range of c is 0 1 smaller c value represents faster flow concentration and in this study c is 0 1 u is the unit conversion coefficient converting mm to m3 s the river flow concentration between the outlet of sub basins and the entire basin is calculated using the muskingum routing method 3 study domain and data two semi arid basins the caoping and zichang basin in the northern china in fig 4 are selected to evaluate the performances of the revised green ampt model with the physically based infiltration distribution curve ga pic model the 90 m 90 m digital elevation model dem of the study regions fig 4 are provided by the united states geological survey usgs the geophysical characteristics and data coverage of the two test basins are given in table 1 with the soil parameters in table 2 and 1 km usda soil type distribution in fig 5 the field observations from the two basins include discharge rainfall and daily potential evaporation provided by the local hydrological bureau in this study the two basins are delineated into several sub basins the infiltration distribution curves for the sub basins are assumed to be identical in the traditional green ampt model ga model while the infiltration distribution curves for the sub basins vary with soil types in the ga pic model 4 model calibration and evaluation statistics 4 1 parameters calibration in this study some parameters of the ga pic model were determined by soil texture including saturated water content θ s wetting front capillary pressure head ψ and saturated hydraulic conductivity k while the remaining model parameters were calibrated using an automatic optimization method combined with a manual optimization method huang et al 2016 huo et al 2019 the automatic optimization method has the advantage of high computational speed and accuracy but the optimal solutions may not be unique as they are the local instead of global optimal solutions compared with the automatic optimization method the manual optimization method has the drawback of relatively high computational cost and lower accuracy combining the two methods can overcome the difficulty as it can not only improve computational efficiency but also reduce the number of parameters for automatic optimization to avoid the parameter equifinality problem beven 2006 there are seven parameters in the green ampt model classified into sensitive and insensitive type table 3 except four parameters mentioned above three other parameters are listed in table 3 including the conversion coefficient of evapotranspiration e recession constant of channel flow cs and the coefficient of the muskingum routing method x e represents the ratio of the evapotranspiration capacity for basin to the pan evaporation cs reflects the recession speed of channel flood which is determined by the geomorphic characteristics of channel the range of cs is 0 1 smaller cs value represents faster flood recession x is a parameter of muskingum routing method which reflects the flood storage of the channel the value of x is related to the ratio of characteristic river length to actual river length the classification of sensitive vs insensitive parameters follows the common standards zhao 1992 brocca et al 2008 huang et al 2016 gan et al 2019 for example the sensitivities of the evapotranspiration parameter e the runoff generation parameter b and the flow concentration parameter cs and x were analyzed by alazzy et al 2015 using the glue method beven and binley 1992 the sensitivities of the remaining parameters are determined by our previous study huo et al 2019 and others researches huang et al 2016 gan et al 2019 the sensitive parameters were calibrated using the automatic optimization method of shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 1993 sorooshian et al 1994 which is a global optimization algorithm with high stability and fast convergence desirable for dealing with high dimensional problems it is more accurate and efficient to calibrate the sensitive parameters using the sce ua algorithm meanwhile the insensitive parameters were estimated by experience and adjusted manually using manual optimization method to calibrate the insensitive parameters can reduce the number of parameters optimized by the sce ua algorithm which is conducive to avoid the parameter equifinality problem and improve accuracy of the sensitive parameters the green ampt model was calibrated separately for simulating flood events and daily runoff in order to evaluate the impact of time step on the model simulations the event model uses time step of 5 min and 10 min respectively while the daily model uses time step of one day before running the event simulations the daily model was calibrated first to provide the initial states of soil water content θ i for each flood event table 4 lists the methods of determining parameters for the green ampt model for simulating flood event and daily runoff 4 2 evaluation statistics three metrics were selected as objective functions for the implementation of the sce ua

2006 were selected for model calibration and 7 floods between 2006 and 2010 for model validation two time steps 5 and 10 min were used to run both ga and ga pic models to reveal the effect of time step on simulated floods the simulation statistics of the four green ampt models are shown in table 5 with the calibrated model parameters in table 6 the ga pic model simulations with 10 min time step have higher qualification rate of peak flow qrpf and coefficient of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and lower relative error of runoff depth rerd and relative error of peak flow repf than the ga model for both calibration and validation periods the qualification rate of runoff depth qrrd of the two models are the same for both calibration 100 and validation 85 7 periods while the ga pic model has a lower time error of peak flow tepf value in calibration period but a higher tepf value in validation period than the ga model in general the ga pic model has a better performance than the ga model using 10 min time step especially in validation period the rerd and repf of the ga pic model are 38 3 and 40 5 respectively lower than those of the ga model 54 0 and 64 4 respectively the ga pic model simulations with 5 min time step also has higher qrpf and lower rerd and repf than the ga model for both calibration and validation periods the two models have the same qrrd and tepf 100 and 42 respectively for the calibration period for the validation period the qrrd of the two models are the same 71 4 while the ga pic model has a higher tepf 37 9 than that of the ga model 37 1 the ga pic model has a lower nse 0 09 than that of the ga model 0 17 in calibration period but a higher nse 0 46 than that of the ga model 0 38 in validation period overall the ga pic model also has a better performance than the ga model at 5 min time step comparison of the green ampt model simulations with 5 and 10 min time step indicates that both ga and ga pic model perform better measured by rerd and repf with smaller time step i e 5 min the time resolutions of the rainfall and discharge data for the caoping basin are 5 20 min and 5 10 min respectively during flood periods the 5 and 10 min green ampt model simulations indicate that reducing the simulation time step may improve its performance using high space time resolutions rainfall data to capture its space time variability over semi arid regions fig 6 shows the box plots of rerd repf tepf and nse of the calibration and validation period the 5 min ga pic model has the lowest median maximum and minimum rerd among the four models for the calibration period the 10 min ga pic model has the lowest median repf while the 5 min ga pic model has the lowest minimum repf among all the models the 10 min ga pic model has a similar performance with the 10 min ga model in terms of tepf while the minimum tepf of the ga pic model simulations is lower than that of the ga model the 5 min ga model has the highest minimum and maximum nse for the validation simulations the 5 min ga pic model has the lowest median rerd and repf while the 10 min ga pic model has the lowest minimum rerd and repf the 10 min ga model has the best performance for tepf and the two ga pic models have better performances in terms of nse than the ga models in general the ga pic models have better performances in simulating runoff depth and flood peak flow than the ga models fig 7 shows the hydrograph comparison of the four green ampt models for the flood event 2006081214 starting at 2006 8 12 14 00 00 and ending at 2006 8 13 4 00 00 the observed flood peak flow is 116 0 m3 s and the observed runoff depth is 2 83 mm the peak flow and runoff depth simulations of the 10 min ga pic model are 95 0 m3 s and 2 85 mm with an repf value of 18 1 and an rerd value of 0 71 the simulated peak flow and runoff depth of the 5 min ga pic model are 95 1 m3 s and 3 13 mm with the repf value of 18 0 and the rerd value of 10 6 the ga models simulated peak flow and runoff depth of the 10 min model are 26 7 m3 s and 0 78 mm with the repf value of 77 0 and the rerd value of 72 4 and the corresponding values of the 5 min model are 27 8 m3 s and 0 91 mm with repf 76 0 and rerd 67 8 the ga pic models perform better than the ga models for simulating peak flow and runoff depth mainly due to the more realistic infiltration distribution curves fig 8 shows the changes of infiltration distribution curves of the two green ampt models in liujiagua sub basin for the same flood event 2006081214 fig 8 a shows the empirical infiltration curve of the 10 min ga model although the infiltration capacity f m at a certain location is changing with time the shape of the infiltration distribution curve as in eq 2 holds for all times and the curves also have the same shape in different sub basins however the physically based infiltration curve of the 10 min ga pic model fig 8 b is calculated using the soil parameters and rainfall data thus this curve is constantly changing with the change of rainfall and the curves of different sub basins have different shapes due to various soil types since this sub basin has three soil types loam a loam b and loamy sand a with different infiltration capacities the infiltration distribution curve has three ladders at the beginning of the flood event the first sub figure in fig 8 b the infiltration capacities for the three soil types decreased gradually with the continuous rainfall towards the end of the flood event the fourth sub figure in fig 8 b the infiltration capacities of loam a and loam b were close and diminishing at faster rates than that of loamy sand a thus leading to a two ladder infiltration distribution curve the maximum runoff generation of liujiagua sub basin for this flood event occurred at 2006 8 12 15 20 00 the third sub figure in fig 8 a and fig 8 b the runoff generation at this time is 2 1 mm for the ga model and 5 mm for the ga pic model which is mainly influenced by the shape of infiltration distribution curve the simulated hydrograph for the ga pic model has higher peak flow and runoff depth and is in better agreement with the observations due to the more realistic infiltration distribution curve 5 2 the zichang basin among the 17 flood events of the zichang basin under study 10 floods between 2008 and 2012 were selected for model calibration and 7 floods between 2012 and 2014 for model validation two time steps 5 and 10 min were used to run both ga and ga pic models to reveal the effect of time step on simulated floods the simulation statistics of the four green ampt models are shown in table 7 with the calibrated model parameters in table 8 all the four green ampt models have the same qrrd 100 for both calibration and validation periods the main reason is that most flood events in zichang basin have relatively small runoff depths among the whole 17 flood events there are 15 flood events with runoff depths less than 3 mm according to the definition of the qrrd when the observed runoff depth is less than 15 mm the runoff depth simulation will be qualified if the gap between the observed and simulated runoff depth is less than 3 mm thus the qrrd cannot effectively evaluate the model performances for runoff depth in zichang basin and rerd is a more suitable indicator for evaluating the runoff depth simulations the ga and ga pic model simulations with 10 min time step have the same rerd 33 0 in calibration period while the rerd of the ga pic model for validation period is 37 4 lower than the corresponding value of the ga model 45 7 the repf and qrpf of the ga pic model for the calibration period are 52 3 and 30 0 respectively better than the corresponding values of the ga model 53 1 and 20 0 respectively the ga pic model has a lower repf 54 1 than that of the ga model 58 9 in validation period while both two models have the same qrpf 14 3 the ga pic model has higher tepf than those of the ga model for both calibration and validation periods and the ga pic model has a lower nse 0 27 than that of the ga model 0 31 in calibration period but a higher nse 0 10 than the corresponding value of the ga model 0 02 in validation period overall the two models have similar performances in calibration period while the ga pic model has a better performance than the ga model in validation period for the 5 min green ampt models the rerd repf qrpf and tepf of the ga pic model are better than those of the ga model in calibration period while the nse of the ga pic model 0 32 is lower than that of the ga model 0 36 the rerd repf and qrpf of the ga pic model are better than those of the ga model in validation period while the two green ampt models have the same tepf 68 6 and nse 0 07 in general the ga pic model has a better performance than the ga model at 5 min time step comparison of the green ampt model simulations with 5 and 10 min time step indicates that the two ga models have similar performances while the 5 min ga pic model have worse performances in rerd repf and tepf than the 10 min ga pic model reducing the simulation time step do not help improve the model performances in zichang basin mainly due to the inaccurate rainfall observations the time resolutions of the observed rainfall and discharge data for the zichang basin are 1 2 h and 5 15 min respectively and the flood processes from rise to end of retreating mostly occur within 1 2 h fig 9 shows the hydrograph comparison of the four green ampt models for the flood event 2010090212 tables 9 and 10 show the partial observed rainfall and discharge for the same flood the time resolution of observed rainfall is 2 h while the flood rose from starting to the peak in 24 min the rainfall during 2010 9 2 14 00 to 2010 9 2 16 00 is 30 8 mm when the rainfall data was interpolated into 10 min or 5 min it was severely averaged and the rainfall within 10 min or 5 min was very small since the green ampt model is an infiltration excess runoff model the runoff occurs only when rainfall intensity is greater than soil infiltration capacity a low rainfall intensity may not produce runoff thus all the four green ampt models have very small runoff simulations however the observed flood peak is 290 m3 s which indicates that the real rainfall intensity is high actually the rainfall during 2010 9 2 14 00 to 2010 9 2 16 00 may occurred in a few minutes and the rainfall intensity is very high but due to the low time resolution of observed rainfall there is no knowledge of the accurate time when the rainfall occurred leading to significant rainfall observation errors it indicates that when the time resolution of observed rainfall is low it cannot improve the model simulations through reducing the time step of hydrological models fig 10 shows the box plots of rerd repf tepf and nse of the calibration and validation period similar to the case of the caoping basin the ga pic models have better performance in simulating runoff depth than the ga models fig 11 shows the hydrograph comparison of the four green ampt models for the flood event 2013072501 starting at 2013 7 25 01 00 00 and ending at 2013 7 26 05 00 00 the observed flood peak flow is 41 6 m3 s and the observed runoff depth is 1 36 mm the peak flow and runoff depth simulations of the 5 min ga pic model are 30 8 m3 s and 1 16 mm with repf 26 0 and rerd 14 7 which are the best performances among the four models the simulated peak flow and runoff depth of the 5 min ga model are 22 0 m3 s and 0 78 mm with repf 47 1 and rerd 42 6 which are the worst performances among the four models the changes of infiltration distribution curves of two green ampt models in xinzhuangke sub basin for the same flood event 2013072501 are given in fig 12 with the empirical infiltration curve of the 5 min ga model in fig 12 a and the physically based infiltration curve of the 5 min ga pic model in fig 12 b the maximum runoff generation of xinzhuangke sub basin for this flood event occurred at 2013 7 25 07 35 00 the third sub figure in fig 12 a and fig 12 b the runoff generation at this time is 0 43 mm for the ga model and 0 73 mm for the ga pic model the different infiltration distribution curves of the two green ampt models lead to different runoff generations the simulated hydrograph for the ga pic model has higher peak flow and runoff depth and is in better agreement with the observations than that for the ga model similar to the case of flood event 2006081214 of the caoping basin fig 7 the four green ampt models have worse performances in the zichang basin than those in the caoping basin rerd repf and tepf values of the four models for the zichang basin are significantly higher than the corresponding values of the four models for the caoping basin one reason is that the time resolutions of the observed rainfall are different between the two basins the time step of the observed rainfall data is 5 20 min for the caoping basin while it is 1 2 h for the zichang basin when the observations are interpolated into 10 min or 5 min the interpolation error will have a great influence on the model simulations and the rainfall interpolation error for the zichang basin is much larger than that for the caoping basin another reason is the rainfall station density the area of caoping basin is 187 km2 with 13 rainfall stations and the rainfall station density is 14 4 km2 station meanwhile the area of zichang basin is 913 km2 with 8 rainfall stations and station density of 114 1 km2 station due to great heterogeneity of rainfall in semi arid areas high density of rainfall stations leads to accurate records of the rainfall distribution the simulation results of the two basins indicate that the accuracy of rainfall observation has a great influence on the flood forecast over semi arid basins high density of rainfall stations and smaller time steps lead to improved flood forecast for semi arid regions 6 conclusions we have shown that the green ampt rainfall runoff model coupled with the proposed physically based infiltration distribution curve ga pic may substantially improve flood forecast for semi arid areas specific findings of this study include 1 the ga pic model has better performances than the ga model in reducing forecast error of runoff depth and flood peak flow over semi arid areas the physically based infiltration curve of the ga pic model effectively describes the spatial and temporal variations of rainfall controlled soil wetness and underlying surface characteristics the shape of this curve is various in different sub basins and constantly changing with the change of time and soil wetness which is more realistic than the fixed empirical infiltration curve of the traditional green ampt model 2 rainfall intensity is a significant factor affecting runoff generation in semi arid areas reducing the simulation time step may improve its performance using high time resolution rainfall data if the time resolution of rainfall data is low the interpolation error will have a strong influence on the accuracy of rainfall intensity and runoff generation and reducing the simulation time step of hydrological model cannot improve flood forecast 3 accurately capturing the rainfall distribution with less rainfall stations is difficult in semi arid areas due to great heterogeneity of rainfall increasing rainfall station density is a significant and effective way for improving flood forecast over semi arid areas the physically based infiltration distribution curve has been shown to outperform the traditional empirical infiltration curve for semi arid areas however it still has some limitations 1 1 km soil type data may be insufficient for accurate calculating infiltration and runoff for small basins 2 the soil infiltration parameters we used may have biases 3 the proposed method to derive the infiltration distribution curve does not explicitly account for the impacts of water exchange between neighboring grid cells since the runoff concentration and routing in the ga pic model is still in a semi distributed fashion our method is based on an assumption that runoff yielded on each grid cell flows directly into the stream channel network in reality the runoff in particular surface runoff on an unsaturated grid cell flowing from the adjacent grid cells may infiltrate into the soil of this grid cell to alter its infiltration capacity thus the derived infiltration distribution curve without explicitly accounting for the contribution of runoff flowing from the adjacent grid cells on infiltration may overestimate the infiltration capacity and be more or less different from the actual distribution curve further studies can be carried on developing the ga pic model into a distributed model and explicitly accounting for the impacts of water exchange between neighboring grid cells the runoff calculation of the proposed ga pic model is based on the theory of infiltration excess runoff so this model can be used in arid and semi arid areas where the dominant runoff generation mechanism is infiltration excess runoff however it is not suitable for humid or semi humid areas where the dominant runoff generation mechanism is saturation excess runoff accurately capturing the spatial and temporal variations of rainfall and underlying surface characteristics has great significance for flood forecast over semi arid areas in addition although the dominant runoff generation mechanism of semi arid areas is infiltration excess runoff saturation excess runoff still exists in some cases more research is need to further improve our understanding of the runoff generation mechanism and the distribution of infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff over semi arid areas since using a physically based infiltration distribution curve may be an effective method for improving the green ampt model this study paved a way for further improvement of flood

5507,reservoirs have been continuously built in the poyang lake basin plb for the local economy with pending removal and reconstruction of aging reservoirs and planning of new reservoirs in this area it is advisable to evaluate the likely impact of the existing and alternative reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime for more effective water resources planning and management in this study reservoirs of multiple sizes in the plb were integrated into a coupled land surface hydrologic model clhms fully coupled with a reservoir scheme the extended model was then validated and applied to investigate the impact of existing reservoirs seven hypothetical scenarios were additionally set up by removing all the reservoirs replacing smaller reservoirs with few larger ones replacing larger reservoirs with many smaller ones moving all reservoirs downstream or upstream increasing or decreasing the mean inflow of reservoirs respectively in all eight simulations were conducted and analyzed using the indictors of hydrologic alterations iha for the period of 1981 1999 results indicate that the existing reservoirs in the plb are able to effectively displace the excessive streamflow in the wet season to the dry season and mitigate the hydrological extremes by increasing the mean inflow of reservoirs the effectiveness of reservoirs in downstream flow regulation can be further enhanced similarly replacing many small reservoirs with a few large ones with a same total capacity can lead to more resiliency against the downstream flow variability and extremes only if the total mean inflow of the new large reservoirs is not considerably lower than that of the small ones relocating reservoirs to a different place with similar mean inflow however has a relatively minor and probably case dependent impact on the hydrologic regime on the other hand the ecological analysis on the iha parameters indicates that the layout preferable for the effective flow regulation may not necessarily be ecologically preferable in general this study comprehensively evaluates the hydrological impact of reservoir network layouts and can provide implications for stakeholders to reach a trade off between reservoir capacity distribution locations and mean inflow not only in the plb but also in different regions worldwide keywords distributed hydrologic model reservoir network layout capacity distribution location mean inflow 1 introduction reservoirs have been continuously built worldwide to cope with the spatiotemporal variability of water resources for the benefit of human society kummu et al 2006 deng et al 2014 this is particularly the case for the catchment of china s largest freshwater lake poyang lake basin plb it is documented that in the plb there are three reservoirs with a capacity larger than 109 m3 hereinafter large reservoirs 22 reservoirs with a capacity between 108 m3 and 109 m3 hereinafter medium reservoirs and approximately 215 reservoirs with a capacity between 107 m3 and 108 m3 hereinafter small reservoirs they together have a combined capacity of 3 1010 m3 accounting for approximately 20 of the total water resources in the plb the operation of such a complex reservoir network can induce a considerable hydrologic alteration in the plb which has yet to be understood lv et al 2016 in general the reservoir induced hydrologic alteration can be quantified by using two approaches the first one is here referred to as the observation based approach which has been intensively used in multiple recent studies for different target basins räsänen et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 li et al 2017 räsänen et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 its concept is to compare the observed streamflow in the pre impact and post impact period due to reservoir operation räsänen et al 2012 or to compare the observed streamflow with the reconstructed natural streamflow both in the post impact period lu et al 2018 the applicability of this approach is generally limited to regions where the flow regime is dominated by a few reservoirs with well documented inauguration dates or sparsely populated areas where the impact of other human activities such as river abstraction groundwater pumping and irrigation are relatively insignificant and can be considered constant over time however neither of the above described conditions holds true for a large scale densely populated and highly regulated basin deitch et al 2013 which is the particular case for the plb more importantly the observation based approach can neither be applied to partition the combined impact of reservoirs into for example the individual impact of small reservoirs among all reservoirs nor be used for what if studies in which hypothetical reservoir scenarios can be established for research and engineering purposes sene 2015 to overcome these difficulties the so called model based approach i e modelling of reservoirs in hydrological models can serve as a suitable alternative for hydrological impact studies on large scale basins güntner et al 2004 hanasaki et al 2006 wisser et al 2010 pokhrel et al 2012 lauri et al 2012 voisin et al 2013 wada et al 2016 giuliani et al 2016 solander et al 2016 ehsani et al 2017 wang et al 2017 yassin et al 2019 shin et al 2019 for example a fully coupled reservoir module in a coupled land surface hydrologic model was developed and applied to the plb in our recent research where the high density reservoir network consisting of large medium and small reservoirs in the plb has been included for hydrological simulations in the past and future dong et al 2019a b as an improvement to conventional offline models lv et al 2016 the newly extended model also accounts for the feedbacks between reservoirs and multiple hydrologic processes for more closed description of the regional terrestrial water cycle dong et al 2019b by setting up hypothetical scenarios for simulation modelling tools of this kind can further provide us with practical instructions in water resources planning and management from hydrological ecological and multiple other perspectives for example they can be applied to determine the capacity distribution of the reservoir network at the planning stage i e whether to build a single large reservoir or many small reservoirs while ziv et al 2012 reported that construction of a large group of small reservoirs on the tributaries would be less beneficial economic and eco friendly than several large reservoirs on the mainstream naiman and dudgeon 2011 and scudder 2012 noted otherwise more recently ehsani et al 2016 reported a single large reservoir would alter the flow regime more significantly than many small ones however they drew conclusions without further separating the impact of reservoir capacity distribution from that of the reservoir mean inflow because the large reservoir receives considerably more inflow than many small ones combined in their study modelling tools with hypothetical scenarios can also be applied to for example assessing multiple potential reservoir building sites in a recent case study liu et al 2019 noted that the benefit of flood control at the basin outlet would be increased by relocating a same reservoir in the upper mainstream of the yalong river to the lower mainstream however again they drew their conclusions without further partitioning the impact of reservoir locations and inflow because moving downstream a reservoir along the mainstream of the river means both the reservoir gets closer to the basin outlet and the reservoir receives higher mean inflow in general despite the above mentioned studies the individual impact of the reservoir capacity distribution locations and mean inflow on the hydrologic regime remains unclear the above described issue leads to one of the key questions in the water resources planning and management with a specified total capacity which reservoir network layout can most desirably regulate the hydrologic regime this question is particularly relevant for the plb since many of the existing reservoirs are classified as hazardous or non functional with pending removal and reconstruction yet new reservoirs are continuously under planning as an attempt to shed light on the proposed question this paper aims to evaluate the impact of the existing and alternative reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime in the poyang lake basin china as indicated in the flowchart fig 1 this is achieved first by integrating the reservoirs of multiple sizes in the plb into a physically based land surface hydrologic model system clhms through a reservoir scheme and generalized conceptual operation rules the extended model with the reservoir scheme disabled and enabled was respectively validated and applied to investigate the impact of existing reservoirs as compared to the no reservoir condition six hypothetical scenarios were additionally simulated with the reservoir enabled model by replacing smaller reservoirs with larger ones replacing larger reservoirs with smaller ones moving all reservoirs downstream and upstream increasing and decreasing the mean inflow of reservoirs respectively then the reservoir induced variations in the streamflow under these scenarios are evaluated and compared using the indicators of hydrologic alterations iha to our knowledge this study is one of the first efforts to comprehensively evaluate the impact of multiple reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime and our framework and findings are expected to provide instructions for water resources planning and management on a regional scale not only in the plb but also in other basins worldwide 2 data and methods the poyang lake basin plb is located in the southeast china and is connected to the yangtze river to the north with a total area of approximately 162 000 km2 wei et al 2015 2016 there are five major rivers draining into the poyang lake namely the xiu river gan river fu river xin river and rao river which divide the plb into five sub basins fig 2 the plb receives mean annual precipitation of around 1600 mm and 70 occurs between march and july and 30 between august and february which partitions the year into wet and dry seasons 2 1 reservoir data the information on three large reservoirs 22 medium reservoirs and 215 small reservoirs in the basin such as capacity location mean inflow and critical water storages are well documented by the local authorities and were collected in this study the daily inflow outflow and water storage data were also collected for a large reservoir the hongmen reservoir capacity 1 2 109 m3 and a medium reservoir the tuanjie reservoir capacity 1 5 108 m3 on the other hand these operation data are not available for the rest of the reservoirs smaller reservoirs with a capacity less than 107 m3 are not included in this study which account for less than 20 of the total capacity of all reservoirs in the plb the locations of the three large reservoirs 22 medium reservoirs and 215 small reservoirs are depicted in fig 2b the storage area correlation is required to estimate the seepage surface evaporation and precipitation of reservoirs given that the geometric information on each reservoir is often not available especially at regional scales a commonly used empirical correlation i e the inverted triangle storage area correlation was employed in this study liebe et al 2005 van beek et al 2011 shin et al 2019 this correlation has been well established using the remote sensing images and digital elevation data of the plb in our previous research see dong et al 2019a for more details 2 2 coupled land surface hydrologic model system clhms the clhms was developed as a fully coupled system of the land surface model lsx and the spatially distributed hydrologic model hms hydrological model system yu et al 1999 yu et al 2006 the land surface model lsx computes the energy and water fluxes e g runoff generation over single vertical columns of soil vegetation and snow without any horizontal interactions on its basis the hms employs the two dimensional diffusion wave equation and the two dimensional boussinesq equation to derive the lateral movement of surface water and groundwater on a raster grid basis respectively and returns the groundwater level and soil moisture content to the lsx as a fully coupling mechanism yu et al 2006 the clhms was chosen here because it is designed for hydrological modelling particularly over macroscale and mesoscale basins for example the plb 162 000 km2 and multiple studies have reported good agreement between the simulation and observation of multiple hydrological components including streamflow soil moisture content and evapotranspiration yang et al 2010 2012 2013 wagner et al 2016 dong et al 2019b the driving data for clhms include the meteorological forcing soil texture land cover and hydrogeological parameters in this study a 0 5 degree gridded observation based dataset was collected to provide the daily temperature and precipitation input the ncep ncar reanalysis data in t62 gaussian grid points were used to obtain surface pressure relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation input yang 2009 the soil texture and hydrogeological parameters were derived from the harmonized world soil database and china geology database and land cover data were obtained from the avhrr dataset hansen et al 2000 2 3 reservoir scheme in this study the effect of reservoirs was evaluated through our newly developed reservoir scheme which is fully coupled to clhms through surface water subsurface water and evapotranspiration latent heat flux component dong et al 2019b to represent the reservoirs of the plb in clhms the 25 large and medium reservoirs along with 215 small reservoirs with known capacities and locations were simply integrated into grid cells corresponding to their geographical coordinates where necessary the location of each of the large and medium reservoirs was further adjusted to ensure that the reservoir location in the clhms matches that in the real river network dong et al 2019a 2 3 1 reservoir water balance equation the water balance equation is employed to update the water storage of reservoirs for each time step with the reservoir seepage surface precipitation and evaporation included 1 v t v t 1 δ t q in q out a t p a t e a t s where v t 1 and v t is the reservoir storage at the model time step t 1 and t respectively δ t is the model time step q in and q out are the inflow and the release of the reservoir respectively a t is the water surface area at the current time step which is calculated using the storage area correlation described in section 2 1 e is the evaporation loss which is calculated from the penman equation p is the precipitation on the surface of reservoirs s is the reservoir seepage given the humid climate and relatively high soil moisture in the plb the reservoir seepage is calculated in the same way as the river and lake seepage in the clhms by using the darcy s law for saturated soil yu et al 2006 2 s k δ h with 3 k k s δ x where δ h is the head difference between the reservoir water level and groundwater level k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the reservoir bottom δ x is the seepage distance due to the lack of details on both k s and δ x they were grouped into a parameter k which was estimated so that the simulated annual seepage roughly equals to that collected from local reports on several reservoirs and was assumed applicable to all reservoirs 2 3 2 operation rules the release of each reservoir q out was determined by a set of generalized conceptual operation rules developed based on our previous researches dong et al 2019a b where the capacity of a reservoir is divided into four storages by three critical water levels from the bottom up i e inactive level conservation level and high flood level zhao et al 2016 inactive level is the upper boundary of the dead storage conservation level is the upper boundary of the conservation storage for water supply irrigation etc and high flood level is the upper boundary of the flood control storage for flood control the release of reservoirs q t m3 s is then calculated as follows 4 q t 0 v t v d r u t v d v t v c max r u t q dmax v t v c v f v c k v c v t v f m a x q dmax v t v f δ t v t v f where v t v d v c and v f m3 are the water storage of reservoir at the model time step t at the inactive level conservation level and high flood level respectively u t m3 s is the human water demand at the time step t which was estimated in this study by temporally downscaling the basin level annual water use and distributing to each reservoir dong et al 2019b r is a correction factor q dmax m3 s is the maximum acceptable release for downstream flood control purposes k is an indicator to account for the magnitude of an incoming flood which is equal to the ratio of the q dmax to the inflow and is set to be no larger than 1 the parameters of the reservoir scheme i e q dmax a n d r can be either calibrated or estimated for reservoir simulation depending on the data availability if the reservoir operation data e g inflow outflow and storage series are available q dmax and r can be directly calibrated against the outflow and storage series to improve as much as possible the accuracy of reservoir modelling while r can be calibrated as a same value for all months dong et al 2019b time variant values are preferable specifically r can be calibrated on a monthly scale for example following the concept of target storage neitsch et al 2011 yassin et al 2019 i e 5 r m a m v t v m i v m i where r m is the r value at the month m v t m3 is the reservoir storage at the model time step t a m is a monthly calibrated parameter for the month m v m i m3 is the i th percentile of non exceedance probabilities of the observed storage at the end of the month m where i is a calibrated percentile same for all months in regional scale research however these reservoir operation data are often not available for calibration which is also the case for this study accordingly here the q dmax values were estimated as the 99th percentile of non exceedance probabilities of simulated streamflow in the corresponding grid cell for reservoirs designed for yearly regulation i e yearly reservoirs the r value was estimated so that the water storage can fall roughly above the inactive level at the end of relatively dry years for reservoirs designed for multi year regulation i e multi year reservoirs the r value was estimated so that the water storage can fall roughly above the inactive level at the end of continuous dry years in both cases r is a same value throughout the study period for each reservoir here the validity of the estimated parameters q dmax and r is further examined for the hongmen reservoir and tuanjie reservoir in section 3 2 for regional scale application 2 4 scenarios eight scenarios were designed in this study to evaluate the hydrological impact of reservoir network layouts for 1981 1999 table 1 the no reservoir scenario serves as the reference scenario with all reservoirs removed and was achieved by performing the clhms simulation with the reservoir scheme disabled i e reservoir disabled clhms the existing reservoirs scenario investigates the likely impact of existing reservoirs on the hydrologic regime of the plb and was achieved by performing the clhms simulation with the reservoir scheme enabled i e reservoir enabled clhms to evaluate the impact of reservoir capacity distribution we established two scenarios by disaggregating each of the large and medium reservoirs to smaller reservoirs with a capacity of 1 107 m3 and aggregating all of the small and medium reservoirs to a large reservoir respectively in each sub basin design parameters of the existing reservoirs such as critical water storages and mean inflow were scaled proportionally for each hypothetical reservoir and the reservoir disaggregation or aggregation induced no change in the total capacity and total mean inflow of reservoirs for each sub basin locations of the hypothetical reservoirs were determined randomly fig 3 a only to ensure that the hypothetical reservoirs receive the same amount of mean inflow as the existing reservoirs that were aggregated or disaggregated to evaluate the impact of reservoir locations all reservoirs were hypothetically moved to the downstream area and the upstream area in each sub basin of the plb respectively similarly the location of each hypothetical reservoir was determined randomly in each sub basin only to ensure that the hypothetical reservoir receives the same amount of mean inflow as the existing reservoir fig 3b and fig 3c depict the locations of large and medium reservoirs under these two scenarios additionally the impact of the mean inflow of reservoirs on the hydrologic regime was assessed by moving all the small and medium reservoirs to nearby grid cells with lower runoff and higher runoff respectively the total mean inflow received by small and medium reservoirs was decreased by around 30 and was increased by around 30 given that the reservoirs are moved within a limited area the effect of reservoir locations is avoided as much as possible 2 5 indicators of hydrologic alteration the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha were employed in this study to quantitatively evaluate the hydrological impact of multiple reservoir network layouts the iha was first proposed by richter 1996 to quantify the hydrological alteration caused by human activities and has been extensively used in the analysis of reservoir impact zhang et al 2014 ehsani et al 2016 lu et al 2018 the iha investigates the characteristics of the streamflow at a river cross section of interest by employing 32 ecologically relevant hydrological parameters which can be classified as the following five groups i the magnitude of the monthly streamflow ii the magnitude and duration of annual extreme streamflow iii timing of annual extreme streamflow iv the frequency and duration of high and low pulses and v the rate and frequency of streamflow changes table 2 the high pulse and low pulse in this study are referred to as periods in which the magnitude of the daily streamflow rises above the mean value plus standard deviation and falls below the mean value minus standard deviation respectively the hydrologic reversal is the turning point between the rising and falling daily flow hydrograph 3 model calibration and validation 3 1 reservoir disabled clhms model the clhms model with the reservoir scheme disabled is calibrated for 1961 1980 and validated for 1981 1999 the daily streamflow data of three hydrological stations were collected for calibration and validation which are located on the three largest tributaries that drain into the poyang lake namely waizhou a meigang b and lijiadu c see fig 2a the streambed conductivity and manning s roughness are two controlling parameters of surface flow and subsurface flow in the clhms model and were therefore selected for calibration other parameters such as porosity and aquifer thickness that depict the moisture distribution beneath the land surface however are insensitive as indicated by our previous sensitivity analysis in dong et al 2019b and thus excluded from calibration in this study regarding calibration procedure for each station 2000 parameter sets were randomly generated from the latin hypercube sampling and the parameter set with the highest value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was selected as the optimal parameter values a detailed uncertainty analysis of the clhms model can be found in dong et al 2019b table 3 presents the calibration and validation results with relative bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and fig 4 depicts the observed and simulated monthly streamflow at the three stations for the period of 1961 1999 it shows that the performance of the reservoir disabled clhms model is quite satisfactory with the nse of all stations for both periods over 0 85 it is also noted that for all of the three stations the nse in the validation period of 1981 1999 is lower than that in the calibration period of 1961 1980 this can be partially explained by the fact that most of the existing reservoirs in the plb were built and became fully operational only after the calibration period this means that the reservoir disabled clhms model is generally calibrated against the natural streamflow for 1961 1980 and is therefore unable to reproduce the impact of reservoirs on the streamflow in the validation period of 1981 1999 3 2 reservoir simulation with the reservoir enabled clhms model in this study the operation data are not available for most of the reservoirs in the plb and thus the q dmax and r values for each reservoir cannot be calibrated and were instead estimated as was described in section 2 3 to evaluate the performance of the reservoir enabled clhms model with the estimated q dmax and r we compared the simulated and the observed inflow outflow and water storage of two reservoirs the hongmen reservoir and the tuanjie reservoir note that the observed inflow outflow and storage of the two reservoirs are not used for calibration but for validation only fig 5 and fig 6 depict the daily simulated and observed inflow outflow and water storage of the two reservoirs respectively the inflow simulated by the reservoir enabled clhms generally matches the observation and the monthly nse values are 0 85 and 0 66 for the hongmen reservoir and the tuanjie reservoir respectively this indicates that the reservoir simulation with our reservoir enabled clhms model can be satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2007 however it should be noted in fig 6a that at a daily scale the nse value of the simulated inflow decreases to 0 43 for the tuanjie reservoir and multiple observed flood peaks e g in late 2016 are not well captured in the simulation one possible explanation is that the catchment of the tuanjie reservoir is as small as approximately 340 km2 yet the meteorological forcing of the model is at the resolution of 0 5 0 5 approximately 2500 km2 that is too coarse to accurately reproduce the observation for such a small catchment that being said the relatively higher nse value of the daily inflow simulation for the hongmen reservoir can be largely attributed to a larger catchment area of around 2300 km2 the inaccuracy of the simulated reservoir inflow can propagate to the simulated outflow and storage which could result in the comparably low daily nse values of the simulated outflow with 0 42 for the hongmen reservoir and 0 30 for the tuanjie reservoir respectively figs 5b 6b at a monthly scale however the results of the reservoir simulations remain satisfactory for both reservoirs with nse values both over 0 50 moriasi et al 2007 in addition the simulated water storage generally matches well with the observation for both reservoirs figs 5c 6c overall the results of figs 5 and 6 indicate that the reservoir enabled clhms model is generally able to represent the reservoir operation during a multi year period by capturing the variation of reservoir outflow and storage especially at a monthly scale moreover in comparison with the data driven operation rules that require considerable data for training testing and validating ehsani et al 2016 coerver et al 2018 yang et al 2019 our current reservoir module with the conceptual operation rules requires relatively little data this advantage leads to an effective compromise between modelling accuracy and data accessibility for regional scale research 3 3 streamflow simulation with the reservoir enabled clhms model to further validate the reservoir scheme the streamflow simulation of the reservoir enabled clhms model was performed and compared with that of the reservoir disabled clhms model with the reservoir scheme enabled the model is considered able to depict the impact of the existing reservoirs for the validation period with no re calibration performed for the original clhms model the nse values of the reservoir enabled clhms simulations are presented in table 4 at a daily scale the reservoir enabled model shows improved performance in comparison with the reservoir disabled model in section 3 1 as the nse values of the simulated daily streamflow increase for all of the three stations the matched pair t test cai et al 2019 was further applied to the reservoir disabled and reservoir enabled streamflow series to investigate the significance of the improvement in the streamflow simulation notably the results indicate that such improvement is significant at the 0 05 level at the daily scale for all of the three stations at a monthly scale the streamflow simulation also sees an improvement at waizhou station and lijiadu station overall the model exhibits improved performance in streamflow simulation for the plb by enabling the reservoir scheme in addition to well reproducing dynamics of the selected reservoirs in the basin section 3 2 it indicates that the reservoir enabled clhms model with our newly developed reservoir scheme allows quantifying the hydrological impact of reservoirs in the plb it is also worth noting that the improved streamflow with the reservoir enabled clhms model which has already been coupled to the genesis land surface scheme could possibly result in a better parameterization of land surface models lsm and improve the land surface fluxes and feedbacks to the atmosphere when further coupling to an atmospheric model yassin et al 2019 4 hydrological impact of reservoir network layout simulations of eight reservoir network layouts table 1 were conducted at a daily modeling timestep over the plb for the period of 1981 1999 the impact of reservoir network layout on the hydrologic regime is quantitatively evaluated for the outlets of the three largest rivers in the plb namely gan river fu river and xin river and is here presented in the form of the monthly streamflow and the relative change in the iha parameters 4 1 existing reservoirs the existing reservoir network in the plb is a combination of small and large upstream and downstream mainstream and tributary reservoirs regulated for multiple purposes as shown in fig 7 the simulated multi year averaged monthly streamflow of the three rivers decreases by 5 2 throughout the wet season march to august and increases by 9 0 throughout the dry season september to february as compared to that for the no reservoir scenario index 1 12 in the right column similarly the maximum flows see a decrease while the minimum flows see an increase with the existing reservoirs as compared to that for the no reservoir scenario for the three rivers index 13 23 on the other hand the dates of maximum and minimum flows are generally postponed or remain unchanged index 24 25 the frequency of high pulses decreases by 1 9 4 5 for the three rivers whereas the low pulses are intensified and prolonged index 26 29 the daily flow variation is also mitigated by the reservoir operation with a 5 20 decrease in the rise rate fall rate and reversal count 4 2 alternative reservoir capacity distribution the impact of reservoir capacity distribution on the flow regime of the three rivers is depicted in fig 8 regarding the simulated multi year averaged monthly streamflow it is distributed more evenly throughout a year if all reservoirs are replaced by a few large ones see left column for the smaller reservoirs only the existing reservoirs and the larger reservoirs only scenarios the streamflow averaged for the three rivers increases by 9 5 12 6 and 15 6 in the dry season and decreases by 4 0 4 8 and 5 8 in the wet season respectively index 1 12 in the right column similarly the maximum minimum flows decrease increase more significantly for a few larger reservoirs as compared to many smaller reservoirs index 13 23 with many smaller reservoirs replaced by a few larger ones the dates of maximum and minimum flows are generally postponed index 24 25 and the flow regime is generally characterized by less frequent and shorter low pulses and less frequent but prolonged high pulses index 26 29 the rise rate fall rate and reversal count are more significantly reduced by larger reservoirs 4 3 alternative reservoir locations fig 9 depicts the impact of reservoir locations on the downstream flow regime of the three rivers for the gan river and xin river the monthly streamflow of the three rivers is increased in the dry season and decreased in the wet season more significantly with upstream reservoirs and existing reservoirs despite that the discrepancies are minor between the three scenarios index 1 12 in the right column the maximum minimum flows see a slightly larger decrease increase for reservoirs located further upstream of the gan river and xin river index 13 17 on the other hand the results of the fu river are in many cases inconsistent with those of the gan river and xin river compare fig 9b with a and c which reveal that locating reservoirs downstream would slightly more effectively increase the streamflow in the dry season decrease the streamflow in the wet season reduce the maximum flows and increase the minimum flows index 1 23 for all three rivers there is no significant variation or clear pattern for the dates of maximum and minimum flows high pulses and low pulses when relocating the reservoirs upstream or downstream index 24 29 this is also the case for the daily flow variation with no clear change in the rise rate fall rate and reversal count index 30 32 4 4 alternative reservoir inflow fig 10 depicts the impact of reservoir mean inflow on the downstream flow regime of the three rivers in general the intra annual flow variability is reduced most significantly with reservoirs with higher mean inflow see left column for all of the three rivers reservoirs with higher mean inflow can reduce the streamflow in the wet season increase the streamflow in the dry season reduce the annual maximum flows and increase the minimum flows more significantly than those with lower mean inflow index 1 23 in the right column reservoirs with higher inflow can postpone or maintain similar dates of the minimum flow and maximum flow relative to those with lower inflow index 24 25 reservoirs with higher inflow also induce more low pulses whereas the number of high pulses and the duration of high pulses and low pulses see no significant change index 26 29 the discrepancies in the rise rate and fall rate are negligible between the scenarios while the reversal count increases by 7 0 for reservoirs with higher inflow as compared to those with lower inflow index 30 32 4 5 combined results reservoir capacity distribution with different mean inflow in section 4 2 the impact of reservoir capacity distribution was evaluated under the same inflow condition to further evaluate the impact of reservoir capacity distribution under different mean inflow conditions we selected part of results from the reservoir capacity distribution section 4 2 and the reservoir mean inflow section 4 4 for a joint analysis fig 11 compares the higher inflow scenario i e existing reservoirs with higher mean inflow and larger reservoirs only scenario i e existing reservoirs aggregated to a few larger ones for the three rivers with the larger reservoirs only scenario as the reference see the red circle in fig 11b results reveal that the values of indexes 1 23 are similar between the two scenarios in particular for the gan river and fu river indicating that the two reservoir network layouts have similar abilities to increase the streamflow in the dry season decrease the streamflow in the wet season reduce the annual maximum flows and increase the minimum flows on the other hand more frequent high pulses and low pulses and higher rise rate fall rate and reversal count are noted for the higher inflow scenario as compared to the larger reservoirs scenario for all of the three rivers index 28 32 5 discussion the existing reservoir network in the plb has been continuously built since decades ago to increase the resiliency of the local economy against the spatiotemporal variation of water resources in this area our reservoir modelling results confirm that the reservoirs in the plb are able to serve as a useful tool to reduce the variability of water resources throughout a year by displacing the excessive water resources in the wet season to the dry season which is in line with multiple other regional scale studies lauri et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 räsänen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 ngo et al 2018 wen et al 2018 these reservoirs also show a strong ability to control floods and relieve droughts zhang et al 2014 räsänen et al 2017 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 the variations of other flow characteristics in the plb are also noted including later or similar dates of maximum and minimum flows ehsani et al 2016 lu et al 2018 an increased frequency and duration for low pulses a decreased frequency for high pulses ehsani et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 lu et al 2018 and a lower variability of daily flow ehsani et al 2016 lu et al 2018 however our simulations also exhibit few results different from those of the existing literature for example an observation based study of zhang et al 2017 reported a generally increased frequency of high pulses and an alternating increase and decrease in the variability of daily flow for the miyun reservoir beijing this reveals the complexity of real time reservoir operation given that the miyun reservoir is operated dynamically for multi objectives for example accounting for the fluctuating water demands of beijing city which is difficult to be parameterized with simple conceptual rules 5 1 reservoir capacity distribution reservoirs vary significantly in size and large ones can have considerably different hydrological ecological and socioeconomic impacts from small ones scudder 2012 in this study our findings suggest that a few larger reservoirs would be able to reduce the intra annual variability of water resources and mitigate hydrologic extremes for the downstream areas more effectively than a large group of smaller reservoirs and a combination of small and large reservoirs that share a same total capacity and same total mean inflow accordingly a decision maker standing on the viewpoint of effective water resources management may find relatively large reservoirs a preferred choice ehsani et al 2016 2017 this is particularly relevant for the plb as most of the small reservoirs were built around 40 years ago and many of them were classified non functional or hazardous with pending removal or reconstruction where practical replacing them with larger ones would likely be an effective solution to improve their ability to regulate the flow regime for the downstream area a few larger reservoirs also have some advantages over smaller ones from the ecological viewpoint given that the baseflow which is a key constraint on the aquatic communities wang et al 2018 increases most effectively with larger reservoirs a large group of smaller reservoirs would also decrease the river connectivity and create barriers for migration of organisms and nutrients lu et al 2018 however replacing small reservoirs with larger ones also brings disadvantages for example it is noted that a few large reservoirs can more significantly reduce the frequency of high pulses than many smaller reservoirs which are disadvantageous to the transfer of nutrient and organic substances thereby posing a challenge for aquatic species to locate a spawning area for recruitment and causing a decrease in the abundance of aquatic species hu et al 2008 a larger decrease in the daily flow variability with larger reservoirs may entrap organisms on the islands and floodplains as compared to smaller reservoirs the nature conservancy 2009 in addition most large reservoirs are deep enough to develop thermal stratification which can disrupt the thermal regime and affects the growth of aquatic organisms poff and hart 2002 from the engineering viewpoint construing smaller reservoirs can also be more practical than construing larger ones due to the lower cost and more scattered geographical distribution of smaller reservoirs which makes it convenient for them to meet the water demand locally with no extra need of pumping and transferring the water resources across the drainage network potter 2006 mushtaq et al 2007 5 2 reservoir locations decision makers often need to weigh up multiple potential reservoir building sites that share similar inflow conditions by moving reservoirs to the downstream and upstream areas without changing the mean inflow we found that different reservoir locations with similar mean inflow conditions have a relatively minor impact on the flow regime in the plb as many of the iha indexes show relatively minor variations although locating reservoirs upstream for gan and xin river would slightly strengthen the capability of reservoirs in the monthly flow regulation flood control and drought relief the inconsistent results for the fu river imply that the impacts of reservoir locations can actually be case dependent given the findings for the three rivers the reservoir location may not need to be an important consideration in the general case if the main focus is to address the monthly variability of water resources and the hydrologic extremes for the downstream area in the case of the plb on the other hand it nevertheless can be more reasonable to locate reservoirs upstream for gan and xin river and to locate reservoirs downstream for the fu river however it should be noted that any current decisions on the removal reconstruction and planning of reservoirs should also incorporate the climate change impact in the near future ehsani et al 2017 for example climate change is expected to bring about more severe droughts in the upper gan river as indicated in our recent research dong et al 2019a and locating reservoirs upstream of the gan river would exactly help to more effectively relieve the future droughts both locally and regionally with respect to the ecosystem locating reservoirs either upstream or downstream can have case dependent impacts with both advantages and disadvantages as noted in section 5 1 such impacts on the ecosystem are relatively minor for different reservoir locations as compared to the reservoir capacity distribution 5 3 reservoir mean inflow many humid regions are characterized by a high density of the river network for example the density of river network can reach up to 1 5 km km2 in the plb zhang et al 2011 and in a small area there could be multiple suitable river reaches with different mean annual runoff to build reservoirs in this case our results reveal that higher mean inflow of reservoirs indicates greater functionality of these reservoirs to regulate the monthly variability of water resources and the hydrologic extremes in the downstream areas although it indicates a decrease in the ratio of capacity to inflow or the degree of regulation grill et al 2014 accordingly decision makers may find that assigning reservoirs higher inflow is a reasonable choice when focusing on balancing the downstream water resources in dry seasons and in wet seasons and the negative impact of hydrologic extremes this implies that it can be more reasonable to place new reservoirs in a cascade mode in the mainstream rather than in a parallel mode across the tributaries also aging reservoirs located in river reaches with higher runoff can be given priority for expansion and reconstruction in view of their higher effectiveness in flow regulation our findings further generalize the conclusions of liu et al 2019 the increased flood control benefit can be a result of the increased mean inflow when moving the reservoir from the upper to lower mainstream of the yalong river rather than the reservoir location being closer to the outlet as was noted in section 5 1 reservoirs with higher inflow can also have ecological benefits due to the larger increase in the low flows on the other hand the increase in the frequency of low pulses can influence soil moisture anaerobic stress and the availability of floodplain habitats in a favorable way for some species but an unfavorable way for others graf 2006 5 4 joint analysis reservoir capacity distribution with different mean inflow the results and discussion of reservoir capacity distribution in sections 4 2 and 5 1 suggest that a few larger reservoirs can deal with the intra annual variability of water resources and the hydrologic extremes more effectively than a large number of smaller reservoirs with a same total capacity and same total inflow however this may not hold true if these larger reservoirs receive considerably less total inflow than the smaller reservoirs because less inflow indicates less effectiveness in the flow regulation as suggested by the results and discussion of reservoir mean inflow in sections 4 4 and 5 3 the further comparison of simulations between the higher inflow scenario and the larger reservoirs only scenario fig 11 suggests that by increasing the mean total inflow of smaller reservoirs by around 30 a large number of smaller reservoirs are likely to have a similar or even stronger ability in the flow regulation as compared to a few larger reservoirs especially for the gan river and fu river this can be informative to relevant hydrological modelling research which quantifies the impact of a large number of small reservoirs by means of aggregating them into one large reservoir downstream e g in güntner et al 2004 malveira et al 2011 and wang et al 2018 our findings suggest that the impact of small reservoirs can be well represented by the aggregation of small reservoirs only if these small reservoirs receive sufficiently higher inflow than the aggregated large reservoir in these studies otherwise the impact of small reservoirs can be overestimated due to the aggregation also our findings further generalize the results of ehsani et al 2016 a single large reservoir may not always be more effective than a number of small reservoirs if the small reservoirs receive sufficiently higher inflow than the large one combining the findings of reservoir capacity distribution and mean inflow decision makers focusing on the flow regulation may instead shift attention to smaller reservoirs if it is possible to assign them sufficiently high inflow in addition our findings suggest that a few larger reservoirs reduce the number of high pulses and low pulses and the daily flow variability much more significantly than a large number of small reservoirs with sufficiently high mean inflow which could give smaller reservoirs additional ecological benefits as indicated in section 5 1 5 5 research limitations our comprehensive analysis may help the decision makers to achieve a trade off for reservoir capacity distribution locations and mean inflow conditions thereby leading to more sustainable water resources planning and management in the plb in view of the large extent of study area and the large number of reservoirs included in this study our findings also have the potential to be generalized and applied in different climate regions worldwide however it should be noted that our findings are based on generalized conceptual operation rules which can be a considerable simplification of the real reservoir operation real time decisions of reservoir operation often need to assimilate the information on the inflow forecast changing multi sectoral demands potential risks and manual experiences yang et al 2019 assimilation of such frequently updated information induces uncertainties in the reservoir operation and poses a challenge to reconstruct actual operation rules from historical observations wu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 if sufficient reservoir operation data are available operation rules derived from machine learning approaches such as artificial neural network may be able to reconstruct comparably accurate operation rules ehsani et al 2016 coerver et al 2018 yang et al 2019 however the black box nature of machine learning based approaches may diminish their ability to provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of reservoir operation which may mask the potential defects in an established neural network model yassin et al 2019 even if the actual operation rules are available the reservoir inflow simulated in hydrological models is nevertheless subject to uncertainties and bias which would eventually propagate to the simulation of reservoir operation for these reasons it is unlikely that the model based approaches can depict the hydrological impact of reservoirs on a regional scale with a perfect accuracy regardless of these uncertainties the validation of the reservoir enabled clhms model indicates that the clhms model coupled with our reservoir scheme and operation rules can serve as a useful tool to reproduce the altered hydrology in reservoir regulated basins and subsequent findings on the hypothetical reservoir scenarios can be informative with respect to the hydrologic alteration induced by the reservoirs network moreover the uncertainties related to operation rules are likely to be cancelled out in the comparison between multiple reservoir network layout scenarios because reservoirs are operated in the same way under different scenarios in this study accordingly we believe that our approaches including the distributed hydrologic model reservoir scheme and scenario design have the potential to provide useful instructions for the water resources planning and management across different regions worldwide 6 conclusions this paper aims to evaluate and compare the impact of the existing and alternative reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime in the poyang lake basin it was motivated by the fact that the water resources in this region are regulated intensively by a high density reservoir network with potential removal reconstruction and planning of reservoirs the variation in the hydrologic regime induced by the existing reservoir network and seven hypothetical reservoir network layouts were simulated by a coupled land surface hydrologic model clhms fully coupled with a reservoir scheme and were further analysed using the indicators of hydrologic alteration with the validated reservoir enabled clhms model we found that the existing reservoir network in the plb is able to provide resiliency against the intra annual variability of water resources and the hydrologic extremes for sustainable economic development to be specific these reservoirs can effectively displace the excessive water resources in the wet season to the dry season mitigate the flood peaks and increase the low flows maintain or postpone the dates of maximum and minimum flow increase the frequency and duration of low pulses decrease the frequency of high pulses and lower the daily flow variations furthermore the analysis on the hydrologic simulations of the hypothetical reservoir scenarios indicates that despite a same total capacity the impact of different reservoir network layouts can vary significantly with conclusions highlighted as follows replacing a large group of smaller reservoirs with a few larger ones with a same total capacity and total mean inflow can enhance the effectiveness of reservoirs in displacing the excessive streamflow in the wet season to the dry season and mitigating flood and drought conditions the much more increased low flows due to larger reservoirs is a major advantage over smaller reservoirs to the ecosystem whereas larger reservoirs also induce a larger decrease in the frequency of high pulses and in the daily flow variations which can be disadvantageous to the riverine ecosystem locating reservoirs to a different place with similar mean inflow is unlikely to significantly diminish or enhance their ability to balance the water resources in dry and wet seasons and to mitigate the hydrologic extremes in general the downstream flow regime is relatively insensitive to the reservoir location than the reservoir capacity distribution and mean inflow and different reservoir locations have a relatively minor ecological impact assigning reservoirs higher mean inflow can be a preferred choice to cope with the intra annual variability of water resources and the hydrologic extremes in this aspect it can be more reasonable to place reservoirs in a cascade mode in the mainstream rather than in a parallel mode across the tributaries and to give priority to aging reservoirs located in river reaches with higher runoff for expansion and reconstruction in view of their higher effectiveness in flow regulation due to the increased low flows reservoirs with higher mean inflow can provide additional ecological benefits over those with lower inflow whereas the increased frequency of low pulses can bring about both positive and negative ecological impacts a large number of smaller reservoirs with sufficiently higher total mean inflow are likely to be more effective in the flow regulation than a single larger reservoir in this case smaller reservoirs can also provide some additional ecological benefits than a single larger one because the number of high pulses and low pulses and the daily flow variability are reduced not significantly as in a larger one reservoir removal reconstruction and planning are capital intensive and require comprehensive analysis on the pros and cons while socioeconomic impacts engineering practicability climate change and local water demand often have to weigh in the decisions on the removal reconstruction or planning of reservoirs this study drew some conclusions with a main focus on the effective flow regulation and sustainable riverine ecosystem using the coupled land surface hydrologic model reservoir scheme and scenario design in this study the impact of reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime was quantitatively evaluated in the plb for more effective water resources planning and management the plb is a typical example of heavily reservoir regulated large scale catchments around the globe where a similarly high density reservoir network can be regularly found across china wang et al 2018 united states ehsani et al 2017 and europe wagner et al 2019 therefore with the local climatological and socio economic conditions taken into account our methodologies and findings have the potential to be generalized beyond the plb to provide ecohydrological instructions for regional water resources planning and management in many other reservoir regulated basins in particular our proposed modelling framework of the hydrologic model reservoir scheme and scenario design can be applied in a regionally adapted manner to similar catchments in further regions worldwide credit authorship contribution statement ningpeng dong conceptualization methodology software writing original draft mingxiang yang supervision funding

5507,reservoirs have been continuously built in the poyang lake basin plb for the local economy with pending removal and reconstruction of aging reservoirs and planning of new reservoirs in this area it is advisable to evaluate the likely impact of the existing and alternative reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime for more effective water resources planning and management in this study reservoirs of multiple sizes in the plb were integrated into a coupled land surface hydrologic model clhms fully coupled with a reservoir scheme the extended model was then validated and applied to investigate the impact of existing reservoirs seven hypothetical scenarios were additionally set up by removing all the reservoirs replacing smaller reservoirs with few larger ones replacing larger reservoirs with many smaller ones moving all reservoirs downstream or upstream increasing or decreasing the mean inflow of reservoirs respectively in all eight simulations were conducted and analyzed using the indictors of hydrologic alterations iha for the period of 1981 1999 results indicate that the existing reservoirs in the plb are able to effectively displace the excessive streamflow in the wet season to the dry season and mitigate the hydrological extremes by increasing the mean inflow of reservoirs the effectiveness of reservoirs in downstream flow regulation can be further enhanced similarly replacing many small reservoirs with a few large ones with a same total capacity can lead to more resiliency against the downstream flow variability and extremes only if the total mean inflow of the new large reservoirs is not considerably lower than that of the small ones relocating reservoirs to a different place with similar mean inflow however has a relatively minor and probably case dependent impact on the hydrologic regime on the other hand the ecological analysis on the iha parameters indicates that the layout preferable for the effective flow regulation may not necessarily be ecologically preferable in general this study comprehensively evaluates the hydrological impact of reservoir network layouts and can provide implications for stakeholders to reach a trade off between reservoir capacity distribution locations and mean inflow not only in the plb but also in different regions worldwide keywords distributed hydrologic model reservoir network layout capacity distribution location mean inflow 1 introduction reservoirs have been continuously built worldwide to cope with the spatiotemporal variability of water resources for the benefit of human society kummu et al 2006 deng et al 2014 this is particularly the case for the catchment of china s largest freshwater lake poyang lake basin plb it is documented that in the plb there are three reservoirs with a capacity larger than 109 m3 hereinafter large reservoirs 22 reservoirs with a capacity between 108 m3 and 109 m3 hereinafter medium reservoirs and approximately 215 reservoirs with a capacity between 107 m3 and 108 m3 hereinafter small reservoirs they together have a combined capacity of 3 1010 m3 accounting for approximately 20 of the total water resources in the plb the operation of such a complex reservoir network can induce a considerable hydrologic alteration in the plb which has yet to be understood lv et al 2016 in general the reservoir induced hydrologic alteration can be quantified by using two approaches the first one is here referred to as the observation based approach which has been intensively used in multiple recent studies for different target basins räsänen et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 li et al 2017 räsänen et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 its concept is to compare the observed streamflow in the pre impact and post impact period due to reservoir operation räsänen et al 2012 or to compare the observed streamflow with the reconstructed natural streamflow both in the post impact period lu et al 2018 the applicability of this approach is generally limited to regions where the flow regime is dominated by a few reservoirs with well documented inauguration dates or sparsely populated areas where the impact of other human activities such as river abstraction groundwater pumping and irrigation are relatively insignificant and can be considered constant over time however neither of the above described conditions holds true for a large scale densely populated and highly regulated basin deitch et al 2013 which is the particular case for the plb more importantly the observation based approach can neither be applied to partition the combined impact of reservoirs into for example the individual impact of small reservoirs among all reservoirs nor be used for what if studies in which hypothetical reservoir scenarios can be established for research and engineering purposes sene 2015 to overcome these difficulties the so called model based approach i e modelling of reservoirs in hydrological models can serve as a suitable alternative for hydrological impact studies on large scale basins güntner et al 2004 hanasaki et al 2006 wisser et al 2010 pokhrel et al 2012 lauri et al 2012 voisin et al 2013 wada et al 2016 giuliani et al 2016 solander et al 2016 ehsani et al 2017 wang et al 2017 yassin et al 2019 shin et al 2019 for example a fully coupled reservoir module in a coupled land surface hydrologic model was developed and applied to the plb in our recent research where the high density reservoir network consisting of large medium and small reservoirs in the plb has been included for hydrological simulations in the past and future dong et al 2019a b as an improvement to conventional offline models lv et al 2016 the newly extended model also accounts for the feedbacks between reservoirs and multiple hydrologic processes for more closed description of the regional terrestrial water cycle dong et al 2019b by setting up hypothetical scenarios for simulation modelling tools of this kind can further provide us with practical instructions in water resources planning and management from hydrological ecological and multiple other perspectives for example they can be applied to determine the capacity distribution of the reservoir network at the planning stage i e whether to build a single large reservoir or many small reservoirs while ziv et al 2012 reported that construction of a large group of small reservoirs on the tributaries would be less beneficial economic and eco friendly than several large reservoirs on the mainstream naiman and dudgeon 2011 and scudder 2012 noted otherwise more recently ehsani et al 2016 reported a single large reservoir would alter the flow regime more significantly than many small ones however they drew conclusions without further separating the impact of reservoir capacity distribution from that of the reservoir mean inflow because the large reservoir receives considerably more inflow than many small ones combined in their study modelling tools with hypothetical scenarios can also be applied to for example assessing multiple potential reservoir building sites in a recent case study liu et al 2019 noted that the benefit of flood control at the basin outlet would be increased by relocating a same reservoir in the upper mainstream of the yalong river to the lower mainstream however again they drew their conclusions without further partitioning the impact of reservoir locations and inflow because moving downstream a reservoir along the mainstream of the river means both the reservoir gets closer to the basin outlet and the reservoir receives higher mean inflow in general despite the above mentioned studies the individual impact of the reservoir capacity distribution locations and mean inflow on the hydrologic regime remains unclear the above described issue leads to one of the key questions in the water resources planning and management with a specified total capacity which reservoir network layout can most desirably regulate the hydrologic regime this question is particularly relevant for the plb since many of the existing reservoirs are classified as hazardous or non functional with pending removal and reconstruction yet new reservoirs are continuously under planning as an attempt to shed light on the proposed question this paper aims to evaluate the impact of the existing and alternative reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime in the poyang lake basin china as indicated in the flowchart fig 1 this is achieved first by integrating the reservoirs of multiple sizes in the plb into a physically based land surface hydrologic model system clhms through a reservoir scheme and generalized conceptual operation rules the extended model with the reservoir scheme disabled and enabled was respectively validated and applied to investigate the impact of existing reservoirs as compared to the no reservoir condition six hypothetical scenarios were additionally simulated with the reservoir enabled model by replacing smaller reservoirs with larger ones replacing larger reservoirs with smaller ones moving all reservoirs downstream and upstream increasing and decreasing the mean inflow of reservoirs respectively then the reservoir induced variations in the streamflow under these scenarios are evaluated and compared using the indicators of hydrologic alterations iha to our knowledge this study is one of the first efforts to comprehensively evaluate the impact of multiple reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime and our framework and findings are expected to provide instructions for water resources planning and management on a regional scale not only in the plb but also in other basins worldwide 2 data and methods the poyang lake basin plb is located in the southeast china and is connected to the yangtze river to the north with a total area of approximately 162 000 km2 wei et al 2015 2016 there are five major rivers draining into the poyang lake namely the xiu river gan river fu river xin river and rao river which divide the plb into five sub basins fig 2 the plb receives mean annual precipitation of around 1600 mm and 70 occurs between march and july and 30 between august and february which partitions the year into wet and dry seasons 2 1 reservoir data the information on three large reservoirs 22 medium reservoirs and 215 small reservoirs in the basin such as capacity location mean inflow and critical water storages are well documented by the local authorities and were collected in this study the daily inflow outflow and water storage data were also collected for a large reservoir the hongmen reservoir capacity 1 2 109 m3 and a medium reservoir the tuanjie reservoir capacity 1 5 108 m3 on the other hand these operation data are not available for the rest of the reservoirs smaller reservoirs with a capacity less than 107 m3 are not included in this study which account for less than 20 of the total capacity of all reservoirs in the plb the locations of the three large reservoirs 22 medium reservoirs and 215 small reservoirs are depicted in fig 2b the storage area correlation is required to estimate the seepage surface evaporation and precipitation of reservoirs given that the geometric information on each reservoir is often not available especially at regional scales a commonly used empirical correlation i e the inverted triangle storage area correlation was employed in this study liebe et al 2005 van beek et al 2011 shin et al 2019 this correlation has been well established using the remote sensing images and digital elevation data of the plb in our previous research see dong et al 2019a for more details 2 2 coupled land surface hydrologic model system clhms the clhms was developed as a fully coupled system of the land surface model lsx and the spatially distributed hydrologic model hms hydrological model system yu et al 1999 yu et al 2006 the land surface model lsx computes the energy and water fluxes e g runoff generation over single vertical columns of soil vegetation and snow without any horizontal interactions on its basis the hms employs the two dimensional diffusion wave equation and the two dimensional boussinesq equation to derive the lateral movement of surface water and groundwater on a raster grid basis respectively and returns the groundwater level and soil moisture content to the lsx as a fully coupling mechanism yu et al 2006 the clhms was chosen here because it is designed for hydrological modelling particularly over macroscale and mesoscale basins for example the plb 162 000 km2 and multiple studies have reported good agreement between the simulation and observation of multiple hydrological components including streamflow soil moisture content and evapotranspiration yang et al 2010 2012 2013 wagner et al 2016 dong et al 2019b the driving data for clhms include the meteorological forcing soil texture land cover and hydrogeological parameters in this study a 0 5 degree gridded observation based dataset was collected to provide the daily temperature and precipitation input the ncep ncar reanalysis data in t62 gaussian grid points were used to obtain surface pressure relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation input yang 2009 the soil texture and hydrogeological parameters were derived from the harmonized world soil database and china geology database and land cover data were obtained from the avhrr dataset hansen et al 2000 2 3 reservoir scheme in this study the effect of reservoirs was evaluated through our newly developed reservoir scheme which is fully coupled to clhms through surface water subsurface water and evapotranspiration latent heat flux component dong et al 2019b to represent the reservoirs of the plb in clhms the 25 large and medium reservoirs along with 215 small reservoirs with known capacities and locations were simply integrated into grid cells corresponding to their geographical coordinates where necessary the location of each of the large and medium reservoirs was further adjusted to ensure that the reservoir location in the clhms matches that in the real river network dong et al 2019a 2 3 1 reservoir water balance equation the water balance equation is employed to update the water storage of reservoirs for each time step with the reservoir seepage surface precipitation and evaporation included 1 v t v t 1 δ t q in q out a t p a t e a t s where v t 1 and v t is the reservoir storage at the model time step t 1 and t respectively δ t is the model time step q in and q out are the inflow and the release of the reservoir respectively a t is the water surface area at the current time step which is calculated using the storage area correlation described in section 2 1 e is the evaporation loss which is calculated from the penman equation p is the precipitation on the surface of reservoirs s is the reservoir seepage given the humid climate and relatively high soil moisture in the plb the reservoir seepage is calculated in the same way as the river and lake seepage in the clhms by using the darcy s law for saturated soil yu et al 2006 2 s k δ h with 3 k k s δ x where δ h is the head difference between the reservoir water level and groundwater level k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the reservoir bottom δ x is the seepage distance due to the lack of details on both k s and δ x they were grouped into a parameter k which was estimated so that the simulated annual seepage roughly equals to that collected from local reports on several reservoirs and was assumed applicable to all reservoirs 2 3 2 operation rules the release of each reservoir q out was determined by a set of generalized conceptual operation rules developed based on our previous researches dong et al 2019a b where the capacity of a reservoir is divided into four storages by three critical water levels from the bottom up i e inactive level conservation level and high flood level zhao et al 2016 inactive level is the upper boundary of the dead storage conservation level is the upper boundary of the conservation storage for water supply irrigation etc and high flood level is the upper boundary of the flood control storage for flood control the release of reservoirs q t m3 s is then calculated as follows 4 q t 0 v t v d r u t v d v t v c max r u t q dmax v t v c v f v c k v c v t v f m a x q dmax v t v f δ t v t v f where v t v d v c and v f m3 are the water storage of reservoir at the model time step t at the inactive level conservation level and high flood level respectively u t m3 s is the human water demand at the time step t which was estimated in this study by temporally downscaling the basin level annual water use and distributing to each reservoir dong et al 2019b r is a correction factor q dmax m3 s is the maximum acceptable release for downstream flood control purposes k is an indicator to account for the magnitude of an incoming flood which is equal to the ratio of the q dmax to the inflow and is set to be no larger than 1 the parameters of the reservoir scheme i e q dmax a n d r can be either calibrated or estimated for reservoir simulation depending on the data availability if the reservoir operation data e g inflow outflow and storage series are available q dmax and r can be directly calibrated against the outflow and storage series to improve as much as possible the accuracy of reservoir modelling while r can be calibrated as a same value for all months dong et al 2019b time variant values are preferable specifically r can be calibrated on a monthly scale for example following the concept of target storage neitsch et al 2011 yassin et al 2019 i e 5 r m a m v t v m i v m i where r m is the r value at the month m v t m3 is the reservoir storage at the model time step t a m is a monthly calibrated parameter for the month m v m i m3 is the i th percentile of non exceedance probabilities of the observed storage at the end of the month m where i is a calibrated percentile same for all months in regional scale research however these reservoir operation data are often not available for calibration which is also the case for this study accordingly here the q dmax values were estimated as the 99th percentile of non exceedance probabilities of simulated streamflow in the corresponding grid cell for reservoirs designed for yearly regulation i e yearly reservoirs the r value was estimated so that the water storage can fall roughly above the inactive level at the end of relatively dry years for reservoirs designed for multi year regulation i e multi year reservoirs the r value was estimated so that the water storage can fall roughly above the inactive level at the end of continuous dry years in both cases r is a same value throughout the study period for each reservoir here the validity of the estimated parameters q dmax and r is further examined for the hongmen reservoir and tuanjie reservoir in section 3 2 for regional scale application 2 4 scenarios eight scenarios were designed in this study to evaluate the hydrological impact of reservoir network layouts for 1981 1999 table 1 the no reservoir scenario serves as the reference scenario with all reservoirs removed and was achieved by performing the clhms simulation with the reservoir scheme disabled i e reservoir disabled clhms the existing reservoirs scenario investigates the likely impact of existing reservoirs on the hydrologic regime of the plb and was achieved by performing the clhms simulation with the reservoir scheme enabled i e reservoir enabled clhms to evaluate the impact of reservoir capacity distribution we established two scenarios by disaggregating each of the large and medium reservoirs to smaller reservoirs with a capacity of 1 107 m3 and aggregating all of the small and medium reservoirs to a large reservoir respectively in each sub basin design parameters of the existing reservoirs such as critical water storages and mean inflow were scaled proportionally for each hypothetical reservoir and the reservoir disaggregation or aggregation induced no change in the total capacity and total mean inflow of reservoirs for each sub basin locations of the hypothetical reservoirs were determined randomly fig 3 a only to ensure that the hypothetical reservoirs receive the same amount of mean inflow as the existing reservoirs that were aggregated or disaggregated to evaluate the impact of reservoir locations all reservoirs were hypothetically moved to the downstream area and the upstream area in each sub basin of the plb respectively similarly the location of each hypothetical reservoir was determined randomly in each sub basin only to ensure that the hypothetical reservoir receives the same amount of mean inflow as the existing reservoir fig 3b and fig 3c depict the locations of large and medium reservoirs under these two scenarios additionally the impact of the mean inflow of reservoirs on the hydrologic regime was assessed by moving all the small and medium reservoirs to nearby grid cells with lower runoff and higher runoff respectively the total mean inflow received by small and medium reservoirs was decreased by around 30 and was increased by around 30 given that the reservoirs are moved within a limited area the effect of reservoir locations is avoided as much as possible 2 5 indicators of hydrologic alteration the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha were employed in this study to quantitatively evaluate the hydrological impact of multiple reservoir network layouts the iha was first proposed by richter 1996 to quantify the hydrological alteration caused by human activities and has been extensively used in the analysis of reservoir impact zhang et al 2014 ehsani et al 2016 lu et al 2018 the iha investigates the characteristics of the streamflow at a river cross section of interest by employing 32 ecologically relevant hydrological parameters which can be classified as the following five groups i the magnitude of the monthly streamflow ii the magnitude and duration of annual extreme streamflow iii timing of annual extreme streamflow iv the frequency and duration of high and low pulses and v the rate and frequency of streamflow changes table 2 the high pulse and low pulse in this study are referred to as periods in which the magnitude of the daily streamflow rises above the mean value plus standard deviation and falls below the mean value minus standard deviation respectively the hydrologic reversal is the turning point between the rising and falling daily flow hydrograph 3 model calibration and validation 3 1 reservoir disabled clhms model the clhms model with the reservoir scheme disabled is calibrated for 1961 1980 and validated for 1981 1999 the daily streamflow data of three hydrological stations were collected for calibration and validation which are located on the three largest tributaries that drain into the poyang lake namely waizhou a meigang b and lijiadu c see fig 2a the streambed conductivity and manning s roughness are two controlling parameters of surface flow and subsurface flow in the clhms model and were therefore selected for calibration other parameters such as porosity and aquifer thickness that depict the moisture distribution beneath the land surface however are insensitive as indicated by our previous sensitivity analysis in dong et al 2019b and thus excluded from calibration in this study regarding calibration procedure for each station 2000 parameter sets were randomly generated from the latin hypercube sampling and the parameter set with the highest value of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was selected as the optimal parameter values a detailed uncertainty analysis of the clhms model can be found in dong et al 2019b table 3 presents the calibration and validation results with relative bias pbias and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and fig 4 depicts the observed and simulated monthly streamflow at the three stations for the period of 1961 1999 it shows that the performance of the reservoir disabled clhms model is quite satisfactory with the nse of all stations for both periods over 0 85 it is also noted that for all of the three stations the nse in the validation period of 1981 1999 is lower than that in the calibration period of 1961 1980 this can be partially explained by the fact that most of the existing reservoirs in the plb were built and became fully operational only after the calibration period this means that the reservoir disabled clhms model is generally calibrated against the natural streamflow for 1961 1980 and is therefore unable to reproduce the impact of reservoirs on the streamflow in the validation period of 1981 1999 3 2 reservoir simulation with the reservoir enabled clhms model in this study the operation data are not available for most of the reservoirs in the plb and thus the q dmax and r values for each reservoir cannot be calibrated and were instead estimated as was described in section 2 3 to evaluate the performance of the reservoir enabled clhms model with the estimated q dmax and r we compared the simulated and the observed inflow outflow and water storage of two reservoirs the hongmen reservoir and the tuanjie reservoir note that the observed inflow outflow and storage of the two reservoirs are not used for calibration but for validation only fig 5 and fig 6 depict the daily simulated and observed inflow outflow and water storage of the two reservoirs respectively the inflow simulated by the reservoir enabled clhms generally matches the observation and the monthly nse values are 0 85 and 0 66 for the hongmen reservoir and the tuanjie reservoir respectively this indicates that the reservoir simulation with our reservoir enabled clhms model can be satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2007 however it should be noted in fig 6a that at a daily scale the nse value of the simulated inflow decreases to 0 43 for the tuanjie reservoir and multiple observed flood peaks e g in late 2016 are not well captured in the simulation one possible explanation is that the catchment of the tuanjie reservoir is as small as approximately 340 km2 yet the meteorological forcing of the model is at the resolution of 0 5 0 5 approximately 2500 km2 that is too coarse to accurately reproduce the observation for such a small catchment that being said the relatively higher nse value of the daily inflow simulation for the hongmen reservoir can be largely attributed to a larger catchment area of around 2300 km2 the inaccuracy of the simulated reservoir inflow can propagate to the simulated outflow and storage which could result in the comparably low daily nse values of the simulated outflow with 0 42 for the hongmen reservoir and 0 30 for the tuanjie reservoir respectively figs 5b 6b at a monthly scale however the results of the reservoir simulations remain satisfactory for both reservoirs with nse values both over 0 50 moriasi et al 2007 in addition the simulated water storage generally matches well with the observation for both reservoirs figs 5c 6c overall the results of figs 5 and 6 indicate that the reservoir enabled clhms model is generally able to represent the reservoir operation during a multi year period by capturing the variation of reservoir outflow and storage especially at a monthly scale moreover in comparison with the data driven operation rules that require considerable data for training testing and validating ehsani et al 2016 coerver et al 2018 yang et al 2019 our current reservoir module with the conceptual operation rules requires relatively little data this advantage leads to an effective compromise between modelling accuracy and data accessibility for regional scale research 3 3 streamflow simulation with the reservoir enabled clhms model to further validate the reservoir scheme the streamflow simulation of the reservoir enabled clhms model was performed and compared with that of the reservoir disabled clhms model with the reservoir scheme enabled the model is considered able to depict the impact of the existing reservoirs for the validation period with no re calibration performed for the original clhms model the nse values of the reservoir enabled clhms simulations are presented in table 4 at a daily scale the reservoir enabled model shows improved performance in comparison with the reservoir disabled model in section 3 1 as the nse values of the simulated daily streamflow increase for all of the three stations the matched pair t test cai et al 2019 was further applied to the reservoir disabled and reservoir enabled streamflow series to investigate the significance of the improvement in the streamflow simulation notably the results indicate that such improvement is significant at the 0 05 level at the daily scale for all of the three stations at a monthly scale the streamflow simulation also sees an improvement at waizhou station and lijiadu station overall the model exhibits improved performance in streamflow simulation for the plb by enabling the reservoir scheme in addition to well reproducing dynamics of the selected reservoirs in the basin section 3 2 it indicates that the reservoir enabled clhms model with our newly developed reservoir scheme allows quantifying the hydrological impact of reservoirs in the plb it is also worth noting that the improved streamflow with the reservoir enabled clhms model which has already been coupled to the genesis land surface scheme could possibly result in a better parameterization of land surface models lsm and improve the land surface fluxes and feedbacks to the atmosphere when further coupling to an atmospheric model yassin et al 2019 4 hydrological impact of reservoir network layout simulations of eight reservoir network layouts table 1 were conducted at a daily modeling timestep over the plb for the period of 1981 1999 the impact of reservoir network layout on the hydrologic regime is quantitatively evaluated for the outlets of the three largest rivers in the plb namely gan river fu river and xin river and is here presented in the form of the monthly streamflow and the relative change in the iha parameters 4 1 existing reservoirs the existing reservoir network in the plb is a combination of small and large upstream and downstream mainstream and tributary reservoirs regulated for multiple purposes as shown in fig 7 the simulated multi year averaged monthly streamflow of the three rivers decreases by 5 2 throughout the wet season march to august and increases by 9 0 throughout the dry season september to february as compared to that for the no reservoir scenario index 1 12 in the right column similarly the maximum flows see a decrease while the minimum flows see an increase with the existing reservoirs as compared to that for the no reservoir scenario for the three rivers index 13 23 on the other hand the dates of maximum and minimum flows are generally postponed or remain unchanged index 24 25 the frequency of high pulses decreases by 1 9 4 5 for the three rivers whereas the low pulses are intensified and prolonged index 26 29 the daily flow variation is also mitigated by the reservoir operation with a 5 20 decrease in the rise rate fall rate and reversal count 4 2 alternative reservoir capacity distribution the impact of reservoir capacity distribution on the flow regime of the three rivers is depicted in fig 8 regarding the simulated multi year averaged monthly streamflow it is distributed more evenly throughout a year if all reservoirs are replaced by a few large ones see left column for the smaller reservoirs only the existing reservoirs and the larger reservoirs only scenarios the streamflow averaged for the three rivers increases by 9 5 12 6 and 15 6 in the dry season and decreases by 4 0 4 8 and 5 8 in the wet season respectively index 1 12 in the right column similarly the maximum minimum flows decrease increase more significantly for a few larger reservoirs as compared to many smaller reservoirs index 13 23 with many smaller reservoirs replaced by a few larger ones the dates of maximum and minimum flows are generally postponed index 24 25 and the flow regime is generally characterized by less frequent and shorter low pulses and less frequent but prolonged high pulses index 26 29 the rise rate fall rate and reversal count are more significantly reduced by larger reservoirs 4 3 alternative reservoir locations fig 9 depicts the impact of reservoir locations on the downstream flow regime of the three rivers for the gan river and xin river the monthly streamflow of the three rivers is increased in the dry season and decreased in the wet season more significantly with upstream reservoirs and existing reservoirs despite that the discrepancies are minor between the three scenarios index 1 12 in the right column the maximum minimum flows see a slightly larger decrease increase for reservoirs located further upstream of the gan river and xin river index 13 17 on the other hand the results of the fu river are in many cases inconsistent with those of the gan river and xin river compare fig 9b with a and c which reveal that locating reservoirs downstream would slightly more effectively increase the streamflow in the dry season decrease the streamflow in the wet season reduce the maximum flows and increase the minimum flows index 1 23 for all three rivers there is no significant variation or clear pattern for the dates of maximum and minimum flows high pulses and low pulses when relocating the reservoirs upstream or downstream index 24 29 this is also the case for the daily flow variation with no clear change in the rise rate fall rate and reversal count index 30 32 4 4 alternative reservoir inflow fig 10 depicts the impact of reservoir mean inflow on the downstream flow regime of the three rivers in general the intra annual flow variability is reduced most significantly with reservoirs with higher mean inflow see left column for all of the three rivers reservoirs with higher mean inflow can reduce the streamflow in the wet season increase the streamflow in the dry season reduce the annual maximum flows and increase the minimum flows more significantly than those with lower mean inflow index 1 23 in the right column reservoirs with higher inflow can postpone or maintain similar dates of the minimum flow and maximum flow relative to those with lower inflow index 24 25 reservoirs with higher inflow also induce more low pulses whereas the number of high pulses and the duration of high pulses and low pulses see no significant change index 26 29 the discrepancies in the rise rate and fall rate are negligible between the scenarios while the reversal count increases by 7 0 for reservoirs with higher inflow as compared to those with lower inflow index 30 32 4 5 combined results reservoir capacity distribution with different mean inflow in section 4 2 the impact of reservoir capacity distribution was evaluated under the same inflow condition to further evaluate the impact of reservoir capacity distribution under different mean inflow conditions we selected part of results from the reservoir capacity distribution section 4 2 and the reservoir mean inflow section 4 4 for a joint analysis fig 11 compares the higher inflow scenario i e existing reservoirs with higher mean inflow and larger reservoirs only scenario i e existing reservoirs aggregated to a few larger ones for the three rivers with the larger reservoirs only scenario as the reference see the red circle in fig 11b results reveal that the values of indexes 1 23 are similar between the two scenarios in particular for the gan river and fu river indicating that the two reservoir network layouts have similar abilities to increase the streamflow in the dry season decrease the streamflow in the wet season reduce the annual maximum flows and increase the minimum flows on the other hand more frequent high pulses and low pulses and higher rise rate fall rate and reversal count are noted for the higher inflow scenario as compared to the larger reservoirs scenario for all of the three rivers index 28 32 5 discussion the existing reservoir network in the plb has been continuously built since decades ago to increase the resiliency of the local economy against the spatiotemporal variation of water resources in this area our reservoir modelling results confirm that the reservoirs in the plb are able to serve as a useful tool to reduce the variability of water resources throughout a year by displacing the excessive water resources in the wet season to the dry season which is in line with multiple other regional scale studies lauri et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 räsänen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 ngo et al 2018 wen et al 2018 these reservoirs also show a strong ability to control floods and relieve droughts zhang et al 2014 räsänen et al 2017 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 the variations of other flow characteristics in the plb are also noted including later or similar dates of maximum and minimum flows ehsani et al 2016 lu et al 2018 an increased frequency and duration for low pulses a decreased frequency for high pulses ehsani et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 lu et al 2018 and a lower variability of daily flow ehsani et al 2016 lu et al 2018 however our simulations also exhibit few results different from those of the existing literature for example an observation based study of zhang et al 2017 reported a generally increased frequency of high pulses and an alternating increase and decrease in the variability of daily flow for the miyun reservoir beijing this reveals the complexity of real time reservoir operation given that the miyun reservoir is operated dynamically for multi objectives for example accounting for the fluctuating water demands of beijing city which is difficult to be parameterized with simple conceptual rules 5 1 reservoir capacity distribution reservoirs vary significantly in size and large ones can have considerably different hydrological ecological and socioeconomic impacts from small ones scudder 2012 in this study our findings suggest that a few larger reservoirs would be able to reduce the intra annual variability of water resources and mitigate hydrologic extremes for the downstream areas more effectively than a large group of smaller reservoirs and a combination of small and large reservoirs that share a same total capacity and same total mean inflow accordingly a decision maker standing on the viewpoint of effective water resources management may find relatively large reservoirs a preferred choice ehsani et al 2016 2017 this is particularly relevant for the plb as most of the small reservoirs were built around 40 years ago and many of them were classified non functional or hazardous with pending removal or reconstruction where practical replacing them with larger ones would likely be an effective solution to improve their ability to regulate the flow regime for the downstream area a few larger reservoirs also have some advantages over smaller ones from the ecological viewpoint given that the baseflow which is a key constraint on the aquatic communities wang et al 2018 increases most effectively with larger reservoirs a large group of smaller reservoirs would also decrease the river connectivity and create barriers for migration of organisms and nutrients lu et al 2018 however replacing small reservoirs with larger ones also brings disadvantages for example it is noted that a few large reservoirs can more significantly reduce the frequency of high pulses than many smaller reservoirs which are disadvantageous to the transfer of nutrient and organic substances thereby posing a challenge for aquatic species to locate a spawning area for recruitment and causing a decrease in the abundance of aquatic species hu et al 2008 a larger decrease in the daily flow variability with larger reservoirs may entrap organisms on the islands and floodplains as compared to smaller reservoirs the nature conservancy 2009 in addition most large reservoirs are deep enough to develop thermal stratification which can disrupt the thermal regime and affects the growth of aquatic organisms poff and hart 2002 from the engineering viewpoint construing smaller reservoirs can also be more practical than construing larger ones due to the lower cost and more scattered geographical distribution of smaller reservoirs which makes it convenient for them to meet the water demand locally with no extra need of pumping and transferring the water resources across the drainage network potter 2006 mushtaq et al 2007 5 2 reservoir locations decision makers often need to weigh up multiple potential reservoir building sites that share similar inflow conditions by moving reservoirs to the downstream and upstream areas without changing the mean inflow we found that different reservoir locations with similar mean inflow conditions have a relatively minor impact on the flow regime in the plb as many of the iha indexes show relatively minor variations although locating reservoirs upstream for gan and xin river would slightly strengthen the capability of reservoirs in the monthly flow regulation flood control and drought relief the inconsistent results for the fu river imply that the impacts of reservoir locations can actually be case dependent given the findings for the three rivers the reservoir location may not need to be an important consideration in the general case if the main focus is to address the monthly variability of water resources and the hydrologic extremes for the downstream area in the case of the plb on the other hand it nevertheless can be more reasonable to locate reservoirs upstream for gan and xin river and to locate reservoirs downstream for the fu river however it should be noted that any current decisions on the removal reconstruction and planning of reservoirs should also incorporate the climate change impact in the near future ehsani et al 2017 for example climate change is expected to bring about more severe droughts in the upper gan river as indicated in our recent research dong et al 2019a and locating reservoirs upstream of the gan river would exactly help to more effectively relieve the future droughts both locally and regionally with respect to the ecosystem locating reservoirs either upstream or downstream can have case dependent impacts with both advantages and disadvantages as noted in section 5 1 such impacts on the ecosystem are relatively minor for different reservoir locations as compared to the reservoir capacity distribution 5 3 reservoir mean inflow many humid regions are characterized by a high density of the river network for example the density of river network can reach up to 1 5 km km2 in the plb zhang et al 2011 and in a small area there could be multiple suitable river reaches with different mean annual runoff to build reservoirs in this case our results reveal that higher mean inflow of reservoirs indicates greater functionality of these reservoirs to regulate the monthly variability of water resources and the hydrologic extremes in the downstream areas although it indicates a decrease in the ratio of capacity to inflow or the degree of regulation grill et al 2014 accordingly decision makers may find that assigning reservoirs higher inflow is a reasonable choice when focusing on balancing the downstream water resources in dry seasons and in wet seasons and the negative impact of hydrologic extremes this implies that it can be more reasonable to place new reservoirs in a cascade mode in the mainstream rather than in a parallel mode across the tributaries also aging reservoirs located in river reaches with higher runoff can be given priority for expansion and reconstruction in view of their higher effectiveness in flow regulation our findings further generalize the conclusions of liu et al 2019 the increased flood control benefit can be a result of the increased mean inflow when moving the reservoir from the upper to lower mainstream of the yalong river rather than the reservoir location being closer to the outlet as was noted in section 5 1 reservoirs with higher inflow can also have ecological benefits due to the larger increase in the low flows on the other hand the increase in the frequency of low pulses can influence soil moisture anaerobic stress and the availability of floodplain habitats in a favorable way for some species but an unfavorable way for others graf 2006 5 4 joint analysis reservoir capacity distribution with different mean inflow the results and discussion of reservoir capacity distribution in sections 4 2 and 5 1 suggest that a few larger reservoirs can deal with the intra annual variability of water resources and the hydrologic extremes more effectively than a large number of smaller reservoirs with a same total capacity and same total inflow however this may not hold true if these larger reservoirs receive considerably less total inflow than the smaller reservoirs because less inflow indicates less effectiveness in the flow regulation as suggested by the results and discussion of reservoir mean inflow in sections 4 4 and 5 3 the further comparison of simulations between the higher inflow scenario and the larger reservoirs only scenario fig 11 suggests that by increasing the mean total inflow of smaller reservoirs by around 30 a large number of smaller reservoirs are likely to have a similar or even stronger ability in the flow regulation as compared to a few larger reservoirs especially for the gan river and fu river this can be informative to relevant hydrological modelling research which quantifies the impact of a large number of small reservoirs by means of aggregating them into one large reservoir downstream e g in güntner et al 2004 malveira et al 2011 and wang et al 2018 our findings suggest that the impact of small reservoirs can be well represented by the aggregation of small reservoirs only if these small reservoirs receive sufficiently higher inflow than the aggregated large reservoir in these studies otherwise the impact of small reservoirs can be overestimated due to the aggregation also our findings further generalize the results of ehsani et al 2016 a single large reservoir may not always be more effective than a number of small reservoirs if the small reservoirs receive sufficiently higher inflow than the large one combining the findings of reservoir capacity distribution and mean inflow decision makers focusing on the flow regulation may instead shift attention to smaller reservoirs if it is possible to assign them sufficiently high inflow in addition our findings suggest that a few larger reservoirs reduce the number of high pulses and low pulses and the daily flow variability much more significantly than a large number of small reservoirs with sufficiently high mean inflow which could give smaller reservoirs additional ecological benefits as indicated in section 5 1 5 5 research limitations our comprehensive analysis may help the decision makers to achieve a trade off for reservoir capacity distribution locations and mean inflow conditions thereby leading to more sustainable water resources planning and management in the plb in view of the large extent of study area and the large number of reservoirs included in this study our findings also have the potential to be generalized and applied in different climate regions worldwide however it should be noted that our findings are based on generalized conceptual operation rules which can be a considerable simplification of the real reservoir operation real time decisions of reservoir operation often need to assimilate the information on the inflow forecast changing multi sectoral demands potential risks and manual experiences yang et al 2019 assimilation of such frequently updated information induces uncertainties in the reservoir operation and poses a challenge to reconstruct actual operation rules from historical observations wu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 if sufficient reservoir operation data are available operation rules derived from machine learning approaches such as artificial neural network may be able to reconstruct comparably accurate operation rules ehsani et al 2016 coerver et al 2018 yang et al 2019 however the black box nature of machine learning based approaches may diminish their ability to provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of reservoir operation which may mask the potential defects in an established neural network model yassin et al 2019 even if the actual operation rules are available the reservoir inflow simulated in hydrological models is nevertheless subject to uncertainties and bias which would eventually propagate to the simulation of reservoir operation for these reasons it is unlikely that the model based approaches can depict the hydrological impact of reservoirs on a regional scale with a perfect accuracy regardless of these uncertainties the validation of the reservoir enabled clhms model indicates that the clhms model coupled with our reservoir scheme and operation rules can serve as a useful tool to reproduce the altered hydrology in reservoir regulated basins and subsequent findings on the hypothetical reservoir scenarios can be informative with respect to the hydrologic alteration induced by the reservoirs network moreover the uncertainties related to operation rules are likely to be cancelled out in the comparison between multiple reservoir network layout scenarios because reservoirs are operated in the same way under different scenarios in this study accordingly we believe that our approaches including the distributed hydrologic model reservoir scheme and scenario design have the potential to provide useful instructions for the water resources planning and management across different regions worldwide 6 conclusions this paper aims to evaluate and compare the impact of the existing and alternative reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime in the poyang lake basin it was motivated by the fact that the water resources in this region are regulated intensively by a high density reservoir network with potential removal reconstruction and planning of reservoirs the variation in the hydrologic regime induced by the existing reservoir network and seven hypothetical reservoir network layouts were simulated by a coupled land surface hydrologic model clhms fully coupled with a reservoir scheme and were further analysed using the indicators of hydrologic alteration with the validated reservoir enabled clhms model we found that the existing reservoir network in the plb is able to provide resiliency against the intra annual variability of water resources and the hydrologic extremes for sustainable economic development to be specific these reservoirs can effectively displace the excessive water resources in the wet season to the dry season mitigate the flood peaks and increase the low flows maintain or postpone the dates of maximum and minimum flow increase the frequency and duration of low pulses decrease the frequency of high pulses and lower the daily flow variations furthermore the analysis on the hydrologic simulations of the hypothetical reservoir scenarios indicates that despite a same total capacity the impact of different reservoir network layouts can vary significantly with conclusions highlighted as follows replacing a large group of smaller reservoirs with a few larger ones with a same total capacity and total mean inflow can enhance the effectiveness of reservoirs in displacing the excessive streamflow in the wet season to the dry season and mitigating flood and drought conditions the much more increased low flows due to larger reservoirs is a major advantage over smaller reservoirs to the ecosystem whereas larger reservoirs also induce a larger decrease in the frequency of high pulses and in the daily flow variations which can be disadvantageous to the riverine ecosystem locating reservoirs to a different place with similar mean inflow is unlikely to significantly diminish or enhance their ability to balance the water resources in dry and wet seasons and to mitigate the hydrologic extremes in general the downstream flow regime is relatively insensitive to the reservoir location than the reservoir capacity distribution and mean inflow and different reservoir locations have a relatively minor ecological impact assigning reservoirs higher mean inflow can be a preferred choice to cope with the intra annual variability of water resources and the hydrologic extremes in this aspect it can be more reasonable to place reservoirs in a cascade mode in the mainstream rather than in a parallel mode across the tributaries and to give priority to aging reservoirs located in river reaches with higher runoff for expansion and reconstruction in view of their higher effectiveness in flow regulation due to the increased low flows reservoirs with higher mean inflow can provide additional ecological benefits over those with lower inflow whereas the increased frequency of low pulses can bring about both positive and negative ecological impacts a large number of smaller reservoirs with sufficiently higher total mean inflow are likely to be more effective in the flow regulation than a single larger reservoir in this case smaller reservoirs can also provide some additional ecological benefits than a single larger one because the number of high pulses and low pulses and the daily flow variability are reduced not significantly as in a larger one reservoir removal reconstruction and planning are capital intensive and require comprehensive analysis on the pros and cons while socioeconomic impacts engineering practicability climate change and local water demand often have to weigh in the decisions on the removal reconstruction or planning of reservoirs this study drew some conclusions with a main focus on the effective flow regulation and sustainable riverine ecosystem using the coupled land surface hydrologic model reservoir scheme and scenario design in this study the impact of reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime was quantitatively evaluated in the plb for more effective water resources planning and management the plb is a typical example of heavily reservoir regulated large scale catchments around the globe where a similarly high density reservoir network can be regularly found across china wang et al 2018 united states ehsani et al 2017 and europe wagner et al 2019 therefore with the local climatological and socio economic conditions taken into account our methodologies and findings have the potential to be generalized beyond the plb to provide ecohydrological instructions for regional water resources planning and management in many other reservoir regulated basins in particular our proposed modelling framework of the hydrologic model reservoir scheme and scenario design can be applied in a regionally adapted manner to similar catchments in further regions worldwide credit authorship contribution statement ningpeng dong conceptualization methodology software writing original draft mingxiang yang supervision funding

5508,this study investigated the scaling characteristics of daily rainfall time series over india and their spatio temporal variability using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis mf dfa method in the study fine resolution gridded 1ox1o dataset of daily rainfall for the period 1951 2016 was used for the analysis the scaling characterization using mf dfa shows that rainfall data of most of the grid points over 87 display short term persistence the analysis of spatial variability of multifractal characteristics shows that the multifractal strength is strongest in the western and central india while the strength is the lowest in the north east region further the evaluation of multifractal properties of rainfall time series of pre and post 1976 77 period of pacific climate shift shows that there is a clear reduction in the multifractal strength and complexity for the post 1976 77 with contrasting behavior for the persistence finally the association of daily rainfall with mean maximum minimum temperature values and the diurnal temperature range dtr time series of the 1951 2016 period were investigated using multifractal detrended cross correlation analysis mf dcca the nature and strength of association between the two variables of rainfall and temperature differs with time scales and it was found that the joint persistence of these variables lies between individual persistence property there is a distinct difference in the persistence cross correlation properties at the peninsular region and coastal belts when compared with other regions in india and the difference is most perceptible in the tmin rainfall link keywords rainfall temperature multifractal correlation climate shift 1 introduction the estimation of local fluctuations of hydrologic time series is one of the challenging problems in hydrologic time series analysis in 1970s the researchers identified fractal behavior of time series which is the property of a fragmental geometrical object that can be subdivided into parts each of which is a reduced size copy of the whole mandelbrot 1982 over the years a large number of methods evolved for estimation of fractality of time series data they include double trace moments tessier et al 1996 fourier spectral analysis hurst 1965 pandey et al 1998 extended self similarity ess principles dahlstedt and jensen 2005 wavelet transform modulus maxima wtmm kantelhardt et al 2003 arbitrary order hilbert spectral analysis aohsa huang et al 2009 adarsh et al 2018 peng et al 1994 proposed an efficient method namely detrended fluctuation analysis dfa to perform the fractal analysis based on a detrending procedure kantelhardt et al 2002 proposed the multifractal extension of dfa procedure popularly known as multifractal dfa mf dfa for hydrological time series the multifractal description can be regarded as a fingerprint of the time series and it serves as an efficient nontrivial test bed for the performance of state of the art rainfall runoff models kantelhardt et al 2006 description of multifractal behavior of daily rainfall fields was one of the major domains of research among hydrologists in the past two decades and the researchers used a multitude of techniques for such analysis olsson and niemczynowicz 1996 tessier et al 1996 kantelhardt et al 2003 yu et al 2014 krzyszczak et al 2018 garcia marin et al 2019 in one seminal work by kantelhardt et al 2006 the authors investigated the multifractal behavior of 99 long term daily precipitation records and 42 long term daily runoff records from different parts of the world they found that the precipitation generally shows short term persistence and runoff time series show long term persistence with a mean scaling exponent of 0 73 for runoff and 0 53 for precipitation records the development of mf dfa method was a major breakthrough in the multifractal characterization of rainfall fields yu et al 2014 tan and gan 2017 krzyszczak et al 2018 even though several studies performed fractal analysis employing mf dfa procedure worldwide according to the authors knowledge no comprehensive study on the multifractality of rainfall time series of india and the spatio temporal variability of the multifractal parameters are reported rainfall is a complex phenomenon gets resulted from the favorable conditions of a large number of meteorological variables like temperature humidity wind velocity and large scale circulations being a multiscale process understanding the teleconnections of rainfall with such variables in different time scales will be giving better insights to the associated physical processes adarsh and janga 2016 multifractal theory is a useful alternative to investigate such teleconnections of non stationary time series in multiple time scales detrended cross correlation analysis dcca proposed by podobnik and stanley 2008 was one of the initial attempts to investigate cross correlations between two dependent time series signals of non stationary characteristics its multifractal extension namely mf dcca proposed by zhou 2008 which involves a procedure quite similar to the mf dfa algorithm except for the capability to handle two candidate series simultaneously the method could gain wide popularity in the analysis of hydro meteorological time series e g hajian and movahed 2010 wu et al 2018 dey and mujumdar 2018 however so far no study reported the rainfall temperature cross correlations in a multifractal framework in view of the above review the specific objectives of this paper can be stated as i to determine multiftactal properties of daily gridded rainfall data of india and to investigate their spatio temporal changes ii to investigate the cross correlation between rainfall and four temperature time series minimum maximum mean and diurnal temperature range dtr using the mf dcca method in section 2 the overall framework followed and algorithms of methodologies used in the study are described in section 3 the details of study area and data are presented in section 4 the results supporting the stated objectives of the study are presented section 5 presents the possible applications and scope for future studies and in the final section important conclusions of the study are presented 2 materials and methods this study firstly provides a generalized framework which can be followed for multifractal analysis of any two correlated time series the potential of mf dfa can be used for the detection of multifractality of the time series of concern and the information on scaling behaviour and the parameters obtained may eventually help for performing multifractal modelling cadenas et al 2019 apart from the above analysing the spatio temporal variability of the prominent multifractal parameters may help in capturing the significant changes in persistence or multifractal properties over different time spells which in turn may infer non stationarity of the time series subsequently non stationarity modelling approaches can be followed to get promising results against the modelling with stationarity assumptions the detection of multifractality will help to investigate the mutual association between two correlated time series in multiple time scales in a multifractal perspective using robust methods like mf dcca the procedure followed in this study involves the conjunctive use of two popular and widely accepted methods like mfdfa and mf dcca for getting improved understanding of the rainfall characteristics of indian subcontinent and for getting new insights into the rainfall temperature cross correlations in short the methodology followed is a general one the algorithms used are well accepted by the scientific community and it can be applied for any complex time series datasets irrespective of the regional differences the flowchart of the procedure followed is presented in fig 1 and the details of the mf dfa and mf dcca are provided in subsequent sections 2 1 multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis mf dfa mf dfa is a popular mathematical tool for detection of the scaling characteristics and multifractality of time series datasets the steps of mf dfa algorithm can be presented as given below kantelhardt et al 2002 li et al 2015 adarsh et al 2019 i for a time series x x1 x2 xn determine the cumulative deviation of the time series known as its profile 1 p i k 1 i x k x where i 1 2 n x and n are the mean and length of the time series ii subdivide the profile p i into n s int n s non overlapping segments of length s which is the segment sample size popularly called as scale and int refers the integer part as n needs not to be an integer multiple of s to avoid the possible exclusion of data points from the tail end of the series the division needs to be performed starting from the tail end also which will lead to a total of 2ns segments in the calculations iii estimate the local trend for each of the 2ns segments by the method of least squares kantelhardt et al 2006 2 f 2 s ν 1 s i 1 s p ν 1 s i p ν i 2 f o r υ 1 2 n s and 3 f 2 s ν 1 s i 1 s p n ν n s s i p ν i 2 f o r υ n s 1 2 n s here pυ i is the fitting polynomial of any appropriate order in segment υ iv find out the fluctuation function ff for any generic statistical moment order q as follows 4 f q s 1 2 n s ν 1 2 n s f 2 s ν q 2 1 q here any real value except zero can be assigned to the moment order q for the zeroth moment order ff can be computed by a logarithmic averaging procedure as given below kantelhardt et al 2002 5 f 0 s exp 1 4 n s ν 1 2 n s ln f 2 s ν v determine the scaling characteristics of the ffs for different moment orders by analysing the logarithmic plots of fq s versus s fq s bears the relation fq s sh q if the time series is power law correlated the power h q is designated as generalized hurst exponent ghe for stationary time series 0 h q 2 less than 1 is identical to the classical hurst exponent h if 0 5 h 1 the time series possess long term persistence long memory if 0 h 0 5 the time series possess short term persistence short memory and if h 0 5 the time series is uncorrelated long term persistence implies a positive auto correlation in the time series i e the effect of an observation on future observations remains significant for a long period of time the selection of scale s range the type of polynomial chosen etc are some of the key issues while applying the mf dfa method their appropriate selection involves a trial and error procedure and some thumb rules can be found in literature ihlen 2012 wang et al 2016 the hurst exponent h q 2 basically helps to comment on persistence of the time series while the derived exponents such as q order mass exponent τ q and singularity exponent α helps to comment on the multifractality of the time series these exponents can be mathematically calculated as li et al 2015 6 τ q q h q 1 7 α d τ q dq and 8 f α q α τ q where the plot of f α vs α is called as the singularity spectrum the base width of the spectrum δ α α max α min depicts the degree of multifractality domf of the time series a wider singularity spectrum indicates a higher domf and vice versa if the time series is multifractal the singularity spectrum will be an inverted parabola asymmetry index r is another useful parameter for multifractal analysis derived from the shape of the multifractal spectrum drożdż and oświecimka 2015 9 r δ α left δ α right δ α left δ α right where δ α left α 0 α min and δ α right α max α 0 are respectively the width of left and right hand wings of the multifractal spectrum their values describe the distribution patterns of high and low fluctuations and α 0 is the singularity exponent known as holder exponent for q 0 r ranges from 1 to 1 r 0 represents a symmetrical multifractal spectrum r 0 suggests a left hand deviation of the multifractal spectrum resulted from the time series with local high fluctuations r less than 0 suggests a right hand deviation with local low fluctuations 2 2 multifractal detrended cross correlation analysis mf dcca in order to quantify the inter relationships between different hydro meteorological variables different statistical measures are used out of which most popular and simplest one is the pearson correlation coefficient however the robustness of this coefficient is debatable in the presence of outliers and if the data is of non linear and non stationarity in character piao and fu 2016 for the real field data which often possess non linear and non stationarity characteristics spurious correlation may be reported as they always characterized by trend because of this an estimation measure supported by the detrending operation such as mf dcca is advisable the different steps involved in mf dcca computational procedure can be described as follows i for two time series x i of y i and i 1 2 n determine the profiles as 10 x k k 1 i x k x 11 y k k 1 i y k y where i 1 n and x and y are the means of two time series ii divide x k and y k into n s non overlapping segments thus 2n s segments are obtained iii calculate the local trend of x k and y k for each of 2ns segments and determine the covariance 12 f dcca 2 s i 1 s k i i n x k x y k y iv calculate detrended covariance by summing over all overlapping segments of length as 13 f s 1 2 n s i 1 2 n s f dcca 2 s i 1 2 f s behaves as a power law function of s the scaling behavior where s is the segmental sample size as f s sλ q the cross correlation exponent λ q designed as scaling exponent can be obtained by deriving the slope of log log plot of f s versus s by the method of least squares cross correlation coefficient is defined as the ratio between the detrended covariance function f dccaxy and the detrended variance functions f dfax and f dfay as zebende 2011 vassoler and zebende 2012 oświecimka et al 2014 kwapień et al 2015 14 ρ dcca f dccaxy f dfax f dfay theoretically the value of ρdcca ranges as 1 ρdcca 1 the values range between 0 666 to 1 0 333 to 0 666 0 to 0 333 show respectively strong positive negative medium and weak cross correlations brito et al 2018 3 study area and database the daily gridded rainfall time series at 1ox1o resolution one time series over each cell for the period 1951 2016 received from india meteorological department imd were used in the present study a total of 286 grid points where long and continuous data were available and identified for performing the analysis brief statistics of the rainfall of different grid points are given in table 1 the spatial variability of multifractality was investigated by considering five rainfall homogeneous regions in india the non overlapping rainfall homogeneous regions have been defined by indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm pune the five regions include north west india nwi south peninsular india spi north east india nei central north east india cnei and western central india wci these regions are defined by rainfall homogeneity by grouping the different meteorological subdivisions the map showing rainfall homogeneous regions in india is presented in fig 2 for investigating the cross correlation of rainfall with temperature time series 1ox1o gridded extreme temperature tmax and tmin mean temperature tmean and diurnal temperature range tdtr which is the difference between maximum and minimum temperature values datasets at the same period 1951 2016 were used in this study 4 results and discussion this section first presents the results of mfdf analysis of daily rainfall time series of different grid points along with the spatial variability to examine the temporal change in multifractal properties of rainfall the time series was partitioned into two periods with respect to the well recognized global climatic shift of 1976 77 and the results of mf analysis of the pre and post 1976 77 periods are presented here subsequently the results of mf dcca between four different pairs of temperature rainfall time series are presented 4 1 spatial variability of multifractal properties of rainfall the mfdf analysis of daily gridded rainfall data for 1951 to 2016 was performed by considering a moment order of 4 to 4 drożdż et al 2019 it should be noted that long and consecutive zero values are present in each grid points and with percentage varies between 44 and 92 in different grids table 1 this needs special attention while performing mf dfa analysis to avoid any possible conclusions on long term persistency in the datasets which may be a spurious and erroneous interpretation to avoid any possible bias or misinterpretations because of the long and consecutive zero values in the records the minimum scale was chosen greater than the longest stretch of consecutive zero values in each time series drożdż et al 2019 different multifractal parameters like hurst exponent the spread of generalized hurst exponent plot δh q spectral width holder exponent α0 asymmetry index r difference between singularity spectrum plot δf α etc were determined for all identified 286 grid points over india the spatial distributions of different multifractal parameters of rainfall data are presented in fig 3 the pdf and cdf of the parameters were estimated using the non parametric kernel density estimator and presented in fig 4 fig 3 shows that the persistence and multifractal behavior of rainfall data is evident in gridded rainfall data of india in most of the grid points over 87 the hurst exponent h values are less than 0 5 indicating short term persistency the mean value of hurst exponent was found to be 0 385 which is also in line with the short term persistency of rainfall records of different parts of the globe reported earlier kantelhardt et al 2006 yu et al 2014 to evaluate the degree of multifractality δh q values were estimated higher value of δh q indicates a steeper ghe plot in which variability in the distribution of high and low fluctuations is increased and the time series will be more complex and heterogeneous hou et al 2018 similar inference can also be made from the values of spectral width the higher values of spectral width infer the high degree of multifractality the mean value of δh q spectral width was found to be 0 498 and 0 873 in about 55 of the grid points the value of δh q was found to be less than 0 5 the spectral width of majority of the points about 74 lies in the range 0 5 to 1 this may be because the rainfall process in india is highly intermittent and the time series of rainfall contains long and continuous zero values about 94 of rainfall data have positive asymmetry index r value which suggests left hand deviation with local low fluctuations the negative value of asymmetry index was noted in the hilly terrains of northern india and few localized grids the value of holder exponent α0 indicates the complexity of the time series and in this study the mean value of holder exponent was found to be 0 44 interestingly the values of holder exponent and hurst exponent were well correlated with correlation value of 0 968 this is in agreement with the association between the two parameters reported by burgueño et al 2014 for the temperature time series the difference between maximum and minimum values of singularity δf α provides an estimate of the spread in changes in fractal patterns since δf α denotes the frequency ratio of the largest to the smallest fluctuations a positive value of δf α means that the largest fluctuations are more frequent than smallest fluctuations the δf α value was positive in most of the regions and a negative value of δf α was noted only in the hilly terrains of the north and north eastern parts of india also to get an insight into multifractal property of rainfall data of different geographical regions the rainfall time series of all grid points were segregated into that of five rainfall homogeneous regions a total of 60 67 50 69 and 40 grid points were identified respectively for the five rainfall homogeneous regions nwi cnei nei wci and pi the multifractal properties estimated by the mf dfa method were clustered into five groups and the pdfs and cdfs of different parameters were developed and presented in fig 5 the statistical properties of prominent multifractal parameters hurst exponent spectral width and holder exponent are presented in table 2 from fig 5 it is clear that the values and variability of hurst exponent and spectral width are high in the north west india nwi it is well evident that the rainfall magnitude in regions like rajasthan located in nwi india is so small and pattern is more predictable and homogeneous when compared to many of other regions of india also higher persistence is noted in the rainfall of nei region which receives higher amount of rainfall within a typical year the behavior of spread of ghe plot is in line with that of spectral width the values of holder exponent α0 which is indicative of data complexity is the highest in the nwi region and in the cnei also the rainfall pattern is complex in character no specific pattern could be noted from the asymmetry index and δf α of the rainfall data of different regions from table 2 it is noted that highest mean multifractal degree is noted in nwi and cnei and overall variability in multifractal degree is the highest in nei on considering all india ai the variability in spectral width is considerably low than that of complexity and hurst exponent it is further noted that the variability of the persistence is the lowest at pi and nwi in order to verify the universality of this relationship least square fit was made between hurst exponent and holder exponent for all india ai and the five homogeneous regions and scatter plots of the same are presented in fig 6 further the correlations between the two exponents are found to be 0 98 0 987 0 979 0 986 and 0 986 respectively for nwi cnei nei wci and pi the high value of correlation confirms the universal property in the association between two multifractal exponents of rainfall datasets of geographical locations of india 4 2 temporal variability of multifractal properties of rainfall to evaluate the temporal variability of the multifractal properties of rainfall the time series of each grid point were partitioned into two sub series with respect to the much debated pacific climate shift of 1976 77 miller et al 1994 it is well evident that the climatic shift influenced the pattern of indian summer monsoon considerably sahana et al 2015 the mfdfa was performed for the pre and post 1976 77 periods the pdfs and cdfs of different multifractal parameters of rainfall time series for pre and post 1977 pacific climatic shift are presented in fig 7 from fig 7 it is clear that the multifractality and persistenace heve been affected by the climate shift of 1977 it is evident that there is a clear decrease in spectral width for rainfall after 1977 indicating the decrease in multifractality while the persistence indicated by hurst exponent and the complexity indicated by the holder exponent have increased after this shift on quantifying this change it is noticed that 104 grid points showed a reduction persistance none of the grid points displayed a swithover from short term to long term while only three grids showed a swithover from long term to short term the complexity of 132 grids and spectral width of 174 61 grids grid points displayed a reduction the mean hurst exponnet was 0 351 and spectral width of 0 82 for the pre 1977 period while it was found to be 0 382 and 0 751 after the shift there was a marginal difference in the mean of the complexity 0 43 and 0 446 for the pre and post 1977 periods respectively the change in multifractal properties could also be connected with the change of the different multifractal properties of standardized precipitataion index spi time series of post 1976 77 period computed based on spatially averaged rainfall dataset adarsh et al 2019 but there is no such clear and consistent reduction in asymmetry index of rainfall time series of different grid points in certain grid points the spectral assymetry was changed from positive to negative and vice versa in certain other grid points i e there is no consistent increase or decrease in extremes at different grid points but it displays spatial diversity to investigate the change in multifractal properties the four temperature time series were analysed by partitianing the data and the results are presented in fig 8 the behaviour of temperature time series was quite contrasting to that of rainfall as for temperature also there is a clear reduction in persistence and multifractality after the climate shift of 1977 the increased urbanization might have a key role and it might have weakened the multifractality of the temperature time series by creating more irregular profiles and smoothening the time series karatasou and santamouris 2018 which in turn have severe influence on the multifractality of rainfall time series in the recent years the multifractal properties of rainfall could be linked with the physical mechanisms leading to the rainfall apart from the global parameters like terrestrial radiations and temperature the local factors like the latitude oceanic and atmospheric circulations topography and local processes may influence the multifractality of the rainfall time series the rainfall of india is highly intermittent in character which leads to high degree of multifractality also one cannot ignore the inextricable link between the precipitation and temperature of the region in the non linear multifractal character of these time series and such links in the multifractality were analyzed in this study using the detrended cross correlation analysis 4 3 mf dcca between rainfall and temperature time series the most readily and directly available meteorological variable influencing the rainfall process of the country is the temperature the temperature extremes and the diurnal temperature range have remarkable roles in rainfall process of india vinnarasi et al 2017 ross et al 2018 in this study the cross correlation between four temperature datasets of tmax tmean tdtr and tmin with rainfall were evaluated using the mf dcca method considering the maximum scale as complete length of the time series in order to avoid any possible inconsistency in estimation of the scaling exponents in order to get the reliable interpretations because of long and continuous zero values in the records the minimum scale was chosen much shorter than the longest stretch of consecutive zero values while performing the mf dcca figs 9 12 show the spatial distribution of scaling exponent and different correlation coefficients obtained by the dcca of rainfall and temperature time series the correlation coefficients at two spatial scales corresponding to 90 days termed as seasonal cross correlation and those corresponding to 365 days termed as annual cross correlation along with overall correlation were considered in this analysis similarly the individual scaling exponents of each variable along with the joint exponent were estimated for elucidating the persistence in different time series from the dcc analysis of tmax rainfall link it is noted that the scaling exponent of rainfall varies between 0 54 and 0 74 and that of maximum temperature varies between 0 8 and 0 99 and in all cases λ value of temperature is more than that of rainfall there is a dominancy of medium persistence 0 601 0 663 in the rainfall time series and such grid points are distributed in west central cnei and nwi the persistence values are relatively lower in the peninsular india even though all λ values are showing long term persistence very high and very low persistence of tmax time series are noticed in the eastern coast and north western regions respectively at all grid points the value of joint scaling exponent is nearly half of the scaling exponent of individual time series i e the joint persistence is in between the individual persistence of the candidate variables rainfall and temperature this is in agreement with the universal property proven by the researchers considering the sunspot streamflow linkages hajian and movahed 2010 except in the peninsular india and western coast the seasonal correlation is negative but at annual scale the negative correlation is displayed in the nwi and some parts of cnei and wci in the peninsular region and coastal belts of india in particular the rainfall tmax correlation is positive with relatively larger magnitude the influence of large scale climatic oscillations from indian ocean such as equatorial indian ocean oscillation arabian sea and bay of bengal could be linked with the rainfall and temperature conditions of the coastal belts overall negative association between rainfall and tmax also displays a similar spatial distribution pattern as that of annual cross correlation according to fig 10 it is evident that strong persistence of mean temperature exists in most of the regions and among which the strongest persistence is displayed at the coastal belts and peninsular india while the weakest persistence exists in the nwi in this case also for all grid points the joint persistence lies between that of rainfall and tmean time series the seasonal cross correlation is negative at all regions except some parts of peninsular india and upper himalaya at annual scale relatively higher correlations are noted in the tmean rainfall link when compared with the tmax rainfall link positive correlation up to 0 78 in this case also the strong positive correlations are clustered in the peninsular india and the coastal belts while negative association is noted only in the nwi and few localized grids of wci again the spatial distribution of overall correlation is identical to that of annual correlation except with a lesser magnitude in the correlations from fig 11 it is noted that for the dtr time series the strongest persistence is in the north west india in the spatial distribution of joint persistence the wci and cnei the eastern coast in particular display the highest persistence along with the nwi region the seasonal correlation and overall correlation are found to be negative except in the western himalayan and southern peninsular regions at annual scale also the positive correlation is noted only in these regions the temperature difference has distinctly different influence on the rainfall pattern when compared with other temperature time series the association between minimum temperature and rainfall is unique when compared with other links the strongest persistence property is noticed for the tmin time series minimum of 0 849 to maximum of 0 997 with a mean of 0 971 when compared with other three temperature time series the seasonal correlation is negative in the nwi and majority of the parts of nci and cnei there is a clear switchover in the nature and strength of association in the tmin rainfall link at annual scale it is also noted that some geographical regions of india the correlation changes from negative at seasonal scale to positive even 0 5 at annual scale the peninsular region and coastal belts of india display the highest persistence property the influence of which is reflected also in the mean temperature time series see fig 10 peninsular region of india is bounded by the bay of bengal in the east indian ocean in the south and arabian sea in the west this oceanic proximity plays a dominant role in the precipitation of the country which is influenced by the temperature anomalies and local surface warming global and regional temperature and precipitation variability is influenced by enso phenomenon davey et al 2014 also it is well proven that other large scale atmospheric circulations such as quasi biennial oscillation qbo equatorial indian ocean oscillation equinoo north atlantic oscillation nao atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo etc are all playing major roles on seasonal rainfall the co existence of multiple oscillations also may modulate the process gadgil et al 2004 and one cannot separate the rainfall and near surface temperature states in india it is hard to find a universal pattern such as how the scaling exponents change with latitude altitude or distance from the coast yu et al 2014 also attributing the reason for multifractality to single indicator is quite impossible as the indian monsoon system is quite complex and many local processes and details like moisture terrain vegetation effects may influence the regional precipitation variations the pdfs and cdfs of dcca parameters of rainfall and four temperature time series links are presented in fig 13 considering the tmax rainfall link the mean values are 0 63 and 0 87 respectively for rainfall and tmax time series and the joint persistence lies between that of individual persistence with a mean of 0 76 for 234 grid points the seasonal correlation is negative and for 119 points annual correlation is negative it is found that almost 39 of ρannual values lay between 0 2 and 0 2 also 35 of ρannual values lay between 0 2 and 0 6 and remaining 26 of ρannual values lay between 0 6 and 0 2 except for 69 points the annual correlation is more than that of seasonal correlation while the overall correlation is positive for 150 points the relative magnitude of persistence of the rainfall tmax and joint persistence is clear from fig 11 and follows the universal property in their relative magnitudes hajian and movahed 2010 the scaling exponent of mean temperature varies between 0 83 and 0 99 the persistence of rainfall time series found to be less than that of temperature in all grid points with a mean of 0 63 and 0 95 respectively while the joint persistence is nearly half of individual persistence values with a mean of 0 78 in 79 the grid points 227 out of 286 the correlation is negative at seasonal scale while the correlation is positive at annual scale for 231 grid points 80 8 of grids except for 31 grid points annual correlation is greater than that of seasonal correlation also it is noted that for 55 of grids ρannual lies between 0 and 0 4 and for 15 grids the correlation lies between 0 4 and 0 8 for 208 grid points the overall correlation between rainfall and tmean is weakly positive and the overall mean correlation is found to be around 0 08 in the tdtr rainfall link it was found that the mean scaling exponent of temperature time series is around 0 87 and the mean value of joint persistence was found to be 0 75 in this case also for all grid points the joint persistence is between those of individual persistence of rainfall and temperature except for 17 grid points the overall correlation is negative with a mean of 0 237 similar response is noted for annual and seasonal correlations i e for 260 and 240 grid points the rainfall temperature association is negative at these time scales but annual correlation is strongly negative with overall mean of 0 89 while seasonal correlation is weakly negative with overall mean of 0 27 at annual time scale the positive correlation varies up to 0 49 while at seasonal scale it varies only up to 0 11 the scaling exponent of minimum temperature varies between 0 85 and 0 99 with a mean of 0 97 which infers very strong persistence the joint persistence clearly lies between the individual persistence with a mean scaling exponent of 0 8 interestingly the seasonal correlation was found to be negative in 210 grid points 73 4 of grid points with an overall mean value of 0 192 but at annual scale the correlation was strongly positive in 268 grid points out of 294 the mean correlation value is 0 426 with minimum of 0 21 and maximum of 0 8 this is a clear evidence of change in the scale dependent nature of association in the minimum temperature rainfall link in this case the overall correlation was also found to be positive in 263 grid points with a mean value of 0 156 varies between 0 05 and 0 46 5 discussion on applications and future scope this study examined the multifractal properties of daily rainfall field over india to get an insight into the complexity and persistence properties of the variable the spatio temporal variability of the multifractal properties adduced some interesting judgments and possible reasons for their diversity ascertaining the role of persistence is vital to the development of hydro meteorological studies and the changes in the persistence over the time spell should be investigated any significant change in the persistence may lead to erroneous predictions and the situation is quite analogous to the use of a stationarity assumption under a non stationary environment in a changing climate scenario the high degree of complexity and multifractality of rainfall in regions like nwi demands the multifractal modeling in such areas for specific applications the predictability could be well assessed by the persistence and the predictions in regions like nei this information could have an added value in devising new paradigms for accurate modeling of rainfall the temporal change in the properties of rainfall with respect to the pacific climatic shift is not supporting the urgent need of non stationary modeling in the country as a whole even though a reduction in complexity and multifractality along with an increase in persistence is noted in majority of the grid points however localized analysis using station wise data may give improved understanding on the modeling practices to be followed for the management of the water resources the rainfall temperature cross correlation studies in a multiscale multifractal framework provided remarkable insights in the behavior of rainfall in indian subcontinent the nature of association of each temperature time series with rainfall in india is quite different from that of the other despite these differences the persistence and correlation properties of the dataset of peninsular india and coastal belts show distinctly different behavior than the rest parts of the country more emphasis should be given on multifractal and non stationary frameworks for modeling hydrological variables in these regions which may eventually help in accurate management of the water resources understanding the multifractal properties of rainfall time series may help for multifractal modeling simulation and synthetic generation of rainfall fields de noising etc deidda et al 1999 deidda 1999 2000 serinaldi 2010 which are some promising domains for subsequent researches the scaling exponents can be used for derivation of intensity duration frequency curves by rainfall disaggregation veneziano and furcolo 2002 huang et al 2014 garcia marin et al 2019 the space time disaggregation of rainfall is a possible application for the scaling exponents developed deidda 2000 hubert 2001 pathirana et al 2007 potential applicability of decomposition methods such as wavelet transforms can be conjunctively used along with multifractal properties in the space time disaggregation studies nourani et al 2013 2017 roushangar et al 2019 the derived multifractal properties may help in performing the catchment classification or regionalization and subsequent predictions in ungauged basins by coupling with different clustering techniques sharghi et al 2018 baghanam et al 2019 to get a more comprehensive picture of the multifractal properties of rainfall fields similar studies can be performed using more fine resolution data say 0 25ox0 25 and cross correlations with other hydrological variables like station wise streamflow can be analyzed in a multifractal perspective this study provided an overall picture of multifractal characteristics of the rainfall and temperature datasets in india in depth studies using the real field datasets are highly recommended in coastal and peninsular india in particular while accepting the constraints on rainfall time series of longer stretch it is always advisable to perform similar studies using the real time datasets 6 conclusions in this study the multifractality of 1ox1o daily gridded rainfall fields over india was evaluated using mf dfa method and its link with the four different temperature datasets was investigated using the mf dcca method the daily gridded rainfall data of 87 grid points possessed short term persistence and most of the time series showed strong multifractal behavior the highest multifractal degree and persistence was noted in the nwi followed by nei where the rainfall pattern is more homogeneous in characteristics there is a clear reduction in multifractal degree of rainfall time series of india for the post 1976 77 pacific climatic shift period the joint persistence of rainfall and temperature was nearly half of the persistence of individual time series in all of the combinations of rainfall temperature linkages the nature and strength of cross correlation between temperature and rainfall displayed spatio temporal diversity the correlation properties between rainfall and temperature were unique in the peninsular and coastal belts of india when compared to other regions which could be attributed to the effect of large scale climatic circulations resulting from oceanic proximity credit authorship contribution statement s adarsh project administration

5508,this study investigated the scaling characteristics of daily rainfall time series over india and their spatio temporal variability using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis mf dfa method in the study fine resolution gridded 1ox1o dataset of daily rainfall for the period 1951 2016 was used for the analysis the scaling characterization using mf dfa shows that rainfall data of most of the grid points over 87 display short term persistence the analysis of spatial variability of multifractal characteristics shows that the multifractal strength is strongest in the western and central india while the strength is the lowest in the north east region further the evaluation of multifractal properties of rainfall time series of pre and post 1976 77 period of pacific climate shift shows that there is a clear reduction in the multifractal strength and complexity for the post 1976 77 with contrasting behavior for the persistence finally the association of daily rainfall with mean maximum minimum temperature values and the diurnal temperature range dtr time series of the 1951 2016 period were investigated using multifractal detrended cross correlation analysis mf dcca the nature and strength of association between the two variables of rainfall and temperature differs with time scales and it was found that the joint persistence of these variables lies between individual persistence property there is a distinct difference in the persistence cross correlation properties at the peninsular region and coastal belts when compared with other regions in india and the difference is most perceptible in the tmin rainfall link keywords rainfall temperature multifractal correlation climate shift 1 introduction the estimation of local fluctuations of hydrologic time series is one of the challenging problems in hydrologic time series analysis in 1970s the researchers identified fractal behavior of time series which is the property of a fragmental geometrical object that can be subdivided into parts each of which is a reduced size copy of the whole mandelbrot 1982 over the years a large number of methods evolved for estimation of fractality of time series data they include double trace moments tessier et al 1996 fourier spectral analysis hurst 1965 pandey et al 1998 extended self similarity ess principles dahlstedt and jensen 2005 wavelet transform modulus maxima wtmm kantelhardt et al 2003 arbitrary order hilbert spectral analysis aohsa huang et al 2009 adarsh et al 2018 peng et al 1994 proposed an efficient method namely detrended fluctuation analysis dfa to perform the fractal analysis based on a detrending procedure kantelhardt et al 2002 proposed the multifractal extension of dfa procedure popularly known as multifractal dfa mf dfa for hydrological time series the multifractal description can be regarded as a fingerprint of the time series and it serves as an efficient nontrivial test bed for the performance of state of the art rainfall runoff models kantelhardt et al 2006 description of multifractal behavior of daily rainfall fields was one of the major domains of research among hydrologists in the past two decades and the researchers used a multitude of techniques for such analysis olsson and niemczynowicz 1996 tessier et al 1996 kantelhardt et al 2003 yu et al 2014 krzyszczak et al 2018 garcia marin et al 2019 in one seminal work by kantelhardt et al 2006 the authors investigated the multifractal behavior of 99 long term daily precipitation records and 42 long term daily runoff records from different parts of the world they found that the precipitation generally shows short term persistence and runoff time series show long term persistence with a mean scaling exponent of 0 73 for runoff and 0 53 for precipitation records the development of mf dfa method was a major breakthrough in the multifractal characterization of rainfall fields yu et al 2014 tan and gan 2017 krzyszczak et al 2018 even though several studies performed fractal analysis employing mf dfa procedure worldwide according to the authors knowledge no comprehensive study on the multifractality of rainfall time series of india and the spatio temporal variability of the multifractal parameters are reported rainfall is a complex phenomenon gets resulted from the favorable conditions of a large number of meteorological variables like temperature humidity wind velocity and large scale circulations being a multiscale process understanding the teleconnections of rainfall with such variables in different time scales will be giving better insights to the associated physical processes adarsh and janga 2016 multifractal theory is a useful alternative to investigate such teleconnections of non stationary time series in multiple time scales detrended cross correlation analysis dcca proposed by podobnik and stanley 2008 was one of the initial attempts to investigate cross correlations between two dependent time series signals of non stationary characteristics its multifractal extension namely mf dcca proposed by zhou 2008 which involves a procedure quite similar to the mf dfa algorithm except for the capability to handle two candidate series simultaneously the method could gain wide popularity in the analysis of hydro meteorological time series e g hajian and movahed 2010 wu et al 2018 dey and mujumdar 2018 however so far no study reported the rainfall temperature cross correlations in a multifractal framework in view of the above review the specific objectives of this paper can be stated as i to determine multiftactal properties of daily gridded rainfall data of india and to investigate their spatio temporal changes ii to investigate the cross correlation between rainfall and four temperature time series minimum maximum mean and diurnal temperature range dtr using the mf dcca method in section 2 the overall framework followed and algorithms of methodologies used in the study are described in section 3 the details of study area and data are presented in section 4 the results supporting the stated objectives of the study are presented section 5 presents the possible applications and scope for future studies and in the final section important conclusions of the study are presented 2 materials and methods this study firstly provides a generalized framework which can be followed for multifractal analysis of any two correlated time series the potential of mf dfa can be used for the detection of multifractality of the time series of concern and the information on scaling behaviour and the parameters obtained may eventually help for performing multifractal modelling cadenas et al 2019 apart from the above analysing the spatio temporal variability of the prominent multifractal parameters may help in capturing the significant changes in persistence or multifractal properties over different time spells which in turn may infer non stationarity of the time series subsequently non stationarity modelling approaches can be followed to get promising results against the modelling with stationarity assumptions the detection of multifractality will help to investigate the mutual association between two correlated time series in multiple time scales in a multifractal perspective using robust methods like mf dcca the procedure followed in this study involves the conjunctive use of two popular and widely accepted methods like mfdfa and mf dcca for getting improved understanding of the rainfall characteristics of indian subcontinent and for getting new insights into the rainfall temperature cross correlations in short the methodology followed is a general one the algorithms used are well accepted by the scientific community and it can be applied for any complex time series datasets irrespective of the regional differences the flowchart of the procedure followed is presented in fig 1 and the details of the mf dfa and mf dcca are provided in subsequent sections 2 1 multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis mf dfa mf dfa is a popular mathematical tool for detection of the scaling characteristics and multifractality of time series datasets the steps of mf dfa algorithm can be presented as given below kantelhardt et al 2002 li et al 2015 adarsh et al 2019 i for a time series x x1 x2 xn determine the cumulative deviation of the time series known as its profile 1 p i k 1 i x k x where i 1 2 n x and n are the mean and length of the time series ii subdivide the profile p i into n s int n s non overlapping segments of length s which is the segment sample size popularly called as scale and int refers the integer part as n needs not to be an integer multiple of s to avoid the possible exclusion of data points from the tail end of the series the division needs to be performed starting from the tail end also which will lead to a total of 2ns segments in the calculations iii estimate the local trend for each of the 2ns segments by the method of least squares kantelhardt et al 2006 2 f 2 s ν 1 s i 1 s p ν 1 s i p ν i 2 f o r υ 1 2 n s and 3 f 2 s ν 1 s i 1 s p n ν n s s i p ν i 2 f o r υ n s 1 2 n s here pυ i is the fitting polynomial of any appropriate order in segment υ iv find out the fluctuation function ff for any generic statistical moment order q as follows 4 f q s 1 2 n s ν 1 2 n s f 2 s ν q 2 1 q here any real value except zero can be assigned to the moment order q for the zeroth moment order ff can be computed by a logarithmic averaging procedure as given below kantelhardt et al 2002 5 f 0 s exp 1 4 n s ν 1 2 n s ln f 2 s ν v determine the scaling characteristics of the ffs for different moment orders by analysing the logarithmic plots of fq s versus s fq s bears the relation fq s sh q if the time series is power law correlated the power h q is designated as generalized hurst exponent ghe for stationary time series 0 h q 2 less than 1 is identical to the classical hurst exponent h if 0 5 h 1 the time series possess long term persistence long memory if 0 h 0 5 the time series possess short term persistence short memory and if h 0 5 the time series is uncorrelated long term persistence implies a positive auto correlation in the time series i e the effect of an observation on future observations remains significant for a long period of time the selection of scale s range the type of polynomial chosen etc are some of the key issues while applying the mf dfa method their appropriate selection involves a trial and error procedure and some thumb rules can be found in literature ihlen 2012 wang et al 2016 the hurst exponent h q 2 basically helps to comment on persistence of the time series while the derived exponents such as q order mass exponent τ q and singularity exponent α helps to comment on the multifractality of the time series these exponents can be mathematically calculated as li et al 2015 6 τ q q h q 1 7 α d τ q dq and 8 f α q α τ q where the plot of f α vs α is called as the singularity spectrum the base width of the spectrum δ α α max α min depicts the degree of multifractality domf of the time series a wider singularity spectrum indicates a higher domf and vice versa if the time series is multifractal the singularity spectrum will be an inverted parabola asymmetry index r is another useful parameter for multifractal analysis derived from the shape of the multifractal spectrum drożdż and oświecimka 2015 9 r δ α left δ α right δ α left δ α right where δ α left α 0 α min and δ α right α max α 0 are respectively the width of left and right hand wings of the multifractal spectrum their values describe the distribution patterns of high and low fluctuations and α 0 is the singularity exponent known as holder exponent for q 0 r ranges from 1 to 1 r 0 represents a symmetrical multifractal spectrum r 0 suggests a left hand deviation of the multifractal spectrum resulted from the time series with local high fluctuations r less than 0 suggests a right hand deviation with local low fluctuations 2 2 multifractal detrended cross correlation analysis mf dcca in order to quantify the inter relationships between different hydro meteorological variables different statistical measures are used out of which most popular and simplest one is the pearson correlation coefficient however the robustness of this coefficient is debatable in the presence of outliers and if the data is of non linear and non stationarity in character piao and fu 2016 for the real field data which often possess non linear and non stationarity characteristics spurious correlation may be reported as they always characterized by trend because of this an estimation measure supported by the detrending operation such as mf dcca is advisable the different steps involved in mf dcca computational procedure can be described as follows i for two time series x i of y i and i 1 2 n determine the profiles as 10 x k k 1 i x k x 11 y k k 1 i y k y where i 1 n and x and y are the means of two time series ii divide x k and y k into n s non overlapping segments thus 2n s segments are obtained iii calculate the local trend of x k and y k for each of 2ns segments and determine the covariance 12 f dcca 2 s i 1 s k i i n x k x y k y iv calculate detrended covariance by summing over all overlapping segments of length as 13 f s 1 2 n s i 1 2 n s f dcca 2 s i 1 2 f s behaves as a power law function of s the scaling behavior where s is the segmental sample size as f s sλ q the cross correlation exponent λ q designed as scaling exponent can be obtained by deriving the slope of log log plot of f s versus s by the method of least squares cross correlation coefficient is defined as the ratio between the detrended covariance function f dccaxy and the detrended variance functions f dfax and f dfay as zebende 2011 vassoler and zebende 2012 oświecimka et al 2014 kwapień et al 2015 14 ρ dcca f dccaxy f dfax f dfay theoretically the value of ρdcca ranges as 1 ρdcca 1 the values range between 0 666 to 1 0 333 to 0 666 0 to 0 333 show respectively strong positive negative medium and weak cross correlations brito et al 2018 3 study area and database the daily gridded rainfall time series at 1ox1o resolution one time series over each cell for the period 1951 2016 received from india meteorological department imd were used in the present study a total of 286 grid points where long and continuous data were available and identified for performing the analysis brief statistics of the rainfall of different grid points are given in table 1 the spatial variability of multifractality was investigated by considering five rainfall homogeneous regions in india the non overlapping rainfall homogeneous regions have been defined by indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm pune the five regions include north west india nwi south peninsular india spi north east india nei central north east india cnei and western central india wci these regions are defined by rainfall homogeneity by grouping the different meteorological subdivisions the map showing rainfall homogeneous regions in india is presented in fig 2 for investigating the cross correlation of rainfall with temperature time series 1ox1o gridded extreme temperature tmax and tmin mean temperature tmean and diurnal temperature range tdtr which is the difference between maximum and minimum temperature values datasets at the same period 1951 2016 were used in this study 4 results and discussion this section first presents the results of mfdf analysis of daily rainfall time series of different grid points along with the spatial variability to examine the temporal change in multifractal properties of rainfall the time series was partitioned into two periods with respect to the well recognized global climatic shift of 1976 77 and the results of mf analysis of the pre and post 1976 77 periods are presented here subsequently the results of mf dcca between four different pairs of temperature rainfall time series are presented 4 1 spatial variability of multifractal properties of rainfall the mfdf analysis of daily gridded rainfall data for 1951 to 2016 was performed by considering a moment order of 4 to 4 drożdż et al 2019 it should be noted that long and consecutive zero values are present in each grid points and with percentage varies between 44 and 92 in different grids table 1 this needs special attention while performing mf dfa analysis to avoid any possible conclusions on long term persistency in the datasets which may be a spurious and erroneous interpretation to avoid any possible bias or misinterpretations because of the long and consecutive zero values in the records the minimum scale was chosen greater than the longest stretch of consecutive zero values in each time series drożdż et al 2019 different multifractal parameters like hurst exponent the spread of generalized hurst exponent plot δh q spectral width holder exponent α0 asymmetry index r difference between singularity spectrum plot δf α etc were determined for all identified 286 grid points over india the spatial distributions of different multifractal parameters of rainfall data are presented in fig 3 the pdf and cdf of the parameters were estimated using the non parametric kernel density estimator and presented in fig 4 fig 3 shows that the persistence and multifractal behavior of rainfall data is evident in gridded rainfall data of india in most of the grid points over 87 the hurst exponent h values are less than 0 5 indicating short term persistency the mean value of hurst exponent was found to be 0 385 which is also in line with the short term persistency of rainfall records of different parts of the globe reported earlier kantelhardt et al 2006 yu et al 2014 to evaluate the degree of multifractality δh q values were estimated higher value of δh q indicates a steeper ghe plot in which variability in the distribution of high and low fluctuations is increased and the time series will be more complex and heterogeneous hou et al 2018 similar inference can also be made from the values of spectral width the higher values of spectral width infer the high degree of multifractality the mean value of δh q spectral width was found to be 0 498 and 0 873 in about 55 of the grid points the value of δh q was found to be less than 0 5 the spectral width of majority of the points about 74 lies in the range 0 5 to 1 this may be because the rainfall process in india is highly intermittent and the time series of rainfall contains long and continuous zero values about 94 of rainfall data have positive asymmetry index r value which suggests left hand deviation with local low fluctuations the negative value of asymmetry index was noted in the hilly terrains of northern india and few localized grids the value of holder exponent α0 indicates the complexity of the time series and in this study the mean value of holder exponent was found to be 0 44 interestingly the values of holder exponent and hurst exponent were well correlated with correlation value of 0 968 this is in agreement with the association between the two parameters reported by burgueño et al 2014 for the temperature time series the difference between maximum and minimum values of singularity δf α provides an estimate of the spread in changes in fractal patterns since δf α denotes the frequency ratio of the largest to the smallest fluctuations a positive value of δf α means that the largest fluctuations are more frequent than smallest fluctuations the δf α value was positive in most of the regions and a negative value of δf α was noted only in the hilly terrains of the north and north eastern parts of india also to get an insight into multifractal property of rainfall data of different geographical regions the rainfall time series of all grid points were segregated into that of five rainfall homogeneous regions a total of 60 67 50 69 and 40 grid points were identified respectively for the five rainfall homogeneous regions nwi cnei nei wci and pi the multifractal properties estimated by the mf dfa method were clustered into five groups and the pdfs and cdfs of different parameters were developed and presented in fig 5 the statistical properties of prominent multifractal parameters hurst exponent spectral width and holder exponent are presented in table 2 from fig 5 it is clear that the values and variability of hurst exponent and spectral width are high in the north west india nwi it is well evident that the rainfall magnitude in regions like rajasthan located in nwi india is so small and pattern is more predictable and homogeneous when compared to many of other regions of india also higher persistence is noted in the rainfall of nei region which receives higher amount of rainfall within a typical year the behavior of spread of ghe plot is in line with that of spectral width the values of holder exponent α0 which is indicative of data complexity is the highest in the nwi region and in the cnei also the rainfall pattern is complex in character no specific pattern could be noted from the asymmetry index and δf α of the rainfall data of different regions from table 2 it is noted that highest mean multifractal degree is noted in nwi and cnei and overall variability in multifractal degree is the highest in nei on considering all india ai the variability in spectral width is considerably low than that of complexity and hurst exponent it is further noted that the variability of the persistence is the lowest at pi and nwi in order to verify the universality of this relationship least square fit was made between hurst exponent and holder exponent for all india ai and the five homogeneous regions and scatter plots of the same are presented in fig 6 further the correlations between the two exponents are found to be 0 98 0 987 0 979 0 986 and 0 986 respectively for nwi cnei nei wci and pi the high value of correlation confirms the universal property in the association between two multifractal exponents of rainfall datasets of geographical locations of india 4 2 temporal variability of multifractal properties of rainfall to evaluate the temporal variability of the multifractal properties of rainfall the time series of each grid point were partitioned into two sub series with respect to the much debated pacific climate shift of 1976 77 miller et al 1994 it is well evident that the climatic shift influenced the pattern of indian summer monsoon considerably sahana et al 2015 the mfdfa was performed for the pre and post 1976 77 periods the pdfs and cdfs of different multifractal parameters of rainfall time series for pre and post 1977 pacific climatic shift are presented in fig 7 from fig 7 it is clear that the multifractality and persistenace heve been affected by the climate shift of 1977 it is evident that there is a clear decrease in spectral width for rainfall after 1977 indicating the decrease in multifractality while the persistence indicated by hurst exponent and the complexity indicated by the holder exponent have increased after this shift on quantifying this change it is noticed that 104 grid points showed a reduction persistance none of the grid points displayed a swithover from short term to long term while only three grids showed a swithover from long term to short term the complexity of 132 grids and spectral width of 174 61 grids grid points displayed a reduction the mean hurst exponnet was 0 351 and spectral width of 0 82 for the pre 1977 period while it was found to be 0 382 and 0 751 after the shift there was a marginal difference in the mean of the complexity 0 43 and 0 446 for the pre and post 1977 periods respectively the change in multifractal properties could also be connected with the change of the different multifractal properties of standardized precipitataion index spi time series of post 1976 77 period computed based on spatially averaged rainfall dataset adarsh et al 2019 but there is no such clear and consistent reduction in asymmetry index of rainfall time series of different grid points in certain grid points the spectral assymetry was changed from positive to negative and vice versa in certain other grid points i e there is no consistent increase or decrease in extremes at different grid points but it displays spatial diversity to investigate the change in multifractal properties the four temperature time series were analysed by partitianing the data and the results are presented in fig 8 the behaviour of temperature time series was quite contrasting to that of rainfall as for temperature also there is a clear reduction in persistence and multifractality after the climate shift of 1977 the increased urbanization might have a key role and it might have weakened the multifractality of the temperature time series by creating more irregular profiles and smoothening the time series karatasou and santamouris 2018 which in turn have severe influence on the multifractality of rainfall time series in the recent years the multifractal properties of rainfall could be linked with the physical mechanisms leading to the rainfall apart from the global parameters like terrestrial radiations and temperature the local factors like the latitude oceanic and atmospheric circulations topography and local processes may influence the multifractality of the rainfall time series the rainfall of india is highly intermittent in character which leads to high degree of multifractality also one cannot ignore the inextricable link between the precipitation and temperature of the region in the non linear multifractal character of these time series and such links in the multifractality were analyzed in this study using the detrended cross correlation analysis 4 3 mf dcca between rainfall and temperature time series the most readily and directly available meteorological variable influencing the rainfall process of the country is the temperature the temperature extremes and the diurnal temperature range have remarkable roles in rainfall process of india vinnarasi et al 2017 ross et al 2018 in this study the cross correlation between four temperature datasets of tmax tmean tdtr and tmin with rainfall were evaluated using the mf dcca method considering the maximum scale as complete length of the time series in order to avoid any possible inconsistency in estimation of the scaling exponents in order to get the reliable interpretations because of long and continuous zero values in the records the minimum scale was chosen much shorter than the longest stretch of consecutive zero values while performing the mf dcca figs 9 12 show the spatial distribution of scaling exponent and different correlation coefficients obtained by the dcca of rainfall and temperature time series the correlation coefficients at two spatial scales corresponding to 90 days termed as seasonal cross correlation and those corresponding to 365 days termed as annual cross correlation along with overall correlation were considered in this analysis similarly the individual scaling exponents of each variable along with the joint exponent were estimated for elucidating the persistence in different time series from the dcc analysis of tmax rainfall link it is noted that the scaling exponent of rainfall varies between 0 54 and 0 74 and that of maximum temperature varies between 0 8 and 0 99 and in all cases λ value of temperature is more than that of rainfall there is a dominancy of medium persistence 0 601 0 663 in the rainfall time series and such grid points are distributed in west central cnei and nwi the persistence values are relatively lower in the peninsular india even though all λ values are showing long term persistence very high and very low persistence of tmax time series are noticed in the eastern coast and north western regions respectively at all grid points the value of joint scaling exponent is nearly half of the scaling exponent of individual time series i e the joint persistence is in between the individual persistence of the candidate variables rainfall and temperature this is in agreement with the universal property proven by the researchers considering the sunspot streamflow linkages hajian and movahed 2010 except in the peninsular india and western coast the seasonal correlation is negative but at annual scale the negative correlation is displayed in the nwi and some parts of cnei and wci in the peninsular region and coastal belts of india in particular the rainfall tmax correlation is positive with relatively larger magnitude the influence of large scale climatic oscillations from indian ocean such as equatorial indian ocean oscillation arabian sea and bay of bengal could be linked with the rainfall and temperature conditions of the coastal belts overall negative association between rainfall and tmax also displays a similar spatial distribution pattern as that of annual cross correlation according to fig 10 it is evident that strong persistence of mean temperature exists in most of the regions and among which the strongest persistence is displayed at the coastal belts and peninsular india while the weakest persistence exists in the nwi in this case also for all grid points the joint persistence lies between that of rainfall and tmean time series the seasonal cross correlation is negative at all regions except some parts of peninsular india and upper himalaya at annual scale relatively higher correlations are noted in the tmean rainfall link when compared with the tmax rainfall link positive correlation up to 0 78 in this case also the strong positive correlations are clustered in the peninsular india and the coastal belts while negative association is noted only in the nwi and few localized grids of wci again the spatial distribution of overall correlation is identical to that of annual correlation except with a lesser magnitude in the correlations from fig 11 it is noted that for the dtr time series the strongest persistence is in the north west india in the spatial distribution of joint persistence the wci and cnei the eastern coast in particular display the highest persistence along with the nwi region the seasonal correlation and overall correlation are found to be negative except in the western himalayan and southern peninsular regions at annual scale also the positive correlation is noted only in these regions the temperature difference has distinctly different influence on the rainfall pattern when compared with other temperature time series the association between minimum temperature and rainfall is unique when compared with other links the strongest persistence property is noticed for the tmin time series minimum of 0 849 to maximum of 0 997 with a mean of 0 971 when compared with other three temperature time series the seasonal correlation is negative in the nwi and majority of the parts of nci and cnei there is a clear switchover in the nature and strength of association in the tmin rainfall link at annual scale it is also noted that some geographical regions of india the correlation changes from negative at seasonal scale to positive even 0 5 at annual scale the peninsular region and coastal belts of india display the highest persistence property the influence of which is reflected also in the mean temperature time series see fig 10 peninsular region of india is bounded by the bay of bengal in the east indian ocean in the south and arabian sea in the west this oceanic proximity plays a dominant role in the precipitation of the country which is influenced by the temperature anomalies and local surface warming global and regional temperature and precipitation variability is influenced by enso phenomenon davey et al 2014 also it is well proven that other large scale atmospheric circulations such as quasi biennial oscillation qbo equatorial indian ocean oscillation equinoo north atlantic oscillation nao atlantic multi decadal oscillation amo etc are all playing major roles on seasonal rainfall the co existence of multiple oscillations also may modulate the process gadgil et al 2004 and one cannot separate the rainfall and near surface temperature states in india it is hard to find a universal pattern such as how the scaling exponents change with latitude altitude or distance from the coast yu et al 2014 also attributing the reason for multifractality to single indicator is quite impossible as the indian monsoon system is quite complex and many local processes and details like moisture terrain vegetation effects may influence the regional precipitation variations the pdfs and cdfs of dcca parameters of rainfall and four temperature time series links are presented in fig 13 considering the tmax rainfall link the mean values are 0 63 and 0 87 respectively for rainfall and tmax time series and the joint persistence lies between that of individual persistence with a mean of 0 76 for 234 grid points the seasonal correlation is negative and for 119 points annual correlation is negative it is found that almost 39 of ρannual values lay between 0 2 and 0 2 also 35 of ρannual values lay between 0 2 and 0 6 and remaining 26 of ρannual values lay between 0 6 and 0 2 except for 69 points the annual correlation is more than that of seasonal correlation while the overall correlation is positive for 150 points the relative magnitude of persistence of the rainfall tmax and joint persistence is clear from fig 11 and follows the universal property in their relative magnitudes hajian and movahed 2010 the scaling exponent of mean temperature varies between 0 83 and 0 99 the persistence of rainfall time series found to be less than that of temperature in all grid points with a mean of 0 63 and 0 95 respectively while the joint persistence is nearly half of individual persistence values with a mean of 0 78 in 79 the grid points 227 out of 286 the correlation is negative at seasonal scale while the correlation is positive at annual scale for 231 grid points 80 8 of grids except for 31 grid points annual correlation is greater than that of seasonal correlation also it is noted that for 55 of grids ρannual lies between 0 and 0 4 and for 15 grids the correlation lies between 0 4 and 0 8 for 208 grid points the overall correlation between rainfall and tmean is weakly positive and the overall mean correlation is found to be around 0 08 in the tdtr rainfall link it was found that the mean scaling exponent of temperature time series is around 0 87 and the mean value of joint persistence was found to be 0 75 in this case also for all grid points the joint persistence is between those of individual persistence of rainfall and temperature except for 17 grid points the overall correlation is negative with a mean of 0 237 similar response is noted for annual and seasonal correlations i e for 260 and 240 grid points the rainfall temperature association is negative at these time scales but annual correlation is strongly negative with overall mean of 0 89 while seasonal correlation is weakly negative with overall mean of 0 27 at annual time scale the positive correlation varies up to 0 49 while at seasonal scale it varies only up to 0 11 the scaling exponent of minimum temperature varies between 0 85 and 0 99 with a mean of 0 97 which infers very strong persistence the joint persistence clearly lies between the individual persistence with a mean scaling exponent of 0 8 interestingly the seasonal correlation was found to be negative in 210 grid points 73 4 of grid points with an overall mean value of 0 192 but at annual scale the correlation was strongly positive in 268 grid points out of 294 the mean correlation value is 0 426 with minimum of 0 21 and maximum of 0 8 this is a clear evidence of change in the scale dependent nature of association in the minimum temperature rainfall link in this case the overall correlation was also found to be positive in 263 grid points with a mean value of 0 156 varies between 0 05 and 0 46 5 discussion on applications and future scope this study examined the multifractal properties of daily rainfall field over india to get an insight into the complexity and persistence properties of the variable the spatio temporal variability of the multifractal properties adduced some interesting judgments and possible reasons for their diversity ascertaining the role of persistence is vital to the development of hydro meteorological studies and the changes in the persistence over the time spell should be investigated any significant change in the persistence may lead to erroneous predictions and the situation is quite analogous to the use of a stationarity assumption under a non stationary environment in a changing climate scenario the high degree of complexity and multifractality of rainfall in regions like nwi demands the multifractal modeling in such areas for specific applications the predictability could be well assessed by the persistence and the predictions in regions like nei this information could have an added value in devising new paradigms for accurate modeling of rainfall the temporal change in the properties of rainfall with respect to the pacific climatic shift is not supporting the urgent need of non stationary modeling in the country as a whole even though a reduction in complexity and multifractality along with an increase in persistence is noted in majority of the grid points however localized analysis using station wise data may give improved understanding on the modeling practices to be followed for the management of the water resources the rainfall temperature cross correlation studies in a multiscale multifractal framework provided remarkable insights in the behavior of rainfall in indian subcontinent the nature of association of each temperature time series with rainfall in india is quite different from that of the other despite these differences the persistence and correlation properties of the dataset of peninsular india and coastal belts show distinctly different behavior than the rest parts of the country more emphasis should be given on multifractal and non stationary frameworks for modeling hydrological variables in these regions which may eventually help in accurate management of the water resources understanding the multifractal properties of rainfall time series may help for multifractal modeling simulation and synthetic generation of rainfall fields de noising etc deidda et al 1999 deidda 1999 2000 serinaldi 2010 which are some promising domains for subsequent researches the scaling exponents can be used for derivation of intensity duration frequency curves by rainfall disaggregation veneziano and furcolo 2002 huang et al 2014 garcia marin et al 2019 the space time disaggregation of rainfall is a possible application for the scaling exponents developed deidda 2000 hubert 2001 pathirana et al 2007 potential applicability of decomposition methods such as wavelet transforms can be conjunctively used along with multifractal properties in the space time disaggregation studies nourani et al 2013 2017 roushangar et al 2019 the derived multifractal properties may help in performing the catchment classification or regionalization and subsequent predictions in ungauged basins by coupling with different clustering techniques sharghi et al 2018 baghanam et al 2019 to get a more comprehensive picture of the multifractal properties of rainfall fields similar studies can be performed using more fine resolution data say 0 25ox0 25 and cross correlations with other hydrological variables like station wise streamflow can be analyzed in a multifractal perspective this study provided an overall picture of multifractal characteristics of the rainfall and temperature datasets in india in depth studies using the real field datasets are highly recommended in coastal and peninsular india in particular while accepting the constraints on rainfall time series of longer stretch it is always advisable to perform similar studies using the real time datasets 6 conclusions in this study the multifractality of 1ox1o daily gridded rainfall fields over india was evaluated using mf dfa method and its link with the four different temperature datasets was investigated using the mf dcca method the daily gridded rainfall data of 87 grid points possessed short term persistence and most of the time series showed strong multifractal behavior the highest multifractal degree and persistence was noted in the nwi followed by nei where the rainfall pattern is more homogeneous in characteristics there is a clear reduction in multifractal degree of rainfall time series of india for the post 1976 77 pacific climatic shift period the joint persistence of rainfall and temperature was nearly half of the persistence of individual time series in all of the combinations of rainfall temperature linkages the nature and strength of cross correlation between temperature and rainfall displayed spatio temporal diversity the correlation properties between rainfall and temperature were unique in the peninsular and coastal belts of india when compared to other regions which could be attributed to the effect of large scale climatic circulations resulting from oceanic proximity credit authorship contribution statement s adarsh project administration

5509,groundwater dependent cities face increasing population and changes in urban land use threatening long term aquifer sustainability by simultaneously increasing pumping demand while modifying recharge rates aquifer management involves a portfolio of alternatives to balance the sustainability of multiple water supply sources including novel recharge alternatives to supplement traditional groundwater and surface water sources however potential managed aquifer recharge solutions can lead to unintended consequences as modern infrastructure and management alter natural hydrology changing the underlying groundwater paradigm this study uses a multiobjective analysis approach to evaluate the performance of spatially distributed aquifer management alternatives for the mexico city metropolitan area mcma a region where the population has increased by 48 and urban land use by 35 in the last 30 years recharge alternatives are evaluated using a physically based groundwater model that incorporates land and water use trends and include repairs to the water supply distribution network increased wastewater treatment and infiltration and increased infiltration of imported water supplies these alternatives are compared according to planning objectives aggregated over three overlapping subregions within the model to minimize energy use for pumping minimize water quality risks in subsidence prone areas and minimize groundwater flooding in urban areas results indicate that management alternatives resulting in equivalent changes in storage can exhibit spatially distinct reductions in drawdown over the historical period additionally combining multiple alternatives results in a more than an additive risk of groundwater flooding demonstrating the need for mitigation of rising water tables this model will serve as the basis for future spatial optimization studies under future climate and land use scenarios these approaches have broad applicability in other rapidly urbanizing regions dependent on groundwater supplies keywords groundwater urbanization land use change managed aquifer recharge mexico city 1 introduction globally urban areas have grown rapidly compared to rural areas particularly in megacities with populations greater than ten million united nations 2016 this in combination with climate variability over time has led to overexploitation of both surface water and groundwater worldwide vörösmarty et al 2000 groundwater is increasingly relied on for water supply during times of shortage placing stress on urban aquifers both in developing and industrialized countries urban groundwater is threatened by unsustainable pumping and contamination from surface and subsurface sources reducing its ability to meet rising demands foster et al 1998 mcdonald et al 2014 expanding urban land cover amplifies these risks by increasing impervious surface area affecting infiltration runoff evapotranspiration recharge and ultimately regional groundwater capture alley and leake 2004 these hydrologic changes may require megacities to seek additional sources of local surface water or consider costly imports jacobson 2011 as conventional water supply and sanitation infrastructure with high capital and operating costs have failed to adapt to changing climate and demographic forces managed aquifer recharge infrastructure and water management solutions have been advocated to mitigate local flooding vulnerabilities regulate surface water runoff and groundwater quality and increase groundwater infiltration to urban aquifers dahlke et al 2018 roy poirier et al 2010 as watersheds globally become more urbanized hydrologic and hydrogeologic models used to support water resources planning must incorporate human impacts on several key dynamics of the water cycle and water quality brath et al 2006 thompson et al 2013 for example urban expansion can increase recharge because losses from decreased precipitation are offset by increases from irrigation with imported water water supply distribution system leakage and infiltration from unlined wastewater systems lawrence et al 1998 alternatively sewer systems have also been shown to remove significant precipitation recharge braud et al 2013 which can result in an overall negative effect on the urban groundwater budget depending on site specific characteristics increased groundwater abstraction in urban areas can also cause ancillary impacts including subsidence ortiz zamora and ortega guerrero 2010 and subsequent ground ruptures frigo et al 2019 as well as flood risks resulting from damaged infrastructure and settling jago on et al 2009 finally urbanization also poses water quality threats from concentrated pollutants in stormwater wastewater and landscape and agricultural runoff lerner 2004 which can enter shallow unconfined aquifers via infiltration and confined aquifers via fractures or well boreholes huizar alvarez et al 2004 the potential for aquifer management to provide solutions for these risks to urban groundwater security is high given the diversity of alternative water supplies and management tools available page et al 2018 however the interactions between such solutions and the natural hydrogeologic system may lead to unintended consequences li et al 2017 maliva 2020 as regional scale hydrologeologic modeling has progressed in large metropolitan areas experts have stressed that a simple determination of safe yield from an aquifer rather than a more detailed analysis of the dynamic processes governing groundwater availability within a basin is necessary to properly inform decision making dendrou 1982 bredehoeft 2002 more recent urban water modeling efforts have included extensive integrated modeling to provide robust groundwater models hanson et al 2012 hanson et al 2014 hanson 2015 in these frameworks a hydrologic model can incorporate economic climate energy ecological and land use components and represent distinct anthropogenic processes such as impervious surfaces groundwater storage residential water use urban irrigation wastewater treatment and storage and leakage from water distribution and collection infrastructure bach et al 2014 mitchell et al 2001 hanson et al 2014 however though regional scale planning efforts can alleviate general sustainability concerns they may not consider distributional impacts particularly in economically marginalized districts where urban growth is often concentrated baker 2012 specifically while regional planning decisions may provide water supply needed to support urban growth in the aggregate stresses may be unevenly distributed across finer spatial scales creating challenging trade offs daw et al 2011 understanding the coupled dynamics of subsurface hydrology urban land use and water consumption is key to ensuring sustainable groundwater management in metropolitan areas tellman et al 2018 in cities facing rapid urbanization spatially distributed analysis of planning objectives at multiple scales can help to achieve reliable water access across districts varis et al 2006 for example reichard et al 2010 evaluated potential groundwater management options in emergency groundwater use based on the costs associated with negative impacts from intensive groundwater extraction however the problem often requires a multiobjective comparison of spatially distributed aquifer management alternatives to demonstrate the conflicts that arise in planning for complex systems in this study we develop a physically based groundwater model that incorporates land use change water supply infrastructure and pumping trends for the mexico city metropolitan area mcma as a case study to examine the effects of the choice of spatial and temporal dimensions for the calculation of objectives on preferred aquifer management alternatives 2 case study the mcma lies within the southwestern portion of the valley of mexico watershed fig 1 characterized by volcanic peaks surrounding a high plains basin ocavm 2014 until roughly 300 years ago there were four natural lakes present in the valley forming an aquifer system which comprised a saturated lakebed overlying alluvial sediment and volcanic rock formations gonzález morán et al 1999 the first large scale drainage project el gran canal del desagüe was completed in 1900 today along with the deep drainage system it carries untreated stormwater and wastewater out of the expanding urban area sacm 2012 like many metropolitan areas around the world the hydrologic cycle of the mcma has been altered substantially with the introduction of inter basin water and wastewater conveyance infrastructure the alteration of land surface properties in high density human settlements and the overdraft of groundwater resources from 1980 to 2015 urban land cover expanded significantly fig 4c driven by a population that nearly doubled during the same period conapo 2014 exploitation of the productive aquifers in the center of the metropolitan area has occurred at varying rates since the discovery of potable groundwater in the valley in 1846 national research council et al 1995 today the city depends on underlying alluvial and volcanic aquifers for 58 of its water supply which has caused the water table to decline throughout the city leading to increased energy costs for pumping water quality concerns and land subsidence ocavm 2014 a number of studies have estimated various components of the total water budget in both the larger valley of mexico watershed as well as the smaller mcma dgcoh 1997 birkle et al 1998 carrera hernández and gaskin 2008 gómez reyes 2013 the major flows in the mcma urban hydrologic system are shown in fig 2 along with how they are represented in the modeling framework developed for this study the drinking water supply to the valley of mexico includes a complex administrative structure for water management in which regional state and local agencies interact the national water commission conagua administrates water supply at the national level it acts at the regional level through the organismo de cuenca aguas del valle de méxico ocavm water supply within mexico city is managed by the sistema de aguas de la ciudad de méxico sacmex the operating agency of the mexico city government on the other hand the state of mexico water commission caem is the agency that provides water for the state of mexico municipalities some of which also have local operating agencies banco interamericano de desarrollo 2012 escolero et al 2016 in practice decisions are made at the federal level within ocavm to distribute supplies within the basin including wells in the immediate action plan program pai and find and manage water sources from outside of the basin including the lerma well system and the cutzamala reservoir system ocavm 2014 conagua 2005 the characteristics of the basin allow for the testing of novel parameterizations of urban aquifer components under traditional groundwater modeling frameworks previous basin wide groundwater modeling efforts have included local water infrastructure such as pumping rates and water supply distribution system leaks as well as zonal geologic and recharge quantities herrera zamarrón et al 2005 however sensitivity analysis and calibration efforts did not incorporate the effects of time varied land use change annual and intra annual precipitation or pumping data lopez alvis 2014 galán breth 2019 palma nava et al 2015 proposed an integrated spatially distributed groundwater model that incorporates both subsidence and climate modeling for the mcma system but did not consider the siting and evaluation of recharge infrastructure alternatives 3 methods 3 1 groundwater model inputs one of the most commonly used groundwater modeling code libraries is modflow a modular finite difference quasi 3d flow model developed by the us geological survey which relies on a number of packages to represent different boundary conditions harbaugh 2006 modflow provides a suitable environment to simulate historical and future conditions perform sensitivity analyses uncertainty estimations and generate alternative scenarios via a comprehensive suite of modules given its widespread use and modular nature modflow serves as an appropriate tool to construct a complex urban groundwater model with the difficulty in the modeling process arising from the representation of the various natural and anthropogenic fluxes the scale and complexity of the model can lead to dramatic increases in runtime making groundwater models challenging to run iteratively as required for many optimization routines however the modular nature of modflow allows researchers to add complexity incrementally evaluating the trade offs between the accuracy of the physical representation and the runtime of the simulation zhou and li 2011 the numerical model was developed in python and solved using modflow model datasets and workflow shown in fig 3 based on the conceptual model of the aquifers in the southwestern portion of the valley of mexico watershed proposed by galán breth 2019 lopez alvis 2014 herrera zamarrón et al 2005 herrera revilla et al 1994 the model contains two vertical layers and 500 by 500 meter grid cells in a model grid space 84 km east to west and 67 km north to south the simulation period is from 1984 to 2013 with daily time steps and monthly or annually varied data using the modflow stress period set to a monthly format the modular nature of modflow allows each physical component of the groundwater system to be represented using a generalized package type with most components defined in specified flux packages modular packages were populated using publicly available and institutional datasets described below which were preprocessed in python and qgis bakker et al 2016 3 1 1 model layers and hydrostratigraphic units the model has two numerical layers table 1 and fig 4 show the relation of these layers with the hydrostratigraphic units and the geologic structure of the model area the surface layer represents the clay unit which ranges from 5 to 150 meters thick and has the hydraulic properties of an aquitard it covers about 25 of the total model surface area the second numerical layer represents the primary aquifer which underlies the first layer where it is present herrera zamarrón et al 2005 geologic data was obtained from the mexican national institute of statistics and geography inegi geology inventory inegi 2002 the dataset was simplified into six main geologic formations based on work done by lopez alvis 2014 and herrera zamarrón et al 2005 hydraulic conductivities and model layers were initialized based on a review of the literature and are indicated in table 1 ortega and farvolden 1989 herrera zamarrón et al 2005 carrera hernández and gaskin 2008 lopez alvis 2014 3 1 2 active model extent previous groundwater models of the valley use an approximation of the watershed boundary of the southwestern portion of the valley of mexico watershed as the natural groundwater basin delineation based on the assumption that the surrounding mountain ranges create a natural groundwater divide ortega and farvolden 1989 gonzález morán et al 1999 the inegi delineated watershed was used in this study inegi 2010 with corrections for a naturally occurring closure at the northern and southeastern edges of the basin with the resulting active model extent shown in black as the model area in 1 herrera zamarrón et al 2005 lopez alvis 2014 galán breth 2019 3 1 3 precipitation mexico city experiences a marked wet and dry season with the wet season predominating from may to october and producing annual averages of 600 to 1200 mm of precipitation precipitation data was taken from the national meteorologic service climatecomputing project which provides daily meteorological station data for precipitation temperature and evaporation smn 2015 of the stations in the region 97 were chosen for their proximity to the model extent and availability of data daily data was summed to monthly and interpolated using cubic spline interpolation in qgis for each month over the 30 year period from 1984 to 2013 rainfall is concentrated in the southwestern area due to orographic effects of the volcanic mountain range demonstrated in 4d which shows the average rainfall at each station for the month of july interpolated over the model area 3 1 4 land use spatially distributed time varied land use data is used in this model to assign both recharge percentages from precipitation zonal recharge in d 1 and incidental recharge from leaks in the water supply distribution system described in section 3 1 5 based on growth trends and data availability land use data was chosen for 1990 2000 and 2010 to represent 1984 1993 1994 2004 and 2005 2013 respectively these model periods are used throughout time varied data in the model an extensive gis analysis was applied to classify land use types into three categories urban natural and water wetland land use percentages for each model cell were calculated based on remote sensing images as described in appendix b each land use category was then assigned an initial infiltration multiplier to be calibrated the monthly precipitation was multiplied by the percentage of each land use by cell and the multiplier for each land use type then summed over all land uses to achieve 100 coverage potential monthly infiltration was then divided by the days in the month and applied as recharge for each daily time step as 100 on all geologic formations except over the lacustrine aquitard where it is applied at 1 of that value 3 1 5 water supply distribution system leaks potential recharge from water infrastructure is a well known component of the urban water cycle but can vary significantly in magnitude for each component depending on local infrastructure maintenance and conditions lerner 1990 in the mcma leaks in the water supply distribution network are estimated to account for between 20 and 55 of water use by municipality or delegation dgcoh 1997 national research council et al 1995 a portion of these leaks is assumed to recharge the underlying aquifers depending on local water use land use type and geologic subsurface material interviews with engineers and administrators at the national water commission have suggested that there is a large potential for reductions in groundwater pumping if leaks were controlled using improved operation and maintenance thus including leaks as parameterized objects during the calibration process was necessary to allow for a reduction in leaks as an aquifer management alternative we considered leaks in the metropolitan area to be a function of total water supply distributed through the public system herrera zamarrón et al 2005 since groundwater supply was calibrated in the model the total quantity of water use was calculated as the sum of the calibrated pumping and an estimation of other historical water sources in the basin these sources are listed in c 1 and summed to 16 7 m 3 s 28 0 m 3 s and 33 5 m 3 s for the three model periods defined above appendix d national research council et al 1995 mazari and mackay 1993 ocavm 2014 torres bernardino 2014 these values were used to calculate groundwater pumping as g t o where g is local groundwater t is total water use and o is other supplies for each of the model phases 1990 2000 and 2010 the calibrated value of t was then multiplied by the percentage of water usage per municipality reported in dgcoh 1997 to get a total water use by municipality previous research by the mexico city department of hydraulic construction and operations estimated leaks to be between 27 and 58 of total water distribution for 25 of the 41 municipalities and delegations total water distribution of municipalities in the state of mexico was estimated to have losses of 35 based on the average losses to leaks in federal district delegations with similar characteristics these values for leaks from the system shown in 5 were applied to the total water use for each municipality any urban leaks occurring over the lacustrine layer were considered to not contribute to recharge of the underlying aquifer based on the low permeability of the confining layer dgcoh 1997 and the presence of preferential flow paths provided by the urban drainage system bonneau et al 2017 a multiplier of 1 was applied to each model period which would allow for calibration of the multiplier if the parameters were found to be sensitive in the model an infiltration parameter of 10 was included as a calibration parameter assuming that preferential flow paths to the sewer and evaporation reduce the total infiltration of potential leak recharge 3 1 6 well pumping well pumping data for the region can be separated into two main categories municipal pumping rates gathered on a monthly or yearly basis and well concessions data indicating a single maximum allowable pumping rate the combined pumping data for 2005 are shown in fig 4b municipal data consists of one dataset of monthly pumping data for municipal wells in the mexico city service area and one dataset of yearly pumping data for municipal wells in the state of mexico conagua 2017 caem 2011 both municipal datasets were assumed to be accurate and were not modified in the calibration process georeferenced well pumping concessions data for the study site is available beginning in 1983 from the public register of water rights repda hosted by the national water commission conagua 2013 since the repda data does not include information about time varied quantities nor when the wells were installed the total quantity and the distribution of pumping was assumed to be unknown but able to be calibrated from the properties of the dataset to determine the total quantity a total water use multiplier was applied one for each of the three model periods to an initial estimate for pumping then the other water supplies defined in section 3 1 5 plus the known municipal pumping were subtracted from this estimate to obtain the remaining groundwater pumping d 1 pumping distribution in the basin has shifted from high pumping in the historical downtown region to pumping in the surrounding areas national research council et al 1995 to mimic this trend the wells in the repda dataset were separated into two groups historical downtown and peripheral next a multiplier was applied to only the downtown repda wells with the peripheral wells calculated as the remaining quantity from the difference of the calibrated groundwater pumping and the urban repda set 3 2 sensitivity analysis and model calibration a fundamental aspect of groundwater model construction is evaluation of the model against observed conditions inverse modeling is generally considered a valuable tool to tune model characteristics using observations hill et al 2016 calibration with inverse modeling is based on the principle that model parameters are either difficult to determine in the field at the scale that has been selected or cannot be directly measured or estimated from the information available foglia et al 2009 mclaughlin and townley 1996 the first step is the parameterization of model characteristics so that the potentially infinite number of values to be adjusted over time and space are reduced to a limited number of variables to evaluate we performed sensitivity analyses and parameter estimation using ucode 2014 poeter et al 2014 which employs a weighted least squares objective function to compare model simulated values to observations provided as in any calibration process the quality of the observations is important in determining which observations will lead to the most accurate representation of the system these errors or uncertainties are represented in the modeling process by applying a weight to the observation in the objective function once the weights are determined a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the model error with respect to perturbation of the initial parameter values to select a smaller group of parameters that are most sensitive hill and tiedeman 2007 the composite scaled sensitivity combined with the evaluation of parameters correlations is used to evaluate the parameters that contribute the largest changes to the weighted sum of squared error between the observations and their simulated equivalent finally an iterative process is completed whereby the parameters are perturbed locally and the weighted sum of squared error is calculated for each parameter calibration until an acceptable tolerance is met 3 2 1 observations an initial set of 669 historical groundwater observation wells were obtained from the national water commission after an initial review the data was determined to contain various irregularities that would impede the proper calibration of the model as such wells that exhibited a difference in water level of 20 m or more from one year to the next were reviewed to see if the fluctuation was persistent and or representative of behavior in nearby wells the wells were filtered to contain only one observation well per model grid cell and exclude any well observation sets with erratic behaviour as compared to nearby wells wells were chosen first by highest number of observations and then proximity to cell center each well dataset has between one and 30 years of yearly water level measurements however there is limited information on the time of year or conditions in which the observations were taken this yielded a total of 531 wells with 6896 unique observations over the 30 year historical model period to set the initial hydraulic head throughout the model area the 132 observations from 1984 were interpolated using ordinary kriging with a spherical variogram model of the remaining 6764 observations 531 were used as initial head values and the rest were used as drawdown observations to perform the sensitivity analysis and calibration weights for each observation were assigned based on the relative confidence in the quality of the observation following lopez alvis 2014 and galán breth 2019 error is introduced by uncertainties associated with well elevation well position non simulated transitory processes sampling and model discretization according to the following calculations 1 error in the elevation of the well 1 σ 1 dem r h 4 2 r v 4 2 dem a m 4 2 where dem is the gradient of the digital elevation model dem r h is the horizontal resolution of the dem 5 m r v is the vertical resolution of the dem 1 m and a m is the accuracy of the gps measuring device 90 m 2 error in the horizontal position of the well 2 σ 2 h a m 4 where h is the hydraulic gradient at the position of the well 3 error in the transitory processes not simulated 3 σ 3 1 n 1 i 1 n d i d 2 where d i is the ith difference between subsequent observations for a single well m d is the mean of the differences for all observations for a single well m and n is the number of differences for the well 4 error in observation measurement accuracy 4 σ 4 d 0 001 4 where d is the depth of the measurement m and 0 001 refers to an accuracy of 0 1 of the well depth 5 error in the discretization of the model 5 σ 5 s nodal h 4 where s nodal is the nodal spacing of the mesh the total standard deviation is assumed to be additive and was determined as the root sum of squares of each of the five errors 6 σ t σ 1 2 σ 2 2 σ 3 2 σ 4 2 σ 5 2 3 2 2 parameters the model parameters evaluated can be separated into four main groups zonal geologic time varied infrastructure zonal recharge and conductance the 33 model parameters are shown in d 1 including horizontal hydraulic conductivity vertical anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity specific storage specific yield pumping leak percentage total water use land use recharge and leak infiltration lower and upper bounds for the zonal geologic parameters were selected based on previous studies in the area and accepted values in the literature which were used as constraints for those parameters during the calibration process singhal et al 1999 galán breth 2019 lopez alvis 2014 herrera zamarrón et al 2005 temporal variations in groundwater pumping and leaks from the water supply distribution system were separated into three model phases 1984 1993 1993 2005 and 2005 2014 chosen based on the availability of land use imagery land use multipliers were assigned to urban natural or water wetland land use types parameters were selected for perturbation in two stages first as a confined system to determine approximate parameter values and then as a convertible confined unconfined system to determine final parameter values for each stage a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the most sensitive parameters and any parameter correlations parameters to be calibrated were selected and the weighted sum of squares was minimized to determine the final calibrated parameters 3 3 application of management alternatives managed aquifer recharge offers a variety of infrastructure and policy options to increase infiltration into over drafted aquifers and promote conjunctive use of alternative water supply sources dahlke et al 2018 in the mcma a number of aquifer management alternatives have been proposed to mitigate the effects of intensive groundwater use and the alteration of the natural hydrologic regimes including demand reduction schemes as well as managed aquifer recharge demand reduction within the valley of mexico could include exchange of fresh water for treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation reduction of leaks in the water supply distribution network substitution of imported sources for local groundwater sources and redistribution of pumping to reduce pumping at problem zones palma nava et al 2015 ocavm 2014 herrera zamarrón et al 2005 alternatively there are many possible managed aquifer recharge projects for the mcma including infiltration basins injection of treated wastewater and decentralized infiltration at the household scale with low impact development design for this study three alternatives with varying spatial extents were chosen for multiobjective analysis increased infiltration of imported water supply fig 5a increased wastewater treatment and infiltration fig 5b and repairs to the water supply distribution network fig 5c representing centralized regionally centralized and decentralized interventions respectively the spatial dimension of the recharge problem adds a degree of complexity the planning and design problem requires selecting not only infrastructure capacities but also their locations numerical representation of the recharge alternatives requires data describing infrastructure including the location and capacity of existing wastewater treatment facilities and the location of existing surface water conveyance routes these data were collected from publicly available planning documents and gis databases and implemented as described in this section negi 2017 ocavm 2014 riveros olivares 2013 in the development of this model the management alternatives and supply policies are assumed to be implemented by centralized decision makers with no dynamic model for interaction between basin agencies the historical condition the three management alternatives described below and an alternative comprising all three management alternatives were analyzed by calculating the cumulative change in storage as well as the spatially aggregated planning objectives defined in section 3 4 cumulative change in storage δ s was calculated as the sum of the difference between model inflows including precipitation recharge r and water supply network leaks l and model outflow from groundwater well pumping w over all stress periods t 7 δ s t 1 360 r t l t w t 3 3 1 infiltration basins the cutzamala reservoir system is the main source of imported water for the mcma conagua 2005 de nys et al 2015 suggest that up to 5 m 3 s of supply could be yielded from reoperation of the reservoir system while birkle et al 1998 calculate a potential of 17 6 m 3 s of local surface water for use within the basin other studies of potential import supplies show that there is economic interest in bringing more external sources into the system however new surface reservoirs to store such sources may be limited given the growing urban areas ocavm 2014 this alternative proposes the implementation of five randomly placed surface infiltration basins to recharge the underlying aquifers at 1 m3 s based on similar basins installed in other urban aquifers dahlke et al 2018 sites were selected from a complete set of evenly spaced points along existing surface water conveyance infrastructure that connects to the cutzamala reservoir system fig 5a the points were filtered such that only one potential site was allowed per model cell and no sites were allowed in cells exceeding the elevation at the cutzamala inlet 2600 meters above sea level in urban areas nor above the lacustrine layer 3 3 2 wastewater reuse at existing treatment plants there are 74 existing wastewater treatment plants within the model area a majority of which are operating at less than their installed capacity due to substandard maintenance and operation practices riveros olivares 2013 the 2015 inventory for wastewater treatment plants was used to determine the installed capacity and the current operating capacity conagua 2015 the difference between these values was then added as recharge to the aquifer layer assuming all repairs and operations modifications were made to improve the amount of treated water produced at each plant this simple difference does not account for infiltration inefficiencies evapotranspiration nor conveyance losses making this estimate an upper bound for this recharge potential however less than 10 of wastewater is currently treated within the valley sosa rodriguez 2010 indicating that there is a indeed a much higher overall potential for wastewater reuse within the valley than what is represented in the wastewater reuse management alternative implemented in this model 3 3 3 repair to leaks in potable supply distribution network in the final alternative the recharge from leaks was reduced while simultaneously decreasing pumping this was achieved by applying a leak persistence percentage factor between 0 and 1 a value of 1 indicates that the leaks are present at 100 of the historical value while a value of 0 indicates that all the leaks have been fixed the pumping quantities were reduced at the municipal or delegation scale by applying eq 8 depending on the base leak percent per municipality of the total water pumped as described in section 2 2 5 8 t n t 1 p l 1 l p where t n is the new total pumping t is the initial total pumping p l is the percentage of leak as a total of the total pumping by municipality and l p is the leak persistence percentage all water use savings were assumed to reduce groundwater pumping representing a form of demand management and resulting in an overall increase in storage within the basin the difference between the new groundwater pumping g n and the original groundwater pumping g and the difference between t n and t are equivalent 9 g n g t n t thus using substitution and algebraic methods as described in appendix b the ratio of the new groundwater pumping to the original groundwater pumping is 10 g n g t 1 p l 1 l p s t s which is then applied to all pumping wells within a municipality or delegation this application could later be used to apply varying degrees of repairs to each municipality or delegation individually 3 4 calculation of planning objectives urban water supply planning is inherently a multiobjective problem as long term sustainability generally conflicts with net present cost as well as future revenue streams for stakeholders reliant on the water sector in such cases no single optimal solution exists but rather a set of pareto optimal solutions where one objective can only be improved by worsening another banzhaf 2009 these challenges motivate the need for novel methods to identify the tradeoffs between multiple conflicting objectives that arise in the design of aquifer management portfolios in urban settings in this case three management objectives are defined to demonstrate the reliance of any given management objective on spatial context minimize water supply pumping energy use minimize water quality risks in subsidence prone areas and minimize flooding potential in urban areas this multiobjective approach allows several advantages first objectives are not required to be aggregated using commensurate units of utility which may be difficult in systems with many stakeholders with conflicting preferences cohon and marks 1975 second a weighted aggregation approach results in a single preferred alternative without fully capturing the range of performance in all objectives that may lead to a change in preference bond et al 2008 the following planning objectives were calculated separately for the historical condition the three management alternatives and the combined management alternatives 3 4 1 minimize energy use falling groundwater tables result in costs relating to increased energy costs to pump deeper water and or the cost of drilling deeper wells this objective estimates a lower bound for energy use associated with pumping in wells by calculating the amount of energy required to lift the quantity of groundwater pumped per day from the head elevation in the cell of the pumping well to the land surface over all wells this objective was calculated in kilowatt hours kwh given n wells is the set of all pumping wells is the conversion factor from lift to kwh d is the number of days in month t h surface is the elevation of the land surface and h well is the hydraulic head at the location of well w then the energy measure e is 11 e t 25 360 w 1 n wells d h surface h well 3 4 2 minimize water quality risks in subsidence prone areas subsidence in mexico city contributes to many potential problems for water supply planners in the region in addition to infrastructure damage there are also major water quality concerns that have arisen as the water table underneath the confining clay layer has fallen huizar alvarez et al 2016 the reversal of the hydraulic gradient as the confined aquifer beneath the clay layer becomes unconfined threatens water security via two primary mechanisms first as the potentiometric surface of the confined aquifer falls below the bottom of the confining layer discharge from the chloride rich aquitard increases to the good quality aquifer ortega guerrero et al 1993 secondly in a confined aquifer with a potentiometric surface above the land surface the flow in the system is upward however as the hydraulic head drops below the surface poor quality water from the surface including sewage and stormwater runoff flows downward through fractures caused by subsidence and poorly managed boreholes huizar alvarez et al 2004 the water quality risk measure was defined as the percent of confined cells with a potentiometric surface below the elevation of the bottom of the confining layer during the last year of the model period given n clay is the set of lacustrine model cells h surface is the elevation of the bottom of the confining layer and h clay is the hydraulic head in the aquifer below the confining payer at time t then the water quality risk measure w is 12 w 1 12 n clay c 1 n clay t 348 360 h t c surface h c clay 3 4 3 minimize groundwater flooding in urban areas mexico city like other urban areas built in low lying regions suffers from flooding that arises from a variety of mechanisms these mechanisms can be separated into two main categories overland flooding and groundwater flooding abboud et al 2018 the former overflow of rivers or canals has been studied and addressed extensively while the latter the emergence of groundwater through rising water tables has largely been overlooked both worldwide and in mexico city abboud et al 2018 aragón durand 2007 groundwater flooding can occur in three main forms short term rising water tables in shallow yet permeable aquifers long term rising water tables in unconfined aquifers and return of water tables to preindustrial levels in historically depleted aquifers macdonald et al 2008 in addition to exacerbating surface flooding conditions groundwater flooding can cause significant structural damages to buildings and public infrastructure toll et al 2012 to address this risk the groundwater flooding objective was defined as the percent of the total urban area over the model period that contained a hydraulic head above the land surface given c urban is the set of model cells with urban land cover c flood is the set of model cells with urban land cover that are flooded at time t and a urban is the percent urban area in the model cell then the urban flooding measure f is 13 f t 25 360 u 1 c flood a urban t 25 360 u 1 c urban a urban 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and parameter sensitivities composite scaled sensitivities are shown for the fifteen most sensitive of the thirty three model parameters in fig 7 for stage 1 and stage 2 of the calibration process the parameter correlation coefficients for stage 1 and stage 2 are shown in table 2 based on the parameter correlations the vertical anisotropy of the clay formation was not included in the calibration process because it was highly correlated with the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the clay layer the eight most sensitive parameters were calibrated in stage 1 fig 7a while in stage 2 the thirteen most sensitive parameters were calibrated fig 7b the composite scaled sensitivities of the resulting parameter set is shown in 7c the total water use parameters are the three most sensitive parameters in the set indicating the importance of incorporating time varied water use factors blue into hydrogeologic modeling this could be a result of these parameters acting as scale factors that exert influence over many pumping cells together rather than individually thus making them more dominant parameters the zonal geologic parameters orange follow with the clay basalt alluvial and tarango formations being the most sensitive this may be a factor of the location of the observations available given that there are no observations located in the andesitic formation next of the remaining time varied infrastructure parameters blue we can see that all three urban pumping parameters are among the most sensitive parameters for stages 1 and 2 with the third urban pumping parameter dropping out of the top fifteen for the final sensitivity analysis which highlights the spatial factor of the pumping and the expected shift from urban to periurban pumping finally the recharge infiltration multiplier is the only zonal recharge parameter green among the most sensitive parameters this is likely a result of a combination of the concentration of precipitation in natural areas the higher infiltration rates experienced under natural land cover and the large percentage of area represented by the natural land cover the fifteen most sensitive parameters chosen for parameter estimation were horizontal hydraulic conductivity for the clay alluvial tarango and fractured basalt formations specific storage for the alluvial formation all three urban pumping multipliers all three total water use multipliers the recharge multiplier for the natural land use type and specific yield for the alluvial tarango and fractured basalt formations the parameters initial values and calibrated results are shown in table d 1 the values calculated for pumping and recharge fluxes are consistent with the ranges reported in the literature gómez reyes 2013 birkle et al 1998 ocavm 2014 4 2 simulation agreement with historical observations fig 8 shows the simulated changes in hydraulic head over time for selected wells in the basin which follow the general downward trend of the corresponding sets of observations overall model performance compares well with historical observations fig e 1 however a comparison between all simulated drawdown with observed drawdown shows better agreement in the alluvial formation with observed values than the other two formations fig e 2 this is confirmed in table e 1 in which the alluvial formation performs better than the other two formations in both the weighted and unweighted mean absolute error the reason for this discrepancy is twofold first the tarango and fractured basalt formations are more heterogeneous in composition than the alluvial formation and second the boundaries of the formation have some error associated with their placement which could indicate that a number of observation wells along the edges of the formations were incorrectly classified these results highlight the importance of calibrating spatially distributed variables within the modeling framework in the drawdown time series for the four wells shown in fig 8 the simulated changes in groundwater levels exhibit distinct differences across the geologic formations with the two wells in the alluvial formation a and b and the well in the fractured basalt formation c showing more gradual annual changes as compared to the well in the tarango formation d in addition comparison of model fluxes to more detailed studies of recharge discussed in section 2 confirm that the simulated groundwater recharge is in agreement with estimates for the area for example calibrated pumping rates were 36 4 m 3 s on average which is 13 4 lower than that reported by gómez reyes 2013 4 3 performance of aquifer management alternatives the three alternatives resulted in an average increase in storage over the basin of 5 00 m 3 s 5 10 m 3 s 5 31 m 3 s and 15 41 m 3 s for infiltration basins wastewater reuse repair leaks and combined respectively over the 30 year period table 3 palma nava et al 2015 report an overall basin deficit of 23 m 3 s for the valley of mexico watershed of which this study covers the southwest portion which would not be entirely overcome by the combined alternative change in storage of 15 41 m 3 s however as shown in fig 10 the year to year deficit in the southwest portion of the basin is overcome by the combined alternative although long term storage deficits within the basin were not addressed in this study it is important to note that the model period 1984 2013 has been part of an increasingly wet period which is uncertain to continue ibarraran 2011 therefore this model may not capture a likely drier climate scenario that would further exacerbate decreasing storage over time thus this model scenario may not represent a conservative estimate in terms of water supply reliability in the future when viewing the distribution of recharge throughout the basin fig 9 it is apparent that each aquifer recharge alternative has a unique spatial signature the wastewater reuse and repair leaks alternatives result in a more distributed change in hydraulic head over the basin while the recharge basins result in more localized changes in head these results also highlight the importance of accounting for geologic heterogeneity in regional scale supply planning as the tarango and andesitic formations experience much greater response when compared to the alluvial and fractured basalt formations despite the relatively equal recharge rates for each alternative in table 3 fig 9 indicates that the alternatives may result in spatially varied reductions in drawdown with corresponding impacts on management objectives an important aspect of this model is the incorporation of diverse spatial and temporal scales used to measure the planning objectives fig 6 each objective uses hydraulic head and a spatial filter to measure conflicting management priorities cumulative change in storage over the model period can be seen in fig 10 a the three management alternatives show similar total reduction in storage deficit over time as compared with the historical cumulative groundwater storage deficit with exception of the combined alternative which essentially sums the deficit savings of the other three alternatives however in fig 9 it is apparent that the repair leaks and increased wastewater infiltration alternatives exhibit more distributed increases in hydraulic head during the 1984 to 2014 model period than the recharge basin alternative with the combined alternative resulting in approximately twofold increases in the hydraulic head in comparison with the other three alternatives throughout the majority of the model area these differences in the distribution of hydraulic head are captured to varying degrees in the spatially and temporally computed objectives fig 10b among these objectives energy use and water quality maximize groundwater head while urban flooding avoidance minimizes hydraulic head additionally both the energy use and water quality objectives are spatially concentrated over the alluvial aquifer which has fairly evenly distributed hydraulic head changes in both the wastewater infiltration and repair leaks alternatives causing them to both outperform the historical and recharge basins alternatives however the combined alternative performs much better in relation to the other alternatives in the water quality objective when compared with its performance in the energy use objective this is likely a factor of the depth at which the water quality objective is being measured specifically the clay layer becomes thinner at the edges particularly in the northwest corner of the clay formation therefore hydraulic head must increase much more to surpass its elevation in those areas requiring the combined head increases from all three alternatives to improve further in this objective alternatively the pumping alternative is mostly concentrated along the western portion of the basin where there are more modest increases in hydraulic head compared to the historical conditions the repair leaks alternative should be expected to perform better than the wastewater and basin infiltration alternatives in the energy use objective because pumping is reduced at the exact locations where the energy use objective is measured the historical scenario minimizes urban flooding but only because it causes the greatest drawdown in urban areas the recharge basins alternative performs slightly better than both the wastewater reuse and leak repair alternatives in urban flooding likely a result of the proximity of wastewater treatment plants and pumping locations to urban areas while recharge basins are located away from urban areas as required by the model however the combined alternative performed much worse than any of the other alternatives locatelli et al 2017 found that stormwater infiltration when combined with increasing recharge from urbanization led to long term increases in the groundwater table and decreased the effectiveness of infiltration basins this is consistent with the warnings raised by bonneau et al 2017 that recharge efforts may lead to localized rises in the groundwater table a deficit in the current model is the lack of drainage points throughout the system to simulate discharge to surface water routes or ponds this could be contributing to an overestimate of groundwater mounding in certain areas of recharge which in turn may be causing the nonlinear increase in the urban groundwater flooding objective however this objective reveals that the implementation of managed aquifer recharge must be accompanied by mitigation of negative effects of flooding in vulnerable urban areas all three objectives are based on simulated head values across the model but they differ in the how they are aggregated spatially and temporally this analysis demonstrates that the spatial and temporal choices of how planning objectives are calculated can have significant impacts on infrastructure decisions 4 4 model uncertainty in the current model there is uncertainty associated with assumptions made to represent certain physical processes and uncertainty propagated from a lack of representation of important physical processes examples of assumptions made in the modeling process that could introduce large uncertainties include the calibration of parameters governing pumping flows leak infiltration precipitation recharge percentages and characteristics of the geologic formations within the basin these uncertainties would benefit from improved measurement or estimation of these properties going forward to resolve uncertainty associated with missing physical processes this model requires improved representation of existing surface and subsurface boundary conditions for example future models could incorporate the presence of seasonal springs in mountainous regions through the use of streamflow routing networks along known surface water routes these are particularly important given that marginalized populations have historically relied on surface sources for water supply in high population low income lakebed areas that are also prone to seasonal flooding the inclusion of such flow observations are important in any inverse modeling application and would help to better constrain the model particularly along the higher elevation boundaries for intra annual timescales similarly representation of subsidence processes and inclusion of subsidence observations would improve the physics and constraints of the model however such improvements to the modeled representation of physical processes and may significantly increase model run time additionally simulations of future land use and precipitation to plan going forward would need to include projected population and climate scenarios such integrated modeling has been used to model aquifer management alternatives hanson et al 2014 boyce et al 2019 and would allow for a more accurate multiobjective comparison for this basin uncertainties in the observations used to measure model error and calibrate the model are important to accurately representing historical groundwater and surface water flows while these uncertainties were accounted for in the weighting methods of calibration process there is always potential to not fully represent all possible sources of error in observation measurements one such source of uncertainty arises from the partial penetration of both observation and pumping wells to multiple hydrostratigraphic units such partial penetration of wells is common with the deep wells that are present in the basin and could lead to either false representation or lack of representation of local anomalies another source is the lack of information on the timing of the measurement of well water levels during the year given the intra annual changes in groundwater head at any point within the basin this uncertainty can cause the calibration effort to try to match values that are either too high or low based on the time of year that is being represented each of these uncertainties has an unknown effect on the final management objectives that would in turn affect decisions made with such a model finally this model does not dynamically represent decision making processes at the local level and instead relies on the assumption of a top down implementation of managed aquifer recharge alternatives through a centralized agency while this may be a realistic assumption given the current governance framework of ocavm uncertainties exist concerning available resources and level of cooperation at the local agency level such uncertainties could limit the full implementation of any of the alternatives proposed for example leaks may only be repaired in a single municipality or subsection of the water supply distribution network rather than evenly across the entire system 5 conclusions this study develops a modeling framework to analyze the effects of urban infrastructure on hydrogeological processes focusing on the case study of the mexico city metropolitan area mcma the inclusion of planning objectives that span varying spatial and temporal extents to properly understand the local effects of groundwater impact mitigation schemes can be a valuable addition to modeling efforts in urban hydrogeologic systems like the mcma a new accounting of the possible impact of leaks and land use types on recharge identifies the potential for managed recharge actions to improve aquifer sustainability results indicate that management alternatives improve groundwater storage and drawdown though with spatially distinct impacts over the historical period additionally the spatial distribution of the management objectives captures conflicting performance between the alternatives demonstrating the importance of not only the choice of management objectives but also the sub basin and temporal scale at which they are evaluated the measurement of the objectives using spatial components can help to tease out the effects of the spatial signature of management alternatives on the overall groundwater security of the basin future work will consider each of these objectives at the local municipality level to further analyze the spatial distribution of management impacts such an experiment would also allow for the application of objective weights based on other characteristics such as socio economic status or rural versus urban areas the set of objectives could also be expanded for an optimization problem to incorporate costs of infrastructure alternatives or the difficulty of implementing a given alternative there are limitations to evaluating alternatives using precipitation data from a thirty year model period that may leave out long term cycles of wet and dry climate patterns future studies could implement statistically or general circulation model gcm derived climate trends to evaluate recharge alternatives across ranges of reasonable precipitation the application of multiobjective analysis to models that include a more rigorous representation of hydrologic processes in the mcma including subsidence and surface water runoff would help to further test the limits and benefits of spatially defined planning objectives the continued refinement of this groundwater model will provide future research opportunities particularly in advancing our understanding of the behavior of urban aquifer systems at a regional scale and in the context of water supply risks faced by vulnerable populations within and at the periphery of urban areas the current model has been formulated to enable future spatial optimization studies in which combinations of interventions comprise a portfolio of management options an approach with broad applicability in other rapidly urbanizing regions dependent on groundwater supplies however a first step in providing valuable decision making information will be to account for the propagation of parameter uncertainties into groundwater management objectives calculated using these types of hydrologic models credit authorship contribution

files include over 30 land use and vegetation markers that vary from year to year which were homogenized into three overarching categories based on their potential for allowing infiltration of precipitation urban natural and water wetland the land use polygons were then compared to preprocessed landsat images to determine the extent of urban land use cover at 1990 2000 and 2010 landsat images were chosen from the full set of images available for the model area for one year prior to and during the year selected prioritizing images with low percentages of cloud cover usgs 2013 images were chosen in both the wet and dry season to compare visually determined land use type between the seasons the landsat images were preprocessed before classification as follows all images overlaying the model area were mosaicked into one image selecting the minimum value for any pixels which were represented in more than one image next any pixels with no data or data equal to 255 were filled to match surrounding data points that were between 0 and 255 the single bands were then converted to top of atmosphere toa reflectance and the dark object subtraction 1 dos1 method was applied as further atmospheric correction next the topographic shape map for urban infrastructure including parks medians and other greenspace was superimposed over the resulting map to exclude these features from the

5509,groundwater dependent cities face increasing population and changes in urban land use threatening long term aquifer sustainability by simultaneously increasing pumping demand while modifying recharge rates aquifer management involves a portfolio of alternatives to balance the sustainability of multiple water supply sources including novel recharge alternatives to supplement traditional groundwater and surface water sources however potential managed aquifer recharge solutions can lead to unintended consequences as modern infrastructure and management alter natural hydrology changing the underlying groundwater paradigm this study uses a multiobjective analysis approach to evaluate the performance of spatially distributed aquifer management alternatives for the mexico city metropolitan area mcma a region where the population has increased by 48 and urban land use by 35 in the last 30 years recharge alternatives are evaluated using a physically based groundwater model that incorporates land and water use trends and include repairs to the water supply distribution network increased wastewater treatment and infiltration and increased infiltration of imported water supplies these alternatives are compared according to planning objectives aggregated over three overlapping subregions within the model to minimize energy use for pumping minimize water quality risks in subsidence prone areas and minimize groundwater flooding in urban areas results indicate that management alternatives resulting in equivalent changes in storage can exhibit spatially distinct reductions in drawdown over the historical period additionally combining multiple alternatives results in a more than an additive risk of groundwater flooding demonstrating the need for mitigation of rising water tables this model will serve as the basis for future spatial optimization studies under future climate and land use scenarios these approaches have broad applicability in other rapidly urbanizing regions dependent on groundwater supplies keywords groundwater urbanization land use change managed aquifer recharge mexico city 1 introduction globally urban areas have grown rapidly compared to rural areas particularly in megacities with populations greater than ten million united nations 2016 this in combination with climate variability over time has led to overexploitation of both surface water and groundwater worldwide vörösmarty et al 2000 groundwater is increasingly relied on for water supply during times of shortage placing stress on urban aquifers both in developing and industrialized countries urban groundwater is threatened by unsustainable pumping and contamination from surface and subsurface sources reducing its ability to meet rising demands foster et al 1998 mcdonald et al 2014 expanding urban land cover amplifies these risks by increasing impervious surface area affecting infiltration runoff evapotranspiration recharge and ultimately regional groundwater capture alley and leake 2004 these hydrologic changes may require megacities to seek additional sources of local surface water or consider costly imports jacobson 2011 as conventional water supply and sanitation infrastructure with high capital and operating costs have failed to adapt to changing climate and demographic forces managed aquifer recharge infrastructure and water management solutions have been advocated to mitigate local flooding vulnerabilities regulate surface water runoff and groundwater quality and increase groundwater infiltration to urban aquifers dahlke et al 2018 roy poirier et al 2010 as watersheds globally become more urbanized hydrologic and hydrogeologic models used to support water resources planning must incorporate human impacts on several key dynamics of the water cycle and water quality brath et al 2006 thompson et al 2013 for example urban expansion can increase recharge because losses from decreased precipitation are offset by increases from irrigation with imported water water supply distribution system leakage and infiltration from unlined wastewater systems lawrence et al 1998 alternatively sewer systems have also been shown to remove significant precipitation recharge braud et al 2013 which can result in an overall negative effect on the urban groundwater budget depending on site specific characteristics increased groundwater abstraction in urban areas can also cause ancillary impacts including subsidence ortiz zamora and ortega guerrero 2010 and subsequent ground ruptures frigo et al 2019 as well as flood risks resulting from damaged infrastructure and settling jago on et al 2009 finally urbanization also poses water quality threats from concentrated pollutants in stormwater wastewater and landscape and agricultural runoff lerner 2004 which can enter shallow unconfined aquifers via infiltration and confined aquifers via fractures or well boreholes huizar alvarez et al 2004 the potential for aquifer management to provide solutions for these risks to urban groundwater security is high given the diversity of alternative water supplies and management tools available page et al 2018 however the interactions between such solutions and the natural hydrogeologic system may lead to unintended consequences li et al 2017 maliva 2020 as regional scale hydrologeologic modeling has progressed in large metropolitan areas experts have stressed that a simple determination of safe yield from an aquifer rather than a more detailed analysis of the dynamic processes governing groundwater availability within a basin is necessary to properly inform decision making dendrou 1982 bredehoeft 2002 more recent urban water modeling efforts have included extensive integrated modeling to provide robust groundwater models hanson et al 2012 hanson et al 2014 hanson 2015 in these frameworks a hydrologic model can incorporate economic climate energy ecological and land use components and represent distinct anthropogenic processes such as impervious surfaces groundwater storage residential water use urban irrigation wastewater treatment and storage and leakage from water distribution and collection infrastructure bach et al 2014 mitchell et al 2001 hanson et al 2014 however though regional scale planning efforts can alleviate general sustainability concerns they may not consider distributional impacts particularly in economically marginalized districts where urban growth is often concentrated baker 2012 specifically while regional planning decisions may provide water supply needed to support urban growth in the aggregate stresses may be unevenly distributed across finer spatial scales creating challenging trade offs daw et al 2011 understanding the coupled dynamics of subsurface hydrology urban land use and water consumption is key to ensuring sustainable groundwater management in metropolitan areas tellman et al 2018 in cities facing rapid urbanization spatially distributed analysis of planning objectives at multiple scales can help to achieve reliable water access across districts varis et al 2006 for example reichard et al 2010 evaluated potential groundwater management options in emergency groundwater use based on the costs associated with negative impacts from intensive groundwater extraction however the problem often requires a multiobjective comparison of spatially distributed aquifer management alternatives to demonstrate the conflicts that arise in planning for complex systems in this study we develop a physically based groundwater model that incorporates land use change water supply infrastructure and pumping trends for the mexico city metropolitan area mcma as a case study to examine the effects of the choice of spatial and temporal dimensions for the calculation of objectives on preferred aquifer management alternatives 2 case study the mcma lies within the southwestern portion of the valley of mexico watershed fig 1 characterized by volcanic peaks surrounding a high plains basin ocavm 2014 until roughly 300 years ago there were four natural lakes present in the valley forming an aquifer system which comprised a saturated lakebed overlying alluvial sediment and volcanic rock formations gonzález morán et al 1999 the first large scale drainage project el gran canal del desagüe was completed in 1900 today along with the deep drainage system it carries untreated stormwater and wastewater out of the expanding urban area sacm 2012 like many metropolitan areas around the world the hydrologic cycle of the mcma has been altered substantially with the introduction of inter basin water and wastewater conveyance infrastructure the alteration of land surface properties in high density human settlements and the overdraft of groundwater resources from 1980 to 2015 urban land cover expanded significantly fig 4c driven by a population that nearly doubled during the same period conapo 2014 exploitation of the productive aquifers in the center of the metropolitan area has occurred at varying rates since the discovery of potable groundwater in the valley in 1846 national research council et al 1995 today the city depends on underlying alluvial and volcanic aquifers for 58 of its water supply which has caused the water table to decline throughout the city leading to increased energy costs for pumping water quality concerns and land subsidence ocavm 2014 a number of studies have estimated various components of the total water budget in both the larger valley of mexico watershed as well as the smaller mcma dgcoh 1997 birkle et al 1998 carrera hernández and gaskin 2008 gómez reyes 2013 the major flows in the mcma urban hydrologic system are shown in fig 2 along with how they are represented in the modeling framework developed for this study the drinking water supply to the valley of mexico includes a complex administrative structure for water management in which regional state and local agencies interact the national water commission conagua administrates water supply at the national level it acts at the regional level through the organismo de cuenca aguas del valle

mexico water commission caem is the agency that provides water for the state of mexico municipalities some of which also have local operating agencies banco interamericano de desarrollo 2012 escolero et al 2016 in practice decisions are made at the federal level within ocavm to distribute supplies within the basin including wells in the immediate action plan program pai and find and manage water sources from outside of the basin including the lerma well system and the cutzamala reservoir system ocavm 2014 conagua 2005 the characteristics of the basin allow for the testing of novel parameterizations of urban aquifer components under traditional groundwater modeling frameworks previous basin wide groundwater modeling efforts have included local water infrastructure such as pumping rates and water supply distribution system leaks as well as zonal geologic and recharge quantities herrera zamarrón et al 2005 however sensitivity analysis and calibration efforts did not incorporate the effects of time varied land use change annual and intra annual precipitation or pumping data lopez alvis 2014 galán breth 2019 palma nava et al 2015 proposed an integrated spatially distributed groundwater model that incorporates both subsidence and climate modeling for the mcma system but did not consider the siting and evaluation of recharge infrastructure alternatives 3 methods 3 1 groundwater model inputs one of the most commonly used groundwater modeling code libraries is modflow a modular finite difference quasi 3d flow model developed by the us geological survey which relies on a number of packages to represent different boundary conditions harbaugh 2006 modflow provides a suitable environment to simulate historical and future conditions perform sensitivity analyses uncertainty estimations and generate alternative scenarios via a comprehensive suite of modules given its widespread use and modular nature modflow serves as an appropriate tool to construct a complex urban groundwater model with the difficulty in the modeling process arising from the representation of the various natural and anthropogenic fluxes the scale and complexity of the model can lead to dramatic increases in runtime making groundwater models challenging to run iteratively as required for many optimization routines however the modular nature of modflow allows researchers to add complexity incrementally evaluating the trade offs between the accuracy of the physical representation and the runtime of the simulation zhou and li 2011 the numerical model was developed in python and solved using modflow model datasets and workflow shown in fig 3 based on the conceptual model of the aquifers in the southwestern portion of the valley of mexico watershed proposed by galán breth 2019 lopez alvis 2014 herrera zamarrón et al 2005 herrera revilla et al 1994 the model contains two vertical layers and 500 by 500 meter grid cells in a model grid space 84 km east to west and 67 km north to south the simulation period is from 1984 to 2013 with daily time steps and monthly or annually varied data using the modflow stress period set to a monthly format the modular nature of modflow allows each physical component of the groundwater system to be represented using a generalized package type with most components defined in specified flux packages modular packages were populated using publicly available and institutional datasets described below which were preprocessed in python and qgis bakker et al 2016 3 1 1 model layers and hydrostratigraphic units the model has two numerical layers table 1 and fig 4 show the relation of these layers with the hydrostratigraphic units and the geologic structure of the model area the surface layer represents the clay unit which ranges from 5 to 150 meters thick and has the hydraulic properties of an aquitard it covers about 25 of the total model surface area the second numerical layer represents the primary aquifer which underlies the first layer where it is present herrera zamarrón et al 2005 geologic data was obtained from the mexican national institute of statistics and geography inegi geology inventory inegi 2002 the dataset was simplified into six main geologic formations based on work done by lopez alvis 2014 and herrera zamarrón et al 2005 hydraulic conductivities and model layers were initialized based on

groundwater models of the valley use an approximation of the watershed boundary of the southwestern portion of the valley of mexico watershed as the natural groundwater basin delineation based on the assumption that the surrounding mountain ranges create a natural groundwater divide ortega and farvolden 1989 gonzález morán et al 1999 the inegi delineated watershed was used in this study inegi 2010

using cubic spline interpolation in qgis for each month over the 30 year period from 1984 to 2013 rainfall is concentrated in the southwestern area due to orographic effects of the volcanic mountain range demonstrated in 4d which shows the average rainfall at each station for the month of july interpolated over the model area 3 1 4 land use spatially distributed time varied land use data is used in this model to assign both recharge percentages from precipitation zonal recharge in d 1 and incidental recharge from leaks in the water supply distribution system described in section 3 1 5 based on growth trends and data availability land use data was chosen for 1990 2000 and 2010 to represent 1984 1993 1994 2004 and 2005 2013 respectively these model periods are used throughout time varied data in the model an extensive gis analysis was applied to classify land use types into three categories urban natural and water wetland land use percentages for each model cell were calculated based on remote sensing images as described in appendix b each land use category was then assigned an initial infiltration multiplier to be calibrated the monthly precipitation was multiplied by the percentage of each land use by cell and the multiplier for each land use type then summed over all land uses to achieve 100 coverage potential monthly infiltration was then divided by the days in the month and applied as recharge for each daily time step as 100 on all geologic formations except over the lacustrine aquitard where it is applied at 1 of that value 3 1 5 water supply distribution system leaks potential recharge from water infrastructure is a well known component of the urban water cycle but can vary significantly in magnitude for each component depending on local infrastructure maintenance and conditions lerner 1990 in the mcma leaks in the water supply distribution network are estimated to account for between 20 and 55 of water use by municipality or delegation dgcoh 1997 national research council et al 1995 a portion of these leaks is assumed to recharge the underlying aquifers depending on local water use land use type and geologic subsurface material interviews with engineers and administrators at the national water commission have suggested that there is a large potential for reductions in groundwater pumping if leaks were controlled using improved operation and maintenance thus including leaks as parameterized objects during the calibration process was necessary to allow for a reduction in leaks as an aquifer management alternative we considered leaks in the metropolitan area to be a function of total water supply distributed through the public system herrera zamarrón et al 2005 since groundwater supply was calibrated in the model the total quantity of water use was calculated as the sum of the calibrated pumping and an estimation of other historical water sources in the basin these sources are listed in c 1 and summed to 16 7 m 3 s 28 0 m 3 s and 33 5 m 3 s for the three model periods defined above appendix d national research council et al 1995 mazari and mackay 1993 ocavm 2014 torres bernardino 2014 these values were used to calculate groundwater pumping as g t o where g is local groundwater t is total water use and o is other supplies for each of the model phases 1990 2000 and 2010 the calibrated value of t was then multiplied by the percentage of water usage per municipality reported in dgcoh 1997 to get a total water use by municipality previous research by the mexico city department of hydraulic construction and operations estimated leaks to be between 27 and 58 of total water distribution for 25 of the 41 municipalities and delegations total water distribution of municipalities in the state of mexico was estimated to have losses of 35 based on the average losses to leaks in federal district delegations with similar characteristics these values for leaks from the system shown in 5 were applied to the total water use for each municipality any urban leaks occurring over the lacustrine layer were considered to not contribute to recharge of the underlying aquifer based on the low permeability of the confining layer dgcoh 1997 and the presence of preferential flow paths provided by the urban drainage system bonneau et al 2017 a multiplier of 1 was applied to each model period which would allow for calibration of the multiplier if the parameters were found to be sensitive in the model an infiltration parameter of 10 was included as a calibration parameter assuming that preferential flow paths to the sewer and evaporation reduce the total infiltration of potential leak recharge 3 1 6 well pumping well pumping data for the region can be separated into two main categories municipal pumping rates gathered on a monthly or yearly basis and well concessions data indicating a single maximum allowable pumping rate the combined pumping data for 2005 are shown in fig 4b municipal data consists of one dataset of monthly pumping data for municipal wells in the mexico city service area and one dataset of yearly pumping data for municipal wells in the state of mexico conagua 2017 caem 2011 both municipal datasets were assumed to be accurate and were not modified in the calibration process georeferenced well pumping concessions data for the study site is available beginning in 1983 from the public register of water rights repda hosted by the national water commission conagua 2013 since the repda data does not include information about time varied quantities nor when the wells were installed the total quantity and the distribution of pumping was assumed to be unknown but able to be calibrated from the properties of the dataset to determine the total quantity a total water use multiplier was applied one for each of the three model periods to an initial estimate for pumping then the other water supplies defined in section 3 1 5 plus the known municipal pumping were subtracted from this estimate to obtain the remaining groundwater pumping d 1 pumping distribution in the basin has shifted from high pumping in the historical downtown region to pumping in the surrounding areas national research council et al 1995 to mimic this trend the wells in the repda dataset were separated into two groups historical downtown and peripheral next a multiplier was applied to only the downtown repda wells with the peripheral wells calculated as the remaining quantity from the difference of the calibrated groundwater pumping and the urban repda set 3 2 sensitivity analysis and model calibration a fundamental aspect of groundwater model construction is evaluation of the model against observed conditions inverse modeling is generally considered a valuable tool to tune model characteristics using observations hill et al 2016 calibration with inverse modeling is based on the principle that model parameters are either difficult to determine in the field at the scale that has been selected or cannot be directly measured or estimated from the information available foglia et al 2009 mclaughlin and townley 1996 the first step is the parameterization of model characteristics so that the potentially infinite number of values to be adjusted over time and space are reduced to a limited number of variables to evaluate we performed sensitivity analyses and parameter estimation using ucode 2014 poeter et al 2014 which employs a weighted least squares objective function to compare model simulated values to observations provided as in any calibration process the quality of the observations is important in determining which observations will lead to the most accurate representation of the system these errors or uncertainties are represented in the modeling process by applying a weight to the observation in the objective function once the weights are determined a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the model error with respect to perturbation of the initial parameter values to select a smaller group of parameters that are most sensitive hill and tiedeman 2007 the composite scaled sensitivity combined with the evaluation of parameters correlations is used to evaluate the parameters that contribute the largest changes to the weighted sum of squared error between the observations and their simulated equivalent finally an iterative process is completed whereby the parameters are perturbed locally and the weighted sum of squared error is calculated for each parameter calibration until an acceptable tolerance is met 3 2 1 observations an initial set of 669 historical groundwater observation wells were obtained from the national water commission after an initial review the data was determined to contain various irregularities that would impede the proper calibration of the model as such wells that exhibited a difference in water level of 20 m or more from one year to the next were reviewed to see if the fluctuation was persistent and or representative of behavior in nearby wells the wells were filtered to contain only one observation well per model grid cell and exclude any well observation sets with erratic behaviour as compared to nearby wells wells were chosen first by highest number of observations and then proximity to cell center each well dataset has between one and 30 years of yearly water level measurements however there is limited information on the time of year or conditions in which the observations were taken this yielded a total of 531 wells with 6896 unique observations over the 30 year historical model period to set the initial hydraulic head throughout the model area the 132 observations from 1984 were interpolated using ordinary kriging with a spherical variogram model of the remaining 6764 observations 531 were used as initial head values and the rest were used as drawdown observations to perform the sensitivity analysis and calibration weights for each observation were assigned based on the relative confidence in the quality of the observation following lopez alvis 2014 and galán breth 2019 error is introduced by uncertainties associated with well elevation well position non simulated transitory processes sampling and model discretization according to the following calculations 1 error in the elevation of the well 1 σ 1 dem r h 4 2 r v 4 2 dem a m 4 2 where dem is the gradient of the digital elevation model dem r h is the horizontal resolution of the dem 5 m r v is the vertical resolution of the dem 1 m

geologic time varied infrastructure zonal recharge and conductance the 33 model parameters are shown in d 1 including horizontal hydraulic conductivity vertical anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity specific storage specific yield pumping leak percentage total water use land use recharge and leak infiltration lower and upper bounds for the zonal geologic parameters were selected based on previous studies in the area and accepted values in the literature which were used as constraints for those parameters during the calibration process singhal et al 1999 galán breth 2019 lopez alvis 2014 herrera zamarrón et al 2005 temporal variations in groundwater pumping and leaks from the water supply distribution system were separated into three model phases 1984 1993 1993 2005 and 2005 2014 chosen based on the availability of land use imagery land use multipliers were assigned to urban natural or water wetland land use types parameters were selected for perturbation in two stages first as a confined system to determine approximate parameter values and then as a convertible confined unconfined system to determine final parameter values for each stage a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the most sensitive parameters and any parameter correlations parameters to be calibrated were selected and the weighted sum of squares was minimized to determine the final calibrated parameters 3 3 application of management alternatives managed aquifer recharge offers a variety of infrastructure and policy options to increase infiltration into over drafted aquifers and promote conjunctive use of alternative water supply sources dahlke et al 2018 in the mcma a number of aquifer management alternatives have been proposed to mitigate the effects of intensive groundwater use and the alteration of the natural hydrologic regimes including demand reduction schemes as well as managed aquifer recharge demand reduction within the valley of mexico could include exchange of fresh water for treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation reduction of leaks in the water supply distribution network substitution of imported sources for local groundwater sources and redistribution of pumping to reduce pumping at problem zones palma nava et al 2015 ocavm 2014 herrera zamarrón et al 2005 alternatively there are many possible managed aquifer recharge projects for the mcma including infiltration basins injection of treated wastewater and decentralized infiltration at the household scale with low impact development design for this study three alternatives with varying spatial extents were chosen for multiobjective analysis increased infiltration of imported water supply fig 5a increased wastewater treatment and infiltration fig 5b and repairs to the water supply distribution network fig 5c representing centralized regionally centralized and decentralized interventions respectively the spatial dimension of the recharge problem adds a degree of complexity the planning and design problem requires selecting not only infrastructure capacities but also their locations numerical representation of the recharge alternatives requires data describing infrastructure including the location and capacity of existing wastewater treatment facilities and the location of existing surface water conveyance routes these data were collected from publicly available planning documents and gis databases and implemented as described in this section negi 2017 ocavm 2014 riveros olivares 2013 in the development of this model the management alternatives and supply policies are assumed to be implemented by centralized decision makers with no dynamic model for interaction between basin agencies the historical condition the three management alternatives described below and an alternative comprising all three management alternatives were analyzed by calculating the cumulative change in storage as well as the spatially aggregated planning objectives defined in section 3 4 cumulative change in storage δ s was calculated as the sum of the difference between model inflows including precipitation recharge r and water supply network leaks l and model outflow from groundwater well pumping w over all stress periods t 7 δ s t 1 360 r t l t w t 3 3 1 infiltration basins the cutzamala reservoir system is the main source of imported water for the mcma conagua 2005 de nys et al 2015 suggest that up to 5 m 3 s of supply could be yielded from reoperation of the reservoir system while birkle et al 1998 calculate a potential of 17 6 m 3 s of local surface water for use within the basin other studies of potential import supplies show that there is economic interest in bringing more external sources into the system however new surface reservoirs to store such sources may be limited given the growing urban areas ocavm 2014 this alternative proposes the implementation of five randomly placed surface infiltration basins to recharge the underlying aquifers at 1 m3 s based on similar basins installed in other urban aquifers dahlke et al 2018 sites were selected from a complete set of evenly spaced points along existing surface water conveyance infrastructure that connects to the cutzamala reservoir system fig 5a the points were filtered such that only one potential site was allowed per model cell and no sites were allowed in cells exceeding the elevation at the cutzamala inlet 2600 meters above sea level in urban areas nor above the lacustrine layer 3 3 2 wastewater reuse at existing treatment plants there are 74 existing wastewater treatment plants within the model area a majority of which are operating at less than their installed capacity due to substandard maintenance and operation practices riveros olivares 2013 the 2015 inventory for wastewater treatment plants was used to determine the installed capacity and the current operating capacity conagua 2015 the difference between these values was then added as recharge to the aquifer layer assuming all repairs and operations modifications were made to improve the amount of treated water produced at each plant this simple difference does not account for infiltration inefficiencies evapotranspiration nor conveyance losses making this estimate an upper bound for this recharge potential however less than 10 of wastewater is currently treated within the valley sosa rodriguez 2010 indicating that there is a indeed a much higher overall potential for wastewater reuse within the valley than what is represented in the wastewater reuse management alternative implemented in this model 3 3 3 repair to leaks in potable supply distribution network in the final alternative the recharge from leaks was reduced while simultaneously decreasing pumping this was achieved by applying a leak persistence percentage factor between 0 and 1 a value of 1 indicates that the leaks are present at 100 of the historical value while a value of 0 indicates that all the leaks have been fixed the pumping quantities were reduced at the municipal or delegation scale by applying eq 8 depending on the base leak percent per municipality of the total water pumped as described in section 2 2 5 8 t n t 1 p l 1 l p where t n is the new total pumping t is the initial total pumping p l is the percentage of leak as a total of the total pumping by municipality and l p is the leak persistence percentage all water use savings were assumed to reduce groundwater pumping representing a form of demand management and resulting in an overall increase in storage within the basin the difference between the new groundwater pumping g n and the original groundwater pumping g and the difference between t n and t are equivalent 9 g n g t n t thus using substitution and algebraic methods as described in appendix b the ratio of the new groundwater pumping to the original groundwater pumping is 10 g n g t 1 p l 1 l p s t s which is then applied to all pumping wells within a municipality or delegation this application could later be used to apply varying degrees of repairs to each municipality or delegation individually 3 4 calculation of planning objectives urban water supply planning is inherently a multiobjective problem as long term sustainability generally conflicts with net present cost as well as future revenue streams for stakeholders reliant on the water sector in such cases no single optimal solution exists but rather a set of pareto optimal solutions where one objective can only be improved by worsening another banzhaf 2009 these challenges motivate the need for novel methods to identify the tradeoffs between multiple conflicting objectives that arise in the design of aquifer management portfolios in urban settings in this case three management objectives are defined to demonstrate the reliance of any given management objective on spatial context minimize water supply pumping energy use minimize water quality risks in subsidence prone areas and minimize flooding potential in urban areas this multiobjective approach allows several advantages first objectives are not required to be aggregated using commensurate units of utility which may be difficult in systems with many stakeholders with conflicting preferences cohon and marks 1975 second a weighted aggregation approach results in a single preferred alternative without fully capturing the range of performance in all objectives that may lead to a change in preference bond et al 2008 the following planning objectives were calculated separately for the historical condition the three management alternatives and the combined management alternatives 3 4 1 minimize energy use falling groundwater tables result in costs relating to increased energy costs to pump deeper water and or the cost of drilling deeper wells this objective estimates a lower bound for energy use associated with pumping in wells by calculating the amount of energy required to lift the quantity of groundwater pumped per day from the head elevation in the cell of the pumping well to the land surface over all wells this objective was calculated in kilowatt hours kwh given n wells is the set of all pumping wells is the conversion factor from lift to kwh d is the number of days in month t h surface is the elevation of the land surface and h well is the hydraulic head at the location of well w then the energy measure e is 11 e t 25 360 w 1 n wells d h surface h well 3 4 2 minimize water quality risks in subsidence prone areas subsidence in mexico city contributes to many potential problems for water supply planners in the region in addition to infrastructure damage there are also major water quality concerns that have arisen as the water table underneath the confining clay layer has fallen huizar alvarez et al 2016 the reversal of the hydraulic gradient as the confined aquifer beneath the clay layer becomes unconfined threatens water security via two primary mechanisms first as the potentiometric surface of the confined aquifer falls below the bottom of the confining layer discharge from the chloride rich aquitard increases to the good quality aquifer ortega guerrero et al 1993 secondly in a confined aquifer with a potentiometric surface above the land surface the flow in the system is upward however as the hydraulic head drops below the surface poor quality water from the surface including sewage and stormwater runoff flows downward through fractures caused by subsidence and poorly managed boreholes huizar alvarez et al 2004 the water quality risk measure was defined as the percent of confined cells with a potentiometric surface below the elevation of the bottom of the confining layer during the last year of the model period given n clay is the set of lacustrine model cells h surface is the elevation of the bottom of the confining layer and h clay is the hydraulic head in the aquifer below the confining payer at time t then the water quality risk measure w is 12 w 1 12 n clay c 1 n clay t 348 360 h t c surface h c clay 3 4 3 minimize groundwater flooding in urban areas mexico city like other urban areas built in low lying regions suffers from flooding that arises from a variety of mechanisms these mechanisms can be separated into two main categories overland flooding and groundwater flooding abboud et al 2018 the former overflow of rivers or canals has been studied and addressed extensively while the latter the emergence of groundwater through rising water tables has largely been overlooked both worldwide and in mexico city abboud et al 2018 aragón durand 2007 groundwater flooding can occur in three main forms short term rising water tables in shallow yet permeable aquifers long term rising water tables in unconfined aquifers and return of water tables to preindustrial levels in historically depleted aquifers macdonald et al 2008 in addition to exacerbating surface flooding conditions groundwater flooding can cause significant structural damages to buildings and public infrastructure toll et al 2012 to address this risk the groundwater flooding objective was defined as the percent of the total urban area over the model period that contained a hydraulic head above the land surface given c urban is the set of model cells with urban land cover c flood is the set of model cells with urban land cover that are flooded at time t and a urban is the percent urban area in the model cell then the urban flooding measure f is 13 f t 25 360 u 1 c flood a urban t 25 360 u 1 c urban a urban 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and parameter sensitivities composite scaled sensitivities are shown for the fifteen most sensitive of the thirty three model parameters in fig 7 for stage 1 and stage 2 of the calibration process the parameter correlation coefficients for stage 1 and stage 2 are shown in table 2 based on the parameter correlations the vertical anisotropy of the clay formation was not included in the calibration process because it was highly correlated with the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the clay layer the eight most sensitive parameters were calibrated in stage 1 fig 7a while in stage 2 the thirteen most sensitive parameters were calibrated fig 7b the composite scaled sensitivities of the resulting parameter set is shown in 7c the total water use parameters are the three most sensitive parameters in the set indicating the importance of incorporating time varied water use factors blue into hydrogeologic modeling this could be a result of these parameters acting as scale factors that exert influence over many pumping cells together rather than individually thus making them more dominant parameters the zonal geologic parameters orange follow with the clay basalt alluvial and tarango formations being the most sensitive this may be a factor of the location of the observations available given that there are no observations located in the andesitic formation next of the remaining time varied infrastructure parameters blue we can see that all three urban pumping parameters are among the most sensitive parameters for stages 1 and 2 with the third urban pumping parameter dropping out of the top fifteen for the final sensitivity analysis which highlights the spatial factor of the pumping and the expected shift from urban to periurban pumping finally the recharge infiltration multiplier is the only zonal recharge parameter green among the most sensitive parameters this is likely a result of a combination of the concentration of precipitation in natural areas the higher infiltration rates experienced under natural land cover and the large percentage of area represented by the natural land cover the fifteen most sensitive parameters chosen for parameter estimation were horizontal hydraulic conductivity for the clay alluvial tarango and fractured basalt formations specific storage for the alluvial formation all three urban pumping multipliers all three total water use multipliers the recharge multiplier for the natural land use type and specific yield for the alluvial tarango and fractured basalt formations the parameters initial values and calibrated results are shown in table d 1 the values calculated for pumping and recharge fluxes are consistent with the ranges reported in the literature gómez reyes 2013 birkle et al 1998 ocavm 2014 4 2 simulation agreement with historical observations fig 8 shows the simulated changes in hydraulic head over time for selected wells in the basin which follow the general downward trend of the corresponding sets of observations overall model performance compares well with historical observations fig e 1 however a comparison between all simulated drawdown with observed drawdown shows better agreement in the alluvial formation with observed values than the other two formations fig e 2 this is confirmed in table e 1 in which the alluvial formation performs better than the other two formations in both the weighted and unweighted mean absolute error the reason for this discrepancy is twofold first the tarango and fractured basalt formations are more heterogeneous in composition than the alluvial formation and second the boundaries of the formation have some error associated with their placement which could indicate that a number of observation wells along the edges of the formations were incorrectly classified these results highlight the importance of calibrating spatially distributed variables within the modeling framework in the drawdown time series for the four wells shown in fig 8 the simulated changes in groundwater levels exhibit distinct differences across the geologic formations with the two wells in the alluvial formation a and b and the well in the fractured basalt formation c showing more gradual annual changes as compared to the well in the tarango formation d in addition comparison of model fluxes to more detailed studies of recharge discussed in section 2 confirm that the simulated groundwater recharge is in agreement with estimates for the area for example calibrated pumping rates were 36 4 m 3 s on average which is 13 4 lower than that reported by gómez reyes 2013 4 3 performance of aquifer management alternatives the three alternatives resulted in an average increase in storage over the basin of 5 00 m 3 s 5 10 m 3 s 5 31 m 3 s and 15 41 m 3 s for infiltration basins wastewater reuse repair leaks and combined respectively over the 30 year period table 3 palma nava et al 2015 report an overall basin deficit of 23 m 3 s for the valley of mexico watershed of which this study covers the southwest portion which would not be entirely overcome by the combined alternative change in storage of 15 41 m 3 s however as shown in fig 10 the year to year deficit in the southwest portion of the basin is overcome by the combined alternative although long term storage deficits within the basin were not addressed in this study it is important to note that the model period 1984 2013 has been part of an increasingly wet period which is uncertain to continue ibarraran 2011 therefore this model may not capture a likely drier climate scenario that would further exacerbate decreasing storage over time thus this model scenario may not represent a conservative estimate in terms of water supply reliability in the future when viewing the distribution of recharge throughout the basin fig 9 it is apparent that each aquifer recharge alternative has a unique spatial signature the wastewater reuse and repair leaks alternatives result in a more distributed change in hydraulic head over the basin while the recharge basins result in more localized changes in head these results also highlight the importance of accounting for geologic heterogeneity in regional scale supply planning as the tarango and andesitic formations experience much greater response when compared to the alluvial and fractured basalt formations despite the relatively equal recharge rates for each alternative in table 3 fig 9 indicates that the alternatives may result in spatially varied reductions in drawdown with corresponding impacts on management objectives an important aspect of this model is the incorporation of diverse spatial and temporal scales used to measure the planning objectives fig 6 each objective uses hydraulic head and a spatial filter to measure conflicting management priorities cumulative change in storage over the model period can be seen in fig 10 a the three management alternatives show similar total reduction in storage deficit over time as compared with the historical cumulative groundwater storage deficit with exception of the combined alternative which essentially sums the deficit savings of the other three alternatives however in fig 9 it is apparent that the repair leaks and increased wastewater infiltration alternatives exhibit more distributed increases in hydraulic head during the 1984 to 2014 model period than the recharge basin alternative with the combined alternative resulting in approximately twofold increases in the hydraulic head in comparison with the other three alternatives throughout the majority of the model area these differences in the distribution of hydraulic head are captured to varying degrees in the spatially and temporally computed objectives fig 10b among these objectives energy use and water quality maximize groundwater head while urban flooding avoidance minimizes hydraulic head additionally both the energy use and water quality objectives are spatially concentrated over the alluvial aquifer which has fairly evenly distributed hydraulic head changes in both the wastewater infiltration and repair leaks alternatives causing them to both outperform the historical and recharge basins alternatives however the combined alternative performs much better in relation to the other alternatives in the water quality objective when compared with its performance in the energy use objective this is likely a factor of the depth at which the water quality objective is being measured specifically the clay layer becomes thinner at the edges particularly in the northwest corner of the clay formation therefore hydraulic head must increase much more to surpass its elevation in those areas requiring the combined head increases from all three alternatives to improve further in this objective alternatively the pumping alternative is mostly concentrated along the western portion of the basin where there are more modest increases in hydraulic head compared to the historical conditions the repair leaks alternative should be expected to perform better than the wastewater and basin infiltration alternatives in the energy use objective because pumping is reduced at the exact locations where the energy use objective is measured the historical scenario minimizes urban flooding but only because it causes the greatest drawdown in urban areas the recharge basins alternative performs slightly better than both the wastewater reuse and leak repair alternatives in urban flooding likely a result of the proximity of wastewater treatment plants and pumping locations to urban areas while recharge basins are located away from urban areas as required by the model however the combined alternative performed much worse than any of the other alternatives locatelli et al 2017 found that stormwater infiltration when combined with increasing recharge from urbanization led to long term increases in the groundwater table and decreased the effectiveness of infiltration basins this is consistent with the warnings raised by bonneau et al 2017 that recharge efforts may lead to localized rises in the groundwater table a deficit in the current model is the lack of drainage points throughout the system to simulate discharge to surface water routes or ponds this could be contributing to an overestimate of groundwater mounding in certain areas of recharge which in turn may be causing the nonlinear increase in the urban groundwater flooding objective however this objective reveals that the implementation of managed aquifer recharge must be accompanied by mitigation of negative effects of flooding in vulnerable urban areas all three objectives are based on simulated head values across the model but they differ in the how they are aggregated spatially and temporally this analysis demonstrates that the spatial and temporal choices of how planning objectives are calculated can have significant impacts on infrastructure decisions 4 4 model uncertainty in the current model there is uncertainty associated with assumptions made to represent certain physical processes and uncertainty propagated from a lack of representation of important physical processes examples of assumptions made in the modeling process that could introduce large uncertainties include the calibration of parameters governing pumping flows leak infiltration precipitation recharge percentages and characteristics of the geologic formations within the basin these uncertainties would benefit from improved measurement or estimation of these properties going forward to resolve uncertainty associated with missing physical processes this model requires improved representation of existing surface and subsurface boundary conditions for example future models could incorporate the presence of seasonal springs in mountainous regions through the use of streamflow routing networks along known surface water routes these are particularly important given that marginalized populations have historically relied on surface sources for water supply in high population low income lakebed areas that are also prone to seasonal flooding the inclusion of such flow observations are important in any inverse modeling application and would help to better constrain the model particularly along the higher elevation boundaries for intra annual timescales similarly representation of subsidence processes and inclusion of subsidence observations would improve the physics and constraints of the model however such improvements to the modeled representation of physical processes and may significantly increase model run time additionally simulations of future land use and precipitation to plan going forward would need to include projected population and climate scenarios such integrated modeling has been used to model aquifer management alternatives hanson et al 2014 boyce et al 2019 and would allow for a more accurate multiobjective comparison for this basin uncertainties in the observations used to measure model error and calibrate the model are important to accurately representing historical groundwater and surface water flows while these uncertainties were accounted for in the weighting methods of calibration process there is always potential to not fully represent all possible sources of error in observation measurements one such source of uncertainty arises from the partial penetration of both observation and pumping wells to multiple hydrostratigraphic units such partial penetration of wells is common with the deep wells that are present in the basin and could lead to either false representation or lack of representation of local anomalies another source is the lack of information on the timing of the measurement of well water levels during the year given the intra annual changes in groundwater head at any point within the basin this uncertainty can cause the calibration effort to try to match values that are either too high or low based on the time of year that is being represented each of these uncertainties has an unknown effect on the final management objectives that would in turn affect decisions made with such a model finally this model does not dynamically represent decision making processes at the local level and instead relies on the assumption of a top down implementation of managed aquifer recharge alternatives through a centralized agency while this may be a realistic assumption given the current governance framework of ocavm uncertainties exist concerning available resources and level of cooperation at the local agency level such uncertainties could limit the full implementation of any of the alternatives proposed for example leaks may only be repaired in a single municipality or subsection of the water supply distribution network rather than evenly across the entire system 5 conclusions this study develops a modeling framework to analyze the effects of urban infrastructure on hydrogeological processes focusing on the case study of the mexico city metropolitan area mcma the inclusion of planning objectives that span varying spatial and temporal extents to properly understand the local effects of groundwater impact mitigation schemes can be a valuable addition to modeling efforts in urban hydrogeologic systems like the mcma a new accounting of the possible impact of leaks and land use types on recharge identifies the potential for managed recharge actions to improve aquifer sustainability results indicate that management alternatives improve groundwater storage and drawdown though with spatially distinct impacts over the historical period additionally the spatial distribution of the management objectives captures conflicting performance between the alternatives demonstrating the importance of not only the choice of management objectives but also the sub basin and temporal scale at which they are evaluated the measurement of the objectives using spatial components can help to tease out the effects of the spatial signature of management alternatives on the overall groundwater security of the basin future work will consider each of these objectives at the local municipality level to further analyze the spatial distribution of management impacts such an experiment would also allow for the application of objective weights based on other characteristics such as socio economic status or rural versus urban areas the set of objectives could also be expanded for an optimization problem to incorporate costs of infrastructure alternatives or the difficulty of implementing a given alternative there are limitations to evaluating alternatives using precipitation data from a thirty year model period that may leave out long term cycles of wet and dry climate patterns future studies could implement statistically or general circulation model gcm derived climate trends to evaluate recharge alternatives across ranges of reasonable precipitation the application of multiobjective analysis to models that include a more rigorous representation of hydrologic processes in the mcma including subsidence and surface water runoff would help to further test the limits and benefits of spatially defined planning objectives the continued refinement of this groundwater model will provide future research opportunities particularly in advancing our understanding of the behavior of urban aquifer systems at a regional scale and in the context of water supply risks faced by vulnerable populations within and at the periphery of urban areas the current model has been formulated to enable future spatial optimization studies in which combinations of interventions comprise a portfolio of management options an approach with broad applicability in other rapidly urbanizing regions dependent on groundwater supplies however a first step in providing valuable decision making information will be to account for the propagation of parameter uncertainties into groundwater management objectives calculated using these types of hydrologic models credit authorship contribution

mexico and the instituto de geofísica of the universidad nacional autónoma de méxico unam for providing pumping and observation data the conceptual groundwater model and input on potential management alternatives dr graciela herrera would like to thank the instituto de geofísica for providing a modflow model that was developed by members of this institute from 1994 to 2018 appendix a land use determination land use shape files were obtained from inegi for data collected in 1984 1997 2003 2010 2012 and 2016 inegi 2001 inegi 2005 inegi 2008 inegi 2009 inegi 2015 inegi 2017 the inegi land use files include over 30 land use and vegetation markers that vary from year to year which were homogenized into three overarching categories based on their potential for allowing infiltration of precipitation urban natural and water wetland the land use polygons were then compared to preprocessed landsat images to determine the extent of urban land use cover at 1990 2000 and 2010 landsat images were chosen from the full set of images available for the model area for one year prior to and during the year selected prioritizing images with low percentages of cloud cover usgs 2013 images were chosen in both the wet and dry season to compare visually determined land use type between the seasons the landsat images were preprocessed before classification as follows all images overlaying the model area were mosaicked into one image selecting the minimum value for any pixels which were represented in more than one image next any pixels with no data or data equal to 255 were filled to match surrounding data points that were between 0 and 255 the single bands were then converted to top of atmosphere toa reflectance and the dark object subtraction 1 dos1 method was applied as further atmospheric correction next the topographic shape map for urban infrastructure including parks medians and other greenspace was superimposed over the resulting map to exclude these features from the urban land use type fig a 1 finally the percentage of each of the three land use types was determined according to the 500 m by 500 m model cells used in the groundwater model the full model extent for each of the three land use types is shown for 1990 in fig a 2 below appendix b selected infiltration basins the five proposed locations for infiltration basins were randomly selected from the set of all possible points along existing surface water conveyance routes that met the criteria described in section 3 3 1 figs b 1 b 5 show location information for the five proposed locations appendix c leak calculations the overarching equation for determining incidental recharge from water supply distribution leaks required the calculation of total water use and non groundwater supply sources additionally it was necessary for the cacluation to allow for the implementation of repairs to the leaks within the system to varying degrees to be able to evaluate the repair leaks alternative c 1 estimated non groundwater supply sources see table c 1 c 2 derivation of new groundwater pumping relationship from repair leaks alternative the determination of the relationship between the implementation of the repair leaks management alternative and the reduction in incidental recharge from the water supply distribution system leaks 14 g t s 15 g n g t n t 16 g n g t n t 17 g n g g t n
