1015,prediction of bacteria transport to riparian shallow groundwater is very important to prevent the pollution of water resources by coliform bacteria the objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation miccp in reducing bacteria escherichia coli and pseudomonas fluorescens transport to perform the miccp process air dried sterile sand was poured into polyvinyl chloride pvc cylinders 4 8 14 92 cm and incubated for 3 days in the presence of sporosarcina pasteurii 108 cell g 1sand urea and cacl2 1 5 m a pulse 0 1 pore volume pv of bacteria suspension 108 cfu ml 1 was added on top of the sand columns miccp treated and control and leaching experiments were followed at steady state saturated flow condition culturable bacteria were determined in the leachate and the sand extracts resident bacteria by colony count method the miccp treatment reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity k s value 3 9 times compared to the control and thereby reduced bacteria leaching bioprecipitated calcium carbonate in miccp columns increased bacteria straining compared to control columns especially in surface layer 0 3 cm miccp process increased filtration coefficient λf and relative adsorption index s r and decreased maximum depth of bacteria transport z max the average c av and cumulative cell density c cum of both bacteria passed from the miccp column decreased around 3 9 fold compared to the control overall the miccp process has potential in bacteria filtration in the porous media reducing the risk of groundwater pollution keywords bacteria filtration hydraulic conductivity miccp sporosarcina pasteurii 1 introduction agriculture in riparian sandy soils is highly dependent on fertilizers application to replenish nutrients and maintain their productivity on the other hand nutrients in these soils are prone to leaching and bypass the plant root zone as the soils have poor structure low water holding capacity and high infiltration rate the issue gets worse when the groundwater is usually shallow in riparian soils and nutrient leaching contributing groundwater contamination raise the environmental concerns shepherd and newell price 2013 animal manures which have long been used in agriculture have recently gained attentions because aside from nutrient replenishment they also improve soil physical chemical and biological properties gosh 2004 however manures are also the source of pathogenic microorganisms that may threaten human health if they enter to the food chain and potable water resources unc and goss 2003 gerba and smith 2005 foppen and schijven 2006 as a rough estimation the average number of bacteria per gram of livestock manure is 1010 of which about half including species of escherichia salmonella shigella campylobacter and mycobacterium harbor strains that can be pathogenic to humans and animals unc and goss 2003 2004 deng et al 2019 foppen and schijven 2006 noted that intestinal or fecal coliforms such as e coli are the most abundant pathogenic bacteria in livestock manure e coli is an indicator bacterium in surface and groundwater contamination surveys due to its easy detection and ubiquity madigan et al 2017 physical chemical and biological factors affect the extent of adhesion transmission and survival of e coli in porous media bradford et al 2002 unc and goss 2004 foppen and schijven 2006 farhangi et al 2013 sepehrnia et al 2019 ideally soil is a perfect filter preventing transport of bacteria to the groundwater and it can be subjected to urban wastewater controlled treatment known as soil aquifer treatment van der hoek et al 2014 especially in arid and semi arid regions usepa 2006 elkayam et al 2015 yet soil pore systems are heterogeneous including continuous macropores that favor rapid bacterial transmission via preferential flow pathways mosaddeghi et al 2009 wang et al 2013 krüger et al 2019 herrmann et al 2019 on the other hand agricultural soils are subject to soil surface disturbances and wetting drying cycles or saturated unsaturated conditions which can encourage water facilitated huysman and verstraete 1993 or colloid facilitate transport madumathi 2017 of bacteria to groundwater resources unc and goss 2004 investigated the transport of bacteria through sandy loam and silt loam soils in the field condition they observed that bacterial transfer was greater in the silt loam soil an observation they related to the stability of the soil structure and thus of the established preferential flow pathways the same result has also been reported by mosaddeghi et al 2009 on the other hand application of beneficial occasionally including genetically engineered microorganisms is common in agriculture and bioremediation pseudomonas spp are the dominant rhizosphere bacteria due to their high ability to compete with other microorganisms for nutrients and also suitable adaptation to different environmental conditions vyas and gulati 2009 however preservation of these microorganisms at the target place e g rhizosphere is essential as they may be leached deeper from the target site under the rooting zone by irrigation or rain water especially in sandy or highly permeable soils thus leaching reduces the efficacy of these microorganisms while also contaminating groundwater resources trevors et al 1990 langenbach et al 2006 liu et al 2007 microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation miccp is a method reported to improve physical and mechanical properties of soils such as permeability and shear strength anbu et al 2016 this method is based on enhancing bacterial activity and thus accelerating biochemical processes such as urea hydrolysis fearon 1923 miccp based degradation of urea occurs through the ureolytic pathway chu et al 2012 kang et al 2015 and is dependent on urease an enzyme which hydrolyzes urea into one and two moles of carbonic acid and ammonia respectively eq 1 fearon 1923 1 nh2 2co 2h2o h2co3 2nh3 the products of the above reaction equilibrate in aqueous environment to give hco3 h eq 2 and nh4 and oh eq 3 2 h2co3 hco3 h 3 nh3 h2o nh4 oh the hydroxide ion oh increases solution ph which in turn leads to release of co3 2 eq 4 that precipitates as calcium carbonate caco3 in the presence of ca2 cations eq 5 dhami et al 2013 4 hco3 oh co3 2 h2o 5 co3 2 ca2 caco3 s various species of bacteria have been utilized for miccp to produce different amounts of urease activity and calcium carbonate precipitation sporosarcina pasteurii alkalophilic soil bacteria have been shown to produce high levels of urease and have therefore been extensively studied anbu et al 2016 miccp is known as an effective method for the remediation of heavy metals from contaminated water and soils achal et al 2009 zhu et al 2016 and co2 sequestration through miccp was also proved okyay et al 2016 furthermore biocementation through miccp treatment can improve soil shear strength and significantly reduce permeability through the production of soil particle binding materials in response to the introduction of bacteria and cementation reagents into the soil ng et al 2012 de muynck et al 2010 reported that presence of calcium carbonate between soil particles improves its structure abdel sabour 2007 found that enhancing miccp significantly reduced soil permeability through both carbonate deposition between sand particles but also through enhanced biomass accumulation decrease in soil porosity and permeability increased sand particles adhesion via bioprecipitated caco3 and enhanced soil strength due to miccp have been repeatedly reported whiffin et al 2007 dejong et al 2010 mortensen et al 2011 gorospe et al 2013 chen et al 2019 preventing pathogenic bacteria transport through soil and retaining beneficial microorganisms in the rhizosphere are very important especially in sandy soils with high permeability rate although the miccp method efficacy in reducing sand permeability have been reported frequently to the best of our knowledge the potential impacts of this method on bacterial transport in porous media has not been studied therefore this study aimed to evaluate the transport of bacteria in miccp treated sand columns two bacteria species escherichia coli as the most common fecal coliform indicator and pseudomonas fluorescens as surrogate for beneficial microorganisms have been examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 sand sampling and analysis sand was collected of alluvial sediments from the sepidrood river near

sediment rasht guilan province eosin methylene blue emb agar medium was used for differentiation of e coli from other non coliform bacteria following overnight incubation at 37 c colonies with green metallic sheen appearance on emb agar medium which then confirmed through biochemical tests imvic were identified as a putative strain of e coli leboffe and pierce 2015 antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by standard disk diffusion method on mueller hinton agar mha four antibiotic disks including ciprofloxacin cip 5µg cephalexin cef 30µg gentamicin gen 10µg and ceftriaxone cfx 30µg were tested zone of inhibition in mha plates was measured after 18 to 24 h incubation at 37 c clsi 2012 it was found the isolated e coli was resistant to ciprofloxacin for inoculum preparation a loopful of isolated e coli was inoculated into heat sterilized nutrient broth medium supplemented with 80 mg l 1 ciprofloxacin antibiotic after the temperature of the medium had dropped sufficiently to avoid inactivation of antibiotics then the inoculated culture medium was incubated in a rotary shaker 120 rpm at 37 c for 24 h the final suspension was centrifuged 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed with sterile distilled water these process was repeated three times and finally the bacteria cells were re suspended in sterile distilled water and stored in a fridge at 4 c before use 2 2 2 pseudomonas fluorescens the rifampicin resistant pseudomonas fluorescens strain was used in the experiment this mutant strain was acquired from soil biology lab of bu ali sina university hamadan iran inoculum preparation was carried out the same as above 2 2 1 section but the growth media was replaced with trypticase soy broth tsb with an antibiotic concentration of 100 mg l 1 rifampicin incubation temperature was 27 c 2 2 3 sporosarcina pasteurii sporosarcina pasteurii ptcc 1645 purchased from iranian microbial bank central collection of industrial fungi and bacteria karaj iran was used for the miccp process s pasteurii was inoculated into the heat sterilized nutrient broth nb medium and supplemented with filtered 0 22 µm pall co mi usa urea solution 2 w v after the temperature of the medium had dropped hereafter nbu medium and then incubated at 30 c achal et al 2009 for inoculum preparation of this bacterium on nb medium the steps described in section 2 2 1 were followed the bacteria cell density e coli p fluorescens and s pasteurii was determined via optical density at 600 nm od600 by uv vis spectrophotometer varian cari 100 its number was also verified by cell counting on a neubauer improved bright line hemacytometer prolab scientific leboffe and pierce 2015 2 3 sand columns preparation for stabilization of miccp process the method of harkes et al 2010 was followed with minor modification 500 g of sand was completely mixed with 30 ml of a 50 mm cacl2 solution and left at the room temperature 25 c for 24 h after that the treated sand was autoclaved 150 kpa 121 c for 45 min and then 432 g of that was freely packed into polyvinyl chloride pvc cylinders 14 92 cm height and 4 8 cm inner diameter to attain bulk density of sampled sand e g 1 6 g cm 3 table 1 a sterile cotton mesh 40 µm diameter was inserted at the bottom of each cylinder and clamped by a metal ring to retain the sand in the column while allowing water flow a funnel was also mounted under cylinder to lead the effluent to the collector fig 2 for the solidification stage of the miccp process 20 ml of the ureolytic s pasteurii suspension 108 cell per gram of sand and 100 ml of solidification solution 1 1 urea cacl2 1 5 m were sequentially added at the top of the columns the sand columns were then incubated at 30 c for 72 h okwadha and li 2010 sand columns without miccp process were used as control 2 4 leaching experiment setup after the miccp treatment leaching experiments were conducted on the sand columns under steady state saturated flow condition columns were saturated with sterile tap water for several hours and k s of each column was measured by the constant head method the k s values in control and miccp columns were calculated as 0 04 and 0 01 cm s 1 respectively after that a pulse of bacterial inoculum 11 9 ml contained 108 cell ml 1 equivalent to 0 1 pore volume pv of sand column was added on top of the columns pv cm3 which is the volume of pores filled with water in the saturated condition was calculated by the eq 6 kirkham 2014 6 pv v t ϑ s where θ s is saturated water content cm3 cm 3 and vt is total sand volume cm3 two bacterial inocula i e e coli and p fluorescens were added separately and the leaching experiment was conducted in two replicates the leaching experiment setup is presented in fig 2 the column leachates were collected at specific time intervals for 5 pore volumes the leachate samples were diluted as necessary and sub samples of 0 1 ml were plated on emb agar medium containing 80 mg l 1 ciprofloxacin or trypticase soy agar tsa containing 100 mg l 1 rifampicin for e coli and p fluorescens respectively plates were incubated at appropriate temperature 37 and 27 c for e coli and p fluorescens respectively for 24 48 h before colony counting thus bacterial recovery was expressed as colony forming units cfu per milliliter ml of leachate leboffe and pierce 2015 after the leaching experiment sand was slowly extruded from the columns and cut into 5 segments fig 3 the sand of each segment 2 g was thoroughly mixed in sodium pyrophosphate na4p2o7 0 18 solution and residual bacteria enumerated as described above thus results were expressed as colony forming units cfu per gram g of dry sand serial dilutions were also prepared everywhere needed alef and nannipieri 1995 calcium carbonate was also determined in each segment as described in section 2 1 2 5 statistical design and data analysis bacterial counts breakthrough curves ec and ph in the leachate effluents were assessed vs pv residual bacteria and calcium carbonate contents in the sand layers were assessed vs depth average c ave and cumulative cell densities c cum of leached bacteria the filtration coefficient λf relative adsorption index s r and maximum bacteria transport depth z max were also calculated for data analysis a completely randomized factorial statistical design was employed with two replications factors included the leaching runs at two levels columns with miccp process and control and bacteria species at two levels e coli and p fluorescens for residual bacteria cell density and produced calcium carbonate level data were analyzed separately for each species and factors included leaching experiment at two levels and sand column sampling layer at 5 levels 0 3 3 6 6 9 9 12 and 12 15 cm post hoc mean comparisons were calculated by the tukey hsd method using the sas software package sas institute 2009 the λf was calculated according to mathess et al 1988 based eq 7 7 λ f ln c 0 av c av c b av 1 z where λf is bacterial filtration factor cm 1 c0 av is the average pulse influent cell density 106 cell ml 1 and c av is the average effluent cell density cfu ml 1 cb av is the background cell density and z is the sand depth cm cb av was zero as the experiment was performed in sterile condition the areas under the breakthrough curves btc of bacteria were calculated by riemann sum method and divided by the cumulative volume of the effluent water over the leaching time to calculate the c av by assuming the c av 1 the eq 7 rewritten as below eq 8 allowed the calculation of the maximum depth zmax to which bacteria may be transported unc and goss 2004 8 z max ln c 0 av 1 λ f the relative adsorption index s r denotes the residual bacteria retained in soil at the end of the experiment residual bacterial counts adsorbed and or strained within the sand column at the end of the leaching events and was calculated using eq 9 mosaddeghi et al 2009 9 s r 0 v max c 0 c c b dv 0 v max c 0 dv where vmax are the cumulative volumes of the effluent water during the leaching experiment ml the other parameters and how they were calculated are defined above 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli and p fluorescens breakthrough curves breakthrough curves btcs of e coli and p fluorescens in miccp treated and control sand are shown in fig 4 in both control and miccp columns e coli appeared at 0 6 pv but subsequent trends diverged btc peak of e coli was observed at 0 9 pv in the micpp columns but at 1 pv in control columns fig 4a the earlier peak of e coli in miccp columns possibly occurred due to pore size exclusion phenomenon and preferential flow as bioprecipitated miccp calcium carbonate may aggregate sand particles and favor larger pores connectivity bacteria downward movement in porous media is governed by the pore water velocity under mechanism known as convective transport which is determined by porosity hydraulic pressure gradient and tortuosity of the porous media ginn et al 2002 however in laboratory columns martins et al 2013 and field experiments hubbard et al 2001 size exclusion phenomena may occur in which transported bacteria move faster than the mean pore water velocity the presence of continuous pores in soil creates preferential flow paths for water flux which facilitate bacterial transport unc and goss 2004 mossadeghi et al 2009 reported rapid transport and early appearance of e coli in the effluent of sandy clay loam scl soil columns when compared with a loamy sand ls soil which they also reported as due to the preferential flow pathways and stable structure in scl soil although an earlier peak of e coli btc was observed in miccp column total e coli counts in the control column s effluent were significantly greater for all sampling events fig 4a it can be speculated that this was because of bacteria adsorption on bioprecipitated calcium carbonate surface as well as the physical entrapment or bioclogging of bacteria in the finer pores dunsmore et al 2004 observed that in artificial porous media desulfovibrio spp first colonized the necks of fine pores followed by the production of biofilms which then further obstructed the pores reducing ks value by half an increase in the ionic strength is of the soil solution leads to the compression of the electric double layer edl which can facilitate adsorption of bacteria on soil particles massoudieh et al 2013 powelson and mills 2001 have also shown that calcium chloride is more effective in reducing the bacterial outflow from sand columns than potassium chloride thus addition of calcium chloride in miccp column can decrease the thickness of edl which can then effectively enhance adsorption of bacteria on sand particles limiting bacteria leaching greater ec values in the leachate of the miccp column fig 5 a compared to control confirms the higher is wang et al 2013 studied e coli transport in homogenous and heterogeneous sand media and found that although the velocity of microbial transport due to preferential flow was enhanced at higher ionic strength is the overall mass balance of transported e coli decreased p fluorescens breakthrough curves were have shown similar trends while for both control and miccp columns p fluorescens appeared in the leachate at 0 6 pv the peaks of cell densities were measured at 0 7 pv in miccp and at 0 9 pv in the control columns respectively fig 4b p fluorescens was observed earlier in the leachate of both columns than the e coli biological factors such as secretion of exopolysaccharides eps by bacteria may induce straining of bacteria via biofilm formation in the porous media morales et al 2010 a possible explanation for the earlier appearance of p fluorescens is that repeated passage of this bacterium in pure culture selects for mutants that their maintenance genes for eps production are not expressed as the putative e coli strain has been freshly isolated compared with the p fluorescens from a culture collection it has a better chance of having a robust eps bacteria are found in association with interfaces in natural environments and form complex structures known as biofilms dependent on eps davey and o toole 2000 the primary function of eps is to irreversible adhesion of bacteria to solid particles like sand grains and organic residues ginn et al 2002 thus relatively sticky e coli would be expected to exit column more slowly for both control and miccp columns the cell density of both bacteria in effluent decreased significantly at 5 pore volume 600 ml and the bt curves reached a nearly steady state trend nevertheless the bacterial leaching proceeded after continuous leaching with significant tailing in the bt curves fig 4 however bacterial counts in effluent of miccp columns were much lower than for control as the influent bacteria was applied in a pulse it seems adsorption was reversible and bacteria weakly adsorbed was continuously released at higher pvs higher water flow rates will favor bacterial transfer through porous media with coarse pores camper et al 1993 calcium carbonate biogenically produced in the soil pores reduces soil s porosity and hydraulic conductivity ivanov and chu 2008 oualha et al 2020 the infiltration rate for the miccp columns in this study was reduced about 3 7 times compared to the control a parameter that is expected to reduce bacterial transport bradford et al 2003 close et al 2006 therefore we can assume that the decrease of bacterial counts in the effluent is mainly affected by changes in the pore volumes and pores size distribution associated with the miccp produced calcium carbonate and less so due to any mobility of the bacteria 3 2 ec and ph changes in the effluents electrical conductivity ec and ph changes in the effluents of the bacteria e coli and p fluorescens leaching experiment are shown in fig 5 the ec curves for the control columns of both bacteria leaching experiments fig 5a c showed nearly identical trends the effluent ec was greater for the miccp than for the control column up to 2 5 and 1 pv for e coli and p fluorescens respectively fig 5a c which might be related to leaching of excess salts from the miccp columns early peak observation 0 8 pv in the miccp column fig 5a which corresponded closely to the e coli btc peak 0 9 pv fig 4a demonstrated the early exit of salts rather than e coli and supports the role of the bacterial pulse plume in the salt exit from the column as discussed above however as bacteria surfaces have usually net negative charges they may adsorb ca2 and nh4 ions gannon et al 1991 thus limiting bacterial aggregation and residence in pores for both bacterial cells and attached cations after the exclusion of the bacteria plume i e 2 5 and 1 pv for e coli and p fluorescens respectively the ec values in the effluents from the miccp column were lower than those of the control column fig 5a c the leachate acidity ph fluctuated significantly for both bacteria leaching columns but with larger fluctuations observed for the miccp column fig 5b d due to the nh4 and oh produced by the miccp process qian et al 2010 3 3 biogenic calcium carbonate in miccp column as the carbonate determination was carried out after leaching experiment results are presented separately for each bacteria species the amount of calcium carbonate decreased with depth fig 6 the bottom layer 12 15 cm had about 2 more calcium carbonate than the control table 1 it seems that top of the column application of the sporosarcina pasteurii is the main contributor to the pattern of biogenic carbonate with depth as the bacteria may be filtrated and resident in the upper layer and showed their own ureolytic activity the p fluorescens column had more calcium carbonate than the e coli column at all layers assuming that the biogenic carbonate in each layer of sand was approximately equal prior to bacteria leaching a possible role for e coli it may be speculated in dissolving carbonate e coli as a facultative anaerobic organism can produce organic acids in its mixed acid fermentation metabolism madigan et al 2017 which may decompose calcium carbonate fermentation of glycogen known to be employed as an energy storage polymer in e coli dawes and senior 1973 will continue throughout sand column processing until samples are full dried before this analysis this process is postulated to dissolve the lost carbonate 3 4 average c av and cumulative c cum bacterial counts in leachate average c av and cumulative c cum cell density of bacteria leached from the sand in control columns was significantly higher than for the miccp treated sand the c av and c cum for both bacteria decreased around 3 9 times in miccp column versus the in control table 2 however the impact of miccp on c av and c cum of each bacterial strain was different for p fluorescens miccp reduced c av by 4 6 times and c cum by 4 5 times versus the control sand for e coli the same parameters were reduced by 3 2 and 3 8 times respectively the total cell density of each bacterium added on top of the columns i e 0 1 pv containing 108 cell ml 1 equates to a total of 11 9 108 cells much smaller numbers 7 02 and 6 50 log cfu for e coli and 7 09 and 6 44 log cfu for p fluorescens were eluted in the leaching experiments of control and miccp columns respectively the second and third data rows of table 3 show how the added numbers partition into bacteria eluted and those retained calculated by difference in the columns 3 5 residual bacteria in sand columns the miccp treatment the sand layer and their interactions had significant effects on resident e coli counts log cfu g 1 sand in the sand column p 0 01 fig 7 most residual e coli counts were measured in the first layer 0 3 cm of the miccp column but were not significantly more than for the second layers 3 6 cm in the 12 15 cm layer the residual e coli counts were the lowest and statistically similar between the control sand and the miccp treated sand fig 7a thus while the counts of residual e coli in sand layers decreased with depth for both treatments the decline was sharper in the miccp columns given that the repacking of the sand was uniform across the column depth the reduction in residual bacteria with depth is a function of effective collision efficiency which is dependent on the distance of travel unc et al 2012 which can lead to bioclogging of pores by bacteria morales et al 2010 this leads to an accumulation of bacteria in the superficial layers reducing downward mass transfer a phenomenon previously reported huysman and verstraete 1993 jiang et al 2007 the importance of these few top first centimeters of soil layer for bacterial filtration unc et al 2012 was employed to declare that the column s length might have a negligible impact on the e coli filtration jiang et al 2007 clearly a statistical argument fraught with subjectivity outside the context of a relevant regulatory threshold for the receiving groundwater or any receiving tile drain effect of miccp and sand layer were similarly significant for residual p fluorescens counts p 0 01 while the count distribution with depth fig 7b was similar to the one observed for e coli there was no statistical significant difference between the two bottom layers i e 9 12 cm vs 12 15 cm p 0 05 in this treatment for both bacteria the miccp led to a reduction of bacteria with depth directly consistent with the calcium carbonate level in the sand layers fig 6 thus it might be speculated that the bioprecipitated calcium carbonate may adsorb bacteria directly on its surface electrostatic effect and or can narrow pores enhancing physical retention of bacteria organic carbon considered a main factor for adsorption and retention of bacteria in the porous media al degs et al 2000 was not detected in the studied sand table 1 furthermore sand particles have negligible electrical charges sparks 1998 based on the point of zero charge ph of caco3 phzpc 9 5 to 10 8 foppen and schijve 2006 calcium carbonate is a good adsorbent for bacteria the average ph of miccp columns in this study was about 7 8 thus with calcium carbonate having a positive surface charge this can favor adsorption of bacteria which usually have net negative surface charges furthermore miccp calcium carbonate bridges soil particles abu ashour et al 1998 increasing structural stability but due to cementation at high concentrations can reduce the permeability of sandy soils de muynck et al 2010 phillips et al 2013 by as much as 90 whiffin et al 2007 physical retention of bacteria due to bioprecipitated carbonate was a likely explanation given the parallel reduction in hydraulic conductivity which was 72 92 lower in miccp than in the control column with adsorption a secondary factor this led to the counts of residual bacteria in the 6 9 cm layer in the miccp treatment to be statistically similar to the top layer of the untreated control column an indication of the shallow miccp layer that might be recommended to filter bacteria nevertheless the type of bacterium is important the mean residual p fluorescens counts were higher than for e coli but the miccp treatment was in term of mass balance more effective on straining p fluorescens overall given to the filling of the column with 432 g sand section 2 3 and its uniform distribution in each layer according to data fig 7 the total counts of e coli and p fluorescens cells retained in control columns were 6 2 6 8 log cfu and in miccp columns were 7 6 8 3 log cfu respectively table 3 row 4 data dividing these residual bacteria by total cell density added on top of the column yields very low residual bacteria in sand column after leaching experiment table 3 apart from the flaws of the plate count method which usually represents 1 to 5 of the number determined by direct microscopy in environmental e g soil water and sediment samples kandeler 2007 the extra stickiness of freshly isolated e coli as already discussed on section 3 1 will cause it to adhere more avidly to sand particles than does the employed pseudomonas strain from a culture collection under this view the retained bacteria determined by viable plate count vpc table 3 row 4 data drastically under represent total retained bacteria of both types because bacteria in general are notoriously difficult to detach from sand particles and thus may be poorly represented by vpc kepner and pratt 1994 furthermore clumps of bacteria eluted from a column will register as single colony forming units this line of thinking concludes by viewing more avid attachment of e coli to sand along with a greater tendency to clump with other cells as combining to make its vpc from sand numbers severely underestimate the actual abundance of this bacterium under this analysis pseudomonas vpc from sand face a similar problem that manifests to a lesser degree because they are less sticky 3 6 bacterial filtration coefficient λf and the maximum bacterial transport depth z max analyses of variance for miccp treatment bacteria and their interactions showed that only the former was significant for adsorption parameters including λf zmax and sr and average c ave and cumulative c cum cell density of bacteria in the leachate p 0 01 the λf m 1 indicates the ability of a porous medium to retain bacteria that usually occurs through a combination of electrochemical adsorption of bacteria on the particle surfaces and their entrapment in the fine pores in the other words the λf shows the relative numbers of the filtered bacteria per unit length of soil column unc and goss 2003 for the miccp sand the λf 1 2 times greater than control table 2 in direct correlation with a considerable reduction in the hydraulic conductivity in comparison with control sand we must acknowledge here that under real conditions the soil saturation state has a dominant role in controlling λ f mosaddeghi et al 2010 and thus this might affect the relationship between water flow and bacterial transport possibly further enhancing filtration z max which predicts the maximum depth of bacterial transport in a filtering porous medium is inversely related to the λ f thus a large infiltration coefficient leads to deepest bacterial transfer unc and goss 2003 the z max for miccp columns decreased by 14 8 compared to control sand table 2 precipitation of biogenic calcium carbonate in the sand pores reduces the water flux rate preventing the bacteria transfer to deeper layers 3 7 relative adsorption index s r the calculated s r values for miccp column 0 98 was significantly greater than that in control sand p 0 05 table 2 organic carbon calcium carbonate and clay minerals are the main factors contributing bacteria adsorption and filtration which controls the s r in soils stevik et al 1999 lo et al 2002 given the conditions of our tests the greater s r value in the miccp treatment can be directly related to biogenic production of calcium carbonate as regarding the role of bacteria in s r larger cells are less likely to be transported far in soil than smaller cells gannon et al 1991 hendry et al 1999 and the rod like cells attach more readily than cocci salerno et al 2006 while both bacteria examined in this study are rod shaped bacilli e coli cells are generally about 2 0 µm long and 0 25 1 0 µm in diameter madigan et al 2017 while pseudomonas cells can be approximately 2 0 2 5 µm in length and 0 5 µm in width martínez garcía et al 2015 either of these parameters could have been relevant to the enhanced retention versus that of e coli compared to the calculations based on eq 9 s r values table 2 the overall residual bacteria in sand medium is low in fact this equation shows the difference between the bacteria eluted from the column and the bacteria added on top of the column and combines bacteria mortality adsorption and straining as filtration an ambiguity which described by mathess et al 1988 therefore the retained values obtained for each column are very high all above 98 certainly the pulse input of bacteria in comparison with continuous input had also great role in such high s r values on the hand the total residual bacteria in sand columns fig 7 demonstrate the bacteria numbers that are still viable and are at risk of surplus leaching if they could detach from sand media 4 conclusions the urease activity by sporsarcina pasteurii and deposition of stable produced calcium carbonate between the sand particles in the miccp treatment decreased the hydraulic conductivity of the sand column 73 compared to control this was directly related to a significant decrease of e coli and p fluorescens transport in sand columns a phenomenon that can be assigned to the decrease in hydraulic conductivity electrostatic adsorption of bacteria on biprecipitated calcium carbonate and as well as to straining and bioclogging in the pores therefore the miccp process not only can reduce the transport of pathogenic bacteria to groundwater but can also retain beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere miccp can be an eco friendly economical and efficient technology to reduce pollution of water resources by bio pollutants in riparian area this method seems to be economically justified especially in sandy riparian soils where it is not possible to accomplish soil aquifer treatment practices declaration of

1015,prediction of bacteria transport to riparian shallow groundwater is very important to prevent the pollution of water resources by coliform bacteria the objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation miccp in reducing bacteria escherichia coli and pseudomonas fluorescens transport to perform the miccp process air dried sterile sand was poured into polyvinyl chloride pvc cylinders 4 8 14 92 cm and incubated for 3 days in the presence of sporosarcina pasteurii 108 cell g 1sand urea and cacl2 1 5 m a pulse 0 1 pore volume pv of bacteria suspension 108 cfu ml 1 was added on top of the sand columns miccp treated and control and leaching experiments were followed at steady state saturated flow condition culturable bacteria were determined in the leachate and the sand extracts resident bacteria by colony count method the miccp treatment reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity k s value 3 9 times compared to the control and thereby reduced bacteria leaching bioprecipitated calcium carbonate in miccp columns increased bacteria straining compared to control columns especially in surface layer 0 3 cm miccp process increased filtration coefficient λf and relative adsorption index s r and decreased maximum depth of bacteria transport z max the average c av and cumulative cell density c cum of both bacteria passed from the miccp column decreased around 3 9 fold compared to the control overall the miccp process has potential in bacteria filtration in the porous media reducing the risk of groundwater pollution keywords bacteria filtration hydraulic conductivity miccp sporosarcina pasteurii 1 introduction agriculture in riparian sandy soils is highly dependent on fertilizers application to replenish nutrients and maintain their productivity on the other hand nutrients in these soils are prone to leaching and bypass the plant root zone as the soils have poor structure low water holding capacity and high infiltration rate the issue gets worse when the groundwater is usually shallow in riparian soils and nutrient leaching contributing groundwater contamination raise the environmental concerns shepherd and newell price 2013 animal manures which have long been used in agriculture have recently gained attentions because aside from nutrient replenishment they also improve soil physical chemical and biological properties gosh 2004 however manures are also the source of pathogenic microorganisms that may threaten human health if they enter to the food chain and potable water resources unc and goss 2003 gerba and smith 2005 foppen and schijven 2006 as a rough estimation the average number of bacteria per gram of livestock manure is 1010 of which about half including species of escherichia salmonella shigella campylobacter and mycobacterium harbor strains that can be pathogenic to humans and animals unc and goss 2003 2004 deng et al 2019 foppen and schijven 2006 noted that intestinal or fecal coliforms such as e coli are the most abundant pathogenic bacteria in livestock manure e coli is an indicator bacterium in surface and groundwater contamination surveys due to its easy detection and ubiquity madigan et al 2017 physical chemical and biological factors affect the extent of adhesion transmission and survival of e coli in porous media bradford et al 2002 unc and goss 2004 foppen and schijven 2006 farhangi et al 2013 sepehrnia et al 2019 ideally soil is a perfect filter preventing transport of bacteria to the groundwater and it can be subjected to urban wastewater controlled treatment known as soil aquifer treatment van der hoek et al 2014 especially in arid and semi arid regions usepa 2006 elkayam et al 2015 yet soil pore systems are heterogeneous including continuous macropores that favor rapid bacterial transmission via preferential flow pathways mosaddeghi et al 2009 wang et al 2013 krüger et al 2019 herrmann et al 2019 on the other hand agricultural soils are subject to soil surface disturbances and wetting drying cycles or saturated unsaturated conditions which can encourage water facilitated huysman and verstraete 1993 or colloid facilitate transport madumathi 2017 of bacteria to groundwater resources unc and goss 2004 investigated the transport of bacteria through sandy loam and silt loam soils in the field condition they observed that bacterial transfer was greater in the silt loam soil an observation they related to the stability of the soil structure and thus of the established preferential flow pathways the same result has also been reported by mosaddeghi et al 2009 on the other hand application of beneficial occasionally including genetically engineered microorganisms is common in agriculture and bioremediation pseudomonas spp are the dominant rhizosphere bacteria due to their high ability to compete with other microorganisms for nutrients and also suitable adaptation to different environmental conditions vyas and gulati 2009 however preservation of these microorganisms at the target place e g rhizosphere is essential as they may be leached deeper from the target site under the rooting zone by irrigation or rain water especially in sandy or highly permeable soils thus leaching reduces the efficacy of these microorganisms while also contaminating groundwater resources trevors et al 1990 langenbach et al 2006 liu et al 2007 microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation miccp is a method reported to improve physical and mechanical properties of soils such as permeability and shear strength anbu et al 2016 this method is based on enhancing bacterial activity and thus accelerating biochemical processes such as urea hydrolysis fearon 1923 miccp based degradation of urea occurs through the ureolytic pathway chu et al 2012 kang et al 2015 and is dependent on urease an enzyme which hydrolyzes urea into one and two moles of carbonic acid and ammonia respectively eq 1 fearon 1923 1 nh2 2co 2h2o h2co3 2nh3 the products of the above reaction equilibrate in aqueous environment to give hco3 h eq 2 and nh4 and oh eq 3 2 h2co3 hco3 h 3 nh3 h2o nh4 oh the hydroxide ion oh increases solution ph which in turn leads to release of co3 2 eq 4 that precipitates as calcium carbonate caco3 in the presence of ca2 cations eq 5 dhami et al 2013 4 hco3 oh co3 2 h2o 5 co3 2 ca2 caco3 s various species of bacteria have been utilized for miccp to produce different amounts of urease activity and calcium carbonate precipitation sporosarcina pasteurii alkalophilic soil bacteria have been shown to produce high levels of urease and have therefore been extensively studied anbu et al 2016 miccp is known as an effective method for the remediation of heavy metals from contaminated water and soils achal et al 2009 zhu et al 2016 and co2 sequestration through miccp was also proved okyay et al 2016 furthermore biocementation through miccp treatment can improve soil shear strength and significantly reduce permeability through the production of soil particle binding materials in response to the introduction of bacteria and cementation reagents into the soil ng et al 2012 de muynck et al 2010 reported that presence of calcium carbonate between soil particles improves its structure abdel sabour 2007 found that enhancing miccp significantly reduced soil permeability through both carbonate deposition between sand particles but also through enhanced biomass accumulation decrease in soil porosity and permeability increased sand particles adhesion via bioprecipitated caco3 and enhanced soil strength due to miccp have been repeatedly reported whiffin et al 2007 dejong et al 2010 mortensen et al 2011 gorospe et al 2013 chen et al 2019 preventing pathogenic bacteria transport through soil and retaining beneficial microorganisms in the rhizosphere are very important especially in sandy soils with high permeability rate although the miccp method efficacy in reducing sand permeability have been reported frequently to the best of our knowledge the potential impacts of this method on bacterial transport in porous media has not been studied therefore this study aimed to evaluate the transport of bacteria in miccp treated sand columns two bacteria species escherichia coli as the most common fecal coliform indicator and pseudomonas fluorescens as surrogate for beneficial microorganisms have been examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 sand sampling and analysis sand was collected of alluvial sediments from the sepidrood river near

sediment rasht guilan province eosin methylene blue emb agar medium was used for differentiation of e coli from other non coliform bacteria following overnight incubation at 37 c colonies with green metallic sheen appearance on emb agar medium which then confirmed through biochemical tests imvic were identified as a putative strain of e coli leboffe and pierce 2015 antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by standard disk diffusion method on mueller hinton agar mha four antibiotic disks including ciprofloxacin cip 5µg cephalexin cef 30µg gentamicin gen 10µg and ceftriaxone cfx 30µg were tested zone of inhibition in mha plates was measured after 18 to 24 h incubation at 37 c clsi 2012 it was found the isolated e coli was resistant to ciprofloxacin for inoculum preparation a loopful of isolated e coli was inoculated into heat sterilized nutrient broth medium supplemented with 80 mg l 1 ciprofloxacin antibiotic after the temperature of the medium had dropped sufficiently to avoid inactivation of antibiotics then the inoculated culture medium was incubated in a rotary shaker 120 rpm at 37 c for 24 h the final suspension was centrifuged 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed with sterile distilled water these process was repeated three times and finally the bacteria cells were re suspended in sterile distilled water and stored in a fridge at 4 c before use 2 2 2 pseudomonas fluorescens the rifampicin resistant pseudomonas fluorescens strain was used in the experiment this mutant strain was acquired from soil biology lab of bu ali sina university hamadan iran inoculum

neubauer improved bright line hemacytometer prolab scientific leboffe and pierce 2015 2 3 sand columns preparation for stabilization of miccp process the method of harkes et al 2010 was followed with minor modification 500 g of sand was completely mixed with 30 ml of a 50 mm cacl2 solution and left at the room temperature 25 c for 24 h after that the treated sand was autoclaved 150 kpa 121 c for 45 min and then 432 g of that was freely packed into polyvinyl chloride pvc cylinders 14 92 cm height and 4 8 cm inner diameter to attain bulk density of sampled sand e g 1 6 g cm 3 table 1 a sterile cotton mesh 40 µm diameter was inserted at the bottom of each cylinder and clamped by a metal ring to retain the sand in the column while allowing water flow a funnel was also mounted under cylinder to lead the effluent to the collector fig 2 for the solidification stage of the miccp process 20 ml of the ureolytic s pasteurii suspension 108 cell per gram of sand and 100 ml of solidification solution 1 1 urea cacl2 1 5 m were sequentially added at the top of the columns the sand columns were then incubated at 30 c for 72 h okwadha and li 2010 sand columns without miccp process were used as control 2 4 leaching experiment setup after the miccp treatment leaching experiments were conducted on the sand columns under steady state saturated flow condition columns were saturated with sterile tap water for several hours and k s of each column was measured by the constant head method the k s values in control and miccp columns were calculated as 0 04 and 0 01 cm s 1 respectively after that a pulse of bacterial inoculum 11 9 ml contained 108 cell ml 1 equivalent to 0 1 pore volume pv of sand column was added on top of the columns pv cm3 which is the volume of pores filled with water in the saturated condition was calculated by the eq 6 kirkham 2014 6 pv v t ϑ s where θ s is saturated water content cm3 cm 3 and vt is total sand volume cm3 two bacterial inocula i e e coli and p fluorescens were added separately and the leaching experiment was conducted in two replicates the leaching experiment setup is presented in fig 2 the column leachates were collected at specific time intervals for 5 pore volumes the leachate samples were diluted as necessary and sub samples of 0 1 ml were plated on emb agar medium containing 80 mg l 1 ciprofloxacin or trypticase soy agar tsa containing 100 mg l 1 rifampicin for e coli and p fluorescens respectively plates were incubated at appropriate temperature 37 and 27 c for e coli and p fluorescens respectively for 24 48 h before colony counting thus bacterial recovery was expressed as colony forming units cfu per milliliter ml of leachate leboffe and pierce 2015 after the leaching experiment sand was slowly extruded from the columns and cut into 5 segments fig 3 the sand of each segment 2 g was thoroughly mixed in sodium pyrophosphate na4p2o7 0 18 solution and residual bacteria enumerated as described above thus results were expressed as colony forming units cfu per gram g of dry sand serial dilutions were also prepared everywhere needed alef and nannipieri 1995 calcium carbonate was also determined in each segment as described in section 2 1 2 5 statistical design and data analysis bacterial counts breakthrough curves ec and ph in the leachate effluents were assessed vs pv residual bacteria and calcium carbonate contents in the sand layers were assessed vs depth average c ave and cumulative cell densities c cum of leached bacteria the filtration coefficient λf relative adsorption index s r and maximum bacteria transport depth z max were also calculated for data analysis a completely randomized factorial statistical design was employed with two replications factors included the leaching runs at two levels columns with miccp process and control and bacteria species at two levels e coli and p fluorescens for residual bacteria cell density and produced calcium carbonate level data were analyzed separately for each species and factors included leaching experiment at two levels and sand column sampling layer at 5 levels 0 3 3 6 6 9 9 12 and 12 15 cm post hoc mean comparisons were calculated by the tukey hsd method using the sas software package sas institute 2009 the λf was calculated according to mathess et al 1988 based eq 7 7 λ f ln c 0 av c av c b av 1 z where λf is bacterial filtration factor cm 1 c0 av is the average pulse influent cell density 106 cell ml 1 and c av is the average effluent cell density cfu ml 1 cb av is the background cell density and z is the sand depth cm cb av was zero as the experiment was performed in sterile condition the areas under the breakthrough curves btc of bacteria were calculated by riemann sum method and divided by the cumulative volume of the effluent water over the leaching time to calculate the c av by assuming the c av 1 the eq 7 rewritten as below eq 8 allowed the calculation of the maximum depth zmax to which bacteria may be transported unc and goss 2004 8 z max ln c 0 av 1 λ f the relative adsorption index s r denotes the residual bacteria retained in soil at the end of the experiment residual bacterial counts adsorbed and or strained within the sand column at the end of the leaching events and was calculated using eq 9 mosaddeghi et al 2009 9 s r 0 v max c 0 c c b dv 0 v max c 0 dv where vmax are the cumulative volumes of the effluent water during the leaching experiment ml the other parameters and how they were calculated are defined above 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli and p fluorescens breakthrough curves breakthrough curves btcs of e coli and p fluorescens in miccp treated and control sand are shown in fig 4 in both control and miccp columns e coli appeared at 0 6 pv but subsequent trends diverged btc peak of e coli was observed at 0 9 pv in the micpp columns but at 1 pv in control columns fig 4a the earlier peak of e coli in miccp columns possibly occurred due to pore size exclusion phenomenon and preferential flow as bioprecipitated miccp calcium carbonate may aggregate sand particles and favor larger pores connectivity bacteria downward movement in porous media is governed by the pore water velocity under mechanism known as convective transport which is determined by porosity hydraulic pressure gradient and tortuosity of the porous media ginn et al 2002 however in laboratory columns martins et al 2013 and field experiments hubbard et al 2001 size exclusion phenomena may occur in which transported bacteria move faster than the mean pore water velocity the presence of continuous pores in soil creates preferential flow paths for water flux which facilitate bacterial transport unc and goss 2004 mossadeghi et al 2009 reported rapid transport and early appearance of e coli in the effluent of sandy clay loam scl soil columns when compared with a loamy sand ls soil which they also reported as due to the preferential flow pathways and stable structure in scl soil although an earlier peak of e coli btc was observed in miccp column total e coli counts in the control column s effluent were significantly greater for all sampling events fig 4a it can be speculated that this was because of bacteria adsorption on bioprecipitated calcium carbonate surface as well as the physical entrapment or bioclogging of bacteria in the finer pores dunsmore et al 2004 observed that in artificial porous media desulfovibrio spp first colonized the necks of fine pores followed by the production of biofilms which then further obstructed the pores reducing ks value by half an increase in the ionic strength is of the soil solution leads to the compression of the electric double layer edl which can facilitate adsorption of bacteria on soil particles massoudieh et al 2013 powelson and mills 2001 have also shown that calcium chloride is more effective in reducing the bacterial outflow from sand columns than potassium chloride thus addition of calcium chloride in miccp column can decrease the thickness of edl which can then effectively enhance adsorption of bacteria on sand particles limiting bacteria leaching greater ec values in the leachate of the miccp column fig 5 a compared to control confirms the higher is wang et al 2013 studied e coli transport in homogenous and heterogeneous sand media and found that although the velocity of microbial transport due to preferential flow was enhanced at higher ionic strength is the overall mass balance of transported e coli decreased p fluorescens breakthrough curves were have shown similar trends while for both control and miccp columns p fluorescens appeared in the leachate at 0 6 pv the peaks of cell densities were measured at 0 7 pv in miccp and at 0 9 pv in the control columns respectively fig 4b p fluorescens was observed earlier in the leachate of both columns than the e coli biological factors such as secretion of exopolysaccharides eps by bacteria may induce straining of bacteria via biofilm formation in the porous media morales et al 2010 a possible explanation for the earlier appearance of p fluorescens is that repeated passage of this bacterium in pure culture selects for mutants that their maintenance genes for eps production are not expressed as the putative e coli strain has been freshly isolated compared with the p fluorescens from a culture collection it has a better chance of having a robust eps bacteria are found in association with interfaces in natural environments and form complex structures known as biofilms dependent on eps davey and o toole 2000 the primary function of eps is to irreversible adhesion of bacteria to solid particles like sand grains and organic residues ginn et al 2002 thus relatively sticky e coli would be expected to exit column more slowly for both control and miccp columns the cell density of both bacteria in effluent decreased significantly at 5 pore volume 600 ml and the bt curves reached a nearly steady state trend nevertheless the bacterial leaching proceeded after continuous leaching with significant tailing in the bt curves fig 4 however bacterial counts in effluent of miccp columns were much lower than for control as the influent bacteria was applied in a pulse it seems adsorption was reversible and bacteria weakly adsorbed was continuously released at higher pvs higher water flow rates will favor bacterial transfer through porous media with coarse pores camper et al 1993 calcium carbonate biogenically produced in the soil pores reduces soil s porosity and hydraulic conductivity ivanov and chu 2008 oualha et al 2020 the infiltration rate for the miccp columns in this study was reduced about 3 7 times compared to the control a parameter that is expected to reduce bacterial transport bradford et al 2003 close et al 2006 therefore we can assume that the decrease of bacterial counts in the effluent is mainly affected by changes in the pore volumes and pores size distribution associated with the miccp produced calcium carbonate and less so due to any mobility of the bacteria 3 2 ec and ph changes in the effluents electrical conductivity ec and ph changes in the effluents of the bacteria e coli and p fluorescens leaching experiment are shown in fig 5 the ec curves for the control columns of both bacteria leaching experiments fig 5a c showed nearly identical trends the effluent ec was greater for the miccp than for the control column up to 2 5 and 1 pv for e coli and p fluorescens respectively fig 5a c which might be related to leaching of excess salts from the miccp columns early peak observation 0 8 pv in the miccp column fig 5a which corresponded closely to the e coli btc peak 0 9 pv fig 4a demonstrated the early exit of salts rather than e coli and supports the role of the bacterial pulse plume in the salt exit from the column as discussed above however as bacteria surfaces have usually net negative charges they may adsorb ca2 and nh4 ions gannon et al 1991 thus limiting bacterial aggregation and residence in pores for both bacterial cells and attached cations after the exclusion of the bacteria plume i e 2 5 and 1 pv for e coli and p fluorescens respectively the ec values in the effluents from the miccp column were lower than those of the control column fig 5a c the leachate acidity ph fluctuated significantly for both bacteria leaching columns but with larger fluctuations observed for the miccp column fig 5b d due to the nh4 and oh produced by the miccp process qian et al 2010 3 3 biogenic calcium carbonate in miccp column as the carbonate determination was carried out after leaching experiment results are presented separately for each bacteria species the amount of calcium carbonate decreased with depth fig 6 the bottom layer 12 15 cm had about 2 more calcium carbonate than the control table 1 it seems that top of the column application of the sporosarcina pasteurii is the main contributor to the pattern of biogenic carbonate with depth as the bacteria may be filtrated and resident in the upper layer and showed their own ureolytic activity the p fluorescens column had more calcium carbonate than the e coli column at all layers assuming that the biogenic carbonate in each layer of sand was approximately equal prior to bacteria leaching a possible role for e coli it may be speculated in dissolving carbonate e coli as a facultative anaerobic organism can produce organic acids in its mixed acid fermentation metabolism madigan et al 2017 which may decompose calcium carbonate fermentation of glycogen known to be employed as an energy storage polymer in e coli dawes and senior 1973 will continue throughout sand column processing until samples are full dried before this analysis this process is postulated to dissolve the lost carbonate 3 4 average c av and cumulative c cum bacterial counts in leachate average c av and cumulative c cum cell density of bacteria leached from the sand in control columns was significantly higher than for the miccp treated sand the c av and c cum for both bacteria decreased around 3 9 times in miccp column versus the in control table 2 however the impact of miccp on c av and c cum of each bacterial strain was different for p fluorescens miccp reduced c av by 4 6 times and c cum by 4 5 times versus the control sand for e coli the same parameters were reduced by 3 2 and 3 8 times respectively the total cell density of each bacterium added on top of the columns i e 0 1 pv containing 108 cell ml 1 equates to a total of 11 9 108 cells much smaller numbers 7 02 and 6 50 log cfu for e coli and 7 09 and 6 44 log cfu for p fluorescens were eluted in the leaching experiments of control and miccp columns respectively the second and third data rows of table 3 show how the added numbers partition into bacteria eluted and those retained calculated by difference in the columns 3 5 residual bacteria in sand columns the miccp treatment the sand layer and their interactions had significant effects on resident e coli counts log cfu g 1 sand in the sand column p 0 01 fig 7 most residual e coli counts were measured in the first layer 0 3 cm of the miccp column but were not significantly more than for the second layers 3 6 cm in the 12 15 cm layer the residual e coli counts were the lowest and statistically similar between the control sand and the miccp treated sand fig 7a thus while the counts of residual e coli in sand layers decreased with depth for both treatments the decline was sharper in the miccp columns given that the repacking of the sand was uniform across the column depth the reduction in residual bacteria with depth is a function of effective collision efficiency which is dependent on the distance of travel unc et al 2012 which can lead to bioclogging of pores by bacteria morales et al 2010 this leads to an accumulation of bacteria in the superficial layers reducing downward mass transfer a phenomenon previously reported huysman and verstraete 1993 jiang et al 2007 the importance of these few top first centimeters of soil layer for bacterial filtration unc et al 2012 was employed to declare that the column s length might have a negligible impact on the e coli filtration jiang et al 2007 clearly a statistical argument fraught with subjectivity outside the context of a relevant regulatory threshold for the receiving groundwater or any receiving tile drain effect of miccp and sand layer were similarly significant for residual p fluorescens counts p 0 01 while the count distribution with depth fig 7b was similar to the one observed for e coli there was no statistical significant difference between the two bottom layers i e 9 12 cm vs 12 15 cm p 0 05 in this treatment for both bacteria the miccp led to a reduction of bacteria with depth directly consistent with the calcium carbonate level in the sand layers fig 6 thus it might be speculated that the bioprecipitated calcium carbonate may adsorb bacteria directly on its surface electrostatic effect and or can narrow pores enhancing physical retention of bacteria organic carbon considered a main factor for adsorption and retention of bacteria in the porous media al degs et al 2000 was not detected in the studied sand table 1 furthermore sand particles have negligible electrical charges sparks 1998 based on the point of zero charge ph of caco3 phzpc 9 5 to 10 8 foppen and schijve 2006 calcium carbonate is a good adsorbent for bacteria the average ph of miccp columns in this study was about 7 8 thus with calcium carbonate having a positive surface charge this can favor adsorption of bacteria which usually have net negative surface charges furthermore miccp calcium carbonate bridges soil particles abu ashour et al 1998 increasing structural stability but due to cementation at high concentrations can reduce the permeability of sandy soils de muynck et al 2010 phillips et al 2013 by as much as 90 whiffin et al 2007 physical retention of bacteria due to bioprecipitated carbonate was a likely explanation given the parallel reduction in hydraulic conductivity which was 72 92 lower in miccp than in the control column with adsorption a secondary factor this led to the counts of residual bacteria in the 6 9 cm layer in the miccp treatment to be statistically similar to the top layer of the untreated control column an indication of the shallow miccp layer that might be recommended to filter bacteria nevertheless the type of bacterium is important the mean residual p fluorescens counts were higher than for e coli but the miccp treatment was in term of mass balance more effective on straining p fluorescens overall given to the filling of the column with 432 g sand section 2 3 and its uniform distribution in each layer according to data fig 7 the total counts of e coli and p fluorescens cells retained in control columns were 6 2 6 8 log cfu and in miccp columns were 7 6 8 3 log cfu respectively table 3 row 4 data dividing these residual bacteria by total cell density added on top of the column yields very low residual bacteria in sand column after leaching experiment table 3 apart from the flaws of the plate count method which usually represents 1 to 5 of the number determined by direct microscopy in environmental e g soil water and sediment samples kandeler 2007 the extra stickiness of freshly isolated e coli as already discussed on section 3 1 will cause it to adhere more avidly to sand particles than does the employed pseudomonas strain from a culture collection under this view the retained bacteria determined by viable plate count vpc table 3 row 4 data drastically under represent total retained bacteria of both types because bacteria in general are notoriously difficult to detach from sand particles and thus may be poorly represented by vpc kepner and pratt 1994 furthermore clumps of bacteria eluted from a column will register as single colony forming units this line of thinking concludes by viewing more avid attachment of e coli to sand along with a greater tendency to clump with other cells as combining to make its vpc from sand numbers severely underestimate the actual abundance of this bacterium under this analysis pseudomonas vpc from sand face a similar problem that manifests to a lesser degree because they are less sticky 3 6 bacterial filtration coefficient λf and the maximum bacterial transport depth z max analyses of variance for miccp treatment bacteria and their interactions showed that only the former was significant for adsorption parameters including λf zmax and sr and average c ave and cumulative c cum cell density of bacteria in the leachate p 0 01 the λf m 1 indicates the ability of a porous medium to retain bacteria that usually occurs through a combination of electrochemical adsorption of bacteria on the particle surfaces and their entrapment in the fine pores in the other words the λf shows the relative numbers of the filtered bacteria per unit length of soil column unc and goss 2003 for the miccp sand the λf 1 2 times greater than control table 2 in direct correlation with a considerable reduction in the hydraulic conductivity in comparison with control sand we must acknowledge here that under real conditions the soil saturation state has a dominant role in controlling λ f mosaddeghi et al 2010 and thus this might affect the relationship between water flow and bacterial transport possibly further enhancing filtration z max which predicts the maximum depth of bacterial transport in a filtering porous medium is inversely related to the λ f thus a large infiltration coefficient leads to deepest bacterial transfer unc and goss 2003 the z max for miccp columns decreased by 14 8 compared to control sand table 2 precipitation of biogenic calcium carbonate in the sand pores reduces the water flux rate preventing the bacteria transfer to deeper layers 3 7 relative adsorption index s r the calculated s r values for miccp column 0 98 was significantly greater than that in control sand p 0 05 table 2 organic carbon calcium carbonate and clay minerals are the main factors contributing bacteria adsorption and filtration which controls the s r in soils stevik et al 1999 lo et al 2002 given the conditions of our tests the greater s r value in the miccp treatment can be directly related to biogenic production of calcium carbonate as regarding the role of bacteria in s r larger cells are less likely to be transported far in soil than smaller cells gannon et al 1991 hendry et al 1999 and the rod like cells attach more readily than cocci salerno et al 2006 while both bacteria examined in this study are rod shaped bacilli e coli cells are generally about 2 0 µm long and 0 25 1 0 µm in diameter madigan et al 2017 while pseudomonas cells can be approximately 2 0 2 5 µm in length and 0 5 µm in width martínez garcía et al 2015 either of these parameters could have been relevant to the enhanced retention versus that of e coli compared to the calculations based on eq 9 s r values table 2 the overall residual bacteria in sand medium is low in fact this equation shows the difference between the bacteria eluted from the column and the bacteria added on top of the column and combines bacteria mortality adsorption and straining as filtration an ambiguity which described by mathess et al 1988 therefore the retained values obtained for each column are very high all above 98 certainly the pulse input of bacteria in comparison with continuous input had also great role in such high s r values on the hand the total residual bacteria in sand columns fig 7 demonstrate the bacteria numbers that are still viable and are at risk of surplus leaching if they could detach from sand media 4 conclusions the urease activity by sporsarcina pasteurii and deposition of stable produced calcium carbonate between the sand particles in the miccp treatment decreased the hydraulic conductivity of the sand column 73 compared to control this was directly related to a significant decrease of e coli and p fluorescens transport in sand columns a phenomenon that can be assigned to the decrease in hydraulic conductivity electrostatic adsorption of bacteria on biprecipitated calcium carbonate and as well as to straining and bioclogging in the pores therefore the miccp process not only can reduce the transport of pathogenic bacteria to groundwater but can also retain beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere miccp can be an eco friendly economical and efficient technology to reduce pollution of water resources by bio pollutants in riparian area this method seems to be economically justified especially in sandy riparian soils where it is not possible to accomplish soil aquifer treatment practices declaration of

1016,the cascade development of water resource will lead to cumulative effect of supersaturated total dissolved gas tdg on the ecological environment which will cause lethal disease to fish the tdg dissipates slowly in deep reservoir areas and if supersaturated tdg can t recover through the spillway then it will lead to continuous accumulation in the stilling basin in order to investigate the cumulative effect of supersaturated tdg of hydropower cascades a validated tdg numerical model with the vof method and des model was used to simulate a spillway discharge of tongjiezi dam with supersaturated tdg and 100 tdg inflow in this model bubble size change is calculated by bubble number density equation and tdg is simulated by transport equation considering the gas liquid mass transfer comparing with the tdg 100 inflow case it indicated forebay tdg level caused by the upstream dams should be considered and involved in the downstream tdg evaluation this paper also proposed an engineering measure with baffle blocks in the spillway which can reduce entrained bubble mass and tdg saturation level at the entry point than the case without blocks it shows baffle blocks in the spillway can effectively reduce the cumulative effect of supersaturated tdg it is a critical step for the mitigation of accumulation of supersaturated tdg through the spillway and the results provide reference about mitigation measure of supersaturated tdg for hydropower cascades keywords total dissolved gas cascade power stations cumulative effects baffle blocks 1 introduction the cascade power station mode is the dominant method of hydropower development all over the world which can make full use of water energy resources however the cascade power station discharge will lead to cumulative effects on the ecological environment supersaturated total dissolved gas tdg by high dam discharge can cause gas bubble disease gbd and even death on fish weitkamp and katz 1980 weitkamp et al 2003 the severity of gbd depends on the level of tdg fish life stage and cumulative exposure time tan 2006 since supersaturated tdg dissipates very slowly in the deep reservoir areas tdg may be supersaturated in the forebay of downstream dam if supersaturated tdg can t back to 100 saturation through the spillway then it will lead to continuous accumulation in the stilling basin previous studies about the continuous accumulation of supersaturated tdg assumed the upstream supersaturated tdg would recover at the entry point in downstream stilling basin during the spillway dissipation or jet break process and they only focused on the impart of tailwater from the powerhouse ma 2016 xue et al 2019 established a tdg prediction formula involving the initial tdg level based on physical experiments for jet flow however the research about continuous accumulation of supersaturated tdg through the spillway is still lacking this study simulated the distribution of supersaturated tdg in the spillway and the subsequent cumulative effects with numerical model in the past decade tdg numerical models have been developed politano et al 2007 started to used two phase flow model to simulate the tdg transport process with bubble number density equation to predict bubble size in the water the source term in the tdg equation was expressed as the mass transfer through the bubble liquid interface fu et al 2010 and wang et al 2018 used two phase model to simulate tdg generation and distribution in three dimension with rans reynolds average navier stokes and des detached eddy simulation turbulent model respectively good agreement between measured and numerical results were obtained for these studies in order to reduce the cumulative effects of supersaturated tdg li 2018 proposed joint operation methods for cascade hydropower stations considering the effect of powerhouse tailwater many studies worked on the variables and factors would affect the tdg distribution and mitigate tdg level such as water depth turbulent condition water temperature wind velocity and vegetation shen et al 2014 huang et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 now the most popular engineering mitigation measure is spillway deflector which can redirect the plunging flow into surface jet and then reduce the bubble transport to depth and consequent air dissolution the simulated result of politano et al 2016 indicates the deflector can effectively reduce tdg concentration downstream of the dam and reduce possible threaten on migrating fish but the deflector can t work for roller bucket type energy dissipation with surface jet a spillway of tongjiezi dam was selected to simulate in this paper the operational condition and upstream supersaturated tdg data were from field observation in order to analyze the cumulative effects a case with tdg 100 inflow was designed to simulate in addition an engineering mitigation measure with the installing of baffle blocks in spillway was proposed to reduce tdg continuous accumulation 2 material and methods the numerical model presented in wang et al 2018 was used in this study in this model vof volume of fluid method is used to track the water surface

other area can be calculated under the laws 3 calculation 3 1 site description tongjiezi is a hydropower station in dadu river china the upper cascade hydropower station is gongzui dam the total storage of tongjiezi reservoir is 2 6 hundred million cubic meters the concrete gravity dam is 82 meters high five spillway bays with tainter gates are consisted and two rows of end sills in the stilling basin were installed for energy dissipation the field observation was conducted by the sichuan university tdg was measured in the reservoir 500 m upstream of the dam and in the tailrace upstream of the second end sill the tdg percent saturation was measured with ysi5200 tgp do and pt4 tgp probes the operational condition of tongjiezi dam on aug 6th 2009 was selected to simulate water temperatures on that day was 19 2 c table 1 shows the operational conditions used for the numerical simulations politano et al 2019c indicated for tongjiezi dam the relative errors of tdg saturation at the measurement point between the numerical model and the field observation was 3 8 with a gas volume fraction of 0 03 and bubble diameter of 0 4 mm at the inlet 3 2 grids and boundary conditions the simulation included the spillway and stilling basin fig 1 shows the grid and the sketch of boundary condition unsteady rans simulations with a standard k ε model were performed to determine the grid size multiblock structured grids with refinement near the free surface the grids contain approximately 3 6 105 nodes in order to reduce the computing time a reduced domain comprising bay 1 and a symmetry boundary was used uniform velocity profile and zero turbulence quantities were imposed at the spillway gates at the outlet hydrostatic pressure was imposed below the tailwater elevation a no slip condition was used at the walls 3 3 simulation cases three cases were simulated as table 2 shows therein case 1 with 0 03 gas volume fraction and 0 4 mm bubble diameter was the validation case in order to analyze the cumulative effects of supersaturated tdg in spillway case 2 with forebay 100 tdg was designed the gas volume fraction and bubble diameter was the same with case 1 the case 3 was the baffle blocks case size of blocks was 2 m 2 m 2 m as fig 2 shows 4 results 4 1 simulation results γ 0 5 was used to define the water surface fig 3 a shows time averaged velocity magnitude and velocity vectors along the centerline of spillway bay 1 in water phase for case 1 since the bubble equations do not affect the liquid flow case 1 and case 2 were in the same flow field velocity vectors were interpolated in a coarser grid for easy visualization the spillway jet plunges at high velocity into the stilling basin floor the highest velocity was near the entry point and it was about 21 1 m s spillway jet with high velocity led to short resident time for bubbles as fig 4 shows the sectional average of gas volume fraction at the entry point was 0 032 and 0 025 for case 1 and case 2 respectively most of entrained bubbles are transported downward by the plunging jet to the deep at high pressure regions and dissolved there bubble dissolution generates tdg fig 5 and fig 6 are time averaged tdg saturation for case 1 and case 2 respectively the highest tdg saturation predicted with the model were found at the bottom of the stilling basin near the end sill and reached about 157 9 and 144 8 for case 1 and case 2 respectively the results indicate because of low pressure in the spillway tdg dissipation was caused especially at the area near the water surface the tdg saturation for case 1 at the entry point was 116 1 fig 7 is the sectional mean tdg saturation along the spillway tdg saturation of case 1 was higher than the value of case 2 due to the high gas volume fraction and tdg level at the entry point for case 1 more tdg was generated at the basin and downstream tdg level was much higher too it shows forebay tdg level caused by the upstream dams can affect the tdg distribution downstream and cause cumulative effect 4 2 effect of baffle blocks in spillway figs 8 a and b are water surface for case 1 and case 3 respectively water flow was broken near the baffle blocks in spillway which led to strong turbulence and rise of water level fig 3b is time averaged velocity magnitude and velocity vectors for case 3 comparing with fig 3a the flow velocity in spillway was smaller the maximum velocity was only 18 2 m s the broken flow caused the dissipation of energy and mixture of air and water gas volume fraction decreased after the blocks because bubbles moved into the air fig 4 the sectional average of gas volume fraction at the entry point was 0 032 and 0 018 for case1 and case3 respectively the low flow velocity and mixture of air and water near the blocks increased the gas liquid transfer and accelerated the supersaturated tdg dissipation fig 9 is tdg isosurface of these cases respectively tdg level decreased after the baffle blocks for case 3 the tdg level at the entry point was 110 9 about 5 2 lower than the result without blocks due to the lower gas volume fraction and tdg level at the entry point for case 3 less tdg was generated at the basin and downstream tdg level was much lower too the results show baffle blocks in the spillway can effectively reduce the cumulative effect of supersaturated tdg 5 conclusions and discussion the continuous accumulation of supersaturated tdg was studied in this paper with numerical model due to the high gas volume fraction and more tdg mass at the entry point for supersaturated tdg inflow case more tdg was generated at the basin and downstream tdg level was much higher too for this case forebay tdg level caused by the upstream dams should be considered and involved in the downstream tdg evaluation the simulation of an engineering measure with the installing of baffle blocks proposed by this paper indicated it can effectively reduce the cumulative effect of supersaturated tdg in this study the whole entrained air in the discharge process was only presented by a parameter of gas volume fraction it can t describe the real condition of air entrainment for turbulence therefore the work of this paper focuses on the mass transfer between bubbles and tdg and further work will focus on the simulation of entrained air by turbulence during the discharge process this study is

1017,the present study investigated the evolution of the contamination of the estuary of the caeté river by thermotolerant coliforms over the past decade the hypothesis tested was that the conditions of the caeté estuary have worsened over this period due to a combination of population growth and the lack of investment in public sanitation by the local authorities samples for hydrological and microbiological analysis were collected at eight sample points in 2013 2014 2018 and 2019 the upper sector of the estuary was represented by the samples from p1 p4 this sector is the most urbanized and the most affected by human activities with 100 of the samples collected presenting thermotolerant coliform concentrations of over 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 conditions were also considered to be inappropriate for human use in other areas at certain times of year despite being located within a protected area the implementation of a public sanitation system proposed in the master plan of the municipality of bragança almost two decades ago has yet to be initiated compared with the results of previous studies of the caeté estuary more than a decade ago the contamination of the water has increased considerably based on the criteria of the current brazilian legislation all types of human use of the water are compromised although socioeconomic activities continue as normal this

including that of the amazon river itself the bac includes a number of relatively isolated and sparsely inhabited municipalities often occupied by traditional populations as well as more densely populated areas and urban zones pereira et al 2009 given the extensive local hydrographic network most towns on the amazon coast have been built on the margins of estuaries as in the case of bragança located in northeastern pará founded in 1613 bragança is a historical town that grew up on the margins of the estuary of the caeté river although the lack of adequate public policies and investment in basic infrastructure such as public sanitation has caused serious impacts on the quality of the estuary with deleterious consequences for the local population gorayeb et al 2009 pereira et al 2010 the lack of an adequate public sanitation system is not restricted to the municipality of bragança however affects virtually all of the municipalities of the amazon coast brondizio et al 2016 mansur et al 2016 sousa felix et al 2017 between 2005 and 2010 a series of studies gorayeb et al 2009 guimarães et al 2009a pereira et al 2010 reported the problems caused by the lack of a public sanitation system in the municipality of bragança in particular the contamination of the waters of the estuary of the caeté river principally in the upper sector of the estuary where the majority of the population of the town of bragança approximately 50 000 inhabitants is concentrated the studies found that the town market local fisheries and businesses and domestic residences are the principal sources de contamination of the caeté estuary gorayeb et al 2009 guimarães et al 2009a monteiro et al 2011 2016a but quantitative data is not available in literature in the 21st century the population of the municipality of bragança has grown at a rate of 2 1 per annum ibge 2020 has this population growth together with the lack of adequate management plans or investments in services and infrastructure including public sanitation compromised the quality of the water of the caeté estuary to answer this question the present study covers two different periods in 2013 2014 and 2018 2019 evaluating the local environmental conditions based on the analysis of hydrological variables and anthropogenic impacts through the measurement of thermotolerant coliform concentrations this pathogenic bacterium was used in the present study because it is universal in sewage water and has been widely used around the world as an indicator of human impacts and sanitary conditions as discussed above the hydrological and microbiological conditions of the estuary were assessed based on the criteria described in detail in the methods section these parameters were compared with those recorded between 2005 and 2010 to determine whether local conditions have stabilized or worsened in this interim during this decade bacterial counts declined only during the months when rainfall peaked guimarães et al 2009a monteiro et al 2011 given this the operational hypothesis is that the quality of the conditions in the caeté estuary have worsened significantly over the past decade independently of the season this analysis was based on the diagnostic tool known as the dpswr that is driver pressure state welfare response cooper 2013 which was applied to the evaluation of social questions in the context of the study area 2 study area the hydrographic basin of the caeté river is located in northeastern pará within a region that has the highest population density in this brazilian state the river is 149 km long between its source in the municipality of bonito and its mouth in caeté urumajó bay with a total drainage area of 2 195 km2 gorayeb et al 2011 the caeté basin drains seven municipalities and passes through the towns of bragança and santa luzia do pará and 19 traditional communities gorayeb 2008 with a total population of approximately 260 000 inhabitants ibge 2020 bragança is the region s principal urban center linked directly to the caeté river the municipality of bragança 01 06 13 s 46 77 56 w is located in the northeastern pará mesoregion approximately 210 km due east of the state capital belém this town is an important cultural and economic center for the region and has 127 686 inhabitants within an area of 124 734 km2 ibge 2020 located within the equatorial zone the climate of the study region is hot and humid with annual precipitation of 2400 2700 mm and a mean annual temperature of 27 c inmet 2019 some 75 85 of the annual precipitation is normally recorded during the first six months of the year while september october and november are typically the driest months this seasonal pattern is determined primarily by the annual shift of the intertropical convergence zone itcz over northern brazil marengo et al 2013 with a total area of 220 km2 the estuary of the caeté river fig 1 is part of the caeté taperaçú marine extractivist reserve and is classified as a permanently open estuary with a depth of approximately 10 m at its mouth and highly turbid waters in some sectors barletta bergan et al 2002 this estuary is highly dynamic with tidal heights of up to 2 4 m during the neap tides and 4 6 m on the spring tide with current velocities that may exceed 1 5 m s 1 monteiro et al 2011 cavalcante et al 2010 the population density of the bragança coastal plain is low and the margins of the estuary are covered with mangrove forest which is dominated by three tree species rhizophora mangle l avicennia germinans l and laguncularia racemosa l c f gaertn cohen et al 1999 menezes et al 2008 the principal economic activities in the rural sector on the margins of the estuary are fisheries and subsistence farming krause and glaser 2003 glaser and diele 2004 3 methods data on the precipitation and fluvial discharge of caeté river were obtained from public institutions while the hydrological data were obtained during fieldwork in the middle and upper estuary of the caeté river a total of eight sampling points were selected randomly in the study area samples were collected in both the dry and the rainy seasons on both the flood and ebb tides in 2013 2014 and 2018 2019 3 1 precipitation and fluvial discharge monthly precipitation data were provided by the inmet meteorological station at tracuateua located 36 m above the ground approximately 17 km west of the town of bragança for the period between 2000 and 2019 the records of the fluvial discharge of the caeté river were provided by the national waters agency ana gauge station at nova mocajuba approximately 23 km upstream from the upper sector of the estuary 3 2 field methods samples of the surface water were collected in zones with different levels of urbanization using a motorboat samples were collected in october 2013 february may and august 2014 september and december 2018 and march and june 2019 a total of 16 samples representing the ebb and flood tides were collected at eight randomly selected points in zones affected by the discharge of waste water or at localities where economic activities may interfere in the quality of the waters of the estuary table 1 a check list was applied to identify the principal sources of contamination of the caeté estuary the number of individuals using the public toilet in the bragança public market was counted from 8am to 12am during periods of both low 22 25th august 2016 and high demand 2 6th september 2016 to estimate the maximum quantity of thermotolerant coliforms discharged per day into the caeté estuary this estimate was based on the protocol of ellis 2004 a ctd equipped with turbidity and dissolved oxygen sensors was used to record the salinity temperature dissolved oxygen and turbidity of the water the measurements were taken at 5 minute intervals at each sampling point samples of the surface water were collected simultaneously using a niskin bottle a total of 128 samples were collected for the ph and chlorophyll a analyses and a further 128 samples were obtained for the microbiological analyses once collected the water samples obtained using niskin bottle were stored in 250 ml polyethylene containers or in glass flasks in the samples destined for the analysis of fecal coliforms the samples were labeled and stored at 4 c prior to processing in the laboratory following the apha 2004 protocol 3 3 laboratory procedures in the laboratory the ph values were determined immediately using a ph meter the chlorophyll a concentrations were extracted from the acetate filters with 90 acetone v v and determined using the spectrophotometric approach described by parsons and strickland 1963 and unesco 1966 the thermotolerant coliform concentrations were measured using the multiple tubes method following the procedures recommended by apha 2004 this method is based on the inoculation of the sample in sodium lauryl sulphate presumptive test and brilliant green broths confirmatory test followed by incubation for 48 hours at 35 2 c positive samples were inoculated in escherichia coli ec selective broth for 48 hours at 44 5 c in both procedures the presence of bacteria is detected by the clouding of the water and the formation of gas in the durham tubes the water quality was classified based on the criteria established by bricker et al 2003 for chlorophyll a hypereutrophic 60 mg m 3 high 20 60 mg m 3 medium 5 20 mg m 3 low 5 mg m 3 and dissolved oxygen anoxia 0 mg l 1 hypoxia 0 2 mg l 1 biological stress 2 5 mg l 1 ideal 5 mg l 1 and using the conselho nacional do meio ambiente 2000 criteria for turbidity ideal not observed poor observed and ph ideal 6 5 8 5 undesirable 6 5 the daily per capita production of effluents were estimated for each urban nucleus at least 150 l or rural settlement at least 120 l with the quantity of thermotolerant coliforms beings estimated at 100 400 billion minimum maximum based on the approach proposed by von sperling 2007 the population of each urban nucleus was obtained from www brasilsabido com br and that of each rural settlement from guimarães 2011 based on statistics it is assumed a growth rate up to 2 1 per annum in the last decade according with ibge 2020 3 4 application of the dpswr the socioeconomic analyses of the present study were based on the dpswr drive pressure state welfare response framework developed by cooper 2013 which was selected for this study because it permits the identification of the social component and provide insights into the potential role that should be the responsibility of the local authorities the social and environmental problems were identified using the whole of the dataset compiled during the study in order to best comprehend the magnitude of the pressures affecting the local environment the wellbeing of the local populations and the potential response or otherwise of the local authorities 3 5 statistical analyses the statistical analyses were preceded by the lilliefors test conover 1971 to determine the normality and the cochran test for the homoscedasticity underwood 1997 of the distribution of the abiotic and biological data the data were then log x 1 transformed as necessary to normalize and homogenize the study variables to satisfy the assumptions for the subsequent analyses if normality and homoscedasticity were not achieved by this transformation the nonparametric mann whitney u and or kruskal wallis h test were applied when the kruskal wallis indicated significant variation in the data a posteriori comparison was run using the student newman keuls test zar 2010 nonparametric tests were applied when the assumptions of parametric tests could not be satisfied even by transforming the data the statistical analyses described above were processed in statistica 8 0 statsoft 2009 considering different levels of significance p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 the variation in the environmental data temperature salinity ph turbidity and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen chlorophyll a and thermotolerant coliforms were verified using a principal components analysis pca to determine the spatial seasonal and inter annual patterns in the parameters this analysis was run in canoco ter braak 1986 ter braak and smilauer 1998 and the groups were defined in the pca plots using 95 confidence interval the coefficients of each pca are presented in supplementary material s1 this indirect multivariate ordering test was used to describe the linear spatial and temporal similarities and differences in the data based on the environmental parameters the data were transformed by the amplitude of their variation ranging milligan and cooper 1988 legendre and legendre 2012 this standardization avoids possible distortions related to the distinct orders of magnitude of the numerical values and the variation in the variances of the different parameters 4 results 4 1 precipitation and fluvial discharge the mean precipitation in the study area between 2013 and 2019 was 2 372 mm fig 2 a the driest year of the study was 2013 1 612 mm while the rainiest was 2019 with 3 512 mm while 2014 and 2018 had annual totals close to the historical mean the rains were more intense 100 mm per month between february and july in 2013 and 2014 whereas in 2019 the rainy season lasted from january to august with 97 54 of the total annual precipitation being recorded during these eight months february march and april 2019 were the rainiest month around 600 mm per month of the whole study period whereas september october and november were the driest 15 mm per month the fluvial discharge fig 2b followed a similar pattern with the lowest values being recorded in 2013 annual mean 28 3 m3 s 1 and the highest in 2019 annual mean 54 3 m3 s 1 in 2013 and 2014 the highest monthly were recorded in may 87 6 m3 s 1 and 97 9 m3 s 1 respectively whereas in 2018 and 2019 as the onset of the rains was earlier discharge peaked in april reaching 87 7 m3 s 1 and 111 4 m3 s 1 respectively 4 2 hydrological variables significant spatial variation table 2 was observed only in temperature h 15 2 p 0 05 and salinity h 40 1 p 0 001 the temperature salinity and ph values all

by contrast chlorophyll a decreased between p2 19 4 17 3 mg m 3 and p8 5 6 2 6 mg m 3 the dissolved oxygen concentrations were slightly higher at p1 5 1 0 8 mg l 1 and p8 4 8 1 0 mg l 1 and lower at p6 4 5 1 0 mg l 1 while turbidity was highest at p5 318 1 348 5 ntu and p6 283 9 265 7 ntu and lowest at p7 149 2 133 0 ntu and p8 138 8 144 5 ntu the spatial distribution of the values is shown in fig 3 and the results of the pca in fig 4 in the principal components analysis pca axis 1 39 2 concentrated the majority of the more external sampling points p5 p6 p7 and p8 indicating a positive correlation between these sectors and salinity temperature and ph thus separating the sectors that were most distant from the center of bragança fig 4 the negative portion of this axis reflected the importance of the thermotolerant coliforms see results in section 4 3 with a predominance of the more internal sampling points p1 p2 p3 and p4 which are closest to the town axis 1 describes a gradient of increasing salinity and temperature that varies spatially by contrast axis 2 concentrated 24 of the variance in the data emphasizing in the positive portion of the axis iv and i the concentrations of chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen and in the negative portion iii and ii the samples with higher concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms and turbidity see results in section 4 3 although it was possible to relate the samples directly to the hydrological variables there was no significant spatial interaction overlap of the ellipses no significant variation was recorded between the flood and ebb tides although significant differences were observed among months and between seasons table 2 the waters were warmer u 127 0 p 0 001 more saline u 995 0 p 0 001 and more alkaline u 832 5 p 0 001

projecting the ph temperature salinity and turbidity concentrated in the samples from the dry season of 2013 and an association between salinity and turbidity it is also possible to observe a greater concentration of samples from the dry seasons of 2014 and 2018 which were characterized by higher values of salinity temperature and ph the second axis in turn explained 24 of the variability in the data with the positive portion iv and i projecting dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a which were most associated with the samples from the rainy season of 2019 while its negative portion iii highlighted the importance of the thermotolerant coliforms see results in section 4 3 which were associated with the samples from the rainy season of 2014 salinity and thermotolerant coliforms were significant in both axes while do turbidity and chlorophyll a were significant only on the second axis thus indicating a significant temporal interaction which can be observed in the dry season of 2013 and the rainy season of 2019 4 3 microbiological variables over three quarters 77 of the samples present thermotolerant coliform concentrations of 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 or higher which is the maximum threshold recommended for most types of water usage fig 7 a and table 6 significant spatial patterns were recorded h 42 3 p 0 001 table 2 with the most contaminated points being located in the vicinity of the town of bragança p1 p4 where 82 of the samples had coliform concentrations of over 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 fig 7b no significant variation was found among months or tides however table 2 although significant differences were observed between seasons u 1561 5 p 0 05 with 77 of the samples having coliform concentrations of over 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 in the rainy season and 55 in the dry season fig 7d these concentrations also varied inter annually among sampling stations h 10 6 p 0 05 with the rainy season of 2019 being the most contaminated with 95 of the samples having concentrations of over 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 4 4 application of the dpswr model bragança has no sewage collection or treatment system and part of its sewage is discharged in natura into the estuaries of the caeté and cereja rivers the cereja river discharges in the upper sector of the caeté estuary after crossing the whole of the town of bragança passing through seven neighborhoods taíra vila sinhá cereja centro padre luiz i and ii and aldeia in addition to the effluents of the cereja river the sewage of the residential neighborhoods of riozinho centro and aldeia and the commercial district and port area are discharged directly into the caeté estuary primarily in its upper sector which coincides with the most densely urbanized area of the municipality table 3 shows the number of inhabitants recorded in the most recent census 2010 for the neighborhoods of bragança and 2005 for the rural communities and the estimates for 2014 and 2019 as well as the production of effluents and the minimum and maximum numbers of thermotolerant coliforms recorded for the respective periods the estimates for 2019 may exceed these values by at least 20 given the mean population growth rate of 2 1 per annum recorded in the municipality of bragança in recent decades by ibge 2020 one other source of contamination by thermotolerant coliforms is the bragança public market the public toilet in this market is used by hundreds of stall workers and customers that are mostly resident in bragança and the surrounding area the effluents produced by this toilet are discharged untreated into the estuary and counts conducted on different days each month indicated that dozens of individuals frequent this facility from which it was estimated that up to 2 65 1011 mpn 100 ml 1 of thermotolerant coliforms are discharged into the caeté estuary every day in addition to this public toilet other sources of contamination can be found in the bragança public market table 4 which impact even further the quality of the water of the upper caeté estuary ice factories and fish processing plants as well as jetties and businesses are found along the middle sector of the caeté estuary table 1 the excess of organic matter discharged into the waters of the upper sector of the caeté estuary table 4 may have favored the proliferation of algae due to the high concentrations of chlorophyll a recorded in the sector closest to the town of bragança the excess of organic matter may also have contributed to the proliferation of decomposing bacteria that consume the dissolved oxygen given that in various months principally at the points in the vicinity of bragança the concentrations of dissolved oxygen were lower than 5 mg l 1 the concentrations recorded in the study and the limits established under current brazilian legislation are shown in table 5 as shown in sections 4 2 and 4 3 the strong rains in the first half of the year have a direct effect on the conditions in the estuary with the water becoming more acidic with a higher density of phytoplankton and greater contamination by thermotolerant coliforms principally in the more urbanized sector fig 7b the rains thus appear to be the principal factor determining the ph values of less than 6 5 recorded during some periods of the year high turbidity is also a natural characteristic of the water and will be discussed in section 5 1 the concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms 77 of the samples followed by the concentrations of dissolved oxygen 64 of the samples and chlorophyll a 13 of the samples indicate that the waters of the caeté estuary are being contaminated by sewage tables 5 and 6 principally in its upper sector which is the most urbanized in fact the findings of the present study are consistent with high levels of contamination which indicate the need for the prohibition of socioeconomic activities in the middle sector of the estuary during a number of months per year table 1 and in the upper sector the existing legislation should be enforced more systematically given the prohibition of commercial activities on the margins of the estuary these activities should be relocated to different areas of the town and the infrastructure necessary for the treatment of liquid and solid waste should be constructed this contamination occurs within part of the caeté taperaçu marine extractive reserve or adjacent to this area where human activities should be regulated by the management plan of the reserve icmbio 2012 the margins of the cereja river which is an area of environmental protection and preservation municipal law number 12 651 of may 25th 2012 have been occupied illegally despite being located within a protected zone the study area lacks investment by the local authorities in public sanitation which contradicts the objectives established by the participative master plan of the municipal government itself municipal law number 3 875 of october 10th 2006 through this legislation the municipality focused on the problem of the town s sanitary sewage and assumed a commitment to resolve the situation within the following 10 years table 7 this deadline passed in 2016 however and the problem remains unresolved the ideal solution for the recuperation of the quality of the water of the caeté estuary in the study sector would be the construction of a sewage collection and treatment plant together with the prohibition of the discharge of effluents into either the caeté estuary or the cereja river the results of the dpswr management model are summarized in fig 8 an additional component natural conditions was included in this model 5 discussion to better understand the anthropogenic conditions of the study area it is necessary to first discuss the natural characteristics of the area which is similar to other amazonian estuarine environments the first section below covers the natural functioning of the hydrological variables monitored here while the subsequent section will consider how the caeté estuary is being affected by the high levels of sanitary sewage being produced in the municipality of bragança 5 1 natural conditions the estuarine waters of the amazon coast are relatively warm and stable varying by only 2 3 c between the dry and rainy seasons pamplona et al 2013 pereira et al 2017 as shown in the present study by contrast salinity oscillates considerably in response to the variation in local rainfall levels and fluvial discharge asp et al 2018 during the first half of the year when the itcz is over the southern hemisphere the rains are intense normally over 2 000 mm and salinity decreases reaching zero in the area between sampling points p1 and p4 principally during the rainiest quarter of the year when fluvial discharge peaks the opposite pattern 10 psu is observed during the driest quarter of the year in addition to this temporal variation there is a longitudinal gradient of salinity with lower values being recorded in the upper sector superior greater fluvial influence and higher values in the middle sector greater marine influence as observed in the study area between points p1 and p8 the ph of the coastal amazonian waters also varies primarily in relation to the input of fresh water which is determined by local rainfall patterns and the fluvial discharge santos et al 2008 the ph of these coastal waters ranges from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline typically oscillating between 6 and 8 depending on the time of year during the dry season when the estuarine waters are more saline the ph tends to vary from neutral to slightly alkaline 7 8 whereas during the rainy season it is slightly acidic to neutral 6 7 as shown by leite et al 2009 magalhães et al 2011 and pamplona et al 2013 and the present study in the present study the turbidity of the water does not appear to have been affected only by the rains in fact a number of previous studies have shown that the ample local mangroves the broad drainage network and the high hydrodynamic energy of the estuary are factors that favour the suspension of large quantities of particles in the coastal waters of the amazon littoral pereira et al 2013 asp et al 2018 during the first half of the year the waters are relatively turbid due to the rains and the input of suspended particles from the mangrove forest and the drainage basins whereas in the second half of the year the turbidity of the water is maintained by the high levels off hydrodynamic energy which provokes the resuspension of the bottom sediments into the water column as recorded in october 2013 during the equinoctial spring tides asp et al 2018 rosa filho et al 2018 longitudinally turbidity is normally influenced by the position of the zone of maximum turbidity zmt which in the caeté estuary shifts toward point p8 during the first half of the year and then back toward p1 during the second half of the year asp et al 2012 araújo and asp 2013 this process is controlled by the oscillation in the fluvial discharge asp et al 2016 under normal natural conditions the waters of the amazon coast are well oxygenated due to their high hydrodynamic energy and the influence of the trade winds which provoke the exchange between the atmosphere and superficial waters as well as the high levels of photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton organisms pereira et al 2017 this plankton supports high levels of biological productivity in the waters of the estuaries which are rich in dissolved nutrients pereira et al 2017 asp et al 2018 as a consequence the chlorophyll a concentrations are normally relatively high as observed here and in other studies of amazonian estuaries costa et al 2011 pamplona et al 2013 atique et al 2016 5 2 anthropogenic activities population growth and the resulting increase in the production of sanitary sewage associated with the expansion of anthropogenic activities have impacted the quality of estuarine waters in many parts of the world neil 2004 mallin et al 2007 nezlin et al 2009 o mullan et al 2019 including the amazon coast menezes et al 2009 gomes et al 2014 monteiro et al 2016b in the town of bragança population growth together with the lack of basic public sanitation throughout the municipality result in the discharge of large quantities of untreated sewage into the local waters including those of the caeté estuary and the cereja river gorayeb et al 2009 guimarães et al 2009b the comparison of the data collected here with the findings of previous studies indicates a clear increase in the contamination by thermotolerant coliforms with 100 of the samples from points p1 p4 upper sector having concentrations of over in previous studies this level of contamination was infrequent in 2006 2007 for example data from the middle sector indicated concentrations of no more than 460 mpn 100 ml 1 monteiro et al 2011 whereas in the upper sector only 20 of the samples exceeded 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 pereira et al 2010 monteiro et al 2016a for example estimated that the population resident on the margins of the caeté estuary excluding industrial activities produced 12 000 m3 d 1 of sewage in 2006 and 2007 as the population has increased by more than 20 since this time as of 2020 the production of effluents has probably increased proportionately which would account for the decline in the quality of the waters of the caeté estuary in the most urbanized sector in addition to population growth other sources of contamination have also affected the quality of the waters of the caeté estuary over the past decade including the local fisheries bragança is one of the principal fishery nuclei in the state of pará and a large number of fishing ports are located along the margins of the caeté estuary although the greatest concentration is located in the town itself between points p1 and p4 in addition to the ports the industry demands the presence of ice factories fish processing plants markets and boatbuilders and dry docks and involves often intense shipping traffic all these activities contribute to the contamination of the estuary through the discarding of solid waste fuels and sewage into its waters silva et al 2006 monteiro et al 2016b the most urbanized sector of the municipality also concentrates a large number of businesses in addition to the municipal market previous studies have shown that this public market is responsible for a considerable part of the waste discharged into the caeté estuary including the sewage from its public toilet gorayeb 2008 guimarães et al 2009b monteiro et al 2016b the present study quantified the production of sewage by this public toilet and the maximum number of thermotolerant coliforms released into the caeté estuary this toilet is used primarily by individuals that come to bragança from the rural zone of the municipality and spend the day working or shopping in the market the p4 sampling point is located at the confluence of the cereja river costa 2012 demonstrated that 43 of the residences located on the margins of the cereja river lack septic tanks and discharge their domestic effluents directly into the river even though the other 57 of the residences do have septic tanks most of their liquid waste is still released untreated into the cereja river this is further reinforced by the large number of illegal settlements squats observed in the upper sector of the cereja river personal observation which increases the amount of sewage discharged into its waters as this river is an area of environmental protection and preservation municipal law number 12 651 of may 25th 2012 the occupation of the margins is prohibited throughout its whole length although the law is not enforced systematically based on the conselho nacional do meio ambiente 2000 regulations the waters of the most urbanized sector of the caeté estuary are inadequate for any type of use given that more than 20 of the samples analyzed had coliform concentrations of over 1 100 mpn per 100 ml the highest thermotolerant coliform concentrations were observed during the rainy season coinciding with the highest concentrations in the cereja river which acts as an important source of contamination for the caeté estuary during this season during this period the river floods and absorbs sewage directly from higher grounds together with other substances from the lixiviation of the soil of the surrounding area guimarães et al 2009a in rainy season more than 80 of the samples exceeded the limits established by the conama resolution indicating that the estuary of the caeté river becomes more contaminated by these microorganisms during the rainiest months as shown in previous studies monteiro et al 2016a during the rainiest months in addition the reduced salinity of the water in the estuary may have favored the survival of the fecal coliforms probably due to their intolerance of high salinity bordalo et al 2002 while naturally eutrophic pereira et al 2017 the discharge of sewage into the waters of the caeté river appears to have contributed to an increase in the chlorophyll a concentrations in the most urbanized sector through the proliferation of microalgae pereira et al 2010 and atique et al 2016 demonstrated that the stretch located between points p1 and p4 upper sector have slightly higher levels of dissolved nutrients in comparison with the other sectors of the estuary these authors associated the increase in dissolved nutrients with anthropogenic activities and the discharge of untreated sewage which contributed to the high density of phytoplankton species that are indicators of eutrophic environments dissolved oxygen is considered to be a good indicator of contamination and environmental conditions and can reveal alterations in the quality of the water ram et al 2014 in the present study low dissolved oxygen concentrations were recorded at most of the collecting points in many months with values lower than 5 mg l 1 being recorded in 64 of the samples overall these values tend to be low because the points at which the samples were collected were generally in relatively close proximity to sewage outfalls dissolved oxygen concentrations may decrease as a result of the consumption of oxygen by decomposing bacteria due to the high concentrations of organic matter present in the environment wallace et al 2014 previous studies of the caeté estuary have recorded higher dissolved oxygen concentrations at points further from the margin and more distant from sources of contamination monteiro et al 2016a overall then the resolution of the effects of population growth will depend on an enormous variety of factors although the most prudent way of controlling the contamination of the waters of the caeté estuary in the sector most affected would be to adopt the measures outlined in the master plan of the municipality table 7 unfortunately the few measures implemented by the local authorities up to now are unsatisfactory and the measures proposed in the most recent master plan presented in 2016 have postponed these initiatives for a further 10 years up to now 2020 however the master plan has not advanced and in fact the authorities have not even presented a proposal for a public sanitation system to the population of the municipality 6 conclusions population growth and the lack of a public sanitation system contribute to the increasing contamination of the waters of the caeté estuary principally in the most urbanized sectors in the other sectors however despite the lower population densities shipping and fishery activities result in inadequate water quality during some periods of the year despite the implementation of protected areas and the existence of a municipal master plan there have been no practical advances toward the installation of a public sanitation system in the most urbanized sector of the municipality the local water is inappropriate for any type of use but despite this the daily life of the population continues unchanged the findings of the present study show clearly that the contamination by thermotolerant coliforms has worsened over the past decade and may be impacting public health and the economic activities of the local population the situation observed in the caeté estuary can be extrapolated to other coastal municipalities in the amazon region that have relatively large urban populations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1017,the present study investigated the evolution of the contamination of the estuary of the caeté river by thermotolerant coliforms over the past decade the hypothesis tested was that the conditions of the caeté estuary have worsened over this period due to a combination of population growth and the lack of investment in public sanitation by the local authorities samples for hydrological and microbiological analysis were collected at eight sample points in 2013 2014 2018 and 2019 the upper sector of the estuary was represented by the samples from p1 p4 this sector is the most urbanized and the most affected by human activities with 100 of the samples collected presenting thermotolerant coliform concentrations of over 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 conditions were also considered to be inappropriate for human use in other areas at certain times of year despite being located within a protected area the implementation of a public sanitation system proposed in the master plan of the municipality of bragança almost two decades ago has yet to be initiated compared with the results of previous studies of the caeté estuary more than a decade ago the contamination of the water has increased considerably based on the criteria of the current brazilian legislation all types of human use of the water are compromised although socioeconomic activities continue as normal this situation may eventually impact the health of the local population and affect economic activities the conditions found in the caeté estuary appear to be typical of other coastal amazonian municipalities keywords dpswr sewage socioeconomic activities amazon estuary 1 introduction estuaries are strategically important for the development of a range of socioeconomic activities such as tourism fisheries agriculture and shipping given this estuaries are coming under increasingly intense anthropogenic pressure in most parts of the world elliott and quintino 2007 dias et al 2013 the most common pressures on estuaries are derived from the unplanned growth of urban settlements agardy et al 2005 wilson et al 2005 lotze et al 2006 one of the principal anthropogenic impacts on estuarine waters is the discharge of domestic effluents which results in the proliferation of microorganisms such as pathogenic bacteria e g escherichia coli these effluents may not only compromise the conditions of the ecosystem but also the health of the local human populations their socioeconomic activities the esthetics of the local landscape and the ecological preservation of coastal areas karlson et al 2002 howarth and marino 2006 burford et al 2012 monteiro et al 2016a costa el al 2018 the assessment of the quality of the estuarine environment through the monitoring of microbiological indicators is a common practise throughout the world and is applied to many estuaries aleksandrov 2010 de et al 2011 cheng et al 2012 hassard et al 2017 cabral et al 2018 jeamsripong and atwill 2019 chinnadurai et al 2020 the brazilian amazon coast bac encompasses one of the world s largest continuous tracts of preserved mangrove forest kjerfve and lacerda 1993 which covers dozens of estuaries including that of the amazon river itself the bac includes a number of relatively isolated and sparsely inhabited municipalities often occupied by traditional populations as well as more densely populated areas and urban zones pereira et al 2009 given the extensive local hydrographic network most towns on the amazon coast have been built on the margins of estuaries as in the case of bragança located in northeastern pará founded in 1613 bragança is a historical town that grew up on the margins of the estuary of the caeté river although the lack of adequate public policies and investment in basic infrastructure such as public sanitation has caused serious impacts on the quality of the estuary with deleterious consequences for the local population gorayeb et al 2009 pereira et al 2010 the lack of an adequate public sanitation system is not restricted to the municipality of bragança however affects virtually all of the municipalities of the amazon coast brondizio et al 2016 mansur et al 2016 sousa felix et al 2017 between 2005 and 2010 a series of studies gorayeb et al 2009 guimarães et al 2009a pereira et al 2010 reported the problems caused by the lack of a public sanitation system in the municipality of bragança in particular the contamination of the waters of the estuary of the caeté river principally in the upper sector of the estuary where the majority of the population of the town of bragança approximately 50 000 inhabitants is concentrated the studies found that the town market local fisheries and businesses and domestic residences are the principal sources de contamination of the caeté estuary gorayeb et al 2009 guimarães et al 2009a monteiro et al 2011 2016a but quantitative data is not available in literature in the 21st century the population of the municipality of bragança has grown at a rate of 2 1 per annum ibge 2020 has this population growth together with the lack of adequate management plans or investments in services and infrastructure including public sanitation compromised the quality of the water of the caeté estuary to answer this question the present study covers two different periods in 2013 2014 and 2018 2019 evaluating the local environmental conditions based on the analysis of hydrological variables and anthropogenic impacts through the measurement of thermotolerant coliform concentrations this pathogenic bacterium was used in the present study because it is universal in sewage water and has been widely used around the world as an indicator of human impacts and sanitary conditions as discussed above the hydrological and microbiological conditions of the estuary were assessed based on the criteria described in detail in the methods section these parameters were compared with those recorded between 2005 and 2010 to determine whether local conditions have stabilized or worsened in this interim during this decade bacterial counts declined only during the months when rainfall peaked guimarães et al 2009a monteiro et al 2011 given this the operational hypothesis is that the quality of the conditions in the caeté estuary have worsened significantly over the past decade independently of the season this analysis was based on the diagnostic tool known as the dpswr that is driver pressure state welfare response cooper 2013 which was applied to the evaluation of social questions in the context of the study area 2 study area the hydrographic basin of the caeté river is located in northeastern pará within a region that has the highest population density in this brazilian state the river is 149 km long between its source in the municipality of bonito and its mouth in caeté urumajó bay with a total drainage area of 2 195 km2 gorayeb et al 2011 the caeté basin drains seven municipalities and passes through the towns of bragança and santa luzia do pará and 19 traditional communities gorayeb 2008 with a total population of approximately 260 000 inhabitants ibge 2020 bragança is the region s principal urban center linked directly to the caeté river the municipality of bragança 01 06 13 s 46 77 56 w is located in the northeastern pará mesoregion approximately 210 km due east of the state capital belém this town is an important cultural and economic center for the region and has 127 686 inhabitants within an area of 124 734 km2 ibge 2020 located within the equatorial zone the climate of the study region is hot and humid with annual precipitation of 2400 2700 mm and a mean annual temperature of 27 c inmet 2019 some 75 85 of the annual precipitation is normally recorded during the first six months of the year while september october and november are typically the driest months this seasonal pattern is determined primarily by the annual shift of the intertropical convergence zone itcz over northern brazil marengo et al 2013 with a total area of 220 km2 the estuary of the caeté river fig 1 is part of the caeté taperaçú marine extractivist reserve and is classified as a permanently open estuary with a depth of approximately 10 m at its mouth and highly turbid waters in some sectors barletta bergan et al 2002 this estuary is highly dynamic with tidal heights of up to 2 4 m during the neap tides and 4 6 m on the spring tide with current velocities that may exceed 1 5 m s 1 monteiro et al 2011 cavalcante et al 2010 the population density of the bragança coastal plain is low and the margins of the estuary are covered with mangrove forest which is dominated by three tree species rhizophora mangle l avicennia germinans l and laguncularia racemosa l c f gaertn cohen et al 1999 menezes et al 2008 the principal economic activities in the rural sector on the margins of the estuary are fisheries and subsistence farming krause and glaser 2003 glaser and diele 2004 3 methods data on the precipitation and fluvial discharge of caeté river were obtained from public institutions while the hydrological data were obtained during fieldwork in the middle and upper estuary of the caeté river a total of eight sampling points were selected randomly in the study area samples were collected in both the dry and the rainy seasons on both the flood and ebb tides in 2013 2014 and 2018 2019 3 1 precipitation and fluvial discharge monthly precipitation data were provided by the inmet meteorological station at tracuateua located 36 m above the ground approximately 17 km west of the town of bragança for the period between 2000 and 2019 the records of the fluvial discharge of the caeté river were provided by the national waters agency ana gauge station at nova mocajuba approximately 23 km upstream from the upper sector of the estuary 3 2 field methods samples of the surface water were collected in zones with different levels of urbanization using a motorboat samples were collected in october 2013 february may and august 2014 september and december 2018 and march and june 2019 a total of 16 samples representing the ebb and flood tides were collected at eight randomly selected points in zones affected by the discharge of waste water or at localities where economic activities may interfere in the quality of the waters of the estuary table 1 a check list was applied to identify the principal sources of contamination of the caeté estuary the number of individuals using the public toilet in the bragança public market was counted from 8am to 12am during periods of both low 22 25th august 2016 and high demand 2 6th september 2016 to estimate the maximum quantity of thermotolerant coliforms discharged per day into the caeté estuary this estimate was based on the protocol of ellis 2004 a ctd equipped with turbidity and dissolved oxygen sensors was used to record the salinity temperature dissolved oxygen and turbidity of the water the measurements were taken at 5 minute intervals at each sampling point samples of the surface water were collected simultaneously using a niskin bottle a total of 128 samples were collected for the ph and chlorophyll a analyses and a further 128 samples were obtained for the microbiological analyses once collected the water samples obtained using niskin bottle were stored in 250 ml polyethylene containers or in glass flasks in the samples destined for the analysis of fecal coliforms the samples were labeled and stored at 4 c prior to processing in the laboratory following the apha 2004 protocol 3 3 laboratory procedures in the laboratory the ph values were determined immediately using a ph meter the chlorophyll a concentrations were extracted from the acetate filters with 90 acetone v v and determined using the spectrophotometric approach described by parsons and strickland 1963 and unesco 1966 the thermotolerant coliform concentrations were measured using the multiple tubes method following the procedures recommended by apha 2004 this method is based on the inoculation of the sample in sodium lauryl sulphate presumptive test and brilliant green broths confirmatory test followed by incubation for 48 hours at 35 2 c positive samples were inoculated in escherichia coli ec selective broth for 48 hours at 44 5 c in both procedures the presence of bacteria is detected by the clouding of the water and the formation of gas in the durham tubes the water quality was classified based on the criteria established by bricker et al 2003 for chlorophyll a hypereutrophic 60 mg m 3 high 20 60 mg m 3 medium 5 20 mg m 3 low 5 mg m 3 and dissolved oxygen anoxia 0 mg l 1 hypoxia 0 2 mg l 1 biological stress 2 5 mg l 1 ideal 5 mg l 1 and using the conselho nacional do meio ambiente 2000 criteria for turbidity ideal not observed poor observed and ph ideal 6 5 8 5 undesirable 6 5 the daily per capita production of effluents were estimated for each urban nucleus at least 150 l or rural settlement at least 120 l with the quantity of thermotolerant coliforms beings estimated at 100 400 billion minimum maximum based on the approach proposed by von sperling 2007 the population of each urban nucleus was obtained from www brasilsabido com br and that of each rural settlement from guimarães 2011 based on statistics it is assumed a growth rate up to 2 1 per annum in the last decade according with ibge 2020 3 4 application of the dpswr the socioeconomic analyses of the present study were based on the dpswr drive pressure state welfare response framework developed by cooper 2013 which was selected for this study because it permits the identification of the social component and provide insights into the potential role that should be the responsibility of the local authorities the social and environmental problems were identified using the whole of the dataset compiled during the study in order to best comprehend the magnitude of the pressures affecting the local environment the wellbeing of the local populations and the potential response or otherwise of the local authorities 3 5 statistical analyses the statistical analyses were preceded by the lilliefors test conover 1971 to determine the normality and the cochran test for the homoscedasticity underwood 1997 of the distribution of the abiotic and biological data the data were then log x 1 transformed as necessary to normalize and homogenize the study variables to satisfy the assumptions for the subsequent analyses if normality and homoscedasticity were not achieved by this transformation the nonparametric mann whitney u and or kruskal wallis h test were applied when the kruskal wallis indicated significant variation in the data a posteriori comparison was run using the student newman keuls test zar 2010 nonparametric tests were applied when the assumptions of parametric tests could not be satisfied even by transforming the data the statistical analyses described above were processed in statistica 8 0 statsoft 2009 considering different levels of significance p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 the variation in the environmental data temperature salinity ph turbidity and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen chlorophyll a and thermotolerant coliforms were verified using a principal components analysis pca to determine the spatial seasonal and inter annual patterns in the parameters this analysis was run in canoco ter braak 1986 ter braak and smilauer 1998 and the groups were defined in the pca plots using 95 confidence interval the coefficients of each pca are presented in supplementary material s1 this indirect multivariate ordering test was used to describe the linear spatial and temporal similarities and differences in the data based on the environmental parameters the data were transformed by the amplitude of their variation ranging milligan and cooper 1988 legendre and legendre 2012 this standardization avoids possible distortions related to the distinct orders of magnitude of the numerical values and the variation in the variances of the different parameters 4 results 4 1 precipitation and fluvial discharge the mean precipitation in the study area between 2013 and 2019 was 2 372 mm fig 2 a the driest year of the study was 2013 1 612 mm while the rainiest was 2019 with 3 512 mm while 2014 and 2018 had annual totals close to the historical mean the rains were more intense 100 mm per month between february and july in 2013 and 2014 whereas in 2019 the rainy season lasted from january to august with 97 54 of the total annual precipitation being recorded during these eight months february march and april 2019 were the rainiest month around 600 mm per month of the whole study period whereas september october and november were the driest 15 mm per month the fluvial discharge fig 2b followed a similar pattern with the lowest values being recorded in 2013 annual mean 28 3 m3 s 1 and the highest in 2019 annual mean 54 3 m3 s 1 in 2013 and 2014 the highest monthly were recorded in may 87 6 m3 s 1 and 97 9 m3 s 1 respectively whereas in 2018 and 2019 as the onset of the rains was earlier discharge peaked in april reaching 87 7 m3 s 1 and 111 4 m3 s 1 respectively 4 2 hydrological variables significant spatial variation table 2 was observed only in temperature h 15 2 p 0 05 and salinity h 40 1 p 0 001 the temperature salinity and ph values all increased toward the middle sector of the estuary with temperature ranging from 26 7 1 1 c at p1 to 27 6 0 8 c at p8 salinity from 0 2 0 4 psu p1 to 8 3 8 7 psu p8 and ph from 6 7 0 3 p2 to 7 0 0 6 p8 by contrast chlorophyll a decreased between p2 19 4 17 3 mg m 3 and p8 5 6 2 6 mg m 3 the dissolved oxygen concentrations were slightly higher at p1 5 1 0 8 mg l 1 and p8 4 8 1 0 mg l 1 and lower at p6 4 5 1 0 mg l 1 while turbidity was highest at p5 318 1 348 5 ntu and p6 283 9 265 7 ntu and lowest at p7 149 2 133 0 ntu and p8 138 8 144 5 ntu the spatial distribution of the values is shown in fig 3 and the results of the pca in fig 4 in the principal components analysis pca axis 1 39 2 concentrated the majority of the more external sampling points p5 p6 p7 and p8 indicating a positive correlation between these sectors and salinity temperature and ph thus separating the sectors that were most distant from the center of bragança fig 4 the negative portion of this axis reflected the importance of the thermotolerant coliforms see results in section 4 3 with a predominance of the more internal sampling points p1 p2 p3 and p4 which are closest to the town axis 1 describes a gradient of increasing salinity and temperature that varies spatially by contrast axis 2 concentrated 24 of the variance in the data emphasizing in the positive portion of the axis iv and i the concentrations of chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen and in the negative portion iii and ii the samples with higher concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms and turbidity see results in section 4 3 although it was possible to relate the samples directly to the hydrological variables there was no significant spatial interaction overlap of the ellipses no significant variation was recorded between the flood and ebb tides although significant differences were observed among months and between seasons table 2 the waters were warmer u 127 0 p 0 001 more saline u 995 0 p 0 001 and more alkaline u 832 5 p 0 001

projecting the ph temperature salinity and turbidity concentrated in the samples from the dry season of 2013 and an association between salinity and turbidity it is also possible to observe a greater concentration of samples from the dry seasons of 2014 and 2018 which were characterized by higher values of salinity temperature and ph the second axis in turn explained 24 of the variability in the data with the positive portion iv and i projecting dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a which were most associated with the samples from the rainy season of 2019 while its negative portion iii highlighted the importance of the thermotolerant coliforms see results in section 4 3 which were associated with the samples from the rainy season of 2014 salinity and thermotolerant coliforms were significant in both axes while do turbidity and chlorophyll a were significant only on the second axis thus indicating a significant temporal interaction which can be observed in the dry season of 2013 and the rainy season of 2019 4 3 microbiological variables over three quarters 77 of the samples present thermotolerant coliform concentrations of 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 or higher which is the maximum threshold recommended for most types of water usage fig 7 a and table 6 significant spatial patterns were recorded h 42 3 p 0 001 table 2 with the most contaminated points being located in the vicinity of the town of bragança p1 p4 where 82 of the samples had coliform concentrations of over 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 fig 7b no significant variation was found among months or tides however table 2 although significant differences were observed between seasons u 1561 5 p 0 05 with 77 of the samples having coliform concentrations of over 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 in the rainy season and 55 in the dry season fig 7d these concentrations also varied inter annually among sampling stations h 10 6 p 0 05 with the rainy season of 2019 being the most contaminated with 95 of the samples having concentrations of over 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 4 4 application of the dpswr model bragança has no sewage collection or treatment system and part of its sewage is discharged in natura into the estuaries of the caeté and cereja rivers the cereja river discharges in the upper sector of the caeté estuary after crossing the whole of the town of bragança passing through seven neighborhoods taíra vila sinhá cereja centro padre luiz i and ii and aldeia in addition to the effluents of the cereja river the sewage of the residential neighborhoods of riozinho centro and aldeia and the commercial district and port area are discharged directly into the caeté estuary primarily in its upper sector which coincides with the most densely urbanized area of the municipality table 3 shows the number of inhabitants recorded in the most recent census 2010 for the neighborhoods of bragança and 2005 for the rural communities and the estimates for 2014 and 2019 as well as the production of effluents and the minimum and maximum numbers of thermotolerant coliforms recorded for the respective periods the estimates for 2019 may exceed these values by at least 20 given the mean population growth rate of 2 1 per annum recorded in the municipality of bragança in recent decades by ibge 2020 one other source of contamination by thermotolerant coliforms is the bragança public market the public toilet in this market is used by hundreds of stall workers and customers that are mostly resident in bragança and the surrounding area the effluents produced by this toilet are discharged untreated into the estuary and counts conducted on different days each month indicated that dozens of individuals frequent this facility from which it was estimated that up to 2 65 1011 mpn 100 ml 1 of thermotolerant coliforms are discharged into the caeté estuary every day in addition to this public toilet other sources of contamination can be found in the bragança public market table 4 which impact even further the quality of the water of the upper caeté estuary ice factories and fish processing plants as well as jetties and businesses are found along the middle sector of the caeté estuary table 1 the excess of organic matter discharged into the waters of the upper sector of the caeté estuary table 4 may have favored the proliferation of algae due to the high concentrations of chlorophyll a recorded in the sector closest to the town of bragança the excess of organic matter may also have contributed to the proliferation of decomposing bacteria that consume the dissolved oxygen given that in various months principally at the points in the vicinity of bragança the concentrations of dissolved oxygen were lower than 5 mg l 1 the concentrations recorded in the study and the limits established under current brazilian legislation are shown in table 5 as shown in sections 4 2 and 4 3 the strong rains in the first half of the year have a direct effect on the conditions in the estuary with the water becoming more acidic with a higher density of phytoplankton and greater contamination by thermotolerant coliforms principally in the more urbanized sector fig 7b the rains thus appear to be the principal factor determining the ph values of less than 6 5 recorded during some periods of the year high turbidity is also a natural characteristic of the water and will be discussed in section 5 1 the concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms 77 of the samples followed by the concentrations of dissolved oxygen 64 of the samples and chlorophyll a 13 of the samples indicate that the waters of the caeté estuary are being contaminated by sewage tables 5 and 6 principally in its upper sector which is the most urbanized in fact the findings of the present study are consistent with high levels of contamination which indicate the need for the prohibition of socioeconomic activities in the middle sector of the estuary during a number of months per year table 1 and in the upper sector the existing legislation should be enforced more systematically given the prohibition of commercial activities on the margins of the estuary these activities should be relocated to different areas of the town and the infrastructure necessary for the treatment of liquid and solid waste should be constructed this contamination occurs within part of the caeté taperaçu marine extractive reserve or adjacent to this area where human activities should be regulated by the management plan of the reserve icmbio 2012 the margins of the cereja river which is an area of environmental protection and preservation municipal law number 12 651 of may 25th 2012 have been occupied illegally despite being located within a protected zone the study area lacks investment by the local authorities in public sanitation which contradicts the objectives established by the participative master plan of the municipal government itself municipal law number 3 875 of october 10th 2006 through this legislation the municipality focused on the problem of the town s sanitary sewage and assumed a commitment to resolve the situation within the following 10 years table 7 this deadline passed in 2016 however and the problem remains unresolved the ideal solution for the recuperation of the quality of the water of the caeté estuary in the study sector would be the construction of a sewage collection and treatment plant together with the prohibition of the discharge of effluents into either the caeté estuary or the cereja river the results of the dpswr management model are summarized in fig 8 an additional component natural conditions was included in this model 5 discussion to better understand the anthropogenic conditions of the study area it is necessary to first discuss the natural characteristics of the area which is similar to other amazonian estuarine environments the first section below covers the natural functioning of the hydrological variables monitored here while the subsequent section will consider how the caeté estuary is being affected by the high levels of sanitary sewage being produced in the municipality of bragança 5 1 natural conditions the estuarine waters of the amazon coast are relatively warm and stable varying by only 2 3 c between the dry and rainy seasons pamplona et al 2013 pereira et al 2017 as shown in the present study by contrast salinity oscillates considerably in response to the variation in local rainfall levels and fluvial discharge asp et al 2018 during the first half of the year when the itcz is over the southern hemisphere the rains are intense normally over 2 000 mm and salinity decreases reaching zero in the area between sampling points p1 and p4 principally during the rainiest quarter of the year when fluvial discharge peaks the opposite pattern 10 psu is observed during the driest quarter of the year in addition to this temporal variation there is a longitudinal gradient of salinity with lower values being recorded in the upper sector superior greater fluvial influence and higher values in the middle sector greater marine influence as observed in the study area between points p1 and p8 the ph of the coastal amazonian waters also varies primarily in relation to the input of fresh water which is determined by local rainfall patterns and the fluvial discharge santos et al 2008 the ph of these coastal waters ranges from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline typically oscillating between 6 and 8 depending on the time of year during the dry season when the estuarine waters are more saline the ph tends to vary from neutral to slightly alkaline 7 8 whereas during the rainy season it is slightly acidic to neutral 6 7 as shown by leite et al 2009 magalhães et al 2011 and pamplona et al 2013 and the present study in the present study the turbidity of the water does not appear to have been affected only by the rains in fact a number of previous studies have shown that the ample local mangroves the broad drainage network and the high hydrodynamic energy of the estuary are factors that favour the suspension of large quantities of particles in the coastal waters of the amazon littoral pereira et al 2013 asp et al 2018 during the first half of the year the waters are relatively turbid due to the rains and the input of suspended particles from the mangrove forest and the drainage basins whereas in the second half of the year the turbidity of the water is maintained by the high levels off hydrodynamic energy which provokes the resuspension of the bottom sediments into the water column as recorded in october 2013 during the equinoctial spring tides asp et al 2018 rosa filho et al 2018 longitudinally turbidity is normally influenced by the position of the zone of maximum turbidity zmt which in the caeté estuary shifts toward point p8 during the first half of the year and then back toward p1 during the second half of the year asp et al 2012 araújo and asp 2013 this process is controlled by the oscillation in the fluvial discharge asp et al 2016 under normal natural conditions the waters of the amazon coast are well oxygenated due to their high hydrodynamic energy and the influence of the trade winds which provoke the exchange between the atmosphere and superficial waters as well as the high levels of photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton organisms pereira et al 2017 this plankton supports high levels of biological productivity in the waters of the estuaries which are rich in dissolved nutrients pereira et al 2017 asp et al 2018 as a consequence the chlorophyll a concentrations are normally relatively high as observed here and in other studies of amazonian estuaries costa et al 2011 pamplona et al 2013 atique et al 2016 5 2 anthropogenic activities population growth and the resulting increase in the production of sanitary sewage associated with the expansion of anthropogenic activities have impacted the quality of estuarine waters in many parts of the world neil 2004 mallin et al 2007 nezlin et al 2009 o mullan et al 2019 including the amazon coast menezes et al 2009 gomes et al 2014 monteiro et al 2016b in the town of bragança population growth together with the lack of basic public sanitation throughout the municipality result in the discharge of large quantities of untreated sewage into the local waters including those of the caeté estuary and the cereja river gorayeb et al 2009 guimarães et al 2009b the comparison of the data collected here with the findings of previous studies indicates a clear increase in the contamination by thermotolerant coliforms with 100 of the samples from points p1 p4 upper sector having concentrations of over in previous studies this level of contamination was infrequent in 2006 2007 for example data from the middle sector indicated concentrations of no more than 460 mpn 100 ml 1 monteiro et al 2011 whereas in the upper sector only 20 of the samples exceeded 1 100 mpn 100 ml 1 pereira et al 2010 monteiro et al 2016a for example estimated that the population resident on the margins of the caeté estuary excluding industrial activities produced 12 000 m3 d 1 of sewage in 2006 and 2007 as the population has increased by more than 20 since this time as of 2020 the production of effluents has probably increased proportionately which would account for the decline in the quality of the waters of the caeté estuary in the most urbanized sector in addition to population growth other sources of contamination have also affected the quality of the waters of the caeté estuary over the past decade including the local fisheries bragança is one of the principal fishery nuclei in the state of pará and a large number of fishing ports are located along the margins of the caeté estuary although the greatest concentration is located in the town itself between points p1 and p4 in addition to the ports the industry demands the presence of ice factories fish processing plants markets and boatbuilders and dry docks and involves often intense shipping traffic all these activities contribute to the contamination of the estuary through the discarding of solid waste fuels and sewage into its waters silva et al 2006 monteiro et al 2016b the most urbanized sector of the municipality also concentrates a large number of businesses in addition to the municipal market previous studies have shown that this public market is responsible for a considerable part of the waste discharged into the caeté estuary including the sewage from its public toilet gorayeb 2008 guimarães et al 2009b monteiro et al 2016b the present study quantified the production of sewage by this public toilet and the maximum number of thermotolerant coliforms released into the caeté estuary this toilet is used primarily by individuals that come to bragança from the rural zone of the municipality and spend the day working or shopping in the market the p4 sampling point is located at the confluence of the cereja river costa 2012 demonstrated that 43 of the residences located on the margins of the cereja river lack septic tanks and discharge their domestic effluents directly into the river even though the other 57 of the residences do have septic tanks most of their liquid waste is still released untreated into the cereja river this is further reinforced by the large number of illegal settlements squats observed in the upper sector of the cereja river personal observation which increases the amount of sewage discharged into its waters as this river is an area of environmental protection and preservation municipal law number 12 651 of may 25th 2012 the occupation of the margins is prohibited throughout its whole length although the law is not enforced systematically based on the conselho nacional do meio ambiente 2000 regulations the waters of the most urbanized sector of the caeté estuary are inadequate for any type of use given that more than 20 of the samples analyzed had coliform concentrations of over 1 100 mpn per 100 ml the highest thermotolerant coliform concentrations were observed during the rainy season coinciding with the highest concentrations in the cereja river which acts as an important source of contamination for the caeté estuary during this season during this period the river floods and absorbs sewage directly from higher grounds together with other substances from the lixiviation of the soil of the surrounding area guimarães et al 2009a in rainy season more than 80 of the samples exceeded the limits established by the conama resolution indicating that the estuary of the caeté river becomes more contaminated by these microorganisms during the rainiest months as shown in previous studies monteiro et al 2016a during the rainiest months in addition the reduced salinity of the water in the estuary may have favored the survival of the fecal coliforms probably due to their intolerance of high salinity bordalo et al 2002 while naturally eutrophic pereira et al 2017 the discharge of sewage into the waters of the caeté river appears to have contributed to an increase in the chlorophyll a concentrations in the most urbanized sector through the proliferation of microalgae pereira et al 2010 and atique et al 2016 demonstrated that the stretch located between points p1 and p4 upper sector have slightly higher levels of dissolved nutrients in comparison with the other sectors of the estuary these authors associated the increase in dissolved nutrients with anthropogenic activities and the discharge of untreated sewage which contributed to the high density of phytoplankton species that are indicators of eutrophic environments dissolved oxygen is considered to be a good indicator of contamination and environmental conditions and can reveal alterations in the quality of the water ram et al 2014 in the present study low dissolved oxygen concentrations were recorded at most of the collecting points in many months with values lower than 5 mg l 1 being recorded in 64 of the samples overall these values tend to be low because the points at which the samples were collected were generally in relatively close proximity to sewage outfalls dissolved oxygen concentrations may decrease as a result of the consumption of oxygen by decomposing bacteria due to the high concentrations of organic matter present in the environment wallace et al 2014 previous studies of the caeté estuary have recorded higher dissolved oxygen concentrations at points further from the margin and more distant from sources of contamination monteiro et al 2016a overall then the resolution of the effects of population growth will depend on an enormous variety of factors although the most prudent way of controlling the contamination of the waters of the caeté estuary in the sector most affected would be to adopt the measures outlined in the master plan of the municipality table 7 unfortunately the few measures implemented by the local authorities up to now are unsatisfactory and the measures proposed in the most recent master plan presented in 2016 have postponed these initiatives for a further 10 years up to now 2020 however the master plan has not advanced and in fact the authorities have not even presented a proposal for a public sanitation system to the population of the municipality 6 conclusions population growth and the lack of a public sanitation system contribute to the increasing contamination of the waters of the caeté estuary principally in the most urbanized sectors in the other sectors however despite the lower population densities shipping and fishery activities result in inadequate water quality during some periods of the year despite the implementation of protected areas and the existence of a municipal master plan there have been no practical advances toward the installation of a public sanitation system in the most urbanized sector of the municipality the local water is inappropriate for any type of use but despite this the daily life of the population continues unchanged the findings of the present study show clearly that the contamination by thermotolerant coliforms has worsened over the past decade and may be impacting public health and the economic activities of the local population the situation observed in the caeté estuary can be extrapolated to

1018,lake nokoué in benin supports the livelihoods of more than 500 000 people through fish production and sand mining however its health is jeopardised by eutrophication and excessive growth of the invasive water hyacinth which dies off and sink to sediment during dry seasons when the lake s salinity increases due to tidal intrusion water hyacinth constitutes then a potential source of internal nutrient loading through the decomposition of detritus and therefore can exacerbate eutrophication problems an important management question is whether the removal of water hyacinth before it dies would significantly reduce eutrophication problems through the removal of nutrients to compare the amount of nutrients removed by water hyacinth biomass to the amount of nutrients transported into the lake mass balance approach has been taken nutrient concentrations water hyacinth cover and hydrological inflows were measured over a 12 month period from november 2016 to october 2017 water hyacinth biomass estimation was based on a calibrated ndvi and field measurement relationship in total the hyacinth covered up to 18 km2 10 of the lake corresponding to 80 000 tonnes of dry weight which sink to the bottom each year when salinity rise the potential internal nutrient loaded from hyacinth to the system was estimated to 1021 tonnes of nitrogen 8 of external input and 231 tonnes of phosphorus 40 of external input considering that the tidal nutrient output compensates almost all the external nutrient inputs about 70 part of the nutrient available for eutrophication must come from internal sources likely through the decomposition of sediment detritus keywords lake nokoué nutrient inputs nutrient budget coastal lake water hyacinth management eutrophication management 1 introduction shallow coastal lakes throughout the world are often vulnerable to eutrophication problems this vulnerability results from their natural characteristics including that many of these lakes are in intertidal zones experience a high degree of wind mixing and sediment resuspension and are exposed to natural variability in nutrient concentrations due to seasonal inflows from sea or tributaries de jonge et al 2002 grenz et al 2019 in addition to natural high rates of productivity these systems are also exposed to strong anthropogenic pressure which includes nutrient loading from modified catchments urban inputs and industrial activities wang et al 2019 smith et al 2016 grenz et al 2019 the most severe symptoms of eutrophication encountered in lake systems are the excessive algal or cyanobacterial blooms and or the excessive aquatic weed growth while symptoms are similar across systems a study of different coastal lakes distributed around the world showed that the path to eutrophication and methods of controlling it are different depending on local conditions de jonge et al 2002 where the physical conditions climate tributaries inputs nutrient inputs open close to the sea as well as the transformation and retention of nutrients by the system constitutes the key parameters determining the specific responses of each system de jonge et al 2002 mitchell et al 2015 wang et al 2019 a recurrent symptom of eutrophication encountered in tropical and subtropical lakes is the colonisation of the invasive water hyacinth which is stimulated by excess nutrient inputs patel 2012 native to south america water hyacinth has infested aquatic system of more than 50 countries outside south america including many in africa téllez et al 2008 outcompeting all endogenous species growing in the vicinity in addition to causing reduction in native biodiversity water hyacinth invasion has also caused reduction of dissolved oxygen and decrease in fish production and thus created problems for local fishermen with respect to difficulties with navigation and decreased catch yield patel 2012 despite its prevalence water hyacinth is very rare in many estuaries because it generally does not tolerate salinity higher than 6 ppt de casabianca and laugier 1995 villamagna and murphy 2010 this situation has preserved many coastal lakes from the invasion of water hyacinth however in certain coastal lakes the tidal influence on the system is seasonally inhibited by heavy freshwater inputs from tributaries promoting the seasonal appearance of species not tolerant of high salinity this is the case of certain lakes in west africa coastline such as lake nokoué benin ebrié lagoon ivory coast where water hyacinth invades the surface of the system at each high water period and die with the sudden increase of salinity at each low water period negusse and bowen 2010 villanueva et al 2006 several management practices for the control of water hyacinth have been adopted in africa for almost three decades with biological control generally giving better results than manual removal and mechanical control hill and coetzee 2008 theuri 2013 thamaga and dube 2018 however biological control implies that the weed dies and sinks to the bottom of the lake representing therefore a potential source of internal nutrient load reddy and debusk 1991 patel 2012 the same applies to systems with a periodic death of water hyacinth due to saline water intrusion as observed in lake nokoué mama et al 2011 a review presented by hill and coetzee 2008 showed that integrated management approach which combines utilisation of available methods for water hyacinth control and nutrient control is required to achieve the acceptable control of the weed with nutrient control meaning control of both external and internal nutrient loading therefore a nutrient budget seemed to be the starting point of proper management of water hyacinth in eutrophic systems considering this integrated approach for the eutrophic lake nokoué mama et al 2011 which experience seasonal death water hyacinth during the low water period when salinity increases an important management question is whether the removal of water hyacinth would significantly reduce eutrophication problems through the removal of nutrients in the system what are nutrient inputs from tributaries compared to nutrient stored in water hyacinth biomass previous studies for nutrient control in lake nokoué have estimated nutrient load from its tributaries mama et al 2011 negusse and bowen 2010 but this information is not very useful for eutrophication management if it is not compared with other components in the nutrient budget several efforts based on field measurements have been made in the monitoring and quantification of water hyacinth however these methods require significant labour and could be time intensive and expensive depending on the size of the system since the year 2000 s remote sensing technology is been developed for the monitoring and management of aquatic systems baban 1999 kutser et al 2020 thamaga and dube 2018 recently time series of open source satellite images provide supporting information that could help decision making for the management of water resource system including management of eutrophication and assessment of control measures this approach offers new possibilities for a rapid estimation of water hyacinth biomass in a large system such as lake nokoué this study aims to understand whether water hyacinth should be removed from lake nokoué as an effort to reduce available nutrients in the system in a possible double positive scenario for both weed control and eutrophication mitigation 1 1 description of lake nokoué environment lake nokoué fig 1 is a very productive coastal shallow 1 5 m deep eutrophic lake located in the south of benin with cotonou laying between its southern shore and the atlantic ocean it covers around 150 km2 at low water and measures 20 km long east west 11 km wide north south le barbé et al 1993 mama et al 2011 and drains a catchment of approximately 46 920 km2 eutrophication in lake nokoué is characterised by the seasonal proliferation of water hyacinth which can cover up to 10 of the surface at its peak negusse and bowen 2010 one peculiarity of lake nokoué is the presence of human habitations built on stilts on the surface of the water in the northwestern part of the lake known as ganvié and vekky the lack of adequate sanitation infrastructure made these villages a potentially important source of nutrient input through the direct rejection of their wastes part of untreated sewage and stormwater from cotonou and calavi are also rejected into the lake 1 2 hydrological regime of lake nokoué the hydrological regime of lake nokoué is characterised by three major hydrologic periods i a high water period from september to november due to rains in north of benin where the ouémé river originates texier et al 1979 gnohossou 2006 ii a low water period from december to may in which tidal inputs enter in the lake through the cotonou channel le barbé et al 1993 and iii a medium water level phase from june to august caused by the local rainfall over the ouémé delta 30 km around lake nokoué in fact this area is highly urbanised and waterproofed with rainwater collectors flowing mainly into the lake instead of its tributaries ouémé and sô rivers thus the local rainfall has a high influence on the water level of lake and a little influence on its tributaries le barbé et al 1993 gnohossou 2006 from high water period to low water period the water level of lake nokoué gradually drops by about 60 cm as a result of the decline in water flows from ouémé and sô rivers which dropped by 80 and 50 respectively each year from october to mid december fig 2 a comparison of the water discharge of ouémé river at bonou to the water level of lake nokoué at cotonou chanel based on data measured from 2001 to 2010 showed a very similar pattern in the variation of both for high water discharge djihouessi 2018 for low water discharge the influence of the tide takes precedence over the influence of the river on the lake water level there is a strong and significant correlation between the water lost by the ouémé river between bonou and hetin sota and the water discharge of the so river at so ava the sô river recovers 15 of the losses that occur along the ouémé river djihouessi 2018 further analysis based on the hydrological period of the rivers indicated that the contribution of the ouémé river to the so river was stronger in high water period 23 than in low water period 12 the ouémé river is more responsive to the dry season because it exclusively depends on runoff inputs while the sô river is fed in the dry season by the upstream lake hlan fig 1 and probably some groundwater by late january the tide from atlantic ocean increasingly influences lake nokoué water level that fluctuate by about 10 to 15 cm each 14 days until july after this period the lake s water level increase progressively due to the increasing discharge in the ouémé and so rivers fig 2 on an average year ouémé and sô rivers water discharges into lake nokoué are about 215 m3 s and 120 m3 s respectively djihouessi and aina 2018 1 3 land use in ouémé catchment the main food crops grown in the catchment are maize yam and cassava in the delta rice is cultivated near the entrance of the ouémé river into the lake cowpea bean a local variety of legume is grown in the upper delta during the water recession period agronomic research has clearly established the gradual depletion in fertile land which in the long term will probably increase the use of fertilizers in the catchment and the delta surveys conducted with sonapra national society for the promotion of agriculture on the use of chemical fertilizers revealed a consumption estimated at more than 100 000 tons for 1994 2000 gnohossou 2006 the dominant breeding is that of pigs which is of great economic profitability the coming modernization of this activity is likely to have a strong negative impact on the environment of ouémé delta some population also raise poultry for sale and for self consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical analyses field sampling was conducted from november 2016 to october 2017 the sampling sites were selected in order to i to quantify the nutrient flux inputs from ouémé river catchment and the surrounding cities ii to capture the spatial variability of the water quality of lake nokoué and iii to estimate the total internal nutrient load in the lake one sampling site was selected on each tributary and outlet of the lake fig 1 in addition sampling sites in the lake were determined using a 15 km2 grid for each of the resulting cells a water status criteria was set using both the water hyacinth proliferation index mama 2010 negusse and bowen 2010 and the pollution level index gnohossou 2006 which integrate nutrient concentrations proximity of a tributary distance to the sea average depth presence of major anthropogenic pressure and presence of acadja a fishing practice djihouessi djihouessi and aina 2018 each cell was compared to its immediate neighbour and they were merged when they were found to be similar according to the water status criteria six cells resulted from this analysis and a sampling site were taken in centre of each cells in total considering the lake its tributaries and its outlet 11 sampling sites with a total of 3 replicates per site were considered for this study thus 495 observations were made in total from november 2016 to october 2017 at each sampling point in situ water quality parameters were measured these measurements included temperature c ph salinity ppt and dissolved oxygen all measured using wqc 24 dkk toa multiprobe transparency was measured with secchi disk cm water samples were collected in opaque bottles and stored in cool boxes at 4 c for laboratory analysis nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn soluble reactive phosphorus po4 total phosphates tp and chlorophyll a chl a were analysed using methods described in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 water hyacinth sampling was conducted using a floating 1 m2 quadrat all the plant in the quadrat was counted and 6 water hyacinth plants were collected each time for determining their dry weight drying at 75 c until constant mass was reached spatio temporal variation of water quality parameters was assessed using repeated measured analysis of variance ranova with site and date as grouping factors post hoc tests using were performed using paired t tests with holm bonferroni adjustment to assess differences among groups statistical analysis was performed using r 3 3 2 2 2 nutrient inputs outputs mass calculations the n and p mass balance budgets of lake nokoué may be represented as 1 δ n r in s in f f i

out nutrient n or p outflow via seeping into the groundwater d out n lost during denitrification b h out nutrient lost from biomass fish and macrophyte harvest the hydrological data rivers inflows and outflows to from the lake for the period of the study was not available therefore to establish nutrient budget for lake nokoué the average monthly hydrological inflows and outflows to from the lake were considered together with the n and p concentrations measured during the study no data are available on groundwater movements within the area of lake nokoué thus it was not possible to estimate nutrient input from groundwater neither nutrient output via seeping also nutrient lost during denitrification were not estimate in this study 2 2 1 rating curve for each tributary river a regression analysis was performed between nutrient concentrations and discharge fig 3 the regression allowed to establish the rating curves which was used for the extrapolation of the nutrient concentrations from monthly values to daily values over the study period such relationship commonly use a power function regression rating curve approach for the estimation of riverine load letcher et al 1999 despite the relatively small number of samples used the range of flow conditions observed during this study all the hydrological periods of the lake nokoué have been sampled made this approach to be valid letcher et al 1999 quilbé et al 2006 jones et al 2019 these regressions showed a significant positive relationships between nutrient concentrations tn and tp and discharge of the so river for the ouémé river these relationships were also significant with a decrease of tn as discharge increased and increase of tp when the discharge increased the regression relationship were used to calculate daily nutrient inputs from the tributaries the mass of tn and tp transported into the lake by each of its tributaries ouémé and sô rivers were derived by multiplying the volume of water inflows by tn and tp concentrations in each of the rivers 2 2 2 nutrients inputs riverine inputs the mass of nutrient tn and tp transported to the lake by its tributaries were calculated by multiplying the daily volume of water inflow by the daily nutrient concentrations in the rivers the daily water inflow for each tributary was provided by the benin water board dg eau based measurements of the water level from the nearest gauge station to the lake the monthly nutrient concentrations in each river were measured at the gauge stations daily estimates of the nutrient concentrations were calculated using the rating curve approach which established the relationship between the nutrient concentrations and the tributaries discharge letcher et al 1999 quilbé et al 2006 it is important to note that riverine input in this study does not include bottom sediment transport at the water sediment interface only the nutrient in the water column total suspended solid was considered in this study sewage and stormwater inputs nutrient inputs from the sewage and stormwater collectors of cotonou and abomey calavi were calculated by multiplying the monthly water volume drained by each collector by the average monthly concentration of tn and tp released by each collector provided by the national institute of water ine let remind that these collectors carried both domestic wastewater all the year and stormwater during rainy season the domestic wastewater rejected was estimated at 169 200 m3 djihouessi and aina 2018 the scs cn rainfall runoff model scs 1956 mishra and singh 2013 was used to estimate the monthly volume of stormwater other inputs other direct nutrient inputs include direct excreta and untreated wastewater ejection from the community living on the villages on stilts and atmospheric deposition these terms have been calculated using secondary data from the literature and national water agency in benin according to the methods explained in table 1 it was assumed that part of the food demand of the population of ganvié and vekky villages on stilts in food is fulfilled by their local fish production since the fish consumed come from the lake it should be removed from the inputs thus the estimate of nutrient from direct excreta input takes into account the nutrient contained in excreta minus the nutrient contained in the fish consumed by the population 2 2 3 nutrients outputs lost from biomass fisheries harvest fisheries harvest fish catches constitutes one way of nutrient removal from the system the values of fishes catch used in this study was estimated at 64 25 t km2 year derived from the eco trophic model presented in villanueva et al 2006 the assumption and calculation made to estimate nutrient lost from fisheries harvest are presented in table 1 no macrophyte biomass removal were occurring on lake nokoué during the period of this study tidal flushing another way of nutrient removal from the system is tidal flushing the amount of tn and tp flushed into the atlantic ocean was estimated by multiplying the concentrations of tn and tp measured in cotonou channel by the volume of water flushed out from the lake table 1 2 2 4 uncertainties on nutrient inputs and output estimations the uncertainties in the current study group the uncertainties due to errors in measurement and bias theses uncertainties related to errors in laboratory measurements and error associated with water flow was calculated by applying uncertainties measurement analysis oenema et al 2003 which combined the equipment used for the measurement and the laboratory methods when secondary data were used the uncertainties were taken from the original study additional uncertainties to the overall nutrient budget estimations comes from limitation to quantify nutrient inputs from n fixation and riverine sediment and nutrient outputs from sediment burial sediment flushing and from denitrification which is recognised to be an essential way of nutrient output in coastal lake enrich prast et al 2016 upreti et al 2017 2 3 calculation of internal nutrient load water hyacinth biomass recycling water hyacinth appears and dies each year during high water period on lake nokoué the dead water hyacinths sink to the bottom of the lake increasing the humic concentration and potentially participating to the internal nutrient recycling in the system through various processes such as decomposition of detritus at the sediment water interface therefore the amount of tn and tp stored in water hyacinth before they die and sink represent part of the potential internal recycling of n and p each year in the system the method used for the estimation of these values combined both field measurements and remote sensing technics including satellite images we used the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi to relate field measurements of hyacinth biomass density and dry weight to remote sensing data the ndvi was calculated based on sentinel 2a satellite data which are satellite images with 12 bands and cells of 10 to 20 m resolution 2 n d v i b a n d 8 b a n d 4 b a n d 8 b a n d 4 simple linear mixed regression models were used to determine the relationship between the measured biomass and the ndvi of the cells containing the sampling points 70 of the dataset was used to develop the regression models and 30 were used to verify and estimate the performance of the best fitted regression model the model performance was calculated using the relative root mean square error rre expressed as 3 rre 1 n n 1 n o n p n 2 o m a x o m i n where n is the number of observations in the dataset o n is the nth observed value p n is the nth predicted value o m a x and o m i n are the maximum and minimum value of the observation respectively the obtained regression model was applied to estimate the lake monthly biomass of water hyacinth storage was calculated by multiplying biomass by the nutrient concentration in water hyacinth measured nutrient uptake rate was calculated by dividing the change in nutrient content over time sample interval of 30 days 3 results 3 1 variations of the water quality parameters temperature of lake nokoué ranged between 26 4 to 33 7 c and its ph values varied between 5 6 and 8 1 the average transparency was 86 cm with values ranging from 27 to 260 cm and the surface dissolved oxygen concentration varied between 0 12 and 9 6 mg l chlorophyll a concentrations in the lake varied between 1 and 512 µg l 3 1 1 salinity along with water level decline the salinity of lake nokoué increased continuously from 0 1 ppt in november 2016 to 19 2 ppt in january 2017 fig 4 a then from january to may the water was brackish with average salinity 18 ppt in june the local rainy season decreased significantly the salinity of the lake repeated measured anova n 495 p 0 01 and water inputs from the tributary rivers in september due to the rainfall events in the head of ouémé catchment maintain the lake s to low salinity 0 1 ppt spatially salinity decreased from the south near the cotonou channel towards the ouémé and sô rivers repeated measured anova n 495 p 0 01 salinity at djonou south west and totchè east presented the lowest values and highest values were recorded at cotonou chanel south and houedo gbadji north these results indicate that saline water intrusion in lake nokoué propagates in the south north direction fig 4a salinity appeared to play a crucial ecological role in lake nokoué it controls water hyacinth appearance salinity 6ppt and disappearance salinity 8 ppt at the surface of the lake 3 1 2 nutrients dissolved inorganic nitrogen din n concentrations in lake nokoué ranged from 0 06 mg l to 2 33 mg l while po4 p concentrations were between from 1 µg l to 155 µg l the temporal and spatial variations of din fig 4b showed a significant peak at all the locations in early april the end of the dry season then din n in the lake decreases progressively to very low values recorded in september october period of maximum discharge of the tributaries similar observations were made by zandagba et al 2016 and mama 2010 these results suggest that din in the lake might come from internal loading and is flushed out of the system by tributaries inflows the po4 p in the lake increased progressively from december to june at all the locations the maximums values were recorded from july to september which corresponds to the raining season in the ouémé catchment fig 4c the high correlation between po4 p concentrations and ouémé river discharge r 0 68 p 0 001 suggests that po4 p mainly comes from the ouémé catchment nutrients remained higher in the north east ganvié than most of the other locations paired t test n 495 p 0 001 the n p molar ratio decline below the redfield ratio at all the location in july corresponding the raining season fig 4d this indicated a shift in the system from p limited to n limited influence by the runoff water inputs in the lake 3 2 nutrient fluxes and budget in lake nokoué 3 2 1 nutrient input the total amount of tn and tp loaded in lake nokoué from both rivers between november 2016 and october 2017 was estimated to 14 968 and 588 tonnes respectively supplementary material 1 this corresponds to an average load of 0 319 and 0 013 tonne km2 year respectively of tn and tp over the entire catchment of ouémé river ouémé and sô rivers contributed almost equally to the tn load while the ouémé river was the major contributor to the tp load 72 there was a high positive correlation between nutrient loads and the ouémé river discharge nutrient loads for sô river decrease when the water discharge increase 57 of the tn load occurred in the dry season with 68 of this load brought by sô river most of the tp load occurred in the rainy season 69 with 68 of this load brought by ouémé river when its water discharge was very high about 378 tonnes of tn and 45 tonnes of tp were transported into lake nokoué by the dejection from houses on stilts stormwater sewage and atmospheric deposition table 2 nutrient input from the dejection of the communities living on the lake ganvié and from atmospheric deposition appeared to be of equal importance and respectively greater than the nutrient input from sewage and stormwater table 2 in general the other sources of nutrient input represent 7 3 of the nutrient brought by tributaries table 2 3 2 2 nutrient outputs fish harvest the yearly fish harvest removed approximatively 405 tonnes of tn and about 24 tonnes of tp with an uncertainty of 10 these values are very high and confirmed that lake nokoué is a very productive system villanueva et al 2006 lalèyè et al 2003 tidal flushing in total about 10052 tonnes of tn and 405 tonnes of phosphorus were rejected from the lake into the atlantic ocean there was a significant and positive correlation between the high values of nutrient flushing and the high values of water discharged from the ouémé and sô rivers supplementary material 1 3 2 3 nutrient budget in general on an annual basis the amount of nutrient loaded in the lake was higher than the amount of nutrient transported from the lake table 2 although some important sinks of nutrient such nutrient burial with sediment and denitrification were not estimated in this study riverine inputs was the main contributor nutrient load more than 90 and tidal flushing was the main contributor of nutrient lost from the system the fish harvest occurred mainly during the low water period while stormwater sewage and atmospheric deposition were more important during the raining period there was no significant difference between monthly nutrient inputs house dejection the maximums tidal nutrient rejection for both n and p occurred in october which correspond to the pic of the high water period the amount of nutrient transported form the system during this period was in the same order of magnitude with the amount of external nutrient inputs supplementary material 1 this suggests that the riverine nutrient inputs during high water period were almost automatically flushed out to the atlantic ocean the accumulation or storage of nitrogen in the system mainly occurred during low water period from february to may and is governed by the inputs from sô river in the other hand the storage of phosphorus occurred at the end of water recession period in december and during the local rainy season in june these periods correspond to period of sedimentation of suspended matter in the system phosphorus accumulation of in the system is governed by the inputs from ouémé river 3 3 internal nutrient load recycling by water hyacinth internal load in this study was mainly related to the cyclic appearance of water hyacinth in the system since water hyacinth appeared to be one of the crucial management problem around lake nokoué the goal was to localise and quantify the trade of nutrient between the sediment and the open water internal load related to phytoplankton was not investigated in this study 3 3 1 field observations the monthly average density of water hyacinth ranged between 69 and 186 plants m2 and average biomass ranged between 1 56 and 2 84 kg dw m2 fig 4e biomass increased at all the locations from november to until the december when the average salinity in the lake was still lower than 6 ppt from january because of salinity stress the weed biomass decreased progressively until late february where all the water hyacinth on the lake were dead and sank to the bottom water hyacinth reappeared in the lake when the salinity decrease and july influence of the local rainy season september and october influence of water discharge from the head catchment the observations made in the field showed that water hyacinth was most prominent in the north of the lake within 1 km of the shoreline fig 5 a and within the acadja where the branches prevented the weed from being blown to the shore 3 3 2 biomass estimate using ndvi water hyacinth biomass in lake nokoué significantly increased with ndvi supplementary material 2 the regression model accounted for 43 of the variation which appears to be higher than r2 of similar studies using landsat 5 images robles et al 2015 the verification of this regression model performed using the rre equation 2 indicated a performance of 65 4 supplementary material 2 thus using this model monthly water hyacinth biomass ranged between about 1 6 to 79 8 tonnes table 3 the maximum biomass occurred in december at the end of the water recession period in the lake 3 3 3 nutrient storage and uptake by water hyacinth tn and tp content of water hyacinth varied between 0 93 and 1 43 and between 0 23 and 0 39 of the dry weight respectively these results are in the same range of biomass values and nutrient contents of water hyacinth recorded in many natural environments boyd and vickers 1971 buller et al 2013 nyananyo et al 2007 when these results are scaled up to the whole lake using the ndvi estimates of biomass 1020 88 tonnes of tn and 231 29 tonnes of tp were stored in water hyacinth at its peak development in december table 3 these values represent the amount of nutrient that potentially sank to the bottom of the lake after seasonal die off and which has the potential to contribute to internal nutrient loading nutrient uptake by water hyacinth in lake nokoué was estimated at 404 kg n km 2 day 1 and 86 kg p km 2 day 1 these values are close similar to previously reported values reddy and sutton 1984 ting et al 2018 considering that water hyacinth occurred in lake nokoué from september to late january the total amount of nitrogen and phosphorus uptake in 2016 2017 was estimated at 1090 80 and 232 20 tonnes respectively these values are closed to the estimates of the total nutrient stored by water hyacinth indicating that the total nutrient uptake over the living period of the weed was equal to nutrient storage 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient inputs and uncertainties based on 1 the error in the analytical measurement in the tn and tp concentrations with 95 confidence interval for replicate analyses and 2 the error in the calculation of tributaries water discharge and stormwater discharges the uncertainty on riverine nutrient loads and stormwater sewage inputs were estimated at 21 the uncertainties on dry and wet nutrient deposition fluxes were about 30 and 10 respectively while a 25 uncertainty was found for the dejection from houses on stilts uncertainties in the nutrient outputs fishery harvest and tidal flushing were estimated to 32 of tn and 19 an anova test considering the uncertainties indicates that the difference between nutrient inputs and nutrient outputs were significant only during the low water period feb to april and the rising water period aug sept with the inputs higher than the outputs supplementary material 1 during the other periods of the year the amount of nutrient input and nutrient out are of the same rank the concern of the establishment of the nutrient budget for lake nokoué was to identify trends in nutrient surpluses thus the analysis of the uncertainty allows classifying the importance of each nutrient source and sink the riverine nutrient input was significantly more important than all the others external nutrient sources the atlantic ocean was the main sink for the whole ouémé catchment including the delta of the ouémé because of variability and high uncertainties budgets establishment for lake nokoué need to be evaluated over several years monitoring of nutrient stocks in some compartment of the system for instance in the agricultural soil of the delta can provide information to check the accuracy of nutrient budgets oenema et al 2003 proposed an application of quality assurance and quality control to remove feelings of unsureness and lack of certainty in nutrient budget studies the quality assurance and quality control would have to encompass the whole range of activities and intermediate steps in assuring accurate and high quality data in nutrient budgeting to foster confidence in the final nutrient balance 4 2 determinant of salinity and nutrient dynamic the spatio temporal variations of water quality and water hyacinth observed in this study indicate that the water recession period december january and the water rising period july september have unintended consequences on lake nokoué water quality the fall of the water level induces the increase of the salinity in the lake while the rise of the water level in the lake leads to a shift from a p limited system to an n limited system this would surely affect the annual phytoplankton dynamic in the system with is still unknown it s clear that hydrological changes during the year drive changes in salinity and nutrient concentration in the lake the two largest lake tributaries the ouémé and sô rivers provide the vast majority of the external nutrient load with the ouémé river alone transporting 72 of the lake s total annual external p load similar observations have been made for several open coastal lakes in west africa ebrié lagoon sakumo lagoon and in new zealand waituna lagoon where nutrient inputs increased with the tributaries water discharges schallenberg et al 2010 mitchell et al 2016 seu anoï et al 2013 the difference in the nutrient inputs amplitude from one system to another is due to the size of the upper catchment the morphological characteristics of the lake the elevation of the lake with respect to the sea water level and the degree of connection to the sea e g shape size of channel although hydrological changes appear to be the strongest driver of the spatio temporal variations of water quality in coastal lake with large catchment there is also strong evidence of local impact for instance the local rainfall significantly reduced the salinity in the lake in june and july 2017 fig 4a even though it doesn t significantly influence the tributaries water discharge fig 2 also the surrounding urbanised area including the village on stilts significantly influence local nutrient concentration through stormwater collectors and sewage inputs in fact po4 3 concentration appeared to be significantly high in the northwest and the south shoreline of the lake near the abomey calavi ganvié houedo gbadji and cotonou fig 1 and about 90 water hyacinth occurred in these regions fig 5 which suggests that the local nutrient inputs and wind control water hyacinth distribution in the lake with low currents contributing to sufficient contact time for nutrient uptake from the water column the optimal nutrient concentration for the development of water hyacinth in lake nokoué include an n p molar ratio greater than 16 with the average din concentrations around 0 5 mg l and po4 3 around 20 µg l 4 3 contribution of water hyacinth harvest to nutrient removal water hyacinth takes up an important amount of n and p in lake nokoué estimated at 1090 80 of tn 8 of total inputs and 232 20 tonnes of tp 40 of total inputs even though there is about 35 uncertainty on the value calculated this nutrient uptake from water hyacinth was equivalent to 3 5 times the sum of dejection from houses on stilts stormwater sewage and atmospheric deposition nutrient inputs nonetheless it appears that water hyacinth harvest would be a sustainable possibility for nutrient mainly phosphorus removal that exceeds the nutrient removal from fishery harvest although water hyacinth harvest seems to be an efficient solution for nutrient reduction in lake nokoué this approach without the reduction of riverine nutrient input would not solve eutrophication problems in lake nokoué the removal of water hyacinth before they die and sink will potentially reduce eutrophication of lake nokoué by nutrient removal from the water column however in several tropical aquatic ecosystem in south america and east africa attempts to restore water quality by rapid removal of water hyacinth has resulted in severe algal bloom since nutrient available in the system were high and algae take advantage of the lack of competition caused by the removal of the weed bicudo et al 2007 therefore water hyacinth harvest activities should be planned in a way to avoid undesirable algal bloom consequently management of the lake nokoué would need to respond to the following question concerning water hyacinth harvest when where and how much to remove in addition it is also primordial to evaluate the economic incidence of the harvest and the fate of tonnes of plants removed previous observations mama 2010 negusse and bowen 2010 djihouessi 2018 indicate that the water hyacinth covered the entire surface of the lake and died anyway before february when salinity increased suggesting that management action could remove all water hyacinth before february in addition results from these studies and the current study indicate that nutrients contained in the water column are flushed out during each water recession period meaning that nutrient accumulation in the water column is renewed each year consequently the risk of having algal bloom after water hyacinth removal in lake nokoué could not be higher than the risk of having algal bloom in the current situation the best period to remove water hyacinth in lake nokoué would be the period before saline water intrusion meaning january to early february for an average hydrological year several campaigns of harvesting would also increase the amount of nutrient removal since mature plant uptake less nutrient that young growing plant djihouessi 2018 4 4 management implications management action for the reduction of eutrophication in lake nokoué should include strategies for reduction of nutrient inputs from the ouémé catchment indeed most of the nutrients loaded in the lake come from the riverine source this could be linked to the importance of agriculture in the ouémé catchment which covered 3990 km2 in 2009 and has definitively increased the last 10 years tossa and tonouhewa 2009 considering an average application of mineral n and p of 90 and 39 kg ha year bossa et al 2012 the total n and p used by agriculture in the ouémé catchment was estimated at 35 910 tonnes year and 15 561 tonnes year respectively with a runoff coefficient 0 25 sandy soil with crops sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 agriculture provides about 66 of the riverine tn and 100 of the riverine tp inputs in lake nokoué serious efforts should be also done in the reduction of nutrient inputs from the villages on stilts stormwater and sewage inputs from ganvié abomey calavi and cotonou this study indicates that there is a strong relation between spatial nutrient enrichment and appearance of water hyacinth the northwest of the lake is the key locations where sanitation efforts have to be reinforced in addition management actions should include the construction of a wastewater treatment plant for the cities of cotonou and abomey calavi proper management of water hyacinth in lake nokoué should also integrate management of acadja as well the presence of acadja promotes the presence of water hyacinth in fact the hyacinth occurred within the branches of the acadja where they are blocked and protected from being moved by the wind currently the fishermen try to manually remove water hyacinth from acadja but the fast reproduction of the weed and the size of the acadja make that they eventually give up acadja could complicate the option of hyacinth removal in lake nokoué because water hyacinth inside acadja might not be accessible and even if they are they cannot be simply removed since acadja are considered as private properties and need authorisation from the owners for access acadja fishing consists of attracting fish and crustaceans into an artificially planted brushwood in the open water of lakes and then surround the brushwood park with a net to easily catch the fish acadja is designed to mimic the natural habitat associated with the shores of lakes that many fish species used for reproduction refuge and food in dry season note that the brushwood is not removed after fish harvest and therefore their decay might highly influence the water quality of the lake 5 conclusion changes in the hydrological regime influence significantly eutrophication of lake nokoué as the water level decreases during the water recession period salinity significantly increases and the nutrient contained in the water column is flushed out into the atlantic ocean an analysis of the nutrient n and p budgets indicates that even though the riverine input was the major source of nutrient its contribution to the lake eutrophication need to be further investigated since all the nutrient input during high water period was automatically flushed out to the atlantic ocean therefore eutrophication in lake nokoué seemed to be the result of internal nutrient loads which is promoted by a continuous and high deposition of organic matter to the sediment due to both the importation of wood for acadja fishing and to the seasonal death of water hyacinth in fact as salinity increase water hyacinth plants die and sink to the bottom of the lake and become a potential source of internal nutrient loading an assessment of the evolution of water hyacinth coverage using sentinel 2a images indicates that the maximum coverage the weed covered around 10 of the lake with a potential internal loading of 1020 88 tonnes of tn and 231 29 tonnes of tp therefore management of eutrophication in lake nokoué by the removal of water hyacinth from the surface of the lake before the increase of salinity beyond 6 ppt in low water period would contribute to reduce the equivalent of nutrient uptake by the plant from the water column however more studies have to be done regarding the complete nutrient budgets of the lake with an emphasis on the quantification of the total

1018,lake nokoué in benin supports the livelihoods of more than 500 000 people through fish production and sand mining however its health is jeopardised by eutrophication and excessive growth of the invasive water hyacinth which dies off and sink to sediment during dry seasons when the lake s salinity increases due to tidal intrusion water hyacinth constitutes then a potential source of internal nutrient loading through the decomposition of detritus and therefore can exacerbate eutrophication problems an important management question is whether the removal of water hyacinth before it dies would significantly reduce eutrophication problems through the removal of nutrients to compare the amount of nutrients removed by water hyacinth biomass to the amount of nutrients transported into the lake mass balance approach has been taken nutrient concentrations water hyacinth cover and hydrological inflows were measured over a 12 month period from november 2016 to october 2017 water hyacinth biomass estimation was based on a calibrated ndvi and field measurement relationship in total the hyacinth covered up to 18 km2 10 of the lake corresponding to 80 000 tonnes of dry weight which sink to the bottom each year when salinity rise the potential internal nutrient loaded from hyacinth to the system was estimated to 1021 tonnes of nitrogen 8 of external input and 231 tonnes of phosphorus 40 of external input considering that the tidal nutrient output compensates almost all the external nutrient inputs about 70 part of the nutrient available for eutrophication must come from internal sources likely through the decomposition of sediment detritus keywords lake nokoué nutrient inputs nutrient budget coastal lake water hyacinth management eutrophication management 1 introduction shallow coastal lakes throughout the world are often vulnerable to eutrophication problems this vulnerability results from their natural characteristics including that many of these lakes are in intertidal zones experience a high degree of wind mixing and sediment resuspension and are exposed to natural variability in nutrient concentrations due to seasonal inflows from sea or tributaries de jonge et al 2002 grenz et al 2019 in addition to natural high rates of productivity these systems are also exposed to strong anthropogenic pressure which includes nutrient loading from modified catchments urban inputs and industrial activities wang et al 2019 smith et al 2016 grenz et al 2019 the most severe symptoms of eutrophication encountered in lake systems are the excessive algal or cyanobacterial blooms and or the excessive aquatic weed growth while symptoms are similar across systems a study of different coastal lakes distributed around the world showed that the path to eutrophication and methods of controlling it are different depending on local conditions de jonge et al 2002 where the physical conditions climate tributaries inputs nutrient inputs open close to the sea as well as the transformation and retention of nutrients by the system constitutes the key parameters determining the specific responses of each system de jonge et al 2002 mitchell et al 2015 wang et al 2019 a recurrent symptom of eutrophication encountered in tropical and subtropical lakes is the colonisation of the invasive water hyacinth which is stimulated by excess nutrient inputs patel 2012 native to south america water hyacinth has infested aquatic system of more than 50 countries outside south america including many in africa téllez et al 2008 outcompeting all endogenous species growing in the vicinity in addition to causing reduction in native biodiversity water hyacinth invasion has also caused reduction of dissolved oxygen and decrease in fish production and thus created problems for local fishermen with respect to difficulties with navigation and decreased catch yield patel 2012 despite its prevalence water hyacinth is very rare in many estuaries because it generally does not tolerate salinity higher than 6 ppt de casabianca and laugier 1995 villamagna and murphy 2010 this situation has preserved many coastal lakes from the invasion of water hyacinth however in certain coastal lakes the tidal influence on the system is seasonally inhibited by heavy freshwater inputs from tributaries promoting the seasonal appearance of species not tolerant of high salinity this is the case of certain lakes in west africa coastline such as lake nokoué benin ebrié lagoon ivory coast where water hyacinth invades the surface of the system at each high water period and die with the sudden increase of salinity at each low water period negusse and bowen 2010 villanueva et al 2006 several management practices for the control of water hyacinth have been adopted in africa for almost three decades with biological control generally giving better results than manual removal and mechanical control hill and coetzee 2008 theuri 2013 thamaga and dube 2018 however biological control implies that the weed dies and sinks to the bottom of the lake representing therefore a potential source of internal nutrient load reddy and debusk 1991 patel 2012 the same applies to systems with a periodic death of water hyacinth due to saline water intrusion as observed in lake nokoué mama et al 2011 a review presented by hill and coetzee 2008 showed that integrated management approach which combines utilisation of available methods for water hyacinth control and nutrient control is required to achieve the acceptable control of the weed with nutrient control meaning control of both external and internal nutrient loading therefore a nutrient budget seemed to be the starting point of proper management of water hyacinth in eutrophic systems considering this integrated approach for the eutrophic lake nokoué mama et al 2011 which experience seasonal death water hyacinth during the low water period when salinity increases an important management question is whether the removal of water hyacinth would significantly reduce eutrophication problems through the removal of nutrients in the system what are nutrient inputs from tributaries compared to nutrient stored in water hyacinth biomass previous studies for nutrient control in lake nokoué have estimated nutrient load from its tributaries mama et al 2011 negusse and bowen 2010 but this information is not very useful for eutrophication management if it is not compared with other components in the nutrient budget several efforts based on field measurements have been made in the monitoring and quantification of water hyacinth however these methods require significant labour and could be time intensive and expensive depending on the size of the system since the year 2000 s remote sensing technology is been developed for the monitoring and management of aquatic systems baban 1999 kutser et al 2020 thamaga and dube 2018 recently time series of open source satellite images provide supporting information that could help decision making for the management of water resource system including management of eutrophication and assessment of control measures this approach offers new possibilities for a rapid estimation of water hyacinth biomass in a large system such as lake nokoué this study aims to understand whether water hyacinth should be removed from lake nokoué as an effort to reduce available nutrients in the system in a possible double positive scenario for both weed control and eutrophication mitigation 1 1 description of lake nokoué environment lake nokoué fig 1 is a very productive coastal shallow 1 5 m deep eutrophic lake located in the south of benin with cotonou laying between its southern shore and the atlantic ocean it covers around 150 km2 at low water and measures 20 km long east west 11 km wide north south le barbé et al 1993 mama et al 2011 and drains a catchment of approximately 46 920 km2 eutrophication in lake nokoué is characterised by the seasonal proliferation of water hyacinth which can cover up to 10 of the surface at its peak negusse and bowen 2010 one peculiarity of lake nokoué is the presence of human habitations built on stilts on the surface of the water in the northwestern part of the lake known as ganvié and vekky the lack of adequate sanitation infrastructure made these villages a potentially important source of nutrient input through the direct rejection of their wastes part of untreated sewage and stormwater from cotonou and calavi are also rejected into the lake 1 2 hydrological regime of lake nokoué the hydrological regime of lake nokoué is characterised by three major hydrologic periods i a high water period from september to november due to rains in north of benin where the ouémé river originates texier et al 1979 gnohossou 2006 ii a low water period from december to may in which tidal inputs enter in the lake through the cotonou channel le barbé et al 1993 and iii a medium water level phase from june to august caused by the local rainfall over the ouémé delta 30 km around lake nokoué in fact this area is highly urbanised and waterproofed with rainwater collectors flowing mainly into the lake instead of its tributaries ouémé and sô rivers thus the local rainfall has a high influence on the water level of lake and a little influence on its tributaries le barbé et al 1993 gnohossou 2006 from high water period to low water period the water level of lake nokoué gradually drops by about 60 cm as a result of the decline in water flows from ouémé and sô rivers which dropped by 80 and 50 respectively each year from october to mid december fig 2 a comparison of the water discharge of ouémé river at bonou to the water level of lake nokoué at cotonou chanel based on data measured from 2001 to 2010 showed a very similar pattern in the variation of both for high water discharge djihouessi 2018 for low water discharge the influence of the tide takes precedence over the influence of the river on the lake water level there is a strong and significant correlation between the water lost by the ouémé river between bonou and hetin sota and the water discharge of the so river at so ava the sô river recovers 15 of the losses that occur along the ouémé river djihouessi 2018 further analysis based on the hydrological period of the rivers indicated that the contribution of the ouémé river to the so river was stronger in high water period 23 than in low water period 12 the ouémé river is more responsive to the dry season because it exclusively depends on runoff inputs while the sô river is fed in the dry season by the upstream lake hlan fig 1 and probably some groundwater by late january the tide from atlantic ocean increasingly influences lake nokoué water level that fluctuate by about 10 to 15 cm each 14 days until july after this period the lake s water level increase progressively due to the increasing discharge in the ouémé and so rivers fig 2 on an average year ouémé and sô rivers water discharges into lake nokoué are about 215 m3 s and 120 m3 s respectively djihouessi and aina 2018 1 3 land use in ouémé catchment the main food crops grown in the catchment are maize yam and cassava in the delta rice is cultivated near the entrance of the ouémé river into the lake cowpea bean a local variety of legume is grown in the upper delta during the water recession period agronomic research has clearly established the gradual depletion in fertile land which in the long term will probably increase the use of fertilizers in the catchment and the delta surveys conducted with sonapra national society for the promotion of agriculture on the use of chemical fertilizers revealed a consumption estimated at more than 100 000 tons for 1994 2000 gnohossou 2006 the dominant breeding is that of pigs which is of great economic profitability the coming modernization of this activity is likely to have a strong negative impact on the environment of ouémé delta some population also raise poultry for sale and for self consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical analyses field sampling was conducted from november 2016 to october 2017 the sampling sites were selected in order to i to quantify the nutrient flux inputs from ouémé river catchment and the surrounding cities ii to capture the spatial variability of the water quality of lake nokoué and iii to estimate the total internal nutrient load in the lake one sampling site was selected on each tributary and outlet of the lake fig 1 in addition sampling sites in the lake were determined using a 15 km2 grid for each of the resulting cells a water status criteria was set using both the water hyacinth proliferation index mama 2010 negusse and bowen 2010 and the pollution level index gnohossou 2006 which integrate nutrient concentrations proximity of a tributary distance to the sea average depth presence of major anthropogenic pressure and presence of acadja a fishing practice djihouessi djihouessi and aina 2018 each cell was compared to its immediate neighbour and they were merged when they were found to be similar according to the water status criteria six cells resulted from this analysis and a sampling site were taken in centre of each cells in total considering the lake its tributaries and its outlet 11 sampling sites with a total of 3 replicates per site were considered for this study thus 495 observations were made in total from november 2016 to october 2017 at each sampling point in situ water quality parameters were measured these measurements included temperature c ph salinity ppt and dissolved oxygen all measured using wqc 24 dkk toa multiprobe transparency was measured with secchi disk cm water samples were collected in opaque bottles and stored in cool boxes at 4 c for laboratory analysis nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn soluble reactive phosphorus po4 total phosphates tp and chlorophyll a chl a were analysed using methods described in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 water hyacinth sampling was conducted using a floating 1 m2 quadrat all the plant in the quadrat was counted and 6 water hyacinth plants were collected each time for determining their dry weight drying at 75 c until constant mass was reached spatio temporal variation of water quality parameters was assessed using repeated measured analysis of variance ranova with site and date as grouping factors post hoc tests using were performed using paired t tests with holm bonferroni adjustment to assess differences among groups statistical analysis was performed using r 3 3 2 2 2 nutrient inputs outputs mass calculations the n and p mass balance budgets of lake nokoué may be represented as 1 δ n r in s in f f i

outflows to from the lake for the period of the study was not available therefore to establish nutrient budget for lake nokoué the average monthly hydrological inflows and outflows to from the lake were considered together with the n and p concentrations measured during the study no data are available on groundwater movements within the area of lake nokoué thus it was not possible to estimate nutrient input from groundwater neither nutrient output via seeping also nutrient lost during denitrification were not estimate in this study 2 2 1 rating curve for each tributary river a regression analysis was performed between nutrient concentrations and discharge fig 3 the regression allowed to establish the rating curves which was used for the extrapolation of the nutrient concentrations from monthly values to daily values over the study period such relationship commonly use a power function regression rating curve approach for the estimation of riverine load letcher et al 1999 despite the relatively small number of samples used the range of flow conditions observed during this study all the hydrological periods of the lake nokoué have been sampled made this approach to be valid letcher et al 1999 quilbé et al 2006 jones et al 2019 these regressions showed a significant positive relationships between nutrient concentrations tn and tp and discharge of the so river for the ouémé river these relationships were also significant with a decrease of tn as discharge increased and increase of tp when the discharge increased the regression relationship were used to calculate daily nutrient inputs from the tributaries the mass of tn and tp transported into the lake by each of its tributaries ouémé and sô rivers were derived by multiplying the volume of water inflows by tn and tp concentrations in each of the rivers 2 2 2 nutrients inputs riverine inputs the mass of nutrient tn and tp transported to the lake by its tributaries were calculated by multiplying the daily volume of water inflow by the daily nutrient concentrations in the rivers the daily water inflow for each tributary was provided by the benin water board dg eau based measurements of the water level from the nearest gauge station to the lake the monthly nutrient concentrations in each river were measured at the gauge stations daily estimates of the nutrient concentrations were calculated using the rating curve approach which established the relationship between the nutrient concentrations and the tributaries discharge letcher et al 1999 quilbé et al 2006 it is important to note that riverine input in this study does not include bottom sediment transport at the water sediment interface only the nutrient in the water column total suspended solid was considered in this study sewage and stormwater inputs nutrient inputs from the sewage and stormwater collectors of cotonou and abomey calavi were calculated by multiplying the monthly water volume drained by each collector by the average monthly concentration of tn and tp released by each collector provided by the national institute of water ine let remind that these collectors carried both domestic wastewater all the year and stormwater during rainy season the domestic wastewater rejected was estimated at 169 200 m3 djihouessi and aina 2018 the scs cn rainfall runoff model scs 1956 mishra and singh 2013 was used to estimate the monthly volume of stormwater other inputs other direct nutrient inputs include direct excreta and untreated wastewater ejection from the community living on the villages on stilts and atmospheric deposition these terms have been calculated using secondary data from the literature and national water agency in benin according to the methods explained in table 1 it was assumed that part of the food demand of the population of ganvié and vekky villages on stilts in food is fulfilled by their local fish production since the fish consumed come from the lake it should be removed from the inputs thus the estimate of nutrient from direct excreta input takes into account the nutrient contained in excreta minus the nutrient contained in the fish consumed by the population 2 2 3 nutrients outputs lost from biomass fisheries harvest fisheries harvest fish catches constitutes one way of nutrient removal from the system the values of fishes catch used in this study was estimated at 64 25 t km2 year derived from the eco trophic model presented in villanueva et al 2006 the assumption and calculation made to estimate nutrient lost from fisheries harvest are presented in table 1 no macrophyte biomass removal were occurring on lake nokoué during the period of this study tidal flushing another way of nutrient removal from the system is tidal flushing the amount of tn and tp flushed into the atlantic ocean was estimated by multiplying the concentrations of tn and tp measured in cotonou channel by the volume of water flushed out from the lake table 1 2 2 4 uncertainties on nutrient inputs and output estimations the uncertainties in the current study group the uncertainties due to errors in measurement and bias theses uncertainties related to errors in laboratory measurements and error associated with water flow was calculated by applying uncertainties measurement analysis oenema et al 2003 which combined the equipment used for the measurement and the laboratory methods when secondary data were used the uncertainties were taken from the original study additional uncertainties to the overall nutrient budget estimations comes from limitation to quantify nutrient inputs from n fixation and riverine sediment and nutrient outputs from sediment burial sediment flushing and from denitrification which is recognised to be an essential way of nutrient output in coastal lake enrich prast et al 2016 upreti et al 2017 2 3 calculation of internal nutrient load water hyacinth biomass recycling water hyacinth appears and dies each year during high water period on lake nokoué the dead water hyacinths sink to the bottom of the lake increasing the humic concentration and potentially participating to the internal nutrient recycling in the system through various processes such as decomposition of detritus at the sediment water interface therefore the amount of tn and tp stored in water hyacinth before they die and sink represent part of the potential internal recycling of n and p each year in the system the method used for the estimation of these values combined both field measurements and remote sensing technics including satellite images we used the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi to relate field measurements of hyacinth biomass density and dry weight to remote sensing data the ndvi was calculated based on sentinel 2a satellite data which are satellite images with 12 bands and cells of 10 to 20 m resolution 2 n d v i b a n d 8 b a n d 4 b a n d 8 b a n d 4 simple linear mixed regression models were used to determine the relationship between the measured biomass and the ndvi of the cells containing the sampling points 70 of the dataset was used to develop the regression models and 30 were used to verify and estimate the performance of the best fitted regression model the model performance was calculated using the relative root mean square error rre expressed as 3 rre 1 n n 1 n o n p n 2 o m a x o m i n where n is the number of observations in the dataset o n is the nth observed value p n is the nth predicted value o m a x and o m i n are the maximum and minimum value of the observation respectively the obtained regression model was applied to estimate the lake monthly biomass of water hyacinth storage was calculated by multiplying biomass by the nutrient concentration in water hyacinth measured nutrient uptake rate was calculated by dividing the change in nutrient content over time sample interval of 30 days 3 results 3 1 variations of the water quality parameters temperature of lake nokoué ranged between 26 4 to 33 7 c and its ph values varied between 5 6 and 8 1 the average transparency was 86 cm with values ranging from 27 to 260 cm and the surface dissolved oxygen concentration varied between 0 12 and 9 6 mg l chlorophyll a concentrations in the lake varied between 1 and 512 µg l 3 1 1 salinity along with water level decline the salinity of lake nokoué increased continuously from 0 1 ppt in november 2016 to 19 2 ppt in january 2017 fig 4 a then from january to may the water was brackish with average salinity 18 ppt in june the local rainy season decreased significantly the salinity of the lake repeated measured anova n 495 p 0 01 and water inputs from the tributary rivers in september due to the rainfall events in the head of ouémé catchment maintain the lake s to low salinity 0 1 ppt spatially salinity decreased from the south near the cotonou channel towards the ouémé and sô rivers repeated measured anova n 495 p 0 01 salinity at djonou south west and totchè east presented the lowest values and highest values were recorded at cotonou chanel south and houedo gbadji north these results indicate that saline water intrusion in lake nokoué propagates in the south north direction fig 4a salinity appeared to play a crucial ecological role in lake nokoué it controls water hyacinth appearance salinity 6ppt and disappearance salinity 8 ppt at the surface of the lake 3 1 2 nutrients dissolved inorganic nitrogen din n concentrations in lake nokoué ranged from 0 06 mg l to 2 33 mg l while po4 p concentrations were between from 1 µg l to 155 µg l the temporal and spatial variations of din fig 4b showed a significant peak at all the locations in early april the end of the dry season then din n in the lake decreases progressively to very low values recorded in september october period of maximum discharge of the tributaries similar observations were made by zandagba et al 2016 and mama 2010 these results suggest that din in the lake might come from internal loading and is flushed out of the system by tributaries inflows the po4 p in the lake increased progressively from december to june at all the locations the maximums values were recorded from july to september which corresponds to the raining season in the ouémé catchment fig 4c the high correlation between po4 p concentrations and ouémé river discharge r 0 68 p 0 001 suggests that po4 p mainly comes from the ouémé catchment nutrients remained higher in the north east ganvié than most of the other locations paired t test n 495 p 0 001 the n p molar ratio decline below the redfield ratio at all the location in july corresponding the raining season fig 4d this indicated a shift in the system from p limited to n limited influence by the runoff water inputs in the lake 3 2 nutrient fluxes and budget in lake nokoué 3 2 1 nutrient input the total amount of tn and tp loaded in lake nokoué from both rivers between november 2016 and october 2017 was estimated to 14 968 and 588 tonnes respectively supplementary material 1 this corresponds to an average load of 0 319 and 0 013 tonne km2 year respectively of tn and tp over the entire catchment of ouémé river ouémé and sô rivers contributed almost equally to the tn load while the ouémé river was the major contributor to the tp load 72 there was a high positive correlation between nutrient loads and the ouémé river discharge nutrient loads for sô river decrease when the water discharge increase 57 of the tn load occurred in the dry season with 68 of this load brought by sô river most of the tp load occurred in the rainy season 69 with 68 of this load brought by ouémé river when its water discharge was very high about 378 tonnes of tn and 45 tonnes of tp were transported into lake nokoué by the dejection from houses on stilts stormwater sewage and atmospheric deposition table 2 nutrient input from the dejection of the communities living on the lake ganvié and from atmospheric deposition appeared to be of equal importance and respectively greater than the nutrient input from sewage and stormwater table 2 in general the other sources of nutrient input represent 7 3 of the nutrient brought by tributaries table 2 3 2 2 nutrient outputs fish harvest the yearly fish harvest removed approximatively 405 tonnes of tn and about 24 tonnes of tp with an uncertainty of 10 these values are very high and confirmed that lake nokoué is a very productive system villanueva et al 2006 lalèyè et al 2003 tidal flushing in total about 10052 tonnes of tn and 405 tonnes of phosphorus were rejected from the lake into the atlantic ocean there was a significant and positive correlation between the high values of nutrient flushing and the high values of water discharged from the ouémé and sô rivers supplementary material 1 3 2 3 nutrient budget in general on an annual basis the amount of nutrient loaded in the lake was higher than the amount of nutrient transported from the lake table 2 although some important sinks of nutrient such nutrient burial with sediment and denitrification were not estimated in this study riverine inputs was the main contributor nutrient load more than 90 and tidal flushing was the main contributor of nutrient lost from the system the fish harvest occurred mainly during the low water period while stormwater sewage and atmospheric deposition were more important during the raining period there was no significant difference between monthly nutrient inputs house dejection the maximums tidal nutrient rejection for both n and p occurred in october which correspond to the pic of the high water period the amount of nutrient transported form the system during this period was in the same order of magnitude with the amount of external nutrient inputs supplementary material 1 this suggests that the riverine nutrient inputs during high water period were almost automatically flushed out to the atlantic ocean the accumulation or storage of nitrogen in the system mainly occurred during low water period from february to may and is governed by the inputs from sô river in the other hand the storage of phosphorus occurred at the end of water recession period in december and during the local rainy season in june these periods correspond to period of sedimentation of suspended matter in the system phosphorus accumulation of in the system is governed by the inputs from ouémé river 3 3 internal nutrient load recycling by water hyacinth internal load in this study was mainly related to the cyclic appearance of water hyacinth in the system since water hyacinth appeared to be one of the crucial management problem around lake nokoué the goal was to localise and quantify the trade of nutrient between the sediment and the open water internal load related to phytoplankton was not investigated in this study 3 3 1 field observations the monthly average density of water hyacinth ranged between 69 and 186 plants m2 and average biomass ranged between 1 56 and 2 84 kg dw m2 fig 4e biomass increased at all the locations from november to until the december when the average salinity in the lake was still lower than 6 ppt from january because of salinity stress the weed biomass decreased progressively until late february where all the water hyacinth on the lake were dead and sank to the bottom water hyacinth reappeared in the lake when the salinity decrease and july influence of the local rainy season september and october influence of water discharge from the head catchment the observations made in the field showed that water hyacinth was most prominent in the north of the lake within 1 km of the shoreline fig 5 a and within the acadja where the branches prevented the weed from being blown to the shore 3 3 2 biomass estimate using ndvi water hyacinth biomass in lake nokoué significantly increased with ndvi supplementary material 2 the regression model accounted for 43 of the variation which appears to be higher than r2 of similar studies using landsat 5 images robles et al 2015 the verification of this regression model performed using the rre equation 2 indicated a performance of 65 4 supplementary material 2 thus using this model monthly water hyacinth biomass ranged between about 1 6 to 79 8 tonnes table 3 the maximum biomass occurred in december at the end of the water recession period in the lake 3 3 3 nutrient storage and uptake by water hyacinth tn and tp content of water hyacinth varied between 0 93 and 1 43 and between 0 23 and 0 39 of the dry weight respectively these results are in the same range of biomass values and nutrient contents of water hyacinth recorded in many natural environments boyd and vickers 1971 buller et al 2013 nyananyo et al 2007 when these results are scaled up to the whole lake using the ndvi estimates of biomass 1020 88 tonnes of tn and 231 29 tonnes of tp were stored in water hyacinth at its peak development in december table 3 these values represent the amount of nutrient that potentially sank to the bottom of the lake after seasonal die off and which has the potential to contribute to internal nutrient loading nutrient uptake by water hyacinth in lake nokoué was estimated at 404 kg n km 2 day 1 and 86 kg p km 2 day 1 these values are close similar to previously reported values reddy and sutton 1984 ting et al 2018 considering that water hyacinth occurred in lake nokoué from september to late january the total amount of nitrogen and phosphorus uptake in 2016 2017 was estimated at 1090 80 and 232 20 tonnes respectively these values are closed to the estimates of the total nutrient stored by water hyacinth indicating that the total nutrient uptake over the living period of the weed was equal to nutrient storage 4 discussion 4 1 nutrient inputs and uncertainties based on 1 the error in the analytical measurement in the tn and tp concentrations with 95 confidence interval for replicate analyses and 2 the error in the calculation of tributaries water discharge and stormwater discharges the uncertainty on riverine nutrient loads and stormwater sewage inputs were estimated at 21 the uncertainties on dry and wet nutrient deposition fluxes were about 30 and 10 respectively while a 25 uncertainty was found for the dejection from houses on stilts uncertainties in the nutrient outputs fishery harvest and tidal flushing were estimated to 32 of tn and 19 an anova test considering the uncertainties indicates that the difference between nutrient inputs and nutrient outputs were significant only during the low water period feb to april and the rising water period aug sept with the inputs higher than the outputs supplementary material 1 during the other periods of the year the amount of nutrient input and nutrient out are of the same rank the concern of the establishment of the nutrient budget for lake nokoué was to identify trends in nutrient surpluses thus the analysis of the uncertainty allows classifying the importance of each nutrient source and sink the riverine nutrient input was significantly more important than all the others external nutrient sources the atlantic ocean was the main sink for the whole ouémé catchment including the delta of the ouémé because of variability and high uncertainties budgets establishment for lake nokoué need to be evaluated over several years monitoring of nutrient stocks in some compartment of the system for instance in the agricultural soil of the delta can provide information to check the accuracy of nutrient budgets oenema et al 2003 proposed an application of quality assurance and quality control to remove feelings of unsureness and lack of certainty in nutrient budget studies the quality assurance and quality control would have to encompass the whole range of activities and intermediate steps in assuring accurate and high quality data in nutrient budgeting to foster confidence in the final nutrient balance 4 2 determinant of salinity and nutrient dynamic the spatio temporal variations of water quality and water hyacinth observed in this study indicate that the water recession period december january and the water rising period july september have unintended consequences on lake nokoué water quality the fall of the water level induces the increase of the salinity in the lake while the rise of the water level in the lake leads to a shift from a p limited system to an n limited system this would surely affect the annual phytoplankton dynamic in the system with is still unknown it s clear that hydrological changes during the year drive changes in salinity and nutrient concentration in the lake the two largest lake tributaries the ouémé and sô rivers provide the vast majority of the external nutrient load with the ouémé river alone transporting 72 of the lake s total annual external p load similar observations have been made for several open coastal lakes in west africa ebrié lagoon sakumo lagoon and in new zealand waituna lagoon where nutrient inputs increased with the tributaries water discharges schallenberg et al 2010 mitchell et al 2016 seu anoï et al 2013 the difference in the nutrient inputs amplitude from one system to another is due to the size of the upper catchment the morphological characteristics of the lake the elevation of the lake with respect to the sea water level and the degree of connection to the sea e g shape size of channel although hydrological changes appear to be the strongest driver of the spatio temporal variations of water quality in coastal lake with large catchment there is also strong evidence of local impact for instance the local rainfall significantly reduced the salinity in the lake in june and july 2017 fig 4a even though it doesn t significantly influence the tributaries water discharge fig 2 also the surrounding urbanised area including the village on stilts significantly influence local nutrient concentration through stormwater collectors and sewage inputs in fact po4 3 concentration appeared to be significantly high in the northwest and the south shoreline of the lake near the abomey calavi ganvié houedo gbadji and cotonou fig 1 and about 90 water hyacinth occurred in these regions fig 5 which suggests that the local nutrient inputs and wind control water hyacinth distribution in the lake with low currents contributing to sufficient contact time for nutrient uptake from the water column the optimal nutrient concentration for the development of water hyacinth in lake nokoué include an n p molar ratio greater than 16 with the average din concentrations around 0 5 mg l and po4 3 around 20 µg l 4 3 contribution of water hyacinth harvest to nutrient removal water hyacinth takes up an important amount of n and p in lake nokoué estimated at 1090 80 of tn 8 of total inputs and 232 20 tonnes of tp 40 of total inputs even though there is about 35 uncertainty on the value calculated this nutrient uptake from water hyacinth was equivalent to 3 5 times the sum of dejection from houses on stilts stormwater sewage and atmospheric deposition nutrient inputs nonetheless it appears that water hyacinth harvest would be a sustainable possibility for nutrient mainly phosphorus removal that exceeds the nutrient removal from fishery harvest although water hyacinth harvest seems to be an efficient solution for nutrient reduction in lake nokoué this approach without the reduction of riverine nutrient input would not solve eutrophication problems in lake nokoué the removal of water hyacinth before they die and sink will potentially reduce eutrophication of lake nokoué by nutrient removal from the water column however in several tropical aquatic ecosystem in south america and east africa attempts to restore water quality by rapid removal of water hyacinth has resulted in severe algal bloom since nutrient available in the system were high and algae take advantage of the lack of competition caused by the removal of the weed bicudo et al 2007 therefore water hyacinth harvest activities should be planned in a way to avoid undesirable algal bloom consequently management of the lake nokoué would need to respond to the following question concerning water hyacinth harvest when where and how much to remove in addition it is also primordial to evaluate the economic incidence of the harvest and the fate of tonnes of plants removed previous observations mama 2010 negusse and bowen 2010 djihouessi 2018 indicate that the water hyacinth covered the entire surface of the lake and died anyway before february when salinity increased suggesting that management action could remove all water hyacinth before february in addition results from these studies and the current study indicate that nutrients contained in the water column are flushed out during each water recession period meaning that nutrient accumulation in the water column is renewed each year consequently the risk of having algal bloom after water hyacinth removal in lake nokoué could not be higher than the risk of having algal bloom in the current situation the best period to remove water hyacinth in lake nokoué would be the period before saline water intrusion meaning january to early february for an average hydrological year several campaigns of harvesting would also increase the amount of nutrient removal since mature plant uptake less nutrient that young growing plant djihouessi 2018 4 4 management implications management action for the reduction of eutrophication in lake nokoué should include strategies for reduction of nutrient inputs from the ouémé catchment indeed most of the nutrients loaded in the lake come from the riverine source this could be linked to the importance of agriculture in the ouémé catchment which covered 3990 km2 in 2009 and has definitively increased the last 10 years tossa and tonouhewa 2009 considering an average application of mineral n and p of 90 and 39 kg ha year bossa et al 2012 the total n and p used by agriculture in the ouémé catchment was estimated at 35 910 tonnes year and 15 561 tonnes year respectively with a runoff coefficient 0 25 sandy soil with crops sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 agriculture provides about 66 of the riverine tn and 100 of the riverine tp inputs in lake nokoué serious efforts should be also done in the reduction of nutrient inputs from the villages on stilts stormwater and sewage inputs from ganvié abomey calavi and cotonou this study indicates that there is a strong relation between spatial nutrient enrichment and appearance of water hyacinth the northwest of the lake is the key locations where sanitation efforts have to be reinforced in addition management actions should include the construction of a wastewater treatment plant for the cities of cotonou and abomey calavi proper management of water hyacinth in lake nokoué should also integrate management of acadja as well the presence of acadja promotes the presence of water hyacinth in fact the hyacinth occurred within the branches of the acadja where they are blocked and protected from being moved by the wind currently the fishermen try to manually remove water hyacinth from acadja but the fast reproduction of the weed and the size of the acadja make that they eventually give up acadja could complicate the option of hyacinth removal in lake nokoué because water hyacinth inside acadja might not be accessible and even if they are they cannot be simply removed since acadja are considered as private properties and need authorisation from the owners for access acadja fishing consists of attracting fish and crustaceans into an artificially planted brushwood in the open water of lakes and then surround the brushwood park with a net to easily catch the fish acadja is designed to mimic the natural habitat associated with the shores of lakes that many fish species used for reproduction refuge and food in dry season note that the brushwood is not removed after fish harvest and therefore their decay might highly influence the water quality of the lake 5 conclusion changes in the hydrological regime influence significantly eutrophication of lake nokoué as the water level decreases during the water recession period salinity significantly increases and the nutrient contained in the water column is flushed out into the atlantic ocean an analysis of the nutrient n and p budgets indicates that even though the riverine input was the major source of nutrient its contribution to the lake eutrophication need to be further investigated since all the nutrient input during high water period was automatically flushed out to the atlantic ocean therefore eutrophication in lake nokoué seemed to be the result of internal nutrient loads which is promoted by a continuous and high deposition of organic matter to the sediment due to both the importation of wood for acadja fishing and to the seasonal death of water hyacinth in fact as salinity increase water hyacinth plants die and sink to the bottom of the lake and become a potential source of internal nutrient loading an assessment of the evolution of water hyacinth coverage using sentinel 2a images indicates that the maximum coverage the weed covered around 10 of the lake with a potential internal loading of 1020 88 tonnes of tn and 231 29 tonnes of tp therefore management of eutrophication in lake nokoué by the removal of water hyacinth from the surface of the lake before the increase of salinity beyond 6 ppt in low water period would contribute to reduce the equivalent of nutrient uptake by the plant from the water column however more studies have to be done regarding the complete nutrient budgets of the lake with an emphasis on the quantification of the total

the dispersion value of 0 431 keywords phytoplankton diversity assemblage environmental parameters sundarbans 1 introduction primary producers hold the key to production function of an aquatic ecosystem and thus draw attention of researchers as an indicator in assessing ecosystem s health the estuaries and adjacent coastal waters are said to be among the most highly fecund ecosystems in the world day et al 1989 these transition zones estuaries are characterized by the mixing of nutrient enriched freshwater with the relatively nutrient poor sea waters quinlan and phlips 2007 this phenomenon is responsible for changes of various physical and chemical gradients of the estuarine environment which greatly influences the spatio temporal variations abundance and functional characteristics of the estuarine biota mc lusky and elliot 2004 as a primary producer phytoplankton forms the basis of the trophic food chain and these communities are said to be responsible for half of the total estuarine primary production soria píriz et al 2017 mangrove associated estuaries in particular are considered as productive zones where phytoplankton may play a pivotal role in such productivity and its production varies significantly due to its dynamicity rahman et al 2013 previous studies revealed that the changes of hydrographical conditions coupled with seasonal precipitations were the controlling factors for the succession of phytoplankton in the estuarine system biswas et al 2009 similarly hilaluddin et al 2020 suggested that transparency and the related parameters turbidity and total solids coupled with availability of nutrients were the major factors in driving the phytoplankton community structure in the mangrove estuaries according to seitzinger et al 2002 estuaries provide bio available dissolved nutrients from natural and anthropogenic sources accumulated through the drainage system to serve its residents the most diversified group of phytoplankton of varying size and morphology from freshwater to euryhaline origin in estuaries phytoplankters are greatly influenced by tidal regime and seasonal freshwater runoff which also greatly affect water column stability residence time light and nutrient availability badylak et al 2016 thus the phytoplankton succession and the species traits may differ considerably in response to the highly dynamic natures of the estuarine environment costa santana et al 2017 according to cloern et al 2014 their responses towards this dynamicity generally falls into two categories i phytoplankton growth rate regulated by light temperature and nutrients and ii mortality that includes grazing pressure and cell lysis induced by viral infections and washout from the system during events of high river flow and sinking the influence of vertical mixing on phytoplankton assemblage biomass and productivity has become an essential subject in present days and thus concern to the researchers and aquatic ecologists the sundarbans the largest deltaic mangrove forest in the world lies at an ecologically important ecotone of hooghly matlah estuarine system in the ganga brahmaputra river basin occupying a territory of india and bangladesh sundarbans was declared as a world heritage site by international union for conservation and nature in 1987 and included as biosphere reserve under united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco man and the biosphere mab programme list 2001 it covers an area of 10 200 sq km of which 4 200 sq km of reserve forest is located in india which also entails within its geographical limits several low lying tides influenced coastal wetlands these wetlands are frequently exposed to differential salinity regime resulting into misbalance in the intracellular osmo regulatory mechanism in many phytoplankton species mitra et al 2012 the region receives an annual rainfall of about 1600 1800 mm and has witnessed several extreme climatic events like tsunamis and cyclonic storms in our understanding stress on aquatic ecosystem results in physical chemical or biological alterations of the environment which may lead to reduction in biodiversity there is a multitude of factors that offers stress on biotic compartments of an ecosystem and the response change in the community structure would be a resultant of degree and frequency of stress factors acting over the community resilience the sundarbans suffered from environmental degradation due to human encroachment deforestation tourism and the rapid growth of agriculture and aquaculture activities sarkar and bhattacharya 2003 eutrophication is another factor controlling the temporal succession of autotrophic and heterotrophic communities in sundarban ecosystem and its associated wetlands chaudhuri et al 2012 besides large container vessels across international ports utilized the estuarine stretch of indian sundarbans as navigational routes through waterways the navigation also imposes tremendous anthropogenic stress generated from the movement of barge propeller imposing detrimental effects of the aquatic food chain das sarkar et al 2019 therefore owing to human induced pressures most coastal waters would unable to maintain system specific stable state or a good ecological state berthold et al 2018 at the same time the sundarbans ecosystem has exceedingly become fragile resulting in dwindling state of floral and faunal diversity and thus this system receives prior attention of the conservationists to formulate restoration strategies sarkar and naskar 2010 several studies had been conducted on hydrology and phytoplankton community structure from indian sundarban waters by de and choudhury 1991 de et al 1994 biswas et al 2009 manna et al 2010 dey et al 2012 and chowdhury et al 2012 the zone being influenced by aggressive tidal action affects the regular variations in values of water quality parameters in the region salinity plays a critical role in deciding the distribution of phytoplankton chaudhury et al 2012 reported that salinity level gradually increases in sundarban waters from post monsoon to pre monsoon period and high level of total nitrogen silicate concentration and moderate to low level of total phosphate which invariably determines the community distribution of phytoplankton but the majority of the previous studies on phytoplankton diversity in highly dynamic sundarban ecosystems have been designed and concise upon particular geographic locality manna et al 2010 chaudhury et al 2012 bhattacharjee et al 2013 and apparently the comparative study on phytoplankton community structure encompassing the upper central and lower part of the sundarbans is still scarce hence the present study aimed at evaluating the structural variation of phytoplankton community assemblage and its distribution concerning environmental traits in sundarban waters thus it is expected that the different environmental parameters along the mangrove estuary upper central and lower parts from the north and south have influence on the structure and compositions of the phytoplankton community over a seasonal period 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area for the convenience of our study we tried to choose a few representative sampling stations covering major ecosystems of indian sundarbans stretched from north to south including a sampling station in river hooghly jharkhali jh 22 21ʹ20ʺ n 88 52ʹ49ʺ e in the north central part of the sundarbans receives freshwater run off from two well known rivers namely matla and bidya flanked by large mangrove patches subsequently the study site sandeshkhali sn 22 01ʹ217ʺ n 88 40ʹ37ʺ e was selected for depiction of upper part of the sundarbans which is also surrounded by river icchamati the stations pathar pratima pp 21 46ʹ23ʺ n 88 24ʹ47ʺ e and frazerganj fz 21 59ʹ54ʺ n 88 11ʹ29ʺ e situated in the lower part of the estuary proximity to sea with a higher magnitude of salinity nischintapur ni 22 34ʹ49ʺ n 88 14ʹ19ʺ e was situated on hooghly river and taken for comparison with the above sites though the station near to sea and influenced by intensive tidal impact site ni receives huge freshwater influx from river ganges owing to geographical heterogeneity all these five sampling locations were selected in different salinity gradient from 0 60 ppt sn to 28 5 ppt fr in indian sundarban seasons referred as monsoon from july to october where it experienced maximum rainfall during this period the post monsoon november february period is characterized by negligible rainfall and the pre monsoon march june is dry period with the occasional rains and thunderstorms chaudhuri et al 2012 the map of the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2

whipple 1992 thomas 1997 cox 1996 bellinger and sigee 2010 the recognized algal taxonomic names were reaffirmed at algaebase guiry and guiry 2020 the phytoplankton were classified under class groups taxonomic position according to the algaebase guiry and guiry 2020 the total number of phytoplankton encountered is expressed as org l 1 2 3 statistical analysis the environmental data were normalized by transforming log x 1 except ph prior to analyses the station wise variation in water quality parameters during three seasons monsoon pre monsoon and post monsoon were subjected to repeated measures analysis of variance anova and their means were compared through post hoc duncan s multiple range tests using sas 9 3 sas institute cary nc pearson s correlation 2 tailed between water quality parameters and phytoplankton groups were also computed diversity indices were calculated following the standard formulae of shannon diversity shannon weiner 1949 richness margalef 1958 and evenness index pielou 1977 the graphical representation of k dominance curve was used to investigate the dominance pattern across seasons hierarchical cluster analysis simprof test was performed to obtain the significant clusters and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was carried out to examine the similarity of community structure among samples using bray curtis similarity measures further analysis of similarity anosim was performed to comprehend the significant differences between stations with respect to phytoplankton species composition similarity percentage simper was performed to categorize species responsible for similarity and dissimilarity between the groups the index of multivariate dispersion imd was applied to evaluate the stability changes in the phytoplankton community warwick and clarke 1993 pretreatment of all the biological data was done by square root transformation to achieve the normality of the abundance data to identify and quantify the environmental variables that potentially influenced the phytoplankton community variability bio env biota and or environment matching and the distance based linear model distlm were performed the fitted distlm was visualized using the distance based redundancy analysis constrained ordination dbrda then we obtained the model using the aicc selection criteria and the stepwise selection procedure all these analyses were performed by using primer v 6 0 clarke and gorley 2006 3 results 3 1 water quality parameters different water quality parameters were pooled and analyzed the analyzed data are presented in table 1 there was no significant difference in surface water temperature in between five sampling stations significant difference was observed between lowest and highest values of ph exhibited at sandeshkhali 7 77 0 06 and frazerganj 8 12 0 13 respectively dissolved oxygen content was significantly lower at sandeshkhali 5 27 1 37 ppm and this was in agreement with the negative correlation of do with temperature r 0 59 p 0 05 table 2 total alkalinity of all the stations was found in optimum range and sandeshkhali had significantly higher value 117 11 1 84 ppm as compared to the other stations distinct differences in salinity was observed between lower middle and upper part of sundarbans salinity was highest at farazerganj 24 29 1 73 ppt followed by pathar pratima 23 99 3 28 ppt and differences between those two stations were statistically no significant but these salinity values are significantly different from those obtained at jharkhali 18 18 3 38 ppt in middle part sandeshkhali 10 21 8 79 ppt in upper part as well as nischintapur 2 21 1 31 ppt on river hooghly lowest in relation to the nutrients not much variation was noticed among all five stations however no3 n and po4 p contents were comparatively more in freshwater zones nischintapur and sandeshkhali pathar pratima had the lowest sio4 si concentration 2 87 0 88 ppm and difference was statistically significant from jharkhali sandeshkhali and nischintapur p 0 0001 sandeshkhali and nischintapur had higher sio4 si levels as compared to other three stations and the later had the highest sio4 si concentration 11 73 1 69 ppm this value was very near to worldwide average river water concentration of sio4 si 11 24 ppm or 147 8 93 6 µ moles gems 2002 intra relationship between various water quality parameters is described in table 2 from the matrix it was found that ph was significantly correlated with ta salinity and sio4 si salinity in turn found to have significant negative correlation with nutrient parameters viz po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 dissolved sio4 si and ph were negatively correlated r 0 535 p 0 05 similar observation was made by nirmal kumar et al 2009 and satpathy et al 2011 earlier from coastal regions of india dissolved oxygen was seen significantly negatively correlated with water temperature r 0 593 p 0 05 3 2 phytoplankton community composition and distribution the phytoplankton community comprised of 84 species belonged to 62 genera throughout the study period maximum diversity 29 species was recorded for bacillariophyceae followed by mediophyceae 22 and coscinodiscophyceae 9 cyanophyceae zygnematophyceae and chlorophyceae were represented by 6 species for each group dinophyceae represented by 3 species namely tripos furca peridinium sp and dinophysis sp least species diversity recorded from the group trebouxiophyceae 2 species and ulvophyceae 1 species out of 9 nine major algal groups coscinodiscophyceae contributed maximum 31 followed by bacillariophyceae 29 and mediophyceae 16 fig 2 algal group coscinodiscophyceae exhibited prominence in terms of abundance 2 501 103 1 04 103 org l 1 and bacillariophyceae in diversity maximum species diversity recorded belonged to the genera chaetoceros 6 species out of 62 phytoplankton genera identified 40 genera were diatoms where 18 centrals 30 species and 22 pennales 30 species the widespread occurrences of centric diatoms were coscinodiscus chaetoceros ditylum bacteriastrum melosira odontella cyclotella and planktoniella while pennate diatoms dominated by nitzschia navicula cylindrotheca gyrosigma synedra thalassionema bacillaria and asterionella throughout the study period the occurrence of pennate diatom stenopterobia sigmatella was found to be very common during winter at pathar pratima and frazerganj green algae chlorophyceae largely accounted for by genera microspora oedogonium tetraedron ankistrodesmus and lemmermannia tetrastrum while zygnematophyceae was represented by mougeotia cosmarium closterium staurastrum and gonatozygon the abundance of those genera chiefly accounted for the assemblage at the station nischintapur where freshwater influx was prominent and salinity fluctuated within the range between 0 60 to 4 48 ppt cyanobacteria represented by genera oscillatoria microcystis lyngbya dolichospermum and aphanocapsa found to have higher abundance during monsoon and post monsoon phytoplankton species composition was similar between the stations pathar pratima and frazerganj both the stations showed diverse euryhaline phytoplankton species that belonged to the algal group coscinodiscophyceae bacillariophyceae and mediophyceae the abundance of chlorophyceae and zygnematophyceae were comparatively higher at station nischintapur and sandeshkhali across the seasons might be due to freshwater influx from the river hooghly and icchamati respectively the occurrence of oscillatoria lyngbya and dolichospermum found to be very common in all stations throughout the study period the group wise percentage contributions and phytoplankton recorded in different seasons are shown in fig 3 and table 3 the quantitative spectrum of phytoplankton ranged from 1 024 103 to 13 24 103 org l 1 recorded maximum at frazerganj and minimum at sandeshkhali seasonal abundance revealed maximum during monsoon 3 74 103 to 13 24 103 org l 1 followed by pre monsoon 1 03 103 to 12 06 103 org l 1 and post monsoon 2 42 103 to 7 83 103 org l 1 during post monsoon phytoplankton recorded the highest at sandeshkhali and the lowest at nischintapur whereas it showed maximum at pathar pratima and minimum at nischintapur during pre monsoon shannon weiner index h margalef s richness index d and pielou s evenness index jʹ ranged from 2 78 to 3 18 3 28 to 4 94 0 92 to 0 97 respectively fig 4 the hʹ value was highest at jharkhali during monsoon and lowest at pathar pratima during post monsoon a similar trend was also observed in case of d the higher values of evenness index were observed indicating the uniform distributions of phytoplankton across the stations in the present study the estuary exhibited moderately rich phytoplankton diversity in the system which was evident from the calculated value of d and hʹ 2 78 there was no significant p 0 05 anova variation of diversity indices values spatially and temporally reflecting a more stable system 3 3 species compositional similarity the hierarchical cluster analysis through bray curtis similarity matrix simprof test was performed on the basis of the abundance of phytoplankton to comprehend the similarity between the stations three clusters i e cluster i bottom ii middle and iii top portrayed by red lines in fig 5 were found to be statistically significant p 0 05 with the average similarity of 68 51 66 and 73 7 in groups i ii and iii respectively the species composition in the stations viz pathar pratima during pre monsoon and nischintapur monsoon were distinctively separated from those groups which exhibited 58 8 and 66 5 similarity in the assemblage the maximum similarity 80 15 recorded between the stations jharkhali and nischintapur during post monsoon the grouping of phytoplankton species composition was reaffirmed by the nmds fig 6 and it also reflected the similar pattern of grouping among the samples as observed in the cluster analysis a total of 60 similarity could be found in the samples of each season and showed a distant separation among the seasonal phytoplankton assemblage on the whole the species composition exhibited 40 similarity throughout the study period the nmds with the stress value of 0 11 is reasonably a good value for the sample grouping results of anosim showed that there were significant global r 0 062 p 0 2 spatial differences of phytoplankton species composition on the whole indicating a meager variation in the community assemblage only three scenarios jh and ni sn and ni pp and ni had significant differences between them however the other scenarios jh and sn jh and pp jh and fr sn and pp sn and fr pp and fr fr and ni did not differ significantly from each other pair wise test the phytoplankton community also illustrated the significant temporal variation with the modest r value 0 345 p 0 1 the cumulative dominance curve k dominance reflected that the species abundance was unambiguously more diverse during pre monsoon than the other seasons nevertheless the species abundance did not exhibit any differences during monsoon and post monsoon depicted similar phytoplankton dominance pattern the index of multivariate dispersion imd values were compared between the stations and the average dispersion value of 0 431 indicated an increase in the community variability stability during the study period the consistent negative value between the stations pair wise implies that there was an increase in intra annual dispersion of phytoplankton community however the only contrasting scenario had been observed between the stations sandeshkhali and frazerganj simper routine analyses based on the phytoplankton community estimates at different sites identified the discriminator species primarily accounting for the assemblage differences between the groups the average dissimilarity percentage was varying from 47 11 to 56 80 with the highest percentage found to be between group i and iii genera coscinodiscus 11 74 fragilaria 9 34 thalassiosira 6 27 asterionella 6 12 synedra 4 33 chaetoceros 4 28 cymbella 3 95 pleurosigma 3 92 gyrosigma 3 62 nitzschia 3 27 skeletonema 3 03 and odontella 3 were the major contributors to form that group the lowest dissimilarity 47 11 recorded between the group ii and iii with the order of percentage contribution viz oscillatoria 6 79 fragilaria 6 63 coscinodiscus 6 57 asterionella 6 45 nitzschia 4 80 chaetoceros 4 53 gyrosigma 4 48 thalassiosira 3 99 synedra 3 75 skeletonema 3 56 and dytilum 3 25 similarly the maximum average similarity 68 26 had been recorded in the group ii where coscinodiscus 30 4 was the chief contributor followed by oscillatoria 14 6 nitzschia 6 71 navicula 5 54 synedra 5 08 cyclotella 4 23 fragilaria 3 37 and thalassiosira 3 07 concurrently coscinodiscus 14 42 again found to be top contributor followed by chaetoceros 11 89 in the group i with the average similarity of 50 51 3 4 influence of environmental traits on phytoplankton distribution the correlation coefficient values between the water quality variables and the algal groups are shown in table 2 coscinodiscophyceae was positively correlated with transparency r 0 529 p 0 05 ph r 0 501 and salinity r 0 473 while negatively correlated with temp r 0 183 ta r 0 234 and no3 n r 0 208 similarly bacillariophyceae had positive correlation with ph r 0 406 do r 0 260 salinity r 0 276 and sio4 si r 0 434 while negative correlation with ta r 0 160 no3 n r 0 125 and so4 2 r 0 110 cyanophyceae exhibited significant positive correlation with ta r 0 531 p 0 05 while negative correlation with ph r 0 295 and do r 0 472 on the whole total phytoplankton exhibited significant positive correlation with temp r 0 621 p 0 05 and salinity r 0 523 p 0 05 and negative correlation with ta r 0 185 and sio4 si r 0 352 the majority of the algal groups exhibited positive correlation between them implies there were close association between them and those algae coexisted in the community structure fig 7 shows the nmds plot drawn based on phytoplankton abundance with superimposed value of nutrient parameters no3 n po4 p sio4 si and ta in different stations two methods were employed to explore the relationships between environmental traits and biological data bio env analysis employing spearman rank correlation method revealed that the water quality parameters viz water temperature ph ta po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 were correlated with the phytoplankton community table 4 the maximum correlation value obtained between phytoplankton and the individual environmental variable was the combination of temp and so4 2 ρ 0 250 in contrast the lowest correlation coefficient ρ 0 239 recorded among the combinations of temp po4 p and so4 2 to quantify the additional explained variables marginal tests distance based linear model distlm was performed to obtain a significant correlation between the phytoplankton and each of the environmental variables results showed that the significant correlation p 0 05 had been observed with the variables of temp ta salinity po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 furthermore the sequential tests also revealed the significant correlation p 0 05 with the variables temp ph salinity and po4 p the distlm step wise selection explained that two environmental variables viz po4 p p 0 001 and ta p 0 011 were the deterministic parameters those could explain the phytoplankton community compositions in the studied stations tables 5 and 6 the model explained 89 total variation in the axis 1 and 11 in axis 2 4 discussion 4 1 community structure and biodiversity the alterations of habitat quality traits are responsible for unhealthy variation in water quality parameters which eventually temporally and spatially influences the population of aquatic flora and fauna phytoplankton underpinning aquatic food pyramid is the worst victim of such altered habitat parameters these pervasive influences become more prominent in the highly complex systems like the indian sundarbans bhattacharjee et al 2013 stated that the growth of cyanophyceae during monsoon and post monsoon seasons are mainly driven by the heavy loads of nutrients in the estuary which in turn boost up the succession of this particular group of algae with respect to others the authors documented the high abundance of cyanophyceae phormidium sp oscillatoria sp synechoccus sp during precipitation and post precipitation period from the chemaguri creek sagar island the present study showed the dominance of diatoms during the pre monsoon and post monsoon which conforms to the findings of manna et al 2010 and rahman et al 2013 banerjee and santra 1999 reported 48 species of diatoms from the sundarban estuarine system 64 phytoplankton taxa from the north western part jharkhali island of sundarbans manna et al 2010 and 52 genera of phytoplankton 10 µm from the chemaguri creek reported by bhattacharjee et al 2013 recently roshith et al 2018 reported 91 species of phytoplankton taxa distributed under 41 species of green algae followed by diatoms 34 and cyanophytes 16 from hooghly river this observation was restricted to the tidal stretch of the estuary encompassing 168 9 km from nabadwip to godakhali furthermore the authors presented a review on phytoplankton community structure in the hooghly matla estuarine system concerning eco climatic variability which could be a parsimonious checklist of the phytoplankton diversity in the system enlisted 378 defined species rahman et al 2013 reported 134 species of phytoplankton from the sudarban eco region bangladesh which was higher phytoplankton diversity compared to the present observation in indian sundarbans twenty one genera of centric and 19 genera of pennate diatoms were reported from chemaguri creek and mooriganga river estuary with the maximum count of total phytoplankton during pre monsoon and minimum during monsoon bhattacharjee et al 2013 the present study showed the inverse scenario with the maximum abundance of total phytoplankton during monsoon season this could be attributed to the presence of more freshwater dominated euryhaline species of bacillariophyceae cyanophyceae and mediophyceae roshith et al 2018 also opined that most of the phytoplankton taxa in the estuarine tidal zone have their origin from the ganges river system and got introduced into the estuary due to increased freshwater influx on the whole our study also depicted a bimodal pattern of phytoplankton abundance with a peak during monsoon and other maxima during pre monsoon happened to be a subtle variation in phytoplankton abundance between these two seasons the stated trend was in contrast to the observations made by sarkar 2011 chowdhury et al 2012 and bhattacharjee al 2013 but agreed with these workers with reference to the pre monsoon maxima gogoi et al 2019 have given a seasonal spectrum of phytoplankton from the upper part of the sundarbans with maximum cellular density during pre monsoon 4 32 103 cells l 1 as compared to rest of the seasons chowdhury et al 2012 have also affirmed similar observation that an inter annual kinetics of phytoplankton from the western part of matla estuary with winter peaks 0 38 105 cells l 1 of these microfloral communities when compared to monsoon 0 13 105 cells l 1 during monsoon though it characterized by heavy precipitation and varying hydrological conditions in the study area the allochthonous nutrients received from the land run off and rivers might have induced for succession of phytoplankton coupled with the riverine source of more freshwater dominated euryhaline species in addition the occurrence of solitary phytoplankton taxa non chain forming diatoms in our samples were also contributed extensively to the total phytoplankton assemblage this was corroborated to the findings of bhattacharjee et al 2013 and mandal 2003 the authors ascribed that the non chain forming diatom taxa such as coscinodiscus and cyclotella were proficient of tolerating variable hydrological conditions sekh et al 2016 also had witnessed the presence of two dominant species coscinodiscus argus and c centralis during monsoon season from bidya river in northern part of sundarbans community structure in the present study was in conformity with the vajravelu et al 2017 and choudhury and pal 2008 that speculated higher species compositions during pre monsoon compared to the other seasons the k dominance curve also depicted similar results with the diverse phytoplankton abundance during pre monsoon the gradual increase in the abundance of cyanophyceae and dinophyceae during post monsoon might be due to rich nutrients received from land run off which was in line with manna et al 2010 as such the author reported that higher establishment of species like cyanophyceae and dinophyceae during winter coupled with high nutrient input in the estuarine water in the present study the higher abundance of toxic dinoflagellates dinophysis spp and cyanophyceae such as dolichospermum oscillatoria klisch and häder 2008 during winter indicated poor water quality simper analysis also revealed that between cluster ii and iii oscillatoria was the top contributor to the total phytoplankton count with the maximum similarity of 53 the assemblage composition of phytoplankton is affected by habitat variability li et al 2014 the significant spatio temporal variation of phytoplankton density in the present study corroborated with the findings of de et al 1994 and choudhury and pal 2010 moreover the resemblance of community compositions observed between pathar pratima and frazerganj lower part could be attributed to the geographical proximity between the stations and similar magnitude of salinity throughout the study period simultaneously the community assemblages between pathar pratima and nischintapur showed the maximum dissimilarity which could be related to its geographical heterogeneity as samples from nischintapur were at the hooghly river with the high tidal impact freshwater influx and pathar pratima near the sea mouth high value of diversity index represents the healthy ecosystem manna et al 2010 the evenness index ranged from 0 92 to 0 97 that implied the uniform distribution of phytoplankton across the sampling locations the calculated value of d and hʹ 2 78 indicating moderately rich phytoplankton diversity in the estuary similarly imd also indicated the hefty community variability across the sampling locations throughout the study period with the dispersion value 0 431 4 2 correlation between assemblage pattern and environmental traits growth and physiological functions in phytoplankters are governed by physico chemical traits haldna et al 2008 and thus a significant positive correlation between temperature and total phytoplankton abundance was seen in the present study coscinodiscophyceae has had a significant positive correlation with the transparency and inversely correlated to water temperature the findings at par with the observations of gogoi et al 2019 that speculated majority of the algal groups had negative affinity towards the water turbidity in the kailash khal sundarbans the increased temperature resulted in higher fractions of cyanophyceae in phytoplankton community however green algae and diatoms perform better in lower temperature sarkar and naskar 2002 schabhuttl et al 2013 our results also found consistent to these workers that the cyanophyceae had more gradient towards temperature and total alkalinity similarly the negligible correlation between the bacillariophyceae and water temperature in sundarban waters also supports the previous statement the multivariate analysis bio env depicted that water parameters viz temp ph ta and nutrients such as po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 were the controlling factors for abundance and distribution of phytoplankton community in the study area the higher numerical abundance of phytoplankton coincides with the occurrence of low tides in sundarbans previously reported by aziz et al 2012 moreover the inter relationship of phytoplankton communities with the environmental factors in sundarbans estuarine region has also been described by many researchers mitra et al 2012 biswas et al 2009 choudhury and pal 2012 while understanding the complex interaction of the sundarban ecosystem chakraborti et al 2020 have disclosed that distance from the sea is the prime parameter controlling the estuarine system s phytoplankton density by employing random forest rf algorithm the authors also classified the nutrients po4 p and no3 n as the secondary important dominating factor after the surface salinity which plays a pivotal role in controlling the phytoplankton population in estuaries our results were also in agreement with the former and found to have statistically significant positive correlation between salinity and total phytoplankton bacillariophyceae also depicted close affinity with the salinity and sio4 si in the present study the ascendency of coscinodiscophyceae coincides with the salinity rise in sundarbans which was consistent with the findings of gogoi et al 2019 the nutrient availability in the system influenced the successions of phytoplankton hai et al 2010 greatly with increases in no3 n and po4 p potentially stimulating the production of phytoplankton biomass yunev et al 2012 in our study po4 p has had more gradients towards the total phytoplankton dissolved sio4 si enriches the growth of the diatoms blanchard 1988 higher concentrations of sio4 si were estimated in all the sampling locations irrespective of seasons that might have supported the ascendency of diatoms throughout the study period according to kaplan et al 1963 the mangrove ecosystem is rich in sulphur and our study also recorded higher dissolved so4 2 concentration in lower and middle sundarbans that could be due to the presence of large mangrove patches it is known that algae assimilate sulfur as sulphate and their uptake is highly regulated in algae and plants davies and grossman 1998 despite little known about the cellular sulfur metabolism in algae some biochemical and genetic evidence for regulation of sulfur uptake in algae is available like freshwater algae chlamydomonas giordano et al 2005 ratti et al 2011 illustrated the influential pattern of so4 2 on the cyanobacterium synechoccus spp green algae tetraselmis suecica and three algae containing chlorophyll a c thalassiosira weissflogii protoceratium reticulatum and the coccolithophorid emiliania huxleyi in a laboratory experiment from their observation the authors surmised that the increased so4 2 may have facilitated the expansion of phytoplankton those containing chlorophyll a c but not the exclusion of other biological and environmental factors the present study showed that water parameters such as temp ta salinity po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 were the deterministic parameters influencing the distribution of phytoplankton in sundarban waters which was evident from the both bio env and marginal test furthermore the distlm explained two variables viz po4 p and ta were the controlling variables that could explain the phytoplankton community compositions other than environmental parameter anthropogenic parameters are also equally responsible for the alteration of phytoplankton assemblage pattern in indian sundarban mega delta 5 conclusion the phytoplankton profile and their spatio temporal dynamics at various geographical locations of the sundarban eco region stands unique in providing a comprehensive information on the status of the ecological interaction with certain phytoplankton groups impacted due to gradual increase of anthropogenic load water quality parameters such as temperature ta salinity po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 were found to have deterministic influence on the distribution abundance and diversity of phytoplankton in indian sundarbans more specifically among these variables our linear model distlm exhibited two water variables viz po4 p and ta were the primary controlling factors that could explain the phytoplankton community compositions in the region the inflow of phosphorus and calcium rich minerals and fertilizers agri wash through run off in this deltaic estuarine water is the key component triggering towards a nutrient rich eutrophic condition and henceforth responsible for seasonal bloom of phytoplankton as evident in sundarban waters hence a plausible management guideline is need of the hour for controlling the point and non point sources of mixing of anthropogenic nutrient load in the region this may be done by modifying agricultural like placement of phosphatic fertilizers to avoid run off losses and other allied activities which will lead to a sustainable healthy aquatic ecosystem with the inherent biota overall our study encompasses representative sites from lower middle and upper parts of the indian sundarbans thus the information generated on the interrelationship between phytoplankton assemblage and environmental factors in this well known estuarine zone would be immensely helpful in dignifying the relative stability of these organisms and also aid to further research the limitations of the existing scientific knowledge on the role of so4 2 in phytoplankton dynamics coupled with its importance pointed in the statistical analysis highlighted a possible research gap on the phytoplankton species specific sulfur uptake in the highly

the dispersion value of 0 431 keywords phytoplankton diversity assemblage environmental parameters sundarbans 1 introduction primary producers hold the key to production function of an aquatic ecosystem and thus draw attention of researchers as an indicator in assessing ecosystem s health the estuaries and adjacent coastal waters are said to be among the most highly fecund ecosystems in the world day et al 1989 these transition zones estuaries are characterized by the mixing of nutrient enriched freshwater with the relatively nutrient poor sea waters quinlan and phlips 2007 this phenomenon is responsible for changes of various physical and chemical gradients of the estuarine environment which greatly influences the spatio temporal variations abundance and functional characteristics of the estuarine biota mc lusky and elliot 2004 as a primary producer phytoplankton forms the basis of the trophic food chain and these communities are said to be responsible for half of the total estuarine primary production soria píriz et al 2017 mangrove associated estuaries in particular are considered as productive zones where phytoplankton may play a pivotal role in such productivity and its production varies significantly due to its dynamicity rahman et al 2013 previous studies revealed that the changes of hydrographical conditions coupled with seasonal precipitations were the controlling factors for the succession of phytoplankton in the estuarine system biswas et al 2009 similarly hilaluddin et al 2020 suggested that transparency and the related parameters turbidity and total solids coupled with availability of nutrients were the major factors in driving the phytoplankton community structure in the mangrove estuaries according to seitzinger et al 2002 estuaries provide bio available dissolved nutrients from natural and anthropogenic sources accumulated through the drainage system to serve its residents the most diversified group of phytoplankton of varying size and morphology from freshwater to euryhaline origin in estuaries phytoplankters are greatly influenced by tidal regime and seasonal freshwater runoff which also greatly affect water column stability residence time light and nutrient availability badylak et al 2016 thus the phytoplankton succession and the species traits may differ considerably in response to the highly dynamic natures of the estuarine environment costa santana et al 2017 according to cloern et al 2014 their responses towards this dynamicity generally falls into two categories i phytoplankton growth rate regulated by light temperature and nutrients and ii mortality that includes grazing pressure and cell lysis induced by viral infections and washout from the system during events of high river flow and sinking the influence of vertical mixing on phytoplankton assemblage biomass and productivity has become an essential subject in present days and thus concern to the researchers and aquatic ecologists the sundarbans the largest deltaic mangrove forest in the world lies at an ecologically important ecotone of hooghly matlah estuarine system in the ganga brahmaputra river basin occupying a territory of india and bangladesh sundarbans was declared as a world heritage site by international union for conservation and nature in 1987 and included as biosphere reserve under united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco man and the biosphere mab programme list 2001 it covers an area of 10 200 sq km of which 4 200 sq km of reserve forest is located in india which also entails within its geographical limits several low lying tides influenced coastal wetlands these wetlands are frequently exposed to differential salinity regime resulting into misbalance in the intracellular osmo regulatory mechanism in many phytoplankton species mitra et al 2012 the region receives an annual rainfall of about 1600 1800 mm and has witnessed several extreme climatic events like tsunamis and cyclonic storms in our understanding stress on aquatic ecosystem results in physical chemical or biological alterations of the environment which may lead to reduction in biodiversity there is a multitude of factors that offers stress on biotic compartments of an ecosystem and the response change in the community structure would be a resultant of degree and frequency of stress factors acting over the community resilience the sundarbans suffered from environmental degradation due to human encroachment deforestation tourism and the rapid growth of agriculture and aquaculture activities sarkar and bhattacharya 2003 eutrophication is another factor controlling the temporal succession of autotrophic and heterotrophic communities in sundarban ecosystem and its associated wetlands chaudhuri et al 2012 besides large container vessels across international ports utilized the estuarine stretch of indian sundarbans as navigational routes through waterways the navigation also imposes tremendous anthropogenic stress generated from the movement of barge propeller imposing detrimental effects of the aquatic food chain das sarkar et al 2019 therefore owing to human induced pressures most coastal waters would unable to maintain system specific stable state or a good ecological state berthold et al 2018 at the same time the sundarbans ecosystem has exceedingly become fragile resulting in dwindling state of floral and faunal diversity and thus this system receives prior attention of the conservationists to formulate restoration strategies sarkar and naskar 2010 several studies had been conducted on hydrology and phytoplankton community structure from indian sundarban waters by de and choudhury 1991 de et al 1994 biswas et al 2009 manna et al 2010 dey et al 2012 and chowdhury et al 2012 the zone being influenced by aggressive tidal action affects the regular variations in values of water quality parameters in the region salinity plays a critical role in deciding the distribution of phytoplankton chaudhury et al 2012 reported that salinity level gradually increases in sundarban waters from post monsoon to pre monsoon period and high level of total nitrogen silicate concentration and moderate to low level of total phosphate which invariably determines the community distribution of phytoplankton but the majority of the previous studies on phytoplankton diversity in highly dynamic sundarban ecosystems have been designed and concise upon particular geographic locality manna et al 2010 chaudhury et al 2012 bhattacharjee et al 2013 and apparently the comparative study on phytoplankton community structure encompassing the upper central and lower part of the sundarbans is still scarce hence the present study aimed at evaluating the structural variation of phytoplankton community assemblage and its distribution concerning environmental traits in sundarban waters thus it is expected that the different environmental parameters along the mangrove estuary upper central and lower parts from the north and south have influence on the structure and compositions of the phytoplankton community over a seasonal period 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area for the convenience of our study we tried to choose a few representative sampling stations covering major ecosystems of indian sundarbans stretched from north to south including a sampling station in river hooghly jharkhali jh 22 21ʹ20ʺ n 88 52ʹ49ʺ e in the north central part of the sundarbans receives freshwater run off from two well known rivers namely matla and bidya flanked by large mangrove patches subsequently the study site sandeshkhali sn 22 01ʹ217ʺ n 88 40ʹ37ʺ e was selected for depiction of upper part of the sundarbans which is also surrounded by river icchamati the stations pathar pratima pp 21 46ʹ23ʺ n 88 24ʹ47ʺ e and frazerganj fz 21 59ʹ54ʺ n 88 11ʹ29ʺ e situated in the lower part of the estuary proximity to sea with a higher magnitude of salinity nischintapur ni 22 34ʹ49ʺ n 88 14ʹ19ʺ e was situated on hooghly river and taken for comparison with the above sites though the station near to sea and influenced by intensive tidal impact site ni receives huge freshwater influx from river ganges owing to geographical heterogeneity all these five sampling locations were selected in different salinity gradient from 0 60 ppt sn to 28 5 ppt fr in indian sundarban seasons referred as monsoon from july to october where it experienced maximum rainfall during this period the post monsoon november february period is characterized by negligible rainfall and the pre monsoon march june is dry period with the occasional rains and thunderstorms chaudhuri et al 2012 the map of the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 sampling methodology samples were collected once in every two months from the selected locations during april 2014 to december 2016 water temperature temp ph transparency sd were measured in situ using thermometer p 601466 digital ph meter hanna instrument and secchi disc strickland and parsons 1972 respectively dissolved oxygen do salinity and total alkalinity ta were also determined in situ by standard titrimetric methods apha 2012 subsurface water samples 0 5 m depth were collected at all selected locations by using standard water sampler based on design of ruttner water sampler das sarkar et al 2019 and immediately transferred in to pre rinsed polyethylene bottles 1 l water samples were brought to the laboratory in cold conditions for analysis of nutrients no3 n po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 and analyzed by following standard recommendations and methods described in apha 2012 for phytoplankton community structure study water samples were collected by filtering 20 µm mesh size silk bolting cloth 50 l sub surface water from the sampling locations the concentrated samples were preserved in 4 buffered formalin quantitative analysis of phytoplankton was done sedgwick rafter cell method by employing trinocular microscope nikon eclipse 50i and identified up to genus or species level wherever possible based on standard taxonomic identification keys prescott 1962 ward and whipple 1992 thomas 1997 cox 1996 bellinger and sigee 2010 the recognized algal taxonomic names were reaffirmed at algaebase guiry and guiry 2020 the phytoplankton were classified under class groups taxonomic position according to the algaebase guiry and guiry 2020 the total number of phytoplankton encountered is expressed as org l 1 2 3 statistical analysis the environmental data were normalized by transforming log x 1 except ph prior to analyses the station wise variation in water quality parameters during three seasons monsoon pre monsoon and post monsoon were subjected to repeated measures analysis of variance anova and their means were compared through post hoc duncan s multiple range tests using sas 9 3 sas institute cary nc pearson s correlation 2 tailed between water quality parameters and phytoplankton groups were also computed diversity indices were calculated following the standard formulae of shannon diversity shannon weiner 1949 richness margalef 1958 and evenness index pielou 1977 the graphical representation of k dominance curve was used to investigate the dominance pattern across seasons hierarchical cluster analysis simprof test was performed to obtain the significant clusters and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was carried out to examine the similarity of community structure among samples using bray curtis similarity measures further analysis of similarity anosim was performed to comprehend the significant differences between stations with respect to phytoplankton species composition similarity percentage simper was performed to categorize species responsible for similarity and dissimilarity between the groups the index of multivariate dispersion imd was applied to evaluate the stability changes in the phytoplankton community warwick and clarke 1993 pretreatment of all the biological data was done by square root transformation to achieve the normality of the abundance data to identify and quantify the environmental variables that potentially influenced the phytoplankton community variability bio env biota and or environment matching and the distance based linear model distlm were performed the fitted distlm was visualized using the distance based redundancy analysis constrained ordination dbrda then we obtained the model using the aicc selection criteria and the stepwise selection procedure all these analyses were performed by using primer v 6 0 clarke and gorley 2006 3 results 3 1 water quality parameters different water quality parameters were pooled and analyzed the analyzed data are presented in table 1 there was no significant difference in surface water temperature in between five sampling stations significant difference was observed between lowest and highest values of ph exhibited at sandeshkhali 7 77 0 06 and frazerganj 8 12 0 13 respectively dissolved oxygen content was significantly lower at sandeshkhali 5 27 1 37 ppm and this was in agreement with the negative correlation of do with temperature r 0 59 p 0 05 table 2 total alkalinity of all the stations was found in optimum range and sandeshkhali had significantly higher value 117 11 1 84 ppm as compared to the other stations distinct differences in salinity was observed between lower middle and upper part of sundarbans salinity was highest at farazerganj 24 29 1 73 ppt followed by pathar pratima 23 99 3 28 ppt and differences between those two stations were statistically no significant but these salinity values are significantly different from those obtained at jharkhali 18 18 3 38 ppt in middle part sandeshkhali 10 21 8 79 ppt in upper part as well as nischintapur 2 21 1 31 ppt on river hooghly lowest in relation to the nutrients not much variation was noticed among all five stations however no3 n and po4 p contents were comparatively more in freshwater zones nischintapur and sandeshkhali pathar pratima had the lowest sio4 si concentration 2 87 0 88 ppm and difference was statistically significant from jharkhali sandeshkhali and nischintapur p 0 0001 sandeshkhali and nischintapur had higher sio4 si levels as compared to other three stations and the later had the highest sio4 si concentration 11 73 1 69 ppm this value was very near to worldwide average river water concentration of sio4 si 11 24 ppm or 147 8 93 6 µ moles gems 2002 intra relationship between various water quality parameters is described in table 2 from the matrix it was found that ph was significantly correlated with ta salinity and sio4 si salinity in turn found to have significant negative correlation with nutrient parameters viz po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 dissolved sio4 si and ph were negatively correlated r 0 535 p 0 05 similar observation was made by nirmal kumar et al 2009 and satpathy et al 2011 earlier from coastal regions of india dissolved oxygen was seen significantly negatively correlated with water temperature r 0 593 p 0 05 3 2 phytoplankton community composition and distribution the phytoplankton community comprised of 84 species belonged to 62 genera throughout the study period maximum diversity 29 species was recorded for bacillariophyceae followed by mediophyceae 22 and coscinodiscophyceae 9 cyanophyceae zygnematophyceae and chlorophyceae were represented by 6 species for each group dinophyceae represented by 3 species namely tripos furca peridinium sp and dinophysis sp least species diversity recorded from the group trebouxiophyceae 2 species and ulvophyceae 1 species out of 9 nine major algal groups coscinodiscophyceae contributed maximum 31 followed by bacillariophyceae 29 and mediophyceae 16 fig 2 algal group coscinodiscophyceae exhibited prominence in terms of abundance 2 501 103 1 04 103 org l 1 and bacillariophyceae in diversity maximum species diversity recorded belonged to the genera chaetoceros 6 species out of 62 phytoplankton genera identified 40 genera were diatoms where 18 centrals 30 species and 22 pennales 30 species the widespread occurrences of centric diatoms were coscinodiscus chaetoceros ditylum bacteriastrum melosira odontella cyclotella and planktoniella while pennate diatoms dominated by nitzschia navicula cylindrotheca gyrosigma synedra thalassionema bacillaria and asterionella throughout the study period the occurrence of pennate diatom stenopterobia sigmatella was found to be very common during winter at pathar pratima and frazerganj green algae chlorophyceae largely accounted for by genera microspora oedogonium tetraedron ankistrodesmus and lemmermannia tetrastrum while zygnematophyceae was represented by mougeotia cosmarium closterium staurastrum and gonatozygon the abundance of those genera chiefly accounted for the assemblage at the station nischintapur where freshwater influx was prominent and salinity fluctuated within the range between 0 60 to 4 48 ppt cyanobacteria represented by genera oscillatoria microcystis lyngbya dolichospermum and aphanocapsa found to have higher abundance during monsoon and post monsoon phytoplankton species composition was similar between the stations pathar pratima and frazerganj both the stations showed diverse euryhaline phytoplankton species that belonged to the algal group coscinodiscophyceae bacillariophyceae and mediophyceae the abundance of chlorophyceae and zygnematophyceae were comparatively higher at station nischintapur and sandeshkhali across the seasons might be due to freshwater influx from the river hooghly and icchamati respectively the occurrence of oscillatoria lyngbya and dolichospermum found to be very common in all stations throughout the study period the group wise percentage contributions and phytoplankton recorded in different seasons are shown in fig 3 and table 3 the quantitative spectrum of phytoplankton ranged from 1 024 103 to 13 24 103 org l 1 recorded maximum at frazerganj and minimum at sandeshkhali seasonal abundance revealed maximum during monsoon 3 74 103 to 13 24 103 org l 1 followed by pre monsoon 1 03 103 to 12 06 103 org l 1 and post monsoon 2 42 103 to 7 83 103 org l 1 during post monsoon phytoplankton recorded the highest at sandeshkhali and the lowest at nischintapur whereas it showed maximum at pathar pratima and minimum at nischintapur during pre monsoon shannon weiner index h margalef s richness index d and pielou s evenness index jʹ ranged from 2 78 to 3 18 3 28 to 4 94 0 92 to 0 97 respectively fig 4 the hʹ value was highest at jharkhali during monsoon and lowest at pathar pratima during post monsoon a similar trend was also observed in case of d the higher values of evenness index were observed indicating the uniform distributions of phytoplankton across the stations in the present study the estuary exhibited moderately rich phytoplankton diversity in the system which was evident from the calculated value of d and hʹ 2 78 there was no significant p 0 05 anova variation of diversity indices values spatially and temporally reflecting a more stable system 3 3 species compositional similarity the hierarchical cluster analysis through bray curtis similarity matrix simprof test was performed on the basis of the abundance of phytoplankton to comprehend the similarity between the stations three clusters i e cluster i bottom ii middle and iii top portrayed by red lines in fig 5 were found to be statistically significant p 0 05 with the average similarity of 68 51 66 and 73 7 in groups i ii and iii respectively the species composition in the stations viz pathar pratima during pre monsoon and nischintapur monsoon were distinctively separated from those groups which exhibited 58 8 and 66 5 similarity in the assemblage the maximum similarity 80 15 recorded between the stations jharkhali and nischintapur during post monsoon the grouping of phytoplankton species composition was reaffirmed by the nmds fig 6 and it also reflected the similar pattern of grouping among the samples as observed in the cluster analysis a total of 60 similarity could be found in the samples of each season and showed a distant separation among the seasonal phytoplankton assemblage on the whole the species composition exhibited 40 similarity throughout the study period the nmds with the stress value of 0 11 is reasonably a good value for the sample grouping results of anosim showed that there were significant global r 0 062 p 0 2 spatial differences of phytoplankton species composition on the whole indicating a meager variation in the community assemblage only three scenarios jh and ni sn and ni pp and ni had significant differences between them however the other scenarios jh and sn jh and pp jh and fr sn and pp sn and fr pp and fr fr and ni did not differ significantly from each other pair wise test the phytoplankton community also illustrated the significant temporal variation with the modest r value 0 345 p 0 1 the cumulative dominance curve k dominance reflected that the species abundance was unambiguously more diverse during pre monsoon than the other seasons nevertheless the species abundance did not exhibit any differences during monsoon and post monsoon depicted similar phytoplankton dominance pattern the index of multivariate dispersion imd values were compared between the stations and the average dispersion value of 0 431 indicated an increase in the community variability stability during the study period the consistent negative value between the stations pair wise implies that there was an increase in intra annual dispersion of phytoplankton community however the only contrasting scenario had been observed between the stations sandeshkhali and frazerganj simper routine analyses based on the phytoplankton community estimates at different sites identified the discriminator species primarily accounting for the assemblage differences between the groups the average dissimilarity percentage was varying from 47 11 to 56 80 with the highest percentage found to be between group i and iii genera coscinodiscus 11 74 fragilaria 9 34 thalassiosira 6 27 asterionella 6 12 synedra 4 33 chaetoceros 4 28 cymbella 3 95 pleurosigma 3 92 gyrosigma 3 62 nitzschia 3 27 skeletonema 3 03 and odontella 3 were the major contributors to form that group the lowest dissimilarity 47 11 recorded between the group ii and iii with the order of percentage contribution viz oscillatoria 6 79 fragilaria 6 63 coscinodiscus 6 57 asterionella 6 45 nitzschia 4 80 chaetoceros 4 53 gyrosigma 4 48 thalassiosira 3 99 synedra 3 75 skeletonema 3 56 and dytilum 3 25 similarly the maximum average similarity 68 26 had been recorded in the group ii where coscinodiscus 30 4 was the chief contributor followed by oscillatoria 14 6 nitzschia 6 71 navicula 5 54 synedra 5 08 cyclotella 4 23 fragilaria 3 37 and thalassiosira 3 07 concurrently coscinodiscus 14 42 again found to be top contributor followed by chaetoceros 11 89 in the group i with the average similarity of 50 51 3 4 influence of environmental traits on phytoplankton distribution the correlation coefficient values between the water quality variables and the algal groups are shown in table 2 coscinodiscophyceae was positively correlated with transparency r 0 529 p 0 05 ph r 0 501 and salinity r 0 473 while negatively correlated with temp r 0 183 ta r 0 234 and no3 n r 0 208 similarly bacillariophyceae had positive correlation with ph r 0 406 do r 0 260 salinity r 0 276 and sio4 si r 0 434 while negative correlation with ta r 0 160 no3 n r 0 125 and so4 2 r 0 110 cyanophyceae exhibited significant positive correlation with ta r 0 531 p 0 05 while negative correlation with ph r 0 295 and do r 0 472 on the whole total phytoplankton exhibited significant positive correlation with temp r 0 621 p 0 05 and salinity r 0 523 p 0 05 and negative correlation with ta r 0 185 and sio4 si r 0 352 the majority of the algal groups exhibited positive correlation between them implies there were close association between them and those algae coexisted in the community structure fig 7 shows the nmds plot drawn based on phytoplankton abundance with superimposed value of nutrient parameters no3 n po4 p sio4 si and ta in different stations two methods were employed to explore the relationships between environmental traits and biological data bio env analysis employing spearman rank correlation method revealed that the water quality parameters viz water temperature ph ta po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 were correlated with the phytoplankton community table 4 the maximum correlation value obtained between phytoplankton and the individual environmental variable was the combination of temp and so4 2 ρ 0 250 in contrast the lowest correlation coefficient ρ 0 239 recorded among the combinations of temp po4 p and so4 2 to quantify the additional explained variables marginal tests distance based linear model distlm was performed to obtain a significant correlation between the phytoplankton and each of the environmental variables results showed that the significant correlation p 0 05 had been observed with the variables of temp ta salinity po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 furthermore the sequential tests also revealed the significant correlation p 0 05 with the variables temp ph salinity and po4 p the distlm step wise selection explained that two environmental variables viz po4 p p 0 001 and ta p 0 011 were the deterministic parameters those could explain the phytoplankton community compositions in the studied stations tables 5 and 6 the model explained 89 total variation in the axis 1 and 11 in axis 2 4 discussion 4 1 community structure and biodiversity the alterations of habitat quality traits are responsible for unhealthy variation in water quality parameters which eventually temporally and spatially influences the population of aquatic flora and fauna phytoplankton underpinning aquatic food pyramid is the worst victim of such altered habitat parameters these pervasive influences become more prominent in the highly complex systems like the indian sundarbans bhattacharjee et al 2013 stated that the growth of cyanophyceae during monsoon and post monsoon seasons are mainly driven by the heavy loads of nutrients in the estuary which in turn boost up the succession of this particular group of algae with respect to others the authors documented the high abundance of cyanophyceae phormidium sp oscillatoria sp synechoccus sp during precipitation and post precipitation period from the chemaguri creek sagar island the present study showed the dominance of diatoms during the pre monsoon and post monsoon which conforms to the findings of manna et al 2010 and rahman et al 2013 banerjee and santra 1999 reported 48 species of diatoms from the sundarban estuarine system 64 phytoplankton taxa from the north western part jharkhali island of sundarbans manna et al 2010 and 52 genera of phytoplankton 10 µm from the chemaguri creek reported by bhattacharjee et al 2013 recently roshith et al 2018 reported 91 species of phytoplankton taxa distributed under 41 species of green algae followed by diatoms 34 and cyanophytes 16 from hooghly river this observation was restricted to the tidal stretch of the estuary encompassing 168 9 km from nabadwip to godakhali furthermore the authors presented a review on phytoplankton community structure in the hooghly matla estuarine system concerning eco climatic variability which could be a parsimonious checklist of the phytoplankton diversity in the system enlisted 378 defined species rahman et al 2013 reported 134 species of phytoplankton from the sudarban eco region bangladesh which was higher phytoplankton diversity compared to the present observation in indian sundarbans twenty one genera of centric and 19 genera of pennate diatoms were reported from chemaguri creek and mooriganga river estuary with the maximum count of total phytoplankton during pre monsoon and minimum during monsoon bhattacharjee et al 2013 the present study showed the inverse scenario with the maximum abundance of total phytoplankton during monsoon season this could be attributed to the presence of more freshwater dominated euryhaline species of bacillariophyceae cyanophyceae and mediophyceae roshith et al 2018 also opined that most of the phytoplankton taxa in the estuarine tidal zone have their origin from the ganges river system and got introduced into the estuary due to increased freshwater influx on the whole our study also depicted a bimodal pattern of phytoplankton abundance with a peak during monsoon and other maxima during pre monsoon happened to be a subtle variation in phytoplankton abundance between these two seasons the stated trend was in contrast to the observations made by sarkar 2011 chowdhury et al 2012 and bhattacharjee al 2013 but agreed with these workers with reference to the pre monsoon maxima gogoi et al 2019 have given a seasonal spectrum of phytoplankton from the upper part of the sundarbans with maximum cellular density during pre monsoon 4 32 103 cells l 1 as compared to rest of the seasons chowdhury et al 2012 have also affirmed similar observation that an inter annual kinetics of phytoplankton from the western part of matla estuary with winter peaks 0 38 105 cells l 1 of these microfloral communities when compared to monsoon 0 13 105 cells l 1 during monsoon though it characterized by heavy precipitation and varying hydrological conditions in the study area the allochthonous nutrients received from the land run off and rivers might have induced for succession of phytoplankton coupled with the riverine source of more freshwater dominated euryhaline species in addition the occurrence of solitary phytoplankton taxa non chain forming diatoms in our samples were also contributed extensively to the total phytoplankton assemblage this was corroborated to the findings of bhattacharjee et al 2013 and mandal 2003 the authors ascribed that the non chain forming diatom taxa such as coscinodiscus and cyclotella were proficient of tolerating variable hydrological conditions sekh et al 2016 also had witnessed the presence of two dominant species coscinodiscus argus and c centralis during monsoon season from bidya river in northern part of sundarbans community structure in the present study was in conformity with the vajravelu et al 2017 and choudhury and pal 2008 that speculated higher species compositions during pre monsoon compared to the other seasons the k dominance curve also depicted similar results with the diverse phytoplankton abundance during pre monsoon the gradual increase in the abundance of cyanophyceae and dinophyceae during post monsoon might be due to rich nutrients received from land run off which was in line with manna et al 2010 as such the author reported that higher establishment of species like cyanophyceae and dinophyceae during winter coupled with high nutrient input in the estuarine water in the present study the higher abundance of toxic dinoflagellates dinophysis spp and cyanophyceae such as dolichospermum oscillatoria klisch and häder 2008 during winter indicated poor water quality simper analysis also revealed that between cluster ii and iii oscillatoria was the top contributor to the total phytoplankton count with the maximum similarity of 53 the assemblage composition of phytoplankton is affected by habitat variability li et al 2014 the significant spatio temporal variation of phytoplankton density in the present study corroborated with the findings of de et al 1994 and choudhury and pal 2010 moreover the resemblance of community compositions observed between pathar pratima and frazerganj lower part could be attributed to the geographical proximity between the stations and similar magnitude of salinity throughout the study period simultaneously the community assemblages between pathar pratima and nischintapur showed the maximum dissimilarity which could be related to its geographical heterogeneity as samples from nischintapur were at the hooghly river with the high tidal impact freshwater influx and pathar pratima near the sea mouth high value of diversity index represents the healthy ecosystem manna et al 2010 the evenness index ranged from 0 92 to 0 97 that implied the uniform distribution of phytoplankton across the sampling locations the calculated value of d and hʹ 2 78 indicating moderately rich phytoplankton diversity in the estuary similarly imd also indicated the hefty community variability across the sampling locations throughout the study period with the dispersion value 0 431 4 2 correlation between assemblage pattern and environmental traits growth and physiological functions in phytoplankters are governed by physico chemical traits haldna et al 2008 and thus a significant positive correlation between temperature and total phytoplankton abundance was seen in the present study coscinodiscophyceae has had a significant positive correlation with the transparency and inversely correlated to water temperature the findings at par with the observations of gogoi et al 2019 that speculated majority of the algal groups had negative affinity towards the water turbidity in the kailash khal sundarbans the increased temperature resulted in higher fractions of cyanophyceae in phytoplankton community however green algae and diatoms perform better in lower temperature sarkar and naskar 2002 schabhuttl et al 2013 our results also found consistent to these workers that the cyanophyceae had more gradient towards temperature and total alkalinity similarly the negligible correlation between the bacillariophyceae and water temperature in sundarban waters also supports the previous statement the multivariate analysis bio env depicted that water parameters viz temp ph ta and nutrients such as po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 were the controlling factors for abundance and distribution of phytoplankton community in the study area the higher numerical abundance of phytoplankton coincides with the occurrence of low tides in sundarbans previously reported by aziz et al 2012 moreover the inter relationship of phytoplankton communities with the environmental factors in sundarbans estuarine region has also been described by many researchers mitra et al 2012 biswas et al 2009 choudhury and pal 2012 while understanding the complex interaction of the sundarban ecosystem chakraborti et al 2020 have disclosed that distance from the sea is the prime parameter controlling the estuarine system s phytoplankton density by employing random forest rf algorithm the authors also classified the nutrients po4 p and no3 n as the secondary important dominating factor after the surface salinity which plays a pivotal role in controlling the phytoplankton population in estuaries our results were also in agreement with the former and found to have statistically significant positive correlation between salinity and total phytoplankton bacillariophyceae also depicted close affinity with the salinity and sio4 si in the present study the ascendency of coscinodiscophyceae coincides with the salinity rise in sundarbans which was consistent with the findings of gogoi et al 2019 the nutrient availability in the system influenced the successions of phytoplankton hai et al 2010 greatly with increases in no3 n and po4 p potentially stimulating the production of phytoplankton biomass yunev et al 2012 in our study po4 p has had more gradients towards the total phytoplankton dissolved sio4 si enriches the growth of the diatoms blanchard 1988 higher concentrations of sio4 si were estimated in all the sampling locations irrespective of seasons that might have supported the ascendency of diatoms throughout the study period according to kaplan et al 1963 the mangrove ecosystem is rich in sulphur and our study also recorded higher dissolved so4 2 concentration in lower and middle sundarbans that could be due to the presence of large mangrove patches it is known that algae assimilate sulfur as sulphate and their uptake is highly regulated in algae and plants davies and grossman 1998 despite little known about the cellular sulfur metabolism in algae some biochemical and genetic evidence for regulation of sulfur uptake in algae is available like freshwater algae chlamydomonas giordano et al 2005 ratti et al 2011 illustrated the influential pattern of so4 2 on the cyanobacterium synechoccus spp green algae tetraselmis suecica and three algae containing chlorophyll a c thalassiosira weissflogii protoceratium reticulatum and the coccolithophorid emiliania huxleyi in a laboratory experiment from their observation the authors surmised that the increased so4 2 may have facilitated the expansion of phytoplankton those containing chlorophyll a c but not the exclusion of other biological and environmental factors the present study showed that water parameters such as temp ta salinity po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 were the deterministic parameters influencing the distribution of phytoplankton in sundarban waters which was evident from the both bio env and marginal test furthermore the distlm explained two variables viz po4 p and ta were the controlling variables that could explain the phytoplankton community compositions other than environmental parameter anthropogenic parameters are also equally responsible for the alteration of phytoplankton assemblage pattern in indian sundarban mega delta 5 conclusion the phytoplankton profile and their spatio temporal dynamics at various geographical locations of the sundarban eco region stands unique in providing a comprehensive information on the status of the ecological interaction with certain phytoplankton groups impacted due to gradual increase of anthropogenic load water quality parameters such as temperature ta salinity po4 p sio4 si and so4 2 were found to have deterministic influence on the distribution abundance and diversity of phytoplankton in indian sundarbans more specifically among these variables our linear model distlm exhibited two water variables viz po4 p and ta were the primary controlling factors that could explain the phytoplankton community compositions in the region the inflow of phosphorus and calcium rich minerals and fertilizers agri wash through run off in this deltaic estuarine water is the key component triggering towards a nutrient rich eutrophic condition and henceforth responsible for seasonal bloom of phytoplankton as evident in sundarban waters hence a plausible management guideline is need of the hour for controlling the point and non point sources of mixing of anthropogenic nutrient load in the region this may be done by modifying agricultural like placement of phosphatic fertilizers to avoid run off losses and other allied activities which will lead to a sustainable healthy aquatic ecosystem with the inherent biota overall our study encompasses representative sites from lower middle and upper parts of the indian sundarbans thus the information generated on the interrelationship between phytoplankton assemblage and environmental factors in this well known estuarine zone would be immensely helpful in dignifying the relative stability of these organisms and also aid to further research the limitations of the existing scientific knowledge on the role of so4 2 in phytoplankton dynamics coupled with its importance pointed in the statistical analysis highlighted a possible research gap on the phytoplankton species specific sulfur uptake in the highly dynamic estuarine system sundarbans authors contributions pranab gogoi sample collection laboratory preparation and analysis statistical analysis interpretation of data manuscript preparation sanjoy
