4255,remote sensing brings unprecedented opportunities to estimate precipitation at regional continental and even global scales nevertheless the spatial resolutions of current mainstream satellite precipitation estimates are still too coarse to be directly used in the hydrological and meteorological applications over the medium and small scales the spatio temporal distribution of precipitation is often affected by various land surface factors such as geographical location vegetational cover topographic characteristics and ground temperature based on the relationship between precipitation and multi geospatial factors this study proposed a new spatial downscaling approach named as gradient boosting decision tree gbdt to downscale the annual satellite precipitation estimates of integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg from 0 1 to 0 01 gridded resolution over mainland china from 2015 to 2018 as for the preprocessing of downscaling algorithm the entire study area of mainland china was separated into four different climate regions due to the spatial discrepancy of the relationship between precipitation and geospatial factors to validate the effectiveness of gbdt approach we compared it with other two types of downscaling methods based on random forests rf and support vector machine svm respectively our evaluation results show that the geographical location including both latitude and longitude seems to be relatively more important and stable for gbdt modelling than other land surface factors across the four climate regions in mainland china in terms of large spatial scales the gbdt and rf algorithms generally are superior to svm for downscaling the imerg precipitation as svm reduced the considerable accuracy of the downscaled results last but not least gbdt exhibits more robust features in downscaling the satellite precipitation retrievals than rf over complex terrains where the amount of precipitation has strong spatial heterogeneity keywords spatial downscaling imerg gbdt mainland china land surface variables 1 introduction precipitation plays an important role in the global water cycle climate system and ecosystem allen and ingram 2002 michaelides et al 2009 reliable and accurate measurement of precipitation is crucial in various scientific and application fields such as agricultural and flood forecasting hydrologic processes simulation water resources monitoring yilmaz et al 2005 tian et al 2009 traditional precipitation measurements from point based rain gauges cannot capture the continuous spatial variation of precipitation and the precision of a certain interpolation algorithm for discrete precipitation data is constrained by unevenly and sparsely distributed meteorological stations hijmans et al 2005 buytaert et al 2006 ma et al 2017 benefitted from the development of satellite sensors and retrieval techniques satellite based remote sensing is becoming a promising alternative for providing global spatially continuous and temporally complete precipitation estimates hsu et al 1997 boushaki et al 2009 sun et al 2018 over the past three decades several satellite based precipitation estimates have been rapidly developed and operationally available such as the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2004 and the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2014 however the spatial resolutions e g 0 1 or lower of the current satellite precipitation estimates are still too coarse for the hydrological study of local regions and basins gebremichael et al 2008 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 chen et al 2019 sorooshian et al 2011 recommended that improving the spatial resolution can be considered as one of the targets for satellite precipitation estimates in the near future many efforts have been explored to map the fine spatial resolution of satellite precipitation estimates by using statistical downscaling approaches based on the hypothesis that precipitation has certain relationships with some land surface characteristics immerzeel et al 2009 downscaled the annual tmpa precipitation from 0 25 to 1 km in the iberian peninsula by establishing an exponential relationship between precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi jia et al 2011 established the multiple linear regression model to downscale the annual tmpa data in the qaidam basin by introducing both ndvi and digital elevation model dem as independent variables fang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 and chen et al 2015 constructed a geographically weighted regression model gwr to downscale the satellite precipitation products for considering the non stationary relationship between precipitation and the geospatial factors such as ndvi dem and land surface temperature with the rapid development of machine learning algorithms more and more scholars applied machine learning techniques to downscale satellite precipitation products shi et al 2015 applied random forests rf to establish the relationship between precipitation with ndvi and dem then downscale the annual tmpa 0 25 0 25 onto the finer grids 1 1 km2 in mainland china jing et al 2016a jing et al 2016b adopted the rf and support vector machine svm to downscale the satellite precipitation and found land surface temperature lst is an important factor in precipitation downscaling ma et al 2018 applied rf to obtain the annual downscaled results 1 km of imerg and tmpa over the tibetan plateau based on ndvi lst and topography data zhang et al 2019 adopted rf to link the satellite precipitation estimates to 1 km resolution predictors such as latitude longitude elevation aspect slope and ndvi in seven precipitation subregions of lancang mekong river basin mei et al 2020 proposed a two step statistical framework to downscale the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra precipitation product firstly adopted a recursive feature elimination method to select explanatory variables then successfully downscaled the merra precipitation using rf over high mountain asia considering the complicated nonlinear relationship between precipitation and surface characteristics the machine learning techniques are more appropriate in precipitation downscaling than traditional statistical regression algorithms over large spatial scales shi et al 2015 the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to generate a robust model in a gradient boosting way friedman 2001 ensemble learning generally can be divided into two categories i e bagging method and boosting method as a representative of the bagging method the rf has been widely used in spatial downscaling of satellite precipitation estimates but the application of boosting way like gbdt is little explored in this field furthermore complex topography across mainland china results in diverse climatic characteristics some local regions are dominated by small climate systems leading to very different precipitation distributions thus the training samples for machine learning modelling may not be balanced gbdt which is an iterative algorithm is robust to outliers and unbalanced data ensuring stable performance therefore it is hopeful to use gbdt to downscale the spatial resolution of satellite precipitation estimates in this study the imerg precipitation product was adopted as the downscaling object to examine the efficacy of the downscaling algorithm gbdt was used to downscale the imerg at annual scale from 0 1 to 0 01 over mainland china during the period of 2015 to 2018 since ndvi was used as an explanatory variable in this study and ndvi has a lagging response to precipitation immerzeel et al 2009 quiroz et al 2011 ghorbanpour et al 2021 whereas annual ndvi homogenizes the delayed response to precipitation duan and bastiaanssen 2013 furthermore we are more concerned about whether gbdt is a practical downscaling algorithm for satellite precipitation estimates therefore the spatial downscaling of imerg was conducted at annual scale a series of main objectives were as follows 1 to downscale the coarse resolution annual imerg data using multiple land surface characteristics based on the gbdt algorithm 2 to explore the relative influences of the input land surface predictors in gbdt modelling over different climate regions this required the division of mainland china into subregions and the gbdt based downscaling model was built for each climate region respectively 3 to compare the downscaled results based on gbdt with those on rf and svm 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area mainland china extends from 73 e to 135 e and from 18 n to 53 n has a complex topography with the elevation descending from west to east such varied topography results in diverse climatic characteristics across mainland china fig 1 according to the long historical recorder of precipitation mainland china is separated into four climate regions 1 the humid region average annual precipitation aap over 800 mm yr which dominated by the subtropical monsoon covering southeastern china 2 the semi humid region aap of 400 800 mm yr extending from northeastern china to the southeast part of tibetan plateau tp 3 the semi arid aap of 200 400 mm yr including the tianshan mountains and the narrow strip region from southwest tp to north inner mongolia 4 the arid region aap 200 mm yr including the tarim basin qaidam basin western tp and southern part of inner mongolia there are two reasons for dividing mainland china into four climate regions first the training dataset has considerable volume over the entire mainland china so it is requisite to conduct the downscaling procedure for each subregion separately then the explanatory land surface variables have different relative influences on the gbdt model over different climate regions analyzing the importance of each predictor in the downscaling procedures over different climate regions is necessary 2 2 data resources 2 2 1 rain gauge data daily rain gauge observations from 2015 to 2018 were used as the independent validation of the downscaled results in this study the station based climatological dataset surf cli chn mul day v3 0 was acquired from national meteorological stations through mainland china and can be downloaded from china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn however the meteorological stations are distributed unevenly across mainland china most of them are concentrated in central and eastern china while sparsely covering western china 699 rain gauges were selected in this study after screening out the meteorological stations with poor quality data fig 1 to obtain annual precipitation at each rain station the daily rain gauge observations were accumulated to the annual total precipitation 2 2 2 imerg satellite precipitation dataset the global precipitation measurement mission core observatory was launched in february 2014 as the successor for trmm the gpm mission was anticipated to provide the next generation global quantitative precipitation estimates with high spatiotemporal resolution and wider spatial coverage 60 n 60 s the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg is the level 3 precipitation estimation algorithm of the gpm mission which is intended to combine intermittent precipitation estimates from all constellation microwave sensors ir based observations and monthly gauge precipitation data hou et al 2014 in this study the imerg final run monthly precipitation product imerg month with a spatial resolution of 0 1 from 2015 to 2018 downloaded from https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm was adopted as our downscaling object 2 2 3 ndvi dataset the ndvi is an indicator of vegetation activity and has a positive correlation with precipitation grist et al 1997 fang et al 2001 mei et al 2020 compared with satellite precipitation estimates ndvi products are available at a higher spatial resolution therefore ndvi is a crucial factor to be used in the precipitation downscaling procedure the ndvi data used in this study is the monthly ndvi mod13a3 didan et al 2015 derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor aboard the terra satellite the mod13a3 dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km in the sinusoidal projection was resampled to 0 01 on the geographic coordinate system annual ndvi value was generated by averaging monthly ndvi in that year it should be noted that the ndvi values are negative over snow and water bodies and these negative values should be excluded from the spatial downscaling procedure 2 2 4 lst datasets land surface temperature lst has been demonstrated as related to precipitation eltahir 1998 brunsell 2006 lst data used in this study is from terra modis l3 lst products mod11a2 download from https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov mod11a2 provides both daytime and nighttime land surface temperature at an 8 day interval with a spatial resolution of 1 km in the sinusoidal projection same as ndvi data both the daytime lst lst day and nighttime lst lst night were resampled to 0 01 on the geographic coordinate system and the annual lst day and lst night were calculated by averaging the 8 day lst day and lst night of the current year respectively 2 2 5 topographic characteristic datasets the dem data used in this study was collected from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm which is operated by the national geospatial intelligence agency nga and national aeronautics and space administration nasa for producing high resolution dem for 56 s to 60 n areas rodriguez et al 2006 schneider et al 2012 we obtained the srtm dem data with the spatial resolution of 90 m over mainland china from resource and environment science and data center chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn in addition to the dem two topographic indices slope and aspect derived based on the dem data were also used in the precipitation downscaling procedure all these three topographic indices were resampled to 0 01 respectively 3 methodology 3 1 downscaling scheme based on gbdt algorithm gbdt constructs an ensemble of weak prediction models iteratively usually takes decision trees as the base model the boosting model is defined as eq 1 1 f m m 1 m γ m h x θ m where f m is the final boosting model of gbdt h x θ m is a simple decision tree characterized by the parameter θ m in the m th iteration γ m is a weight of h x θ m as gbdt is an iterative algorithm the eq 1 can also be rewritten as eq 2 2 f m f m 1 γ m h x θ m in each step of the gbdt process a new decision regression tree is trained to optimize certain loss functions identified by the difference between the results of all previous decision trees and the target in the negative gradient direction the details of the solving process of estimating parameters in eq 2 can be referred to friedman 2001 gbdt is a robust machine learning algorithm for its sensitivity to outliers and unbalanced data lawrence et al 2004 wei et al 2019 considering the complex and nonlinear relationship between precipitation and the land surface variables gbdt was chosen as the satellite precipitation downscaling model the flow chart of the downscaling process is shown in fig 2 and the main steps of the downscaling process were depicted as follows 1 the ndvi and lst with 1 km spatial resolution as well as the topographic characteristic datasets dem slope and aspect with 90 m spatial resolution were resampled to 0 01 on the geographic coordinate system the negative ndvi values as well as the corresponding lst and topographic characteristic values were removed from the land surface variables datasets 2 all land surface variables with 0 01 spatial resolution were aggregated into 0 1 by averaging the pixel values then we obtained the annual ndvi and annual lst at 0 1 spatial resolution by averaging the monthly ndvi and 8 day lst in that year respectively 3 annual imerg precipitation as well as the annual ndvi annual lst topographic characteristic datasets and latitude and longitude at 0 1 resolution were used to train the downscaling model by gbdt the gbdt was developed for each climate region 4 hyperparameter optimization is a crucial part of machine learning modelling since we used package gbm in r to establish the gbdt model the main parameters of the gbdt model here are n trees total number of trees to fit here set the parameter range from 2000 to 10 000 with an interval of 2000 interaction depth maximum depth of each tree here set the parameter range from 1 to 9 with an interval of 2 shrinkage learning rate or step size reduction here set the parameter to 0 1 or 0 01 and n minobsinnode minimum number of observations in the terminal nodes of the trees here set the parameter range from 10 to 50 with an interval of 10 we adopted an optimization scheme that combines the grid searching method with cross validation to find the optimal parameters of gbdt fig 3 shows an instance of hyperparameter optimization in the humid region in 2015 it is clear to see the process of optimization for the combination of the four parameters mentioned above 5 the downscaling model derived from the gbdt algorithm was applied to the explanatory land surface variables at 0 01 spatial resolution and then the finer scale imerg with 0 01 spatial resolution was produced 3 2 evaluation strategy the evaluation strategy is divided into two parts a the 10 fold cross validation aiming to investigate the performance of the downscaling algorithm itself and b validation with independent ground observations designed to evaluate the accuracy of the final downscaled products 3 2 1 cross validation 10 fold cross validation was used in this study to estimate the performance of the downscaling model itself the datasets original imerg precipitation estimates and the corresponding land surface variables were divided into 10 sample sets 9 sets were used to train the model meanwhile 1 set was applied to estimate the predicting performance repeat this step 10 times to make sure each set is verified here we adopted three widely used statistical metrics coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the mean error me these evaluation metrics were calculated as follows 3 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 5 me 1 n i 1 n y i x i where x i and x are the original imerg precipitation and its average y i and y refer to the modelled imerg precipitation and its average at the spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and n is the number of pixels in original imerg precipitation 3 2 2 validation with ground observations the cross validation can only evaluate the performance of the downscaling algorithm itself but we don t know about the accuracy of the downscaled products relative to the ground observations therefore the downscaled values were validated with the gauge observations to further estimate the practicability of the downscaling algorithm the evaluation metrics calculated here are the same as the 10 fold cross validation but the x i is the gauge observations x refers to the mean value of all gauge observations y i is the modelled precipitation at the same location of the corresponding rain gauge y refers to the mean value of y i and n means the number of rain gauges 4 results and discussions 4 1 modelling and cross validation to analyze the spatial distribution of annual imerg precipitation after downscaling we first need to know the original annual imerg precipitation information fig 4 portrays the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation by the original imerg dataset at 0 1 scale in 2015 generally the annual precipitation was descending from southeast to northwest of mainland china however we noticed there were some unbalanced data that were not very compatible with the data around them over the southern tibet box a and the ili river valley in northwest china box b unbalanced data in this study means a minority of precipitation samples aren t quite coordinated with the surrounding precipitation and it is caused by the local climatic condition and topography blocked by the southern slope of the himalayas the indian ocean monsoon brings abundant rainfall to the southern tibet and the southern tibet becomes one of the rainiest places in the world so the southern tibet is zoned as the humid region similar to southern tibet the large amount of precipitation in the ili river valley is influenced by the tianshan mountains which accept the water vapour from the atlantic ocean and the westerly current the precipitation amount in the ili river valley is between 200 and 400 mm yr thus the ili river valley is zoned as the semi arid region such unbalanced data tend to predict all unknown samples as the majority set in machine learning algorithms chawla et al 2004 lin and chen 2012 and may result in unsatisfactory downscaled results fig 5 demonstrates the fitting diagrams of the original annual imerg dataset and the predicted imerg derived from svm rf and gbdt at 0 1 spatial resolution in 2015 it is easy to see that both rf and gbdt had outstanding fitting performances and far outperformed svm besides the scatterplots of gbdt are clustered to the 1 1 line more closely relative to that of rf in addition we found that the rf predicted precipitation has slight underestimations over 2500 mm yr in 2015 this finding is consistent with the research conducted by shi et al 2015 that precipitation simulated by rf has underestimation relative to the original satellite precipitation estimates at the relatively high rain rate the fitting metrics between original imerg precipitation and the predicted imerg with different machine learning algorithms at 0 1 scale from 2015 to 2018 are shown in table 1 both predicted precipitation derived from rf and gbdt have higher r2 lower rmse and me values than those of svm the performance of metrics of rf and gbdt were much better than svm similar results were also demonstrated by jing et al 2016a jing et al 2016b that svm had much higher fitting residuals than rf in the tibetan plateau and northern china svm is sensitive to the kernel function and the hyperparameters of the model although all the three machine learning algorithms have conducted the grid search optimization for hyperparameters gbdt and rf as the ensemble learning are more robust than svm in addition although the r2 values of rf and gbdt are basically identical the gbdt has lower me values and 40 drops of rmse values relative to that of rf therefore the gbdt outperformed rf and svm to simulate the annual precipitation of imerg based on land surface characteristics at 0 1 scale to further analyze the spatial distribution of fitting error over mainland china we plotted the distribution of fitting residuals of gbdt rf and svm in 2015 fig 6 one can see that the predicted precipitation derived from svm has considerable fitting residuals across mainland china compared with that of rf and gbdt this is consistent with fig 5 that the fitting scatterplots of svm were much dispersed and had a lot of outliers suggesting that svm is inappropriate to simulate and downscale the precipitation estimates of imerg based on land surface characteristics over mainland china for the remaining two algorithms although rf and gbdt had much smaller fitting residuals than svm across mainland china the fitting residuals of gbdt were distributed evenly across mainland china whereas the fitting residuals of rf were found clustered over some local areas with relatively higher fitting errors especially over the areas covered by box a and box b in fig 4 over these areas with complex terrain the influencing factors of precipitation are complicated are more prone to have unbalanced precipitation relative to their surrounding areas meanwhile the gbdt model is more sensitive to the unbalanced data in modelling than rf because of its iterative residuals correcting strategy therefore we concluded that gbdt was competent to simulate the precipitation of imerg at 0 1 scale over mainland china based on land surface characteristics fitting represents the capability of simulation while it doesn t indicate the predicting capability of each machine learning algorithm because machine learning algorithms may have the excellent fitting ability on the training set but weak generalization to the data out of the training sets cross validation can be used to estimate the performance of the downscaling model itself for the testing datasets are independent of the training datasets therefore cross validation is needed here to assess the performance of the prediction of each model used in this study fig 7 shows the scatterplots of the predicted imerg datasets derived from gbdt rf and svm against the original imerg data based on 10 fold cross validation from 2015 to 2018 in general the scatterplots of each model based on cross validation showed the similar pattern with their fitting results with the best performance of gbdt and worst of svm it means that gbdt didn t show the overfitting on the training sets and still showed a strong predictive ability on the independent datasets it is clear that rf and gbdt could predict the precipitation of imerg much better than svm over mainland china both rf and gbdt had higher r2 values and much lower rmse and me values compared to svm as for the intercomparison between rf and gbdt the predicted precipitation of imerg by gbdt showed fewer outliers and more consistent with the original imerg than rf the statistical metrics of gbdt were slightly better than that of rf with relatively lower rmse and me values of gbdt it demonstrates that gbdt was more robust not only to simulate but also to predict the precipitation of imerg based on the land surface characteristics over mainland china than rf and svm 4 2 downscaled results and validation with ground observations fig 8 portrays the downscaled annual imerg precipitation by the svm rf and gbdt in 2015 it is easy to see that the downscaled precipitation derived from rf and gbdt showed a consistent spatial distribution pattern with the original imerg precipitation the downscaled imerg by gbdt and rf showed smoothed patterns when compared to the downscaled product derived from svm additionally we noticed that the distribution of downscaled precipitation by svm was quite different from the original imerg precipitation over the humid region especially over the southern tibet box a in fig 4 the downscaled precipitation by svm had significant underestimations in this area which is a finding consistent with that of jing et al 2016a moreover the downscaled precipitation by svm showed remarkable heterogeneous patches over the four climate regions we concluded that the ensemble learning may be more appropriate than svm to downscale the precipitation of imerg over mainland china based on the land surface characteristics as for the performances of downscaled precipitation by rf and gdbt it s hard to tell the difference of precipitation with the spatial resolution from 0 1 to 0 01 over the large spatial scale of mainland china therefore we selected two local areas which are located in box a and b in fig 4 to conduct a further comparison between rf and gbdt the reasons for selecting these two areas were two fold first the details of the spatial distribution of precipitation are more obvious at the local scale the second reason was to analyze the modelling applicability over the areas in which unbalanced precipitation occurred fig 9 shows comparisons with respect to the original annual imerg data and the downscaled results over the southern tibet box a in fig 4 compared with svm and rf the downscaled precipitation by gbdt shows smoother transitions over different climate regions moreover the distribution of downscaled precipitation by gbdt is closest to the original imerg fig 10 demonstrates the distributions of the original annual imerg and the downscaled precipitation over the ili river valley in northwest china box b in fig 4 it s easy to see that the distribution of downscaled precipitation by gbdt is more consistent with the original imerg data compared with that of svm and rf with the downscaled precipitation by rf having slight underestimation over the tianshan mountains therefore we concluded that the gbdt is more suitable for precipitation downscaling than svm and rf over local areas where unbalanced precipitation occurred it should be noted that the dependent variable of the spatial downscaling procedure is the satellite precipitation estimates rather than the real precipitation of the rain gauge in addition to the cross validation validation of the downscaled values against the gauge observations is also indispensable to further estimate the practicability of the downscaling algorithms fig 11 shows the scatterplots of the downscaled imerg based on different downscaling algorithms and the original imerg versus gauge observations over mainland china in 2015 the scatterplots of the downscaled imerg by gbdt and rf showed similar distribution patterns to the original imerg data whereas the svm presented a quite different pattern to the original imerg data the downscaled imerg by svm had a remarkable underestimation over 2000 mm yr and showed more outliers the metrics of the original imerg and the three downscaled imerg products against the gauge observations from 2015 to 2018 are shown in table 2 generally the downscaled results by gbdt and rf had similar values of validation metrics to the original imerg data it indicates that the downscaled precipitation by gbdt and rf improved the spatial resolution with reasonable accuracies although the me values of downscaled results by svm were lower than that of the original imerg the r2 and rmse were much worse than the original imerg it suggests that the cost of improving the spatial resolution by svm is the loss of considerable accuracies therefore we concluded that ensemble learning algorithms gbdt and rf are more applicable in spatial downscaling of precipitation over mainland china because gbdt and rf were more competent in simulation prediction and downscaling than svm 4 3 variable importance of gbdt downscaling procedure as described in the downscaling procedure we built the gbdt model for each climate region respectively the relative influence of each input predictor for the gbdt model in 2015 was illustrated in fig 12 it shows that all the eight geospatial predictors play corresponding roles in the downscaling procedure across four different climate regions over mainland china in general different land surface characteristics have different influences for gbdt modelling over different climate regions the geographical location latitude and longitude makes steady and relatively greater contributions to gbdt modelling compared with other variables it is consistent with the phenomenon that precipitation is decreasing from the southeast to the northwest of china in fig 4 suggesting geographical location plays an important role in the spatial distribution of precipitation the ndvi has more importance in semi humid and semi arid regions while has small contributions in the humid and arid regions the lst played a relatively significant role only over the humid region with the highest importance of lst n in gbdt modelling for this region however the topographic characteristics seem to have a relatively small effect on the gbdt modelling but it didn t mean that topographic characteristics were not important for gbdt simulation for the relative influence of each input predictor was derived from an entire climate region the topographic characteristics do have a significant effect on precipitation over some local areas with complex terrains like southern tibet and the ili river valley as mentioned above overall the above results verified that it is reasonable and necessary to divide mainland china into different climate regions for the non stationary relationships between precipitation and land surface characteristics 5 conclusions and future scope of work in this study a new spatial downscaling algorithm gbdt was introduced to downscale the annual precipitation estimates of imerg using multiple land surface predictors over the complex and vast territory of mainland china the annual imerg estimates at a 0 01 x0 01 gridded resolution were generated using the proposed gbdt approach the new gbdt based downscaled product was also compared those derived from other two downscaling algorithms i e svm and rf the principal conclusions of this investigation are summarized as follows 1 the geographical location is an important factor for the precipitation downscaling and makes a stable contribution to the gbdt modelling over different climate regions the roles of ndvi and lst in different climatic zones vary greatly and the topographic variables seem to have relatively small impact on the gbdt modelling over the large spatial scales 2 the results of cross validation and validation benchmarked by the ground data show that both gbdt and rf generally outperformed svm and these two machine learning algorithms exhibited operational potentials for downscaling the imerg precipitation estimates over mainland china in practice these two downscaling algorithms i e gbdt and rf can effectively improve the spatial resolution without reducing the accuracy while the cost of enhancing the spatial resolution for the svm algorithm is the loss of considerable accuracies 3 the gbdt algorithm is sensitive to the unbalanced data for its iterative residuals correction strategy results of the cross validation showed that gbdt is more appropriate for downscaling precipitation than rf over local areas where unbalanced precipitation occurred especially over those regions with complex topography therefore gbdt is relatively more robust to simulate and downscale the satellite precipitation estimates than rf at the large spatial scale looking into the future efforts will be focused on two aspects to generate satellite precipitation estimates with finer spatio temporal resolutions and higher data accuracies in the gmp era first other rainfall related predictors e g cloud optical thickness cloud water path water vapour and soil moisture would be further introduced to downscale the satellite precipitation estimates although the downscaling method proposed in this study is capable to improve the spatial resolution of satellite precipitation estimates with reasonable accuracy it didn t significantly improve the accuracy of the downscaled results when compared to original imerg retrievals the introduction of predictors like soil moisture and water vapour which have more direct relationships with rainfall may further improve the accuracy of the downscaled results on the other hand to better service for hydrological and meteorological applications high temporal resolution precipitation products are indispensable the temporal downscaling algorithms or procedures are in great need to downscale the high spatial resolution satellite precipitation estimates with higher temporal resolutions e g weekly daily and

4255,remote sensing brings unprecedented opportunities to estimate precipitation at regional continental and even global scales nevertheless the spatial resolutions of current mainstream satellite precipitation estimates are still too coarse to be directly used in the hydrological and meteorological applications over the medium and small scales the spatio temporal distribution of precipitation is often affected by various land surface factors such as geographical location vegetational cover topographic characteristics and ground temperature based on the relationship between precipitation and multi geospatial factors this study proposed a new spatial downscaling approach named as gradient boosting decision tree gbdt to downscale the annual satellite precipitation estimates of integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg from 0 1 to 0 01 gridded resolution over mainland china from 2015 to 2018 as for the preprocessing of downscaling algorithm the entire study area of mainland china was separated into four different climate regions due to the spatial discrepancy of the relationship between precipitation and geospatial factors to validate the effectiveness of gbdt approach we compared it with other two types of downscaling methods based on random forests rf and support vector machine svm respectively our evaluation results show that the geographical location including both latitude and longitude seems to be relatively more important and stable for gbdt modelling than other land surface factors across the four climate regions in mainland china in terms of large spatial scales the gbdt and rf algorithms generally are superior to svm for downscaling the imerg precipitation as svm reduced the considerable accuracy of the downscaled results last but not least gbdt exhibits more robust features in downscaling the satellite precipitation retrievals than rf over complex terrains where the amount of precipitation has

information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2004 and the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2014 however the spatial resolutions e g 0 1 or lower of the current satellite precipitation estimates are still too coarse for the hydrological study of local regions and basins gebremichael et al 2008 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 chen et al 2019 sorooshian et al 2011 recommended that improving the spatial resolution can be considered as one of the targets for satellite precipitation estimates in the near future many efforts have been explored to map the fine spatial resolution of satellite precipitation estimates by using statistical downscaling approaches based on the hypothesis that precipitation has certain relationships with some land surface characteristics immerzeel et al 2009 downscaled the annual tmpa precipitation from 0 25 to 1 km in the iberian peninsula by establishing an exponential relationship between precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi jia et al 2011 established the multiple linear regression model to downscale the annual tmpa data in the qaidam basin by introducing both ndvi and digital elevation model dem as independent variables fang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 and chen et al 2015 constructed a geographically weighted regression model gwr to downscale the satellite precipitation products for considering the non stationary relationship between precipitation and the geospatial factors such as ndvi dem and land surface temperature with the rapid development of machine learning algorithms more and more scholars applied machine learning techniques to downscale satellite precipitation products shi et al 2015 applied random forests rf to establish the relationship between precipitation with ndvi and dem then downscale the annual tmpa 0 25 0 25 onto the finer grids 1 1 km2 in mainland china jing et al 2016a jing et al 2016b adopted the rf and support vector machine svm to downscale the satellite precipitation and found land surface temperature lst is an important factor in precipitation downscaling ma et al 2018 applied rf to obtain the annual downscaled results 1 km of imerg and tmpa over the tibetan plateau based on ndvi lst and topography data zhang et al 2019 adopted rf to link the satellite precipitation estimates to 1 km resolution predictors such as latitude longitude elevation aspect slope and ndvi in seven precipitation subregions of lancang mekong river basin mei et al 2020 proposed a two step statistical framework to downscale the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra precipitation product firstly adopted a recursive feature elimination method to select explanatory variables then successfully downscaled the merra precipitation using rf over high mountain asia considering the complicated nonlinear relationship between precipitation and surface characteristics the machine learning techniques are more appropriate in precipitation downscaling than traditional statistical regression algorithms over large spatial scales shi et al 2015 the gradient boosting decision tree gbdt is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to generate a robust model in a gradient boosting way friedman 2001 ensemble learning generally can be divided into two categories i e bagging method and boosting method as a representative of the bagging method the rf has been widely used in spatial downscaling of satellite precipitation estimates but the application of boosting way like gbdt is little explored in this field furthermore complex topography across mainland china results in diverse climatic characteristics some local regions are dominated by small climate systems leading to very different precipitation distributions thus the training samples for machine learning modelling may not be balanced gbdt which is an iterative algorithm is robust to outliers and unbalanced data ensuring stable performance therefore it is hopeful to use gbdt to downscale the spatial resolution of satellite precipitation estimates in this study the imerg precipitation product was adopted as the downscaling object to examine the efficacy of the downscaling algorithm gbdt was used to downscale the imerg at annual scale from 0 1 to 0 01 over mainland china during the period of 2015 to 2018 since ndvi was used as an explanatory variable in this study and ndvi has a lagging response to precipitation immerzeel et al 2009 quiroz et al 2011 ghorbanpour et al 2021 whereas annual ndvi homogenizes the delayed response to precipitation duan and bastiaanssen 2013 furthermore we are more concerned about whether gbdt is a practical downscaling algorithm for satellite precipitation estimates therefore the spatial downscaling of imerg was conducted at annual scale a series of main objectives were as follows 1 to downscale the coarse resolution annual imerg data using multiple land surface characteristics based on the gbdt algorithm 2 to explore the relative influences of the input land surface predictors in gbdt modelling over different climate regions this required the division of mainland china into subregions and the gbdt based downscaling model was built for each climate region respectively 3 to compare the downscaled results based on gbdt with those on rf and svm 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area mainland china extends from 73 e to 135 e and from 18 n to 53 n has a complex topography with the elevation descending from west to east such varied topography results in diverse climatic characteristics across mainland china fig 1 according to the long historical recorder of precipitation mainland china is separated into four climate regions 1 the humid region average annual precipitation aap over 800 mm yr which dominated by the subtropical monsoon covering southeastern china 2 the semi humid region aap of 400 800 mm yr extending from northeastern china to the southeast part of tibetan plateau tp 3 the semi arid aap of 200 400 mm yr including the tianshan mountains and the narrow strip region from southwest tp to north inner mongolia 4 the arid region aap 200 mm yr including the tarim basin qaidam basin western tp and southern part of inner mongolia there are two reasons for dividing mainland china into four climate regions first the training dataset has considerable volume over the entire mainland china so it is requisite to conduct the downscaling procedure for each subregion separately then the explanatory land surface variables have different relative influences on the gbdt model over different climate regions analyzing the importance of each predictor in the downscaling procedures over different climate regions is necessary 2 2 data resources 2 2 1 rain gauge data daily rain gauge observations from 2015 to 2018 were used as the independent validation of the downscaled results in this study the station based climatological dataset surf cli chn mul day v3 0 was acquired from national meteorological stations through mainland china and can be downloaded from china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn however the meteorological stations are distributed unevenly across mainland china most of them are concentrated in central and eastern china while sparsely covering western china 699 rain gauges were selected in this study after screening out the meteorological stations with poor quality data fig 1 to obtain annual precipitation at each rain station the daily rain gauge observations were accumulated to the annual total precipitation 2 2 2 imerg satellite precipitation dataset the global precipitation measurement mission core observatory was launched in february 2014 as the successor for trmm the gpm mission was anticipated to provide the next generation global quantitative precipitation estimates with high spatiotemporal resolution and wider spatial coverage 60 n 60 s the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg is the level 3 precipitation estimation algorithm of the gpm mission which is intended to combine intermittent precipitation estimates from all constellation microwave sensors ir based observations and monthly gauge precipitation data hou et al 2014 in this study the imerg final run monthly precipitation product imerg month with a spatial resolution of 0 1 from 2015 to 2018 downloaded from https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm was adopted as our downscaling object 2 2 3 ndvi dataset the ndvi is an indicator of vegetation activity and has a positive correlation with precipitation grist et al 1997 fang et al 2001 mei et al 2020 compared with satellite precipitation estimates ndvi products are available at a higher spatial resolution therefore ndvi is a crucial factor to be used in the precipitation downscaling procedure the ndvi data used in this study is the monthly ndvi mod13a3 didan et al 2015 derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor aboard the terra satellite the mod13a3 dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km in the sinusoidal projection was resampled to 0 01 on the geographic coordinate system annual ndvi value was generated by averaging monthly ndvi in that year it should be noted that the ndvi values are negative over snow and water bodies and these negative values should be excluded from the spatial downscaling procedure 2 2 4 lst datasets land surface temperature lst has been demonstrated as related to precipitation eltahir 1998 brunsell 2006 lst data used in this study is from terra modis l3 lst products mod11a2 download from https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov mod11a2 provides both daytime and nighttime land surface temperature at an 8 day interval with a spatial resolution of 1 km in the sinusoidal projection same as ndvi data both the daytime lst lst day and nighttime lst lst night were resampled to 0 01 on the geographic coordinate system and the annual lst day and lst night were calculated by averaging the 8 day lst day and lst night of the current year respectively 2 2 5 topographic characteristic datasets the dem data used in this study was collected from the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm which is operated by the national geospatial intelligence agency nga and national aeronautics and space administration nasa for producing high resolution dem for 56 s to 60 n areas rodriguez et al 2006 schneider et al 2012 we obtained the srtm dem data with the spatial resolution of 90 m over mainland china from resource and environment science and data center chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn in addition to the dem two topographic indices slope and aspect derived based on the dem data were also used in the precipitation downscaling procedure all these three topographic indices were resampled to 0 01 respectively 3 methodology 3 1 downscaling scheme based on gbdt algorithm gbdt constructs an ensemble of weak prediction models iteratively usually takes decision trees as the base model the boosting model is defined as eq 1 1 f m m 1 m γ m h x θ m where f m is the final boosting model of gbdt h x θ m is a simple decision tree characterized by the parameter θ m in the m th iteration γ m is a weight of h x θ m as gbdt is an iterative algorithm the eq 1 can also be rewritten as eq 2 2 f m f m 1 γ m h x θ m in each step of the gbdt process a new decision regression tree is trained to optimize certain loss functions identified by the difference between the results of all previous decision trees and the target in the negative gradient direction the details of the solving process of estimating parameters in eq 2 can be referred to friedman 2001 gbdt is a robust machine learning algorithm for its sensitivity to outliers and unbalanced data lawrence et al 2004 wei et al 2019 considering the complex and nonlinear relationship between precipitation and the land surface variables gbdt was chosen as the satellite precipitation downscaling model the flow chart of the downscaling process is shown in fig 2 and the main steps of the downscaling process were depicted as follows 1 the ndvi and lst with 1 km spatial resolution as well as the topographic characteristic datasets dem slope and aspect with 90 m spatial resolution were resampled to 0 01 on the geographic coordinate system the negative ndvi values as well as the corresponding lst and topographic characteristic values were removed from the land surface variables datasets 2 all land surface variables with 0 01 spatial resolution were aggregated into 0 1 by averaging the pixel values then we obtained the annual ndvi and annual lst at 0 1 spatial resolution by averaging the monthly ndvi and 8 day lst in that year respectively 3 annual imerg precipitation as well as the annual ndvi annual lst topographic characteristic datasets and latitude and longitude at 0 1 resolution were used to train the downscaling model by gbdt the gbdt was developed for each climate region 4 hyperparameter optimization is a crucial part of machine learning modelling since we used package gbm in r to establish the gbdt model the main parameters of the gbdt model here are n trees total number of trees to fit here set the parameter range from 2000 to 10 000 with an interval of 2000 interaction depth maximum depth of each tree here set the parameter range from 1 to 9 with an interval of 2 shrinkage learning rate or step size reduction here set the parameter to 0 1 or 0 01 and n minobsinnode minimum number of observations in the terminal nodes of the trees here set the parameter range from 10 to 50 with an interval of 10 we adopted an optimization scheme that combines the grid searching method with cross validation to find the optimal parameters of gbdt fig 3 shows an instance of hyperparameter optimization in the humid region in 2015 it is clear to see the process of optimization for the combination of the four parameters mentioned above 5 the downscaling model derived from the gbdt algorithm was applied to the explanatory land surface variables at 0 01 spatial resolution and then the finer scale imerg with 0 01 spatial resolution was produced 3 2 evaluation strategy the evaluation strategy is divided into two parts a the 10 fold cross validation aiming to investigate the performance of the downscaling algorithm itself and b validation with independent ground observations designed to evaluate the accuracy of the final downscaled products 3 2 1 cross validation 10 fold cross validation was used in this study to estimate the performance of the downscaling model itself the datasets original imerg precipitation estimates and the corresponding land surface variables were divided into 10 sample sets 9 sets were used to train the model meanwhile 1 set was applied to estimate the predicting performance repeat this step 10 times to make sure each set is verified here we adopted three widely used statistical metrics coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the mean error me these evaluation metrics were calculated as follows 3 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 2 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 5 me 1 n i 1 n y i x i where x i and x are the original imerg precipitation and its average y i and y refer to the modelled imerg precipitation and its average at the spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and n is the number of pixels in original imerg precipitation 3 2 2 validation with ground observations the cross validation can only evaluate the performance of the downscaling algorithm itself but we don t know about the accuracy of the downscaled products relative to the ground observations therefore the downscaled values were validated with the gauge observations to further estimate the practicability of the downscaling algorithm the evaluation metrics calculated here are the same as the 10 fold cross validation but the x i is the gauge observations x refers to the mean value of all gauge observations y i is the modelled precipitation at the same location of the corresponding rain gauge y refers to the mean value of y i and n means the number of rain gauges 4 results and discussions 4 1 modelling and cross validation to analyze the spatial distribution of annual imerg precipitation after downscaling we first need to know the original annual imerg precipitation information fig 4 portrays the spatial distribution of the annual precipitation by the original imerg dataset at 0 1 scale in 2015 generally the annual precipitation was descending from southeast to northwest of mainland china however we noticed there were some unbalanced data that were not very compatible with the data around them over the southern tibet box a and the ili river valley in northwest china box b unbalanced data in this study means a minority of precipitation samples aren t quite coordinated with the surrounding precipitation and it is caused by the local climatic condition and topography blocked by the southern slope of the himalayas the indian ocean monsoon brings abundant rainfall to the southern tibet and the southern tibet becomes one of the rainiest places in the world so the southern tibet is zoned as the humid region similar to southern tibet the large amount of precipitation in the ili river valley is influenced by the tianshan mountains which accept the water vapour from the atlantic ocean and the westerly current the precipitation amount in the ili river valley is between 200 and 400 mm yr thus the ili river valley is zoned as the semi arid region such unbalanced data tend to predict all unknown samples as the majority set in machine learning algorithms chawla et al 2004 lin and chen 2012 and may result in unsatisfactory downscaled results fig 5 demonstrates the fitting diagrams of the original annual imerg dataset and the predicted imerg derived from svm rf and gbdt at 0 1 spatial resolution in 2015 it is easy to see that both rf and gbdt had outstanding fitting performances and far outperformed svm besides the scatterplots of gbdt are clustered to the 1 1 line more closely relative to that of rf in addition we found that the rf predicted precipitation has slight underestimations over 2500 mm yr in 2015 this finding is consistent with the research conducted by shi et al 2015 that precipitation simulated by rf has underestimation relative to the original satellite precipitation estimates at the relatively high rain rate the fitting metrics between original imerg precipitation and the predicted imerg with different machine learning algorithms at 0 1 scale from 2015 to 2018 are shown in table 1 both predicted precipitation derived from rf and gbdt have higher r2 lower rmse and me values than those of svm the performance of metrics of rf and gbdt were much better than svm similar results were also demonstrated by jing et al 2016a jing et al 2016b that svm had much higher fitting residuals than rf in the tibetan plateau and northern china svm is sensitive to the kernel function and the hyperparameters of the model although all the three machine learning algorithms have conducted the grid search optimization for hyperparameters gbdt and rf as the ensemble learning are more robust than svm in addition although the r2 values of rf and gbdt are basically identical the gbdt has lower me values and 40 drops of rmse values relative to that of rf therefore the gbdt outperformed rf and svm to simulate the annual precipitation of imerg based on land surface characteristics at 0 1 scale to further analyze the spatial distribution of fitting error over mainland china we plotted the distribution of fitting residuals of gbdt rf and svm in 2015 fig 6 one can see that the predicted precipitation derived from svm has considerable fitting residuals across mainland china compared with that of rf and gbdt this is consistent with fig 5 that the fitting scatterplots of svm were much dispersed and had a lot of outliers suggesting that svm is inappropriate to simulate and downscale the precipitation estimates of imerg based on land surface characteristics over mainland china for the remaining two algorithms although rf and gbdt had much smaller fitting residuals than svm across mainland china the fitting residuals of gbdt were distributed evenly across mainland china whereas the fitting residuals of rf were found clustered over some local areas with relatively higher fitting errors especially over the areas covered by box a and box b in fig 4 over these areas with complex terrain the influencing factors of precipitation are complicated are more prone to have unbalanced precipitation relative to their surrounding areas meanwhile the gbdt model is more sensitive to the unbalanced data in modelling than rf because of its iterative residuals correcting strategy therefore we concluded that gbdt was competent to simulate the precipitation of imerg at 0 1 scale over mainland china based on land surface characteristics fitting represents the capability of simulation while it doesn t indicate the predicting capability of each machine learning algorithm because machine learning algorithms may have the excellent fitting ability on the training set but weak generalization to the data out of the training sets cross validation can be used to estimate the performance of the downscaling model itself for the testing datasets are independent of the training datasets therefore cross validation is needed here to assess the performance of the prediction of each model used in this study fig 7 shows the scatterplots of the predicted imerg datasets derived from gbdt rf and svm against the original imerg data based on 10 fold cross validation from 2015 to 2018 in general the scatterplots of each model based on cross validation showed the similar pattern with their fitting results with the best performance of gbdt and worst of svm it means that gbdt didn t show the overfitting on the training sets and still showed a strong predictive ability on the independent datasets it is clear that rf and gbdt could predict the precipitation of imerg much better than svm over mainland china both rf and gbdt had higher r2 values and much lower rmse and me values compared to svm as for the intercomparison between rf and gbdt the predicted precipitation of imerg by gbdt showed fewer outliers and more consistent with the original imerg than rf the statistical metrics of gbdt were slightly better than that of rf with relatively lower rmse and me values of gbdt it demonstrates that gbdt was more robust not only to simulate but also to predict the precipitation of imerg based on the land surface characteristics over mainland china than rf and svm 4 2 downscaled results and validation with ground observations fig 8 portrays the downscaled annual imerg precipitation by the svm rf and gbdt in 2015 it is easy to see that the downscaled precipitation derived from rf and gbdt showed a consistent spatial distribution pattern with the original imerg precipitation the downscaled imerg by gbdt and rf showed smoothed patterns when compared to the downscaled product derived from svm additionally we noticed that the distribution of downscaled precipitation by svm was quite different from the original imerg precipitation over the humid region especially over the southern tibet box a in fig 4 the downscaled precipitation by svm had significant underestimations in this area which is a finding consistent with that of jing et al 2016a moreover the downscaled precipitation by svm showed remarkable heterogeneous patches over the four climate regions we concluded that the ensemble learning may be more appropriate than svm to downscale the precipitation of imerg over mainland china based on the land surface characteristics as for the performances of downscaled precipitation by rf and gdbt it s hard to tell the difference of precipitation with the spatial resolution from 0 1 to 0 01 over the large spatial scale of mainland china therefore we selected two local areas which are located in box a and b in fig 4 to conduct a further comparison between rf and gbdt the reasons for selecting these two areas were two fold first the details of the spatial distribution of precipitation are more obvious at the local scale the second reason was to analyze the modelling applicability over the areas in which unbalanced precipitation occurred fig 9 shows comparisons with respect to the original annual imerg data and the downscaled results over the southern tibet box a in fig 4 compared with svm and rf the downscaled precipitation by gbdt shows smoother transitions over different climate regions moreover the distribution of downscaled precipitation by gbdt is closest to the original imerg fig 10 demonstrates the distributions of the original annual imerg and the downscaled precipitation over the ili river valley in northwest china box b in fig 4 it s easy to see that the distribution of downscaled precipitation by gbdt is more consistent with the original imerg data compared with that of svm and rf with the downscaled precipitation by rf having slight underestimation over the tianshan mountains therefore we concluded that the gbdt is more suitable for precipitation downscaling than svm and rf over local areas where unbalanced precipitation occurred it should be noted that the dependent variable of the spatial downscaling procedure is the satellite precipitation estimates rather than the real precipitation of the rain gauge in addition to the cross validation validation of the downscaled values against the gauge observations is also indispensable to further estimate the practicability of the downscaling algorithms fig 11 shows the scatterplots of the downscaled imerg based on different downscaling algorithms and the original imerg versus gauge observations over mainland china in 2015 the scatterplots of the downscaled imerg by gbdt and rf showed similar distribution patterns to the original imerg data whereas the svm presented a quite different pattern to the original imerg data the downscaled imerg by svm had a remarkable underestimation over 2000 mm yr and showed more outliers the metrics of the original imerg and the three downscaled imerg products against the gauge observations from 2015 to 2018 are shown in table 2 generally the downscaled results by gbdt and rf had similar values of validation metrics to the original imerg data it indicates that the downscaled precipitation by gbdt and rf improved the spatial resolution with reasonable accuracies although the me values of downscaled results by svm were lower than that of the original imerg the r2 and rmse were much worse than the original imerg it suggests that the cost of improving the spatial resolution by svm is the loss of considerable accuracies therefore we concluded that ensemble learning algorithms gbdt and rf are more applicable in spatial downscaling of precipitation over mainland china because gbdt and rf were more competent in simulation prediction and downscaling than svm 4 3 variable importance of gbdt downscaling procedure as described in the downscaling procedure we built the gbdt model for each climate region respectively the relative influence of each input predictor for the gbdt model in 2015 was illustrated in fig 12 it shows that all the eight geospatial predictors play corresponding roles in the downscaling procedure across four different climate regions over mainland china in general different land surface characteristics have different influences for gbdt modelling over different climate regions the geographical location latitude and longitude makes steady and relatively greater contributions to gbdt modelling compared with other variables it is consistent with the phenomenon that precipitation is decreasing from the southeast to the northwest of china in fig 4 suggesting geographical location plays an important role in the spatial distribution of precipitation the ndvi has more importance in semi humid and semi arid regions while has small contributions in the humid and arid regions the lst played a relatively significant role only over the humid region with the highest importance of lst n in gbdt modelling for this region however the topographic characteristics seem to have a relatively small effect on the gbdt modelling but it didn t mean that topographic characteristics were not important for gbdt simulation for the relative influence of each input predictor was derived from an entire climate region the topographic characteristics do have a significant effect on precipitation over some local areas with complex terrains like southern tibet and the ili river valley as mentioned above overall the above results verified that it is reasonable and necessary to divide mainland china into different climate regions for the non stationary relationships between precipitation and land surface characteristics 5 conclusions and future scope of work in this study a new spatial downscaling algorithm gbdt was introduced to downscale the annual precipitation estimates of imerg using multiple land surface predictors over the complex and vast territory of mainland china the annual imerg estimates at a 0 01 x0 01 gridded resolution were generated using the proposed gbdt approach the new gbdt based downscaled product was also compared those derived from other two downscaling algorithms i e svm and rf the principal conclusions of this investigation are summarized as follows 1 the geographical location is an important factor for the precipitation downscaling and makes a stable contribution to the gbdt modelling over different climate regions the roles of ndvi and lst in different climatic zones vary greatly and the topographic variables seem to have relatively small impact on the gbdt modelling over the large spatial scales 2 the results of cross validation and validation benchmarked by the ground data show that both gbdt and rf generally outperformed svm and these two machine learning algorithms exhibited operational potentials for downscaling the imerg precipitation estimates over mainland china in practice these two downscaling algorithms i e gbdt and rf can effectively improve the spatial resolution without reducing the accuracy while the cost of enhancing the spatial resolution for the svm algorithm is the loss of considerable accuracies 3 the gbdt algorithm is sensitive to the unbalanced data for its iterative residuals correction strategy results of the cross validation showed that gbdt is more appropriate for downscaling precipitation than rf over local areas where unbalanced precipitation occurred especially over those regions with complex topography therefore gbdt is relatively more robust to simulate and downscale the satellite precipitation estimates than rf at the large spatial scale looking into the future efforts will be focused on two aspects to generate satellite precipitation estimates with finer spatio temporal resolutions and higher data accuracies in the gmp era first other rainfall related predictors e g cloud optical thickness cloud water path water vapour and soil moisture would be further introduced to downscale the satellite precipitation estimates although the downscaling method proposed in this study is capable to improve the spatial resolution of satellite precipitation estimates with reasonable accuracy it didn t significantly improve the accuracy of the downscaled results when compared to original imerg retrievals the introduction of predictors like soil moisture and water vapour which have more direct relationships with rainfall may further improve the accuracy of the downscaled results on the other hand to better service for hydrological and meteorological applications high temporal resolution precipitation products are indispensable the temporal downscaling algorithms or procedures are in great need to downscale the high spatial resolution satellite precipitation estimates with higher temporal resolutions e g weekly daily and

4256,exogenous sulfate produced by anthropogenic activities in karst aquifer does not only induce groundwater pollution reduction products of sulfate may also acid cave environment however studies have not explored whether sulfate reduction can occur in pure limestone aquifer under low temperature in this study it was observed that sulfate concentrations of groundwater were high up to 131 mg l and irregularly distributed outside the cave while it dropped to low values of 3 96 mg l on average inside the cave influenced by the heterogeneity of karst development and hydrological conditions the groundwater environment exhibited oxidation or reduction and had a strong reducing condition in the saturation zone of the cave with the oxidation reduction potential orp ranging from 99 mv to 344 mv microbial community analysis revealed the presence of anaerobic bacteria in particular sulfate reducing bacteria srb was prevalent in the groundwater generally h2s could be detected at the groundwater table inside the cave with possible values ranging from 0 056 to 0 444 mg m3 the findings of this study revealed that sulfate reduction occurred specifically in the epigene karst aquifer in the presence of srb the difference in karst development and hydrological conditions as well as the increasing contaminant enrichment of the cave environment are the adduced reasons for the difference in water chemistry and the strength of sulfate reduction in the study site the volatilization of h2s into the moisture on the cave wall precipitated the oxidation of h2s to h2so4 which then participated in carbonate dissolution inducing damage to cultural relics from the cave site the results of this study have contributed to enhancement of knowledge on h2s production in epigene karst aquifers and provided scientific support to management strategies in cave sites keywords sulfate hydrogen sulfide reducing condition cave environment epigene karst 1 introduction sulfur plays an important role in global biogeochemical cycling on earth and is primarily preserved in sulfate evaporates and pyrite zerkle et al 2016 sulfur elements migrate into soils surface and groundwater and is a major cause of environmental acidification samborska et al 2013 sulfate so4 2 in water is usually from sulfate minerals e g gypsum oxidation of sulfide minerals e g pyrite rainfall volcanic activity fernando et al 2018 hosono et al 2011 or anthropogenic activities such as sewage fertilizer and manure samborska et al 2013 excessive so4 2 concentration in water environment threatens the potability of drinking water decimates the health of aquatic ecosystems and corrodes buildings huang et al 2019 in carbonate rock regions the entry of sulfur into the environment may induce further dissolution and weathering li et al 2008 precipitating unpredictable consequences such as void expansion in caves in general the dissolution of carbonate rocks is induced primarily by the action of carbonic acid formed by atmospheric soil co2 and water exogenous acids such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid can also dissolve carbonate rocks and emit co2 into the atmosphere as a carbon source thereby affecting local or global carbon cycle huang et al 2017 recently there has been a surge in research and literatures on the topic of sulfur in carbonate dissolution for example sulfuric acid accelerate the rate of chemical weathering at the yangtze river basin by an average of approximately 28 through participation in the weathering rate of carbonate rocks present at the basin zhang et al 2016 although there are numerous studies on the relationship between sulfur and carbonate dissolution however most of them are focused on the degree of groundwater pollution in carbonate rocks area caused by sulfuric acid sun et al 2017 or the extent of increase in carbon sink when sulfur is involved in carbonate weathering in a hydrological basin scale spence and telmer 2005 xie et al 2021 to our knowledge there is scant research on how sulfur changes local cave environment after entering the karst aquifer it is a common perception that the formation of karst especially conduits or caves is a slow process that entails the dissolution of carbonate rocks by carbonic acid under natural conditions however studies have shown that when exogenous acids are present they may induce more karst development or cave expansion owing to accelerated dissolution ford and williams 2007 the role of sulfuric acid formed by oxidation of hydrogen sulfide dissolved in underground waters during the dissolution of carbonate rocks is well known and has been actively studied and investigated over the past five decades klimchouk 2007 sulfuric acid speleogenesis sas is a process that involves the dissolution of limestone by sulfuric acid that is derived from h2s degassing from hypogene water fed by deep sources as demonstrated at the lower kane cave wyoming egemeier 1981 acidity originates from sulfides associated with volcanism hydrocarbons sulfide ores or microbial reduction of sulfates at great depth palmer and palmer 2012 the role of h2s in hypogene systems has been explicitly elucidated and widely understood audra et al 2015 in contrast research on h2s produced in epigene systems gutiérrez et al 2019 remains limited in the anaerobic environment of sulfate rich groundwater sulfate reduction may occur through the process of anaerobic respiration employing sulfate as the final electron acceptor the reduction can occur by thermochemical sulfate reduction induced by hydrocarbons and sulfate bacterial sulfate reduction bsr precipitated by the action of microorganisms and dissimilatory sulfate reduction machel et al 1995 mayrhofer et al 2014 dissimilatory srb utilizes organic compounds as electron donors for the reduction hansen 1994 muyzer and stams 2008 even though the bsr is well known and regarded as a common process most sulfate reducing bacteria prefer temperatures up to 80 c machel 2001 orr 1977 the temperature of groundwater environment is generally equivalent to the annual average temperature in the epigene karst in southern china for example it is about 17 21 oc in guilin city in such a low temperature environment it is unknown whether bsr can still occur however if it happens one of the most imperative products of sulfate reduction h2s can be oxidized to h2so4 the latter is a strong acid which reacts swiftly with the carbonate host rock thereby amplifying the carbonate dissolution d angeli et al 2021 a site cave or occupied cave is a site where ancient humans once inhabited or used leaving evidences and antiquities of native culture preservation of cave sites is often impeded by a variety of threats owing to the fact that cave sites are exposed to the natural environment for example mechanical damage induced by flooding erosion caused by groundwater level fluctuations guo et al 2015 karst collapse increased co2 concentration caused by tourist visits are some of the threats impeding cave sites preservation in industrial agricultural or urban areas that are significantly affected by anthropogenic activities caves located in the seasonal groundwater fluctuation zone may also experience groundwater contamination problems mazina et al 2009 however studies on the impact of toxic deleterious or corrosive gases produced by groundwater pollution on the cave environment are rare the objective of the present study was to expand the knowledge of sulfate conversion in karst aquifers in order to verify whether h2s production can occur in epigene karst aquifer at low temperature of less than 21 c and to discuss the impact of acceleration of carbonate dissolution on cultural material protection to achieve this goal we observed the hydrological dynamic of groundwater in the zengpiyan cave system and studied their sulfate concentrations and organic matter temporally and spatially the oxidation reduction conditions and srb were also measured to confirm the onset of bsr the effects of corrosive gas on carbonate dissolution especially in cave sites were assessed through dissolution experiments employing standard limestone tablets this paper provides new insights into the production of h2s in epigene karst aquifers and the attendant consequences in normal temperature conditions as well as draws attention to the need to safeguard carbonate cave sites from gas erosion due to groundwater pollution 2 study area zengpiyan is a karst cave that developed in the limestone fenglin peak forest landscape of the guilin city south china the cave system develops at the foot of an isolated peak du hill and includes a main cave cave site a lower cave lc and a water cave d1 as well as other solution cavities that are impassably small fig 1 the main cave is semi open with a broad entrance it has a width and height of 10 m and 4 m respectively a 3 m thick cultural layer is deposited in the cave in 1967 thirteen complete ancient human skeletons and a massive number of cultural relics such as stone tools pottery animal bones plant seeds etc were unearthed from the main cave it has become an imperative and valuable archaeological site for holocene cultural research in south china providing important evidence on anthropogenic activities that were carried out at the site between 12 000 and 7 000 years ago in order to better protect the site a national archaeological park was established there in 2014 the d1 is located in the southeast of the main cave and has an area of about 300 m2 it is separated from other caves by narrow bedrock partitions still existing d1 is filled with water all year round and has never been known or reported to dry up the lower cave is also partially filled with water and hydrologically connected to the water cave the cave site is located in the seasonal groundwater fluctuation zone jiang et al 2020 the zengpiyan cave system is developed in carbonate rocks of the guilin formation d3g upper devonian and has a depth of about 200 300 m the limestone is pure thick massively bedded and without any pyrite the surroundings of the peak are a cover of quaternary clay capped by silt clay and gravel with total thicknesses ranging from 0 to 30 m the annual average air temperature of the zengpiyan area is 18 19 in addition it has an average annual precipitation of 1896 mm and an annual average evaporation of 1414 mm the air temperature and humidity in the main cave range between 17 and 21 and 63 100 respectively the variation in groundwater level and water temperature is approximately 1 1 5 m and 1 3 respectively some factories were established upstream of the zengpiyan cave system between the 1990 s and 1970 s in this regard a former brick factory located to the north of zengpiyan had the greatest impact on the cave system although the factory was closed in 1991 the cinder utilized during its manufacture was permanently buried in the ground around the cave the zengpiyan cave system is located down gradient of the disposal areas there are also some residential quarters around the cave that discharge sewage directly into it without treatment 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrological monitoring automatic water level recorders and air pressure gauges have been installed in selected boreholes since 2013 water levels were automatically recorded employing solinst levelogger solinstcanada ltd at an interval of 15 min a baro solinst was also employed for pressure correction simultaneously meteorological indicators such as rainfall and temperature were automatically recorded using a hobo data logging weather station installed at the zengpiyan site with a recording time interval of 15 min the depth of groundwater in the boreholes was measured employing a solinst model 107 tlc meter every two or three months 3 2 sampling sites a total of 24 boreholes were arranged in the zengpiyan cave system according to the hydrogeological conditions the cave system and its surrounding groundwater were divided into an upstream zone zone 1 site zone 2 and downstream zone zone 3 fig 1 zone 1 covers the contaminant source zone while zones 2 and 3 are the pollutant diffusion zones water sampling points included conduit water fissure water and surface water in the pools the conduit water samples had conduit flow intercepted by boreholes and cave water at the foot cave 3 3 physicochemical measurement a wtw 3430 water quality multi parameter was used to measure water temperature t ph specific electrical conductivity sec and orp in situ with resolutions of 0 1 0 001 ph unit 1 μs cm and 0 1 mv respectively a merck german alkalinity meter and hardness meter were employed to establish the ionic concentrations of hco3 and ca2 by titration with an accuracy of 0 1 mmol l and 2 mg l respectively 3 4 ions and doc analysis in the groundwater ions and dissolved organic carbon doc were measured between 2016 and 2019 every one to three months triple rinsed clean polyethylene bottles were employed to take 50 ml filtered water samples for anion determination 30 ml filtered water samples were

immediately after sampling the chromogenic reagent was added and the samples were brought to the laboratory an ultraviolet spectrophotometer t6 new century type was employed for colorimetric quantification at a wavelength of 665 nm within 6 h the detection limit was 0 003 mg m3 3 6 microbial community structure and the srb testing in december 2019 two grams of each water sample was collected a peristaltic pump was used to collect water from boreholes and the original 15 l water was discarded before collection of samples water samples were filtered employing sterile mixed fibers membrane with a pore size of 0 22 μm on site the bacterial 16s rrna genes of the dna were amplified with the e 515fmodf 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 907r 5 ccgtcaattcmtttragttt 3 the bacterial community was investigated by high throughput sequencing on an illumina sequencing system in the laboratory of the majorbio biopharm technology co ltd shanghai china operational taxonomic units otus

positive reactions in the test bottle black precipitates or filaments the mpn was determined china national petroleum corporation 2012 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrological conditions of groundwater at the foot cave system generally the direction of groundwater flow in zengpiyan area is from northwest to southeast as illustrated in fig 1 this served as the basis for the classification of groundwater into upstream and downstream zones groundwater runoff which is affected by heterogeneity of karst development and groundwater dynamics is delineated as main channel formed by foot caves and karst conduits and secondary channels formed by network of fractures the groundwater migration velocity between d2 and d1 in the main channel was 31 7 42 m day while that of the secondary channel was only 4 8 12 2 m day which is more than three times lower than the main route zeng et al 2016 d1 is the lowest cave in the foot cave system and is filled with groundwater all year round making it a local collection point of groundwater d2 and d1 are connected by a concentrated conduit flow zone groundwater is stored and flows in four distinct media zones concentrated conduit flow zone highly fractured zone cave sediment zone and matrix with fractures zone with the foot caves constituting the primary groundwater flow zone jiang et al 2020 these different types of media zones influence the physicochemical parameters of groundwater and make them to vary significantly on a local scale the elevation level of groundwater in the zengpiyan area ranged from 151 to 153 m the depth of groundwater ranged from 2 2 to 9 5 m while the difference between zone 2 and zone 3 was small with values ranging from 1 4 to 4 7 m most of the changes in water level at the same observation site were 1 2 m the groundwater depth in the main cave ranged from 1 5 to 2 7 m the maximum difference between the water depth in dry season and rainy season was 1 2 m the cultural layer of the main cave is located in the seasonal fluctuation zone of the groundwater due to elevation of the top and bottom surfaces of the site is 154 151 m which is 3 m below the surface groundwater dynamics precipitates alternating contact or separation between the site and groundwater causing damage to the cultural material through water flushing dissolution and gas erosion zk9 and zk21 boreholes were selected to represent groundwater in the concentrated conduit flow zone and matrix with fractures zone respectively groundwater of both boreholes was sensitive to rainfall in most period of the hydrological year water level in the matrix with fractures zone was higher than that in the concentrated conduit flow zone fig 2 the rise in water level during the rainy season induced flooding in the cave causing inundation of the cultural material stability is gradually attained in the change in groundwater during dry season although groundwater is separated from the site during that time the release of gas from groundwater nonetheless can cause erosion 4 2 general hydrochemical characteristics the data presented in this study include 194 samples obtained at 3 foot caves 13 boreholes and 1 pool with 2 13 samples per point within a period of 2 years an overview of physicochemical values of the water samples is given in table 1 the ph of groundwater was between 6 19 and 8 26 with an average value of 7 38 indicating a weakly alkaline groundwater the water temperature sec concentration of ca2 and hco3 were in the range of 13 29 7 c 307 936 μs cm 45 178 mg l and 146 4 524 9 mg l respectively the pool p1 had the highest ph and water temperature even though the main water source of the pool comes from groundwater flowing in the direction of d1 to zk9 the hydrochemical characteristics of the pool exhibited the properties of surface water because of the exposure to air and mixing with other water sources such as rainwater in addition the pool water had the lowest value of hco3 high sec values were observed mainly in zk6 zk9 zk11 and zk14 the lowest values of ca2 was observed in zk10 which is the borehole located in the main cave ca2 and mg2 accounted for 53 8 83 and 10 3 43 6 respectively of the total cations ca2 had the largest mass concentration of cation followed by mg2 na and k the average concentrations were 98 26 mg l 13 35 mg l 5 51 mg l 3 01 mg l respectively hco3 and so4 2 were the dominant anions hco3 accounted for 68 1 91 5 of the total anions and so4 2 for 2 4 28 8 of the total anions from the average values the order of mass concentration of the anions is hco3 so4 2 cl and no3 with average concentrations of 288 49 mg l 59 29 mg l 6 52 mg l 5 28 mg l respectively furthermore the molar ratio between ca2 mg2 and hco3 ranged from 0 35 to 0 91 fig 3 with 90 of the ratio more than 0 5 indicating that h2so4 and or hno3 participated in carbonate dissolution li et al 2010 the main type of water chemical in the study area is thus a ca hco3 facies but there are also other types including ca hco3 so4 ca mg hco3 or ca mg hco3 so4 among the 164 samples analyzed statistically the frequency of sulfate radicals reached a value of 17 fig 3 in the pure limestone regions of guilin the geochemistry of groundwater is dominated naturally by ca hco3 or ca mg hco3 water types in this study area the participation of sulfate in the classification of water types indicated that the geochemistry is disturbed by anthropogenic activities and that sulfate is the main contaminant in groundwater from the perspective of the spatial change of sec there was no trend of attenuation along the flow path even though the samples were closed to each other their sec was distinctly different for example although the distance between zk8 and zk9 was only 15 m their sec differed up to 189 μs cm simultaneously the difference in physicochemical parameters indicates several points worthy of mention firstly the aqueous medium is diverse and heterogeneous high density electrical conductivity and boreholes drilling demonstrated that thirteen of the 24 boreholes had open karst caves ranging from 0 3 m 17 5 m in height more suspected caves were found in front of the main cave but the probability of having karst caves in other areas is low jiang et al 2020 therefore based on the caves and fractures intercepted by boreholes and a combination of dye tracers the storage and migration of groundwater in the range of 0 1 km2 could be divided into three patterns fissure flow conduit flow and cave flow table 2 the zk10 represents a very peculiar site it is the only borehole located in the main cave with a total depth of 73 2 m although the borehole uncovered a 5 5 m deep cave the cave was isolated without distinct hydraulic connection to the surrounding groundwater consequently it is considered as fissure flow secondly the pollutant sources and transport pathway were different even the downstream groundwater had the same primary sources of pollutant from the former brick factory the concentrations of pollutants at downstream were inconsistent owing to groundwater transport routes composed of primary and secondary flow paths the secondary pollution source is domestic sewage which is generally point pollution and groundwater close to the pollution source is significantly impacted thirdly at the downstream area the degree of pollutant attenuation was different due to the different environmental condition of groundwater for example the karst fracture medium had low dissolved oxygen with strong reducing condition which indicates a high possibility of pollutant reduction in the karst conduit medium the oxidizing capacity was strong resulting in a low possibility of pollutant reduction 4 3 groundwater redox conditions and microbial characteristics the coexistence of fissures conduits and karst caves in the aquifer coupled with the difference in soil cover thickness and aeration conditions of the underground space may increase the possibility of the groundwater having different oxidation or reduction conditions the orp is used to show the macroscopic oxidation reduction properties of all substances in an aqueous solution a positive potential indicates that the solution has undergone a certain degree of oxidation while a negative potential indicates that the solution has undergone reduction khanal and huang 2003 in the 194 in situ measurements 159 displayed positive orp while 35 were negative indicating that the reducing conditions attained 18 at the observed times among the samples with positive orp values most were between 100 and 200 mv and a few were greater than 300 mv suggesting that the overall oxidation was not strong the orp at zk10 ranged from 99 mv to 344 mv and was always negative indicating strong reducing conditions a small number of the boreholes produced both oxidation and reduction values at different times for example zk6 zk7 and zk8 experienced reducing conditions in the dry season often changing into oxidizing conditions in the rainy season fig 4 reasons for the difference have been stated to include conditions of aqueous medium microorganisms content of organic carbon and dissolved oxygen su et al 2016 contrasting positive or negative orp values recorded even in boreholes close to each other is attributed to the structure of the different karst medium groundwater that is dominated by fast flow in boreholes where karst conduits or caves were intercepted often presented in oxidizing conditions because of the good atmospheric connectivity in situations where there were no nearby karst conduits the underground environment was relatively stable and the groundwater circulation was slow presenting reducing conditions the microbial community is an important factor in groundwater material circulation energy conversion and information transmission also it is a comprehensive reflection of the groundwater environment microbial community has a specific response mechanism to pollutants specific microbial community can handle certain pollutants by degrading them krell et al 2013 and be beneficial to their own growth and reproduction simultaneously the composition analysis of microbial community showed that the dominant species of microbial community at genus level were similar for all samples but the relative abundance varied significantly among samples fig 5 at genus level the dominant species were sulfurimonas accounting for 61 13 norank f norank o candidatus kaiserbacteria 22 30 norank f hydrogenophilaceae 24 67 and norank f hydrogenophilaceae 89 67 at zk6 zk7 zk8 and zk10 respectively all of these four species belong to the class of anaerobic bacteria the dominant species of norank f hydrogenophilaceae at zk10 were observed to grow in the anaerobic environment belonging to γ proteobacteria which contains several kinds of microbial community associated with sulfate reduction and the capacity to degrade organic contaminants wang et al 2013 the statistical results of species classification indicated that the srb was prevalent in the zengpiyan vicinity srb are mainly distributed in 8 families of the δ proteobacteria desulfarculaceae desulfobacteraceae desulfobulbaceae desulfomicrobiaceae desulfovibrionaceae desulfuromonadaceae syntrophaceae and syntrophobacteraceae in order to better comprehend the change in srb the water was sampled and cultivated in the laboratory srb is a class of functional bacteria with different morphologies that employ sulfate or other oxidized sulfides as electron acceptors to dissimilate organic matter and obtain energy under anoxic or anaerobic conditions barton 1995a it is extensively present in soil seawater river water underground pipelines oil and gas reservoirs etc maeda et al 2000 in the course of their metabolic activities srb usually change the nature of certain constituents in the environment barton 1995b including the consumption of organic matter and sulfate and production of h2s barton et al 2014 five sampling and cultivation tests demonstrated that sixty of the 63 groundwater samples contained srb with the number ranging from 1 250 cfu ml suggesting that the srb is extensively distributed in the groundwater the number of srb was greater in the rainy season compared to the dry season fig 6 4 4 sulfate concentration and its conversion product so4 2 was analyzed in 188 samples taken on eleven different occasions the maximum value of so4 2 was 131 mg l and the minimum value was 0 56 mg l so4 2 concentration of 50 60 mg l was the most frequent exceeding 20 followed by 20 30 mg l samples with so4 2 concentration values of 0 10 mg l close to 10 and values as great as 90 100 mg l were also observed in the statistical data indicating that so4 2 concentrations in the study area varies distinctively spatially the concentration of so4 2 in the upstream area y6 and y8 was the highest fig 7 the upstream area was the original coal cinder burning area of the former brick factory which was confirmed as the source of so4 2 pollution precipitated by the isotope of sulfate zeng 2017 although the factory was closed in 1991 the cinders buried in the ground continued to leach producing sulfates that continuously percolate into groundwater the average concentrations of so4 2 in the downstream zone ranged from 25 to 60 mg l with the exception of zk10 the so4 2 concentrations of zk10 were abnormally low with an average value of 3 96 mg l which was 12 times lower than the values of other water samples in this area in addition the nitrate concentration of zk10 was also abnormally low with the lowest value of 0 and an average value of 1 0 mg l the average concentration of no3 in nearest boreholes zk8 and zk9 was 6 14 mg l and the maximum values could reach 18 08 mg l these indicate that sulfate and nitrate might both be undergoing reduction under the negative orp condition in the main cave zhang et al 2021 culminating in low values of so4 2 and no3 that being the case under reducing conditions sulfate is most likely to be reduced to h2s during the observation periods it was found that some boreholes gave off a pungent odor indicating that some types of gas may have been generated the monitoring results showed that h2s could be detected everywhere inside the cave including zk10 lc d1 dt6 with the concentrations ranging from 0 056 0 444 mg m3 table 3 the 73 2 m deep borehole of zk10 covers an aeration vadose zone and a saturated phreatic zone the sulfate in the saturated zone undergoes reduction and then its product is released into the vadose zone lc is the lowest part of the main cave and is a relatively more closed cave so the concentration of h2s is the highest there h2s could also be detected in the exploration pit dt6 and air kq indicating that h2s produced by sulfate reduction in the saturated zone is unstable and volatilizes swiftly into the upper vadose zone as well as the open air lc lower cave kq the air of the main cave from the seasonal perspective h2s concentrations at zk10 were often high in summer and autumn and low in spring and winter fig 8 it was found that h2s concentrations had a significant correlation with the air temperature microbial metabolism is more active at high summer temperatures which may be the primary reason for the more intense sulfate reduction bhattarai et al 2018 the correlation between changes in groundwater level groundwater velocity and h2s concentration showed that the rate of renewal of groundwater may influence the conversion rates of the sulfate sulfate reduction in groundwater requires certain conditions in addition to the availability of sulfate electron donors electron acceptors are also required as well as microorganisms the reaction equation can be expressed as follows roesler et al 2007 where ch2o here stands for organic matter so4 2 2ch2o 2hco3 h2s 1 so4 2 2ch2o 2h 2co2 h2s 2h2o 2 so4 2 2ch2o 2hco3 hs h 3 electron acceptors are supplied by organic matter which includes human excrement organic acids carbohydrates or solid organic matter the zengpiyan is located in the downtown area and there are some old communities still existing around the vicinity domestic sewage and waste are discharged in situ without any treatment culminating in a high organic matter content in the groundwater doc is the main energy source for microbial metabolism in groundwater and it has important indicators for groundwater environmental changes and microbial action processes the average mass concentration of doc in the zengpiyan area varied from 6 41 to 12 63 mg l and the total average concentration was 8 86 mg l according to the regulations of the international water association the doc concentration of pollution free water sources should be less than 1 5 mg l jiang 2018 doc content in the study area was much higher than the standard value fig 9 also shows that the highest doc concentrations are located in the upstream of the cave system in the study area the theoretical conditions required for sulfate reduction were all satisfied and therefore the chemical reactions could proceed naturally based on this the production of h2s gas in the epigene karst aquifer under reducing conditions is descripted as fig 10 in relatively isolated caves or fractured media with weak groundwater hydraulic connections groundwater is prone to experience reducing conditions and sulfates will undergo bsr reactions this is the case of zk10 in karst conduit or relatively open media groundwater is prone to undergo oxidizing conditions and the sulfate reduction ability is weak or does not occur although h2s could also be detected in the zengpiyan area however their concentrations were low compared to the h2s value in the hypogene caves d angeli et al 2021 the reasons for this are firstly the concentration of sulfate and organic matter was less than 100 mg l and 15 mg l respectively which may indicate that electron acceptors and donors are limited secondly the temperature of the environment was relatively low ranging from 17 to 21 c research on the saturated zone of landfills has shown that redox rates of bsr are highest at 50 60 c jin et al 2020 thirdly h2s is highly unstable and volatilizes swiftly or undergoes oxidation in addition to these factors in a karst aquifer where caves fracture and matrix drainage coexist h2s is more difficult to retain 4 5 the impact of sulfate reduction on the cave environment the products of sulfate reduction depend on a series of conditions such as ph redox potential iron ion concentration and the abundance of microorganisms deverel et al 1986 h2s is one of the primary products of the reduction and one of the substances that can induce significant damage to the environment the h2s produced by sulfate reduction is oxidized to h2so4 which is a strong highly corrosive acid in non karst areas the dissolution capacity of h2s oxidation might be neglected but in karst areas they can promote accelerated karst development iurkiewicz and stevanovic 2010 or precipitate geological disasters such as collapse it is well known that h2s production and oxidation in the s o h system plays the principal role in the formation of certain types of caves palmer 1991 kirkland 2014 the volatilization of h2s from groundwater to the cave atmosphere and the oxidation of h2s to sulfuric acid on moist cave walls results in spontaneous reaction with the carbonate rock which can form large cavities the reaction equations are h2s 2o2 h2so4 4 h2so4 caco3 ca2 so4 2 co2 h2o 5 h2so4 caco3 h2o caso4 2h2o co2 6 carbonate dissolution by sulfuric acid or organic acid can be verified through different means gams 1981 initiated the study of dissolution of standard limestone tablets which was applied to different locations in the zengpiyan area e g suspended in the air groundwater air interface and at different depths in the water it was found that most of the tablets experienced substantial dissolution indicating that the modern cave environment is very corrosive fig 11 zk10 had the strongest reducing condition however it did not have the maximum dissolution rates of carbonate the reasons are that the dissolution of carbonate rock is induced by both co2 and h2s also flowing water is required for dissolution in the closed cave system the sources of co2 are limited liu et al 2007 with poor groundwater mobility in this case although the h2s was relativity high the dissolution rate was not necessarily the highest nevertheless the participation of h2s amplifies the capacity of carbonate dissolution and the attendant consequences which threatens the cave environment in the future the mineral composition of the standard limestone tablets should be identified to confirm the presence of gypsum the product of sulfuric acid corrosion of carbonate rocks when the saturation indexes for calcite c si dolomite d si and gypsum g si were calculated it was found that c si was between 0 36 and 0 72 d si between 0 00 and 1 05 and g si between 3 69 and 1 29 c si and d si had positive values while the standard limestone tablets still exhibited dissolution capacity indicating that the corrosion of the standard limestone tablets was not caused by carbonic acid only thus confirming that other acids sulfuric acid and organic had participated in the dissolution processes the cultural layer is a key symbol of ancient human cave sites in the zengpiyan cave site the main physical evidence existing in the cultural layer is snail shells it was observed that old snail shells buried in the cultural layer also displayed effects of recent significant weathering when touched with the hand surfaces were clearly powdery and some of this residuum fell off directly the originally hard calcareous nodules had become soft indicating that the environment has been acidified 5 conclusion the coal and cinders left by the former industry in a karst peak forest plain are continuously leached by rainwater resulting in high sulfate concentrations in the famous downstream cultural cave site sulfate concentrations of the groundwater showed irregular distribution because of the heterogeneity of karst development and hydrological conditions the sulfate is almost exhausted as it approaches and enters the main cave due to reduction reactions by pollutant monitoring measurement of groundwater redox conditions and srb bacterial cultures the mechanism of h2s production from sulfate reduction in epigene karst aquifers was uncovered in the fissure dominated karst medium the groundwater environment gradually becomes anaerobic the reduction of sulfate to sulfide occurs when sulfate acts as the electron receptor in the oxidation of organic matter once h2s is produced it is released into the overlying aeration zone via fractures or solution conduits and collects in the cave a combination of enhanced weathering of old snail shells in the cultural layer of the site cave experiments with standard limestone dissolution tablets and determination of the calcite saturation index confirmed that sulfuric acid plays a role in the dissolution of the carbonate rocks this study reveals that sulfate can also undergo reduction reactions at low temperatures in epigene karst aquifer the preservation of the zengpiyan cultural site is threatened by acidification of the environment regular monitoring for toxic deleterious or corrosive gases is recommended for the protection of such important cave sites credit authorship contribution

4256,exogenous sulfate produced by anthropogenic activities in karst aquifer does not only induce groundwater pollution reduction products of sulfate may also acid cave environment however studies have not explored whether sulfate reduction can occur in pure limestone aquifer under low temperature in this study it was observed that sulfate concentrations of groundwater were high up to 131 mg l and irregularly distributed outside the cave while it dropped to low values of 3 96 mg l on average inside the cave influenced by the heterogeneity of karst development and hydrological conditions the groundwater environment exhibited oxidation or reduction and had a strong reducing condition in the saturation zone of the cave with the oxidation reduction potential orp ranging from 99 mv to 344 mv microbial community analysis revealed the presence of anaerobic bacteria in particular sulfate reducing bacteria srb was prevalent in the groundwater generally h2s could be detected at the groundwater table inside the cave with possible values ranging from 0 056 to 0 444 mg m3 the findings of this study revealed that sulfate reduction occurred specifically in the epigene karst aquifer in the presence of srb the difference in karst development and hydrological conditions as well as the increasing contaminant enrichment of the cave environment are the adduced reasons for the difference in water chemistry and the strength of sulfate reduction in the study site the volatilization of h2s into the moisture on the cave wall precipitated the oxidation of h2s to h2so4 which then participated in carbonate dissolution inducing damage to cultural relics from the cave site the results of this study have contributed to enhancement of knowledge on h2s production in epigene karst aquifers and provided scientific support to management strategies in cave sites keywords sulfate hydrogen sulfide reducing condition cave environment epigene karst 1 introduction sulfur plays an important role in global biogeochemical cycling on earth and is primarily preserved in sulfate evaporates and pyrite zerkle et al 2016 sulfur elements migrate into soils surface and groundwater and is a major cause of environmental acidification samborska et al 2013 sulfate so4 2 in water is usually from sulfate minerals e g gypsum oxidation of sulfide minerals e g pyrite rainfall volcanic activity fernando et al 2018 hosono et al 2011 or anthropogenic activities such as sewage fertilizer and manure samborska et al 2013 excessive so4 2 concentration in water environment threatens the potability of drinking water decimates the health of aquatic ecosystems and corrodes buildings huang et al 2019 in carbonate rock regions the entry of sulfur into the environment may induce further dissolution and weathering li et al 2008 precipitating unpredictable consequences such as void expansion in caves in general the dissolution of carbonate rocks is induced primarily by the action of carbonic acid formed by atmospheric soil co2 and water exogenous acids such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid can also dissolve carbonate rocks and emit co2 into the atmosphere as a carbon source thereby affecting local or global carbon cycle huang et al 2017 recently there has been a surge in research and literatures on the topic of sulfur in carbonate dissolution for example sulfuric acid accelerate the rate of chemical weathering at the yangtze river basin by an average of approximately 28 through participation in the weathering rate of carbonate rocks present at the basin zhang et al 2016 although there are numerous studies on the relationship between sulfur and carbonate dissolution however most of them are focused on the degree of groundwater pollution in carbonate rocks area caused by sulfuric acid sun et al 2017 or the extent of increase in carbon sink when sulfur is involved in carbonate weathering in a hydrological basin scale spence and telmer 2005 xie et al 2021 to our knowledge there is scant research on how sulfur changes local cave environment after entering the karst aquifer it is a common perception that the formation of karst especially conduits or caves is a slow process that entails the dissolution of carbonate rocks by carbonic acid under natural conditions however studies have shown that when exogenous acids are present they may induce more karst development or cave expansion owing to accelerated dissolution ford and williams 2007 the role of sulfuric acid formed by oxidation of hydrogen sulfide dissolved in underground waters during the dissolution of carbonate rocks is well known and has been actively studied and investigated over the past five decades klimchouk 2007 sulfuric acid speleogenesis sas is a process that involves the dissolution of limestone by sulfuric acid that is derived from h2s degassing from hypogene water fed by deep sources as demonstrated at the lower kane cave wyoming egemeier 1981 acidity originates from sulfides associated with volcanism hydrocarbons sulfide ores or microbial reduction of sulfates at great depth palmer and palmer 2012 the role of h2s in hypogene systems has been explicitly elucidated and widely understood audra et al 2015 in contrast research on h2s produced in epigene systems gutiérrez et al 2019 remains limited in the anaerobic environment of sulfate rich groundwater sulfate reduction may occur through the process of anaerobic respiration employing sulfate as the final electron acceptor the reduction can occur by thermochemical sulfate reduction induced by hydrocarbons and sulfate bacterial sulfate reduction bsr precipitated by the action of microorganisms and dissimilatory sulfate reduction machel et al 1995 mayrhofer et al 2014 dissimilatory srb utilizes organic compounds as electron donors for the reduction hansen 1994 muyzer and stams 2008 even though the bsr is well known and regarded as a common process most sulfate reducing bacteria prefer temperatures up to 80 c machel 2001 orr 1977 the temperature of groundwater environment is generally equivalent to the annual average temperature in the epigene karst in southern china for example it is about 17 21 oc in guilin city in such a low temperature environment it is unknown whether bsr can still occur however if it happens one of the most imperative products of sulfate reduction h2s can be oxidized to h2so4 the latter is a strong acid which reacts swiftly with the carbonate host rock thereby amplifying the carbonate dissolution d angeli et al 2021 a site cave or occupied cave is a site where ancient humans once inhabited or used leaving evidences and antiquities of native culture preservation of cave sites is often impeded by a variety of threats owing to the fact that cave sites are exposed to the natural environment for example mechanical damage induced by flooding erosion caused by groundwater level fluctuations guo et al 2015 karst collapse increased co2 concentration caused by tourist visits are some of the threats impeding cave sites preservation in industrial agricultural or urban areas that are significantly affected by anthropogenic activities caves located in the seasonal groundwater fluctuation zone may also experience groundwater contamination problems mazina et al 2009 however studies on the impact of toxic deleterious or corrosive gases produced by groundwater pollution on the cave environment are rare the objective of the present study was to expand the knowledge of sulfate conversion in karst aquifers in order to verify whether h2s production can occur in epigene karst aquifer at low temperature of less than 21 c and to discuss the impact of acceleration of carbonate dissolution on cultural material protection to achieve this goal we observed the hydrological dynamic of groundwater in the zengpiyan cave system and studied their sulfate concentrations and organic matter temporally and spatially the oxidation reduction conditions and srb were also measured to confirm the onset of bsr the effects of corrosive gas on carbonate dissolution especially in cave sites were assessed through dissolution experiments employing standard limestone tablets this paper provides new insights into the production of h2s in epigene karst aquifers and the attendant consequences in normal temperature conditions as well as draws attention to the need to safeguard carbonate cave sites from gas erosion due to groundwater pollution 2 study area zengpiyan is a karst cave that developed in the limestone fenglin peak forest landscape of the guilin city south china the cave system develops at the foot of an isolated peak du hill and includes a main cave cave site a lower cave lc and a water cave d1 as well as other solution cavities that are impassably small fig 1 the main cave is semi open with a broad entrance it has a width and height of 10 m and 4 m respectively a 3 m thick cultural layer is deposited in the cave in 1967 thirteen complete ancient human skeletons and a massive number of cultural relics such as stone tools pottery animal bones plant seeds etc were unearthed from the main cave it has become an imperative and valuable archaeological site for holocene cultural research in south china providing important evidence on anthropogenic activities that were carried out at the site between 12 000 and 7 000 years ago in order to better protect the site a national archaeological park was established there in 2014 the d1 is located in the southeast of the main cave and has an area of about 300 m2 it is separated from other caves by narrow bedrock partitions still existing d1 is filled with water all year round and has never been known or reported to dry up the lower cave is also partially filled with water and hydrologically connected to the water cave the cave site is located in the seasonal groundwater fluctuation zone jiang et al 2020 the zengpiyan cave system is developed in carbonate rocks of the guilin formation d3g upper devonian and has a depth of about 200 300 m the limestone is pure thick massively bedded and without any pyrite the surroundings of the peak are a cover of quaternary clay capped by silt clay and gravel with total thicknesses ranging from 0 to 30 m the annual average air temperature of the zengpiyan area is 18 19 in addition it has an average annual precipitation of 1896 mm and an annual average evaporation of 1414 mm the air temperature and humidity in the main cave range between 17 and 21 and 63 100 respectively the variation in groundwater level and water temperature is approximately 1 1 5 m and 1 3 respectively some factories were established upstream of the zengpiyan cave system between the 1990 s and 1970 s in this regard a former brick factory located to the north of zengpiyan had the greatest impact on the cave system although the factory was closed in 1991 the cinder utilized during its manufacture was permanently buried in the ground around the cave the zengpiyan cave system is located down gradient of the disposal areas there are also some residential quarters around the cave that discharge sewage directly into it without treatment 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrological monitoring automatic water level recorders and air pressure gauges have been installed in selected boreholes since 2013 water levels were automatically recorded employing solinst levelogger solinstcanada ltd at an interval of 15 min a baro solinst was also employed for pressure correction simultaneously meteorological indicators such as

boreholes was measured employing a solinst model 107 tlc meter every two or three months 3 2 sampling sites a total of 24 boreholes were arranged in the zengpiyan cave system according to the hydrogeological conditions the cave system and its surrounding groundwater were divided into an upstream zone zone 1 site zone 2 and downstream zone zone 3 fig 1 zone 1 covers the contaminant source zone while zones 2 and 3 are the pollutant diffusion zones water sampling points included conduit water fissure water and surface water in the pools the conduit water samples had conduit flow intercepted by boreholes and cave water at the foot cave 3 3 physicochemical measurement a wtw 3430 water quality multi parameter was used to measure water temperature t ph specific electrical conductivity sec and orp in situ with resolutions of 0 1 0 001 ph unit 1 μs cm and 0 1 mv respectively a merck german alkalinity meter and hardness meter were employed to establish the ionic concentrations of hco3 and ca2 by titration with an accuracy of 0 1 mmol l and 2 mg l respectively 3 4 ions and doc analysis in the groundwater ions and dissolved organic carbon doc were measured between 2016 and 2019 every one to three months triple rinsed clean polyethylene bottles were employed to take 50 ml filtered water samples for anion determination 30 ml filtered water samples were

groundwater at the foot cave system generally the direction of groundwater flow in zengpiyan area is from northwest to southeast as illustrated in fig 1 this served as the basis for the classification of groundwater into upstream and downstream zones groundwater runoff which is affected by heterogeneity of karst development and groundwater dynamics is delineated as main channel formed by foot caves and karst conduits and secondary channels formed by network of fractures the groundwater migration velocity between d2 and d1 in the main channel was 31 7 42 m day while that of the secondary channel was only 4 8 12 2 m day which is more than three times lower than the main route zeng et al 2016 d1 is the lowest cave in the foot cave system and is filled with groundwater all year round making it a local collection point of groundwater d2 and d1 are connected by a concentrated conduit flow zone groundwater is stored and flows in four distinct media zones concentrated conduit flow zone highly fractured zone cave sediment zone and matrix with fractures zone with the foot caves constituting the primary groundwater flow zone jiang et al 2020 these different types of media zones influence the physicochemical parameters of groundwater and make them to vary significantly on a local scale the elevation level of groundwater in the zengpiyan area ranged from 151 to 153 m the depth of groundwater ranged from 2 2 to 9 5 m while the difference between zone 2 and zone 3 was small with values ranging from 1 4 to 4 7 m most of the changes in water level at the same observation site were 1 2 m the groundwater depth in the main cave ranged from 1 5 to 2 7 m the maximum difference between the water depth in dry season and rainy season was 1 2 m the cultural layer of the main cave is located in the seasonal fluctuation zone of the groundwater due to elevation of the top and bottom surfaces of the site is 154 151 m which is 3 m below the surface groundwater dynamics precipitates alternating contact or separation between the site and groundwater causing damage to the cultural material through water flushing dissolution and gas erosion zk9 and zk21 boreholes were selected to represent groundwater in the concentrated conduit flow zone and matrix with fractures zone respectively groundwater of both boreholes was sensitive to rainfall in most period of the hydrological year water level in the matrix with fractures zone was higher than that in the concentrated conduit flow zone fig 2 the rise in water level during the rainy season induced flooding in the cave causing inundation of the cultural material stability is gradually attained in the change in groundwater during dry season although groundwater is separated from the site during that time the release of gas from groundwater nonetheless can cause erosion 4 2 general hydrochemical characteristics the data presented in this study include 194 samples obtained at 3 foot caves 13 boreholes and 1 pool with 2 13 samples per point within a period of 2 years an overview of physicochemical values of the water samples is given in table 1 the ph of groundwater was between 6 19 and 8 26 with an average value of 7 38 indicating a weakly alkaline groundwater the water temperature sec concentration of ca2 and hco3 were in the range of 13 29 7 c 307 936 μs cm 45 178 mg l and 146 4 524 9 mg l respectively the pool p1 had the highest ph and water temperature even though the main water source of the pool comes from groundwater flowing in the direction of d1 to zk9 the hydrochemical characteristics of the pool exhibited the properties of surface water because of the exposure to air and mixing with other water sources such as rainwater in addition the pool water had the lowest value of hco3 high sec values were observed mainly in zk6 zk9 zk11 and zk14 the lowest values of ca2 was observed in zk10 which is the borehole located in the main cave ca2 and mg2 accounted for 53 8 83 and 10 3 43 6 respectively of the total cations ca2 had the largest mass concentration of cation followed by mg2 na and k the average concentrations were 98 26 mg l 13 35 mg l 5 51 mg l 3 01 mg l respectively hco3 and so4 2 were the dominant anions hco3 accounted for 68 1 91 5 of the total anions and so4 2 for 2 4 28 8 of the total anions from the average values the order of mass concentration of the anions is hco3 so4 2 cl and no3 with average concentrations of 288 49 mg l 59 29 mg l 6 52 mg l 5 28 mg l respectively furthermore the molar ratio between ca2 mg2 and hco3 ranged from 0 35 to 0 91 fig 3 with 90 of the ratio more than 0 5 indicating that h2so4 and or hno3 participated in carbonate dissolution li et al 2010 the main type of water chemical in the study area is thus a ca hco3 facies but there are also other types including ca hco3 so4 ca mg hco3 or ca mg hco3 so4 among the 164 samples analyzed statistically the frequency of sulfate radicals reached a value of 17 fig 3 in the pure limestone regions of guilin the geochemistry of groundwater is dominated naturally by ca hco3 or ca mg hco3 water types in this study area the participation of sulfate in the classification of water types indicated that the geochemistry is disturbed by anthropogenic activities and that sulfate is the main contaminant in groundwater from the perspective of the spatial change of sec there was no trend of attenuation along the flow path even though the samples were closed to each other their sec was distinctly different for example although the distance between zk8 and zk9 was only 15 m their sec differed up to 189 μs cm simultaneously the difference in physicochemical parameters indicates several points worthy of mention firstly the aqueous medium is diverse and heterogeneous high density electrical conductivity and boreholes drilling demonstrated that thirteen of the 24 boreholes had open karst caves ranging from 0 3 m 17 5 m in height more suspected caves were found in front of the main cave but the probability of having karst caves in other areas is low jiang et al 2020 therefore based on the caves and fractures intercepted by boreholes and a combination of dye tracers the storage and migration of groundwater in the range of 0 1 km2 could be divided into three patterns fissure flow conduit flow and cave flow table 2 the zk10 represents a very peculiar site it is the only borehole located in the main cave with a total depth of 73 2 m although the borehole uncovered a 5 5 m deep cave the cave was isolated without distinct hydraulic connection to the surrounding groundwater consequently it is considered as fissure flow secondly the pollutant sources and transport pathway were different even the downstream groundwater had the same primary sources of pollutant from the former brick factory the concentrations of pollutants at downstream were inconsistent owing to groundwater transport routes composed of primary and secondary flow paths the secondary pollution source is domestic sewage which is generally point pollution and groundwater close to the pollution source is significantly impacted thirdly at the downstream area the degree of pollutant attenuation was different due to the different environmental condition of groundwater for example the karst fracture medium had low dissolved oxygen with strong reducing condition which indicates a high possibility of pollutant reduction in the karst conduit medium the oxidizing capacity was strong resulting in a low possibility of pollutant reduction 4 3 groundwater redox conditions and microbial characteristics the coexistence of fissures conduits and karst caves in the aquifer coupled with the difference in soil cover thickness and aeration conditions of the underground space may increase the possibility of the groundwater having different oxidation or reduction conditions the orp is used to show the macroscopic oxidation reduction properties of all substances in an aqueous solution a positive potential indicates that the solution has undergone a certain degree of oxidation while a negative potential indicates that the solution has undergone reduction khanal and huang 2003 in the 194 in situ measurements 159 displayed positive orp while 35 were negative indicating that the reducing conditions attained 18 at the observed times among the samples with positive orp values most were between 100 and 200 mv and a few were greater than 300 mv suggesting that the overall oxidation was not strong the orp at zk10 ranged from 99 mv to 344 mv and was always negative indicating strong reducing conditions a small number of the boreholes produced both oxidation and reduction values at different times for example zk6 zk7 and zk8 experienced reducing conditions in the dry season often changing into oxidizing conditions in the rainy season fig 4 reasons for the difference have been stated to include conditions of aqueous medium microorganisms content of organic carbon and dissolved oxygen su et al 2016 contrasting positive or negative orp values recorded even in boreholes close to each other is attributed to the structure of the different karst medium groundwater that is dominated by fast flow in boreholes where karst conduits or caves were intercepted often presented in oxidizing conditions because of the good atmospheric connectivity in situations where there were no nearby karst conduits the underground environment was relatively stable and the groundwater circulation was slow presenting reducing conditions the microbial community is an important factor in groundwater material circulation energy conversion and information transmission also it is a comprehensive reflection of the groundwater environment microbial community has a specific response mechanism to pollutants specific microbial community can handle certain pollutants by degrading them krell et al 2013 and be beneficial to their own growth and reproduction simultaneously the composition analysis of microbial community showed that the dominant species of microbial community at genus level were similar for all samples but the relative abundance varied significantly among samples fig 5 at genus level the dominant species were sulfurimonas accounting for 61 13 norank f norank o candidatus kaiserbacteria 22 30 norank f hydrogenophilaceae 24 67 and norank f hydrogenophilaceae 89 67 at zk6 zk7 zk8 and zk10 respectively all of these four species belong to the class of anaerobic bacteria the dominant species of norank f hydrogenophilaceae at zk10 were observed to grow in the anaerobic environment belonging to γ proteobacteria which contains several kinds of microbial community associated with sulfate reduction and the capacity to degrade organic contaminants wang et al 2013 the statistical results of species classification indicated that the srb was prevalent in the zengpiyan vicinity srb are mainly distributed in 8 families of the δ proteobacteria desulfarculaceae desulfobacteraceae desulfobulbaceae desulfomicrobiaceae desulfovibrionaceae desulfuromonadaceae syntrophaceae and syntrophobacteraceae in order to better comprehend the change in srb the water was sampled and cultivated in the laboratory srb is a class of functional bacteria with different morphologies that employ sulfate or other oxidized sulfides as electron acceptors to dissimilate organic matter and obtain energy under anoxic or anaerobic conditions barton 1995a it is extensively present in soil seawater river water underground pipelines oil and gas reservoirs etc maeda et al 2000 in the course of their metabolic activities srb usually change the nature of certain constituents in the environment barton 1995b including the consumption of organic matter and sulfate and production of h2s barton et al 2014 five sampling and cultivation tests demonstrated that sixty of the 63 groundwater samples contained srb with the number ranging from 1 250 cfu ml suggesting that the srb is extensively distributed in the groundwater the number of srb was greater in the rainy season compared to the dry season fig 6 4 4 sulfate concentration and its conversion product so4 2 was analyzed in 188 samples taken on eleven different occasions the maximum value of so4 2 was 131 mg l and the minimum value was 0 56 mg l so4 2 concentration of 50 60 mg l was the most frequent exceeding 20 followed by 20 30 mg l samples with so4 2 concentration values of 0 10 mg l close to 10 and values as great as 90 100 mg l were also observed in the statistical data indicating that so4 2 concentrations in the study area varies distinctively spatially the concentration of so4 2 in the upstream area y6 and y8 was the highest fig 7 the upstream area was the original coal cinder burning area of the former brick factory which was confirmed as the source of so4 2 pollution precipitated by the isotope of sulfate zeng 2017 although the factory was closed in 1991 the cinders buried in the ground continued to leach producing sulfates that continuously percolate into groundwater the average concentrations of so4 2 in the downstream zone ranged from 25 to 60 mg l with the exception of zk10 the so4 2 concentrations of zk10 were abnormally low with an average value of 3 96 mg l which was 12 times lower than the values of other water samples in this area in addition the nitrate concentration of zk10 was also abnormally low with the lowest value of 0 and an average value of 1 0 mg l the average concentration of no3 in nearest boreholes zk8 and zk9 was 6 14 mg l and the maximum values could reach 18 08 mg l these indicate that sulfate and nitrate might both be undergoing reduction under the negative orp condition in the main cave zhang et al 2021 culminating in low values of so4 2 and no3 that being the case under reducing conditions sulfate is most likely to be reduced to h2s during the observation periods it was found that some boreholes gave off a pungent odor indicating that some types of gas may have been generated the monitoring results showed that h2s could be detected everywhere inside the cave including zk10 lc d1 dt6 with the concentrations ranging from 0 056 0 444 mg m3 table 3 the 73 2 m deep borehole of zk10 covers an aeration vadose zone and a saturated phreatic zone the sulfate in the saturated zone undergoes reduction and then its product is released into the vadose zone lc is the lowest part of the main cave and is a relatively more closed cave so the concentration of h2s is the highest there h2s could also be detected in the exploration pit dt6 and air kq indicating that h2s produced by sulfate reduction in the saturated zone is unstable and volatilizes swiftly into the upper vadose zone as well as the open air lc lower cave kq the air of the main cave from the seasonal perspective h2s concentrations at zk10 were often high in summer and autumn and low in spring and winter fig 8 it was found that h2s concentrations had a significant correlation with the air temperature microbial metabolism is more active at high summer temperatures which may be the primary reason for the more intense sulfate reduction bhattarai et al 2018 the correlation between changes in groundwater level groundwater velocity and h2s concentration showed that the rate of renewal of groundwater may influence the conversion rates of the sulfate sulfate reduction in groundwater requires certain conditions in addition to the availability of sulfate electron donors electron acceptors are also required as well as microorganisms the reaction equation can be expressed as follows roesler et al 2007 where ch2o here stands for organic matter so4 2 2ch2o 2hco3 h2s 1 so4 2 2ch2o 2h 2co2 h2s 2h2o 2 so4 2 2ch2o 2hco3 hs h 3 electron acceptors are supplied by organic matter which includes human excrement organic acids carbohydrates or solid organic matter the zengpiyan is located in the downtown area and there are some old communities still existing around the vicinity domestic sewage and waste are discharged in situ without any treatment culminating in a high organic matter content in the groundwater doc is the main energy source for microbial metabolism in groundwater and it has important indicators for groundwater environmental changes and microbial action processes the average mass concentration of doc in the zengpiyan area varied from 6 41 to 12 63 mg l and the total average concentration was 8 86 mg l according to the regulations of the international water association the doc concentration of pollution free water sources should be less than 1 5 mg l jiang 2018 doc content in the study area was much higher than the standard value fig 9 also shows that the highest doc concentrations are located in the upstream of the cave system in the study area the theoretical conditions required for sulfate reduction were all satisfied and therefore the chemical reactions could proceed naturally based on this the production of h2s gas in the epigene karst aquifer under reducing conditions is descripted as fig 10 in relatively isolated caves or fractured media with weak groundwater hydraulic connections groundwater is prone to experience reducing conditions and sulfates will undergo bsr reactions this is the case of zk10 in karst conduit or relatively open media groundwater is prone to undergo oxidizing conditions and the sulfate reduction ability is weak or does not occur although h2s could also be detected in the zengpiyan area however their concentrations were low compared to the h2s value in the hypogene caves d angeli et al 2021 the reasons for this are firstly the concentration of sulfate and organic matter was less than 100 mg l and 15 mg l respectively which may indicate that electron acceptors and donors are limited secondly the temperature of the environment was relatively low ranging from 17 to 21 c research on the saturated zone of landfills has shown that redox rates of bsr are highest at 50 60 c jin et al 2020 thirdly h2s is highly unstable and volatilizes swiftly or undergoes oxidation in addition to these factors in a karst aquifer where caves fracture and matrix drainage coexist h2s is more difficult to retain 4 5 the impact of sulfate reduction on the cave environment the products of sulfate reduction depend on a series of conditions such as ph redox potential iron ion concentration and the abundance of microorganisms deverel et al 1986 h2s is one of the primary products of the reduction and one of the substances that can induce significant damage to the environment the h2s produced by sulfate reduction is oxidized to h2so4 which is a strong highly corrosive acid in non karst areas the dissolution capacity of h2s oxidation might be neglected but in karst areas they can promote accelerated karst development iurkiewicz and stevanovic 2010 or precipitate geological disasters such as collapse it is well known that h2s production and oxidation in the s o h system plays the principal role in the formation of certain types of caves palmer 1991 kirkland 2014 the volatilization of h2s from groundwater to the cave atmosphere and the oxidation of h2s to sulfuric acid on moist cave walls results in spontaneous reaction with the carbonate rock which can form large cavities the reaction equations are h2s 2o2 h2so4 4 h2so4 caco3 ca2 so4 2 co2 h2o 5 h2so4 caco3 h2o caso4 2h2o co2 6 carbonate dissolution by sulfuric acid or organic acid can be verified through different means gams 1981 initiated the study of dissolution of standard limestone tablets which was applied to different locations in the zengpiyan area e g suspended in the air groundwater air interface and at different depths in the water it was found that most of the tablets experienced substantial dissolution indicating that the modern cave environment is very corrosive fig 11 zk10 had the strongest reducing condition however it did not have the maximum dissolution rates of carbonate the reasons are that the dissolution of carbonate rock is induced by both co2 and h2s also flowing water is required for dissolution in the closed cave system the sources of co2 are limited liu et al 2007 with poor groundwater mobility in this case although the h2s was relativity high the dissolution rate was not necessarily the highest nevertheless the participation of h2s amplifies the capacity of carbonate dissolution and the attendant consequences which threatens the cave environment in the future the mineral composition of the standard limestone tablets should be identified to confirm the presence of gypsum the product of sulfuric acid corrosion of carbonate rocks when the saturation indexes for calcite c si dolomite d si and gypsum g si were calculated it was found that c si was between 0 36 and 0 72 d si between 0 00 and 1 05 and g si between 3 69 and 1 29 c si and d si had positive values while the standard limestone tablets still exhibited dissolution capacity indicating that the corrosion of the standard limestone tablets was not caused by carbonic acid only thus confirming that other acids sulfuric acid and organic had participated in the dissolution processes the cultural layer is a key symbol of ancient human cave sites in the zengpiyan cave site the main physical evidence existing in the cultural layer is snail shells it was observed that old snail shells buried in the cultural layer also displayed effects of recent significant weathering when touched with the hand surfaces were clearly powdery and some of this residuum fell off directly the originally hard calcareous nodules had become soft indicating that the environment has been acidified 5 conclusion the coal and cinders left by the former industry in a karst peak forest plain are continuously leached by rainwater resulting in high sulfate concentrations in the famous downstream cultural cave site sulfate concentrations of the groundwater showed irregular distribution because of the heterogeneity of karst development and hydrological conditions the sulfate is almost exhausted as it approaches and enters the main cave due to reduction reactions by pollutant monitoring measurement of groundwater redox conditions and srb bacterial cultures the mechanism of h2s production from sulfate reduction in epigene karst aquifers was uncovered in the fissure dominated karst medium the groundwater environment gradually becomes anaerobic the reduction of sulfate to sulfide occurs when sulfate acts as the electron receptor in the oxidation of organic matter once h2s is produced it is released into the overlying aeration zone via fractures or solution conduits and collects in the cave a combination of enhanced weathering of old snail shells in the cultural layer of the site cave experiments with standard limestone dissolution tablets and determination of the calcite saturation index confirmed that sulfuric acid plays a role in the dissolution of the carbonate rocks this study reveals that sulfate can also undergo reduction reactions at low temperatures in epigene karst aquifer the preservation of the zengpiyan cultural site is threatened by acidification of the environment regular monitoring for toxic deleterious or corrosive gases is recommended for the protection of such important cave sites credit authorship contribution

4257,a recent review has suggested relatively simple contextual models would remain attractive in the estimation of evapotranspiration et the surface temperature vegetation index feature space model is a typical representative since it provides direct monitoring of et using simply and effective contextual information however the temporally continuous estimation and large scale application issues are not well identified at previous studies under this background the main motivation for this study is to develop an operational new parameterization scheme within the feature space framework for large scale temporally continuous et estimation specifically the spatial domain division strategy was first designed to obtain the optimal grid division size for large scale et estimation the model boundaries of these sub regions were parameterized using spatial domain based temporal domain information at seasonal scale the applicability of new method was demonstrated over the entire contiguous united states conus in the year 2008 using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and global land surface satellite glass products the comparison between present method and traditional method indicates that the new parameterization scheme produced at different reference spatial domains has a slight accuracy improvement over the 14 fluxnet sites in addition the new method holds unique advantages in its simplicity and continuity especially superior in the temporally continuous estimation of et over a large extended region the validation results of 14 fluxnet sites indicate the correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse the mean bias b values for continuous estimation of daily et were 0 62 28 430 w m2 36 133 w m2 and 0 059 respectively the comparison results with existing et product also demonstrated the comparable of et distribution and estimates meanwhile the boundary parameters obtained at seasonal scale also enhanced the physical meanings of feature space model consequently the new parameterization scheme proposed in this study can be regarded as a suitable tool to provide large scale temporally continuous estimation of et keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing large scale temporally continuous feature space model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is one of the major components in land surface water and energy balance a large variety of field observatory networks have been established to measure et by eddy covariance ec towers energy balance bowen ratio ebbr systems and large aperture scintillometer las with relatively high accuracy baldocchi et al 1996 cheng and li 2015 liu et al 2018 however such field observations are usually costly time consuming and made at point scale abdolghafoorian et al 2017 xu et al 2020 besides in situ measurements et maps can be produced from land surface model dong and dai 2017 jung et al 2017 data assimilation method lievens et al 2017 he et al 2020a machine learning method jung et al 2009 xu et al 2018 physically based model fisher et al 2008 mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 and empirical semi empirical model wang and liang 2008 yao et al 2019 among them remote sensing rs observations provide an alternative to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of et and its related explanatory parameters which is unachievable from sparse filed networks although the driving parameters of et e g soil water availability land surface biophysical vegetation cover type and etc have been well produced based on rs technology there still exist some limitations in the deficiency of suitable computational grids at interested spatial and temporal scales 100 m 1000 m daily weekly tang et al 2013 hssaine et al 2018 cuxart and boone 2020 such factors weigh heavily for operational applications at significantly long integration periods and large extended domain therefore the utilization of most rs based model is a trade off between extensibility and accuracy biggs et al 2016 zhu et al 2017a under this context a unique et parameterization scheme using contextual feature space model with remotely sensed radiative temperature t s and fractional vegetation cover f c information has been widely recognized as an alternative solution to strike this compromise jiang and islam 2001 sandholt et al 2002 tang et al 2010 yang and shang 2013 zhu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 in general a low f c value is in response to a high t s value for the same pixel where slight et would be observed and vice versa consequently the scatterplots of t s and f c measurements would be conceptually triangle technically trapezoid and simplified rectangle shapes if there exists sufficient pixels that representing soil moisture availability and vegetation cover conditions over the study domain the spatial contextual information of t s versus f c first reported by goward et al 1985 has been applied widely to the estimation of et due to its simply mechanism less data input and appropriate performance jiang and islam 2001 tang and li 2017a carlson and petropoulos 2019 chen et al 2020 huang et al 2020 although the feature space based et estimation methods have been developed many different versions they are mostly grounded in the parameterization of upper dry and lower wet edges since the model boundary information is the most important in the feature space method batra et al 2006 tang et al 2010 zhu et al 2020 in general the model boundaries of feature space can be retrieved either from empirical linear regression or theoretical surface energy balance approach sandholt et al 2002 zhang et al 2008 tang et al 2010 long and singh 2012a zhu et al 2017b tang and li 2017a cui et al 2020 huang et al 2020 comprehensive reviews on the estimation of et from the feature space method can be learned from carlson 2007 li et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 and chen and liu 2020 in summary the recently developed theoretical calculation of dry edge and wet edge has improved the mechanism and performance of feature space based et estimation sun 2016 tang and li 2017a however the theoretical method determined by surface energy balance principle and penman monteith equation usually requires complex parameterization process and ancillary meteorological measurements this contradicts to some extent with the intention of feature space method because this method was initially designed to bypass the reliance on ancillary meteorological observations and complex parameterization of heat and water transfer carlson 2007 jiang et al 2009 long and singh 2012a zhu et al 2017a a recent review of et models also suggested relatively simple contextual models are attractive and valuable to practitioners and researchers chen and liu 2020 therefore it is necessary to retain the intention of feature space method and make essential improvement from a perspective of theoretical analysis with model boundary parameters however several common issues associated with t s f c feature space have not been adequately addressed firstly one intrinsic assumption is the feature space method only works well under relatively uniform atmospheric forcing garcia et al 2014 that is the reason why the application of feature space method at regional scale has been commonly reported in most previous studies nishida et al 2003 tang et al 2010 stefan et al 2015 although several studies have documented the scale dependencies and the impact of end member selection at regional scale few literatures have investigated whether the above findings have prospects to large scale et estimation long et al 2012 tang et al 2013 de tomás et al 2014 secondly t s gaps caused by large cloud cover may bring in huge uncertainties in the determination of edge parameters of feature space leng et al 2017 sun 2017 therefore a large amount of studies focused on the t s reconstruction under partically cloudy sky conditions and et estimation under clear sky conditions metz et al 2014 the solution of edge parameters at partially cloudy days were still not well identified which directly leads to the temporally discontinuous thirdly most previous feature space methods were performed with spatial domain of edge parameters although the validity of empirical linear regression and theoretical surface energy balance approaches has been proved the edge parameters were still retrieved at daily scale jiang and islam 2001 long and singh 2012a as several studies indicated a procedure with the temporal domain information could overcome the limitations involved in the spatial domain based methods carlson 2007 minacapilli et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 consequently exploring the characteristics of temporal domain information with respect to the spatial domain may bring possibility to parameterize edge parameters at seasonal or annual scale according to the evolution and limitation of feature space based et estimation this study aims at re reviewing the traditional feature space method from the insights of theoretical solution to estimate temporally continuous et distribution over a large extended area using an operational new parameterization scheme the objectives of this study were to 1 propose a spatial domain division strategies under the background of uniform atmospheric conditions and develop an operational new parameterization scheme nps with respect to the theoretical definition of model boundaries 2 investigate the spatial scale dependencies of model boundary parameters and compare the model performance of nps and traditional parameterization scheme tps at these divided sub regions 3 estimate temporally continuous et distribution over the entire large extended region using the most suitable spatial domain size and nps and validate its consistency with existing et product 2 methodology 2 1 overview of feature space model the feature space method developed by goward et al 1985 has been widely used for the et estimation in many different regions worldwide wang et al 2006 tang et al 2010 chen et al 2020 the basic hypotheses are interpreted as follows if there are enough pixels representing broadly land surface temperature t s and fractional vegetation cover f c conditions over an interested region the envelope of these pixels would constitute a physically meaningful triangle trapezoid or rectangle shape their upper and lower boundaries represent two limiting cases of evapotranspiration consequently et of each pixel within the feature space can be deduced by the interpolation procedures according to its relative position between the dry and wet edges carlson 2007 tang et al 2010 according to long et al 2012 there are basically three kinds of rs based et parameterization schemes derived from feature space method including triangle model trapezoid model and rectangle model see fig 1 among them both triangle and rectangle models entail derivation of dry and wet edges directly from the scatterplot of t s f c conceptual sketch for a certain size of satellite images in contrast trapezoid model employs the surface energy balance equation to detect extreme dry and wet edges without a prior knowledge of a broad of fractional vegetation cover and soil moisture wetness although these three feature space methods are distinct from each other in shape configuration they all utilize the priestley taylor p t formulation to parameterize et distribution jiang and islam 2001 due to the simplicity and operability of the rectangle model over the triangle and trapezoid model only the rectangle model is used in this study to develop an operational new parameterization scheme for large scale temporally continuous et estimation the basic framework of the feature space model is described as below based on an extension of the p t formulation and the definition of evaporative fraction ef the ratio of latent heat flux le to available energy rn g the mathematical expression of et in the feature space is generally described as 1 le δ δ γ r n g where δ represents the gradient of the saturated vapor pressure to the air temperature kpa c 1 γ represents a psychrometric constant kpa c 1 r n and g represent the net radiation and soil heat flux w m 2 represents an integrated priestley taylor parameter accounting for the surface and canopy resistances although parameter looks similar to the α pt α pt 1 26 in the initial version of p t formulation the wide range of surface evaporative conditions is encompassed to estimate et distribution over unsaturated underlying surface the distinct difference of these three models is the parameterization scheme of which is related to the dry edge configuration of feature space for the rectangle feature space abce in fig 1 the calculation scheme of for each pixel is expressed as 2 i a b c e t smax i i i i t s i t smax i i i i t w i max where t smax i i i i and t w i denotes the observed maximum and minimum surface temperature t s i throughout an entire scene respectively unlike t smax i i and t smax i i i which vary with t s f c in triangle and trapezoid feature space t smax i i i i retains constant and therefore constitutes a horizontal upper limit likewise the parameter min i of the dry edge is also set as zero dry edge of rectangle model theoretically corresponds to the driest surfaces for a wide range of fractional vegetation cover and soil moisture conditions the rectangle model is implied in the studies of batra et al 2006 and jiang et al 2009 long and singh 2012b also demonstrated the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal is a rectangular shape compared with triangle and trapezoid parameterization scheme the rectangle feature space is characterized by its simplicity operability and especially its potential for large scale et estimation 2 2 new parameterization scheme of et estimation there are some literatures suggesting that controlled by the incoming solar radiation the seasonal variations of theoretical maximum temperature of bare soil and full vegetated canopy followed a trend similar to cosine curves at a specific spatial domain sun et al 2012a sun et al 2012b zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 inspired by this a new large scale parameterization scheme of et was developed through the combination of the spatial domain based rectangle feature space and temporal domain based statistical fitting method specifically a large extended area is first divided into many sub regions following the hypothesis of uniform atmosphere forcing thereafter the dry edge and wet edge of the rectangle feature space are fitted using cosine function at these sub regions as reported by jiang et al 2009 and long and singh 2012a the dry and wet edges of rectangle were constituted by the surface maximum and minimum temperature in view of these theoretical basis the dry and wet edges of sub regions can be expressed as follows zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 3 t max j a max cos a max θ j b max 4 t min j a min cos a min θ j b min 5 t w j m i n t min j t min j where t max j and t min j represent the fitted dry and wet edges of rectangle feature space respectively a max a max and b max are the fitted parameters of dry edge using daily observed surface maximum temperature t max j and average solar zenith angle time series data as inputs likewise a min a min and b min are the fitted parameters of wet edge by observed surface minimum temperature t min j and average solar zenith angle t w j represents the wet edge which is adopted by the minimum value of fitted surface minimum temperature and observed surface minimum temperature it should be noticed that these input data are all collected under clear sky conditions under this context i in eq 1 can be estimated by eqs 3 5 in a manner of statistically theoretical fitting method to further testify the applicability of new proposed method we would make a comparison with traditional rectangle method which directly uses observed surface maximum and minimum temperature to calculate model boundary information differ from traditional method one motivation of this study is to achieve temporally continuous estimation of et regardless of the weather conditions that is to estimate t max j and t min j of eqs 3 and 4 using only solar zenith angle that under partially cloudy conditions as inputs therefore it s a new attempt to achieve temporally continuous estimation of et based on the temporal domain information of spatial domain based feature space model we only focus on the introduction of new nps and traditional tps parameterization scheme in this section the detailed technical and data processing stream will be explained in the following section due to the feature space model only provides instantaneous snapshots of latent heat flux at the satellite overpass times daily latent heat flux estimation has more application fields than instantaneous values following the studies of tang and li 2017b and cui et al 2020 the instantaneous fluxes are scaled to daily values by assuming that the ef is constant throughout the daytime that means ef obtained at the satellite overpass time is approximately equal to the daytime value using above assumption the daily et value is extrapolated using the following formulation vinukollu et al 2011 6 et daily i n max t max j t s i t max j t w j δ δ γ i r n g daytime i where n is set as 1 07 following the study of sugita and brutsaert 1991 which includes the evaporation from night time to avoid the complex calculation of radiative transfer equation involved in most feature space based latent heat flux estimation we take full advantage of the existing daytime net radiation product which is provided by global land surface satellite glass jiang et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 besides the determination of surface heat flux is interpreted as 7 g daytime i r n d a y t i m e i γ veg 1 f c i γ soil γ veg 8 f c i ndvi i ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min 2 where γ veg and γ soil are the coefficients over full vegetation and bare soil which can be taken as 0 05 and 0 315 respectively daughtry et al 1990 vinukollu et al 2011 yang et al 2017 f c i represents the fractional vegetation cover which is calculated by the squared relationship with ndvi gillies et al 1997 ndvi min and ndvi max represent the minimum and maximum ndvi values over the entire study region respectively following the study of zhang et al 2009 and sun et al 2013 the full vegetated surface is defined as ndvi max 0 95 and bare soil is recognized as ndvi min 0 05 2 3 strategies of scale dependencies and sub region division de tomás et al 2014 suggested that a prior selection of spatial domain size is a non trivial but decisive task in general the enlarging of domain size would be helpful to maximize the probability of finding true dry and wet edges but the assumption of relatively uniform atmospheric forcing may be compromised garcia et al 2014 inspired by this besides the modification of traditional feature space method we also investigate the scale dependencies to choose a proper window size for large scale et estimation under the background of uniform atmospheric conditions specifically scale dependencies were determined from two aspects firstly the spatial domain dependencies of observed model boundaries over the rectangle feature space were explored secondly the spatial domain dependencies of et estimates at both new and traditional parameterization scheme were compared the purpose of scale dependencies was to comprehend the influence of spatial domain expansion on the model boundaries and model performance it would provide a promising reference for us to choose a suitable reference domain size for large scale et estimation due to the limitation of uniform atmosphere forcing it s necessary to divide a large extended region to many sub regions using a grid mask as previous studies suggested 50 km 100 km 150 km and 200 km were adopted as reference grid masks to divide the large extended region into many different sub regions respectively long et al 2012 tang et al 2013 biggs et al 2016 molero et al 2016 babaeian et al 2018 in addition the clear sky condition was required to well distinguish the model boundaries at each sub region therefore a cloud cover less than 20 at interested region was adopted to define the clear sky days following the studies of venturini et al 2008 and zhu et al 2020 specifically the land cover type product at 1 km spatial resolution was used to calculate the reference number of valid clear sky pixels and make the template of clear sky days the surface temperature product at daily scale was adopted to evaluate whether it s under clear sky conditions by comparing the number of valid temperature data with the aforementioned reference value on this basis we can obtain the maximum and minimum surface temperature distribution at each sub region under clear sky conditions the corresponding daily average solar zenith angle of each sub region was also extracted according to eqs 4 and 5 the dry edge and wet edge parameters of new parameterization scheme nps at 50 km 100 km 150 km and 200 km sub regions can be fitted under clear sky conditions meanwhile the traditional parameterization scheme tps can be driven by the input of maximum and minimum surface temperature in these sub regions after the investigation of scale dependencies we would choose the optimal spatial domain size to estimate et distribution over a large extended region composed of these sub regions the workflow of this study is summarized schematically in fig 2 2 4 error metrics there are no generally accepted methodologies to evaluate the accuracy of et retrieved from rs observations due to the mismatch in spatial scale with field measurements following most previous studies et observations obtained at site scale were used directly to validate the accuracy of rs based estimates at 1 km spatial resolution walker et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 feng et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 four error metrics were employed to assess the accuracy of et estimates they are correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse the mean bias b entekhabi et al 2010 9 r i 1 n p i p i o i o i i 1 n p i p i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 10 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 12 b p i o i 1 where p i represents the estimated et o i represents the observed et p i and o i represent the mean values of et estimates and et observations respectively 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the contiguous united states conus region is located in latitude between 24 8 n to 49 5 n and in longitude from 66 5 w to 124 8 w fig 3 this study area is large and the ecoclimatic characteristics in different regions are obviously diverse the dominant vegetation types of conus are grassland cropland forest and shrubland influenced by warm and humid airstream in the atlantic the precipitation increases gradually from west to east with an annual average value about 760 mm he et al 2020b a large variety of flux networks have been established over this region to monitor moisture momentum fluxes and surface heat i e first international satellite land surface climatology project field experiment fife ameriflux atmospheric radiation measurement arm and etc sellers et al 1988 baldocchi et al 1996 besides the abundant datasets the heterogeneous distribution of air temperature precipitation topography and vegetation system also makes the conus region an ideal domain for the development of model and evaluation of model performance senay et al 2013 xu et al 2019 he et al 2020b 3 2 ground based measurements flux and meteorological data from 14 sites retrieved from the fluxnet2015 network https fluxnet fluxdata org were utilized in this study table 1 the 14 sites used in this study span over different climate zone covering the diverse vegetation cover type and a wide range of environmental gradients fig 3 therefore the consideration of these sites enables the testing of the broader applicability of our proposed method on a large extended region all sites use the eddy covariance ec flux method to measure energy fluxes and all observations used in this study were collected in the year 2008 in this study daily latent heat le were utilized to evaluate the accuracy of et estimation the meteorological data of air temperature collected at 30 min interval was applied to validate the accuracy of air temperature estimation at satellite overpass time generally the available energy rn g is prone to be more than the sum of the sensible and latent heat fluxes h le from the ec system foken 2008 thus bowen ratio method br was applied to correct values of le observations from ec 3 3 satellite data besides ground based measurements the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra products and global land surface satellite glass product were also used in this study table 2 both of them provided global coverage and long observation period 2000 to present for modis and 2000 to 2018 for glass specifically the modis products consisted of daily t s observations at 1 km spatial resolution mod11a1 was adopted to retrieve maximum t max j and minimum t min j surface temperature daily solar zenith θ angle observations at 1 km spatial resolution mod03 was employed to estimate spatially average solar zenith angle the daily cloud observations mod06 l2 and daily atmosphere profile observations mod07 l2 at 5 km spatial resolution were resampled to 1 km and adopted for the estimation of near surface air temperature t a following zhu et al 2017c the vegetation cover type observations at 500 m spatial resolution mcd12q1 was resampled to 1 km and employed to make clear sky template the 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product at 1 km spatial resolution mod13a2 was time series smoothed using the algorithm proposed by chen et al 2006 and interpolated to the daily value the fractional vegetation cover f c was calculated using the squared relationship with ndvi proposed by gillies et al 1997 in addition to the modis products glass product includes daytime net radiation at 5 km spatial resolution was employed and resampled to 1 km jiang et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 to make a comparison with other widely used products the principle of 1 km spatial resolution and produced at daily scale were designed to acquire the qualified et products on this basis the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop et product was selected in this study senay et al 2013 senay 2018 it should be noted that the nearest interpolation method was adopted to obtain input parameters with 1 km spatial resolution meanwhile the lower quality data from these products were removed by the additional quality control information sun 2016 4 results 4 1 variations of dry and wet edges with domain size to investigate the variations of dry and wet edges with domain enlarging the spatial domain grids of 14 ground sites are considered as a representative example the number of clear sky days for these spatial grids is first calculated which is presented in table 3 the decrease of clear sky days with the increase of domain size were observed at most sites and the number of clear sky days was diverse among different grids specifically us whs and us wkg located grids have nearly the highest clear sky days than other sites the number of clear sky days over us ib2 and us oho were at a low level with an average values of 100 96 85 and 78 for these four domains respectively the difference in the number of clear sky days maybe contributed to the geographical location water vapor conditions and local circulation once the clear sky days was masked at these four domains we can easily derived the dry edge and wet edge of the rectangle feature space fig 4 presents the annual variations of observed dry and wet edges for four domains under clear sky conditions in general the samples within each site located spatial grid are distributed evenly throughout the year which enables us to capture the seasonal variations of dry and wet edges it is apparent that the upper limits of these curves at different spatial grids present a trend similar to cosine characteristic in contrast to upper limits the lower limits seem to be poorly demarcated at some sites like us src us srg and srm that a doublecosinecurve were observed besides the shapes of dry and wet edges the amplitudes of these limits also implicitly indicate the overall hydrothermal conditions the amplitudes of dry edge with a lower maximum surface temperature were produced at sites us arm us ib2 us mms and us oho compared with other sites meanwhile the differences of amplitudes for dry and wet edges also indicated these sites have a slight variation of temperature over four domains this maybe hamper the requirement of a broad range of soil moisture and temperature conditions that intrinsic in feature space method therefore we would further investigate the influence of deficient model boundary conditions on the accuracy of et estimates in the following section as reported by long et al 2012 increasing the domain size would increase the heterogeneity in the land surface for a general case and consequently result in variations in the boundary conditions of feature space model this discovery can also be demonstrated in this study that the maximum surface temperature is increased and minimum surface temperature is decreased with an enlarging domain size however some particular cases were also observed at sites us me2 us mms with the maximum surface temperature mostly obtained at 150 km domain and us ton us var with the minimum surface temperature also mostly obtained at 150 km domain fig 5 presents the distribution of surface temperature at these four sites over four domains it is obvious that the incomplete inclusion relationship was generally existed in site located four domains only 50 km grid was included in other three spatial domain grids the lower area overlappingproportion promotes the heterogeneity of temperature distribution which was especially significant at 150 km and 200 km grids the maximum temperature of us me2 located 150 km domain was obviously higher than the 200 km domain as opposite to the maximum temperature the minimum surface temperature at 150 km domain was lower at site us me2 than 200 km domain in terms of site us mms the area overlappingproportion was larger than us me2 and the distribution of maximum and minimum temperature over 150 km and 200 km were very similar with each other to illustrate more reasonable we calculated the maximum and minimum temperature of these two grids the maximum temperature with 315 36 k and 312 32 k and minimum temperature with 290 78 k and 290 78 k were produced over 150 km and 200 km domains respectively besides the particular cases in maximum temperature the significant difference in minimum temperature was observed at sites us ton and us var these two sites located in the same four spatial domains therefore they share common model boundaries the minimum temperature with 287 16 k and 296 64 k were obtained at 150 km and 200 km domains respectively it is obvious that the minimum temperature obtained at 150 km domain was far lower than 200 km domain due to the intrinsic disadvantage in the division of large extended region the issue of incomplete inclusion was unavoidable therefore we would also display the influence of incomplete inclusion on the accuracy of et estimation in the following section 4 2 variations of et estimates with domain size for the purpose of reminder the traditional parameterization scheme tps of rectangle feature space can be expressed by eqs 1 and 2 with the maximum and minimum temperature at four domains the proposed new parameterization scheme nps requires theoretical fitted maximum and minimum temperature eqs 3 5 combined with eqs 1 and 2 besides the spatially average solar zenith angle used for the fitting function the air temperature t a and net radiation r n were also essential for the performance of nps and tps fortunately the validity of glass net radiation products released by jiang et al 2016 and jiang et al 2018 has been demonstrated at global scale which containing the 17 measurement networks compared with r n t a was also indispensable in the expression of term δ δ γ in eq 1 therefore the accuracy of t a estimates was further evaluated since the method proposed by zhu et al 2017b was only demonstrated at basin scale fig 6 presents the accuracy of t a estimates over different vegetation cover types the r mae rmse and b of t a estimates were 0 97 2 32 k 2 97 k and 0 06 which are consistent with the accuracy of zhu et al 2017c therefore the terms in eq 1 has been well quantified and only the performance of dry and wet edges requires to be recognized in terms of the accuracy of et estimates over four domains fig 7 shows the taylor diagrams of et estimates against the et observations at different spatial grids it is used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the modeled and observed behavior from three statistics thepearson correlation coefficient r theroot mean square error rmse and thestandard deviation sd taylor 2001 because the et observations of these 14 sites were different from each other the relative sd and rmse rsd and rrmse were utilized in the presentation of taylor diagram meanwhile the taylor diagram solely characterizes the centered pattern error we also summarize the information about overall bias of nps and tps over four domains in table 4 the annual series from tps and nps estimates are similar and are located close to each other in the taylor diagrams specifically the tps and nps over four domains have similar r values mostly ranging between 0 6 and 0 9 and the rmse values are ranged from 23 020 w m2 to 76 643 w m2 however a slight accuracy improvement was observed at nps in the average values of rmse and b over four domains which has been reduced by 0 832 w m2 and 0 106 respectively besides the comparison of different parameterization schemes we found the optimal performance of nps and tps was achieved at 150 km spatial domain the average values of rmse and b were 36 985 w m2 and 0 128 over these two parameterization schemes respectively meanwhile the worst accuracy of et estimates was obtained at 50 km spatial domain with the average rmse and b values of 44 387 w m2 and 0 717 across all sites the best performance was observed at 150 km domain derived nps with r rmse and b values of 0 65 36 340 w m2 and 0 093 respectively therefore the nps with 150 km spatial grid was recognized as the most suitable spatial reference for et estimation over entire conus as we mentioned above the influence in the deficiency of model boundary conditions and incomplete inclusion of spatial grids are existed in this study for the former factor the significant influence was observed at aforementioned sites of us arm us ib2 us mms and us oho specifically the average rmse values with nps at these four sites were 45 289 w m2 34 665 w m2 76 052 w m2 and 43 648 w m2 respectively meanwhile the worse accuracy of et estimates for sites us ib2 us mms and us oho were produced at 50 km domain this partly explains the model boundaries with wide range of fractional vegetation cover and soil moisture conditions was also necessary in rectangle feature space for the later factor the accuracy difference was apparent at site us me2 with rmse values of 37 422 w m2 and 76 643 w m2 and at site us mms with rmse values of 43 335 w m2 and 71 971 w m2 over 150 km and 200 km spatial domains respectively although the incomplete inclusion of spatial grids may be eliminated when a suitable window size was selected to large scale application it s also valuable to investigate the influence of different hydrothermal conditions in addition it should also be noticed that site us mms has the worst performance with rmse values of 75 8 w m2 79 794 w m2 76 643 w m2 and 71 971 w m2 when tps is employed at four different spatial domains respectively although the accuracy of et estimates achieved at sites us mms has been improved by nps the worst performance was still observed across all 14 sites thus both the model boundary conditions and spatial grids selection will affect the accuracy of et estimates especially over such large extended region this also emphasizes the importance of prior calibration for selecting a proper window domain de tomás et al 2014 4 3 accuracy of temporally continuous et estimation both empirical and theoretical feature space methods require a broad range of vegetation cover and soil moisture availability pixels for the construction model boundaries as a result most previous feature space models only work well when the cloud cover of interested region is less than the threshold similarly the new proposed parameterization scheme was also performed under clear sky conditions however unlike previous empirical and theoretical methods parameterized at daily scale the nps was designed at seasonal scale once the fitted parameters in eqs 3 and 4 were produced at clear sky days the model boundaries at daily scale can be retrieved directly by using solar zenith as input here we presented the fitted parameters of dry and wet edges in table 5 the parameters a max a min b max and b min were very similar at these 14 sites to further investigate the ability of nps for continuous estimation of et the fitted parameters from eqs 3 and 4 under clear sky conditions at 150 km spatial domain were directly applied to the estimation of et under partially cloudy conditions the partially cloudy conditions defined here refer to the cloud cover over each spatial domain is more than 20 the results of temporally continuous estimation of et across these 14 sites were presented in fig 8 and the accuracy of tps and nps produced at clear sky days were also summarized in table 6 in general the seasonal variation trend of et at most sites could be captured by the new parameterization scheme with r ranging from 0 51 to 0 77 though there were some significant mismatches on individual days overall the four statistical metrics produced by nps under all weather conditions were 0 66 29 997 w m2 37 343 w m2 0 160 respectively the above statistics were a little higher than those produced under clear sky conditions which were 0 65 29 548 w m2 36 340 w m2 0 093 respectively the good agreements between nps produced et estimates under clear sky conditions and partially cloudy sky conditions demonstrated the ability of temporally continuous et estimation by nps in addition to the overall evaluation the significant difference in the accuracy of et were also site specific for sites us arm us ib2 and us oho the errors were mainly caused by the inadequate model boundary conditions that leads to the underestimation of et peak values although this underestimation was also observed at sites us src us srm and us srg the overestimation of et trough values played a partial role unlike the underestimation of et peak values implied at sites us arm us ib2 and us oho the large values of mae and rmse at site us mms were mainly caused by the large underestimation of et at trough values there are also a special case at the 150 km spatial domain that is us src us srg us srm us wks and us wkg share common model boundaries although the heterogeneous land cover type were apart them from each other the similarity in accuracy demonstrated the importance of prior calibration for the window domain this relationship and similar performance can also be obtained at sites us ton and us var though these two sites have overestimated et at both peak and through values moreover controlled by the cosine function of t smax the time series of et estimates were similar to a cosine curve with the peak value arising in summer on the contrary the seasonal fluctuation of et observations was much more significant and complex for example at sites us src us srg and us srm there were two peak values arising in the curves of observed et fortunately a distinct doublesinecurve at wet edge and indistinct doublesinecurve at dry edge were captured by remote sensing based surface temperature observations fig 4 b this contributed to the effectively capture from these sharp variations of et observations 4 4 et distribution over conus a close look at table 5 indicates the parameters a and b produced by eqs 3 and 4 were similar at most sites respectively inspired by this we adopt the average values of a and b as 0 489 and 0 114 to estimate et for these 14 sites the results of fitted amplitude parameters in dry edge and wet edge were summarized in table 7 the overall accuracy with r mae rmse and b values for continuous et estimation were 0 62 28 430 w m2 36 133 w m2 and 0 059 which has a slight improvement compared with those produced in table 5 this slight difference can be explained from two aspects firstly as long et al 2012 suggested the utilization of observed dry edge and wet edge in feature space model may result in coincidently reasonable et estimates therefore it s not surprised to obtain the similar overall accuracy when constant parameters a and b were used in the parameterization of model boundaries secondly yang and shang 2013 indicated t s was sensitive to the variation of et estimates and long et al 2012 also suggested the et distribution over surfaces pixels approaching the observed limiting edges maybe distorted when the model boundaries were overestimated or underestimated therefore this is also the reason why the overall agreement of accuracy was observed from fig 8 and table 7 whereas independent discrepancies were also observed at some sites i e us arm and us srm considering the improvement of b and simplicity required in large scale application the constant values of a and b were adopted for the et estimation over the entire conus fig 9 presents the spatial distribution of amplitude parameters in dry edge and wet edge and the parameters a and b were retained constant throughout the entire conus the amplitude parameters within dry edge and wet edge were ranged from 298 25 k to 330 50 k and from 278 36 k to 315 37 k respectively as indicated in most previous studies the soil moisture index t max j t s i t max j t w j that implied in eq 6 has ability to reflect the soil moisture conditions sun et al 2012a sun et al 2012b zhu et al 2017b bai et al 2020 in general high amplitude parameters in t max j usually represent relative low soil moisture content therefore we can easily infer that the western region of conus suffers from serious drought than the eastern region as indicated by sun et al 2012a sun et al 2012b and zhu et al 2017a theoretical upper limit was controlled by the incoming solar radiation whereas statistically based upper limit developed in this study can be regarded as an integration of incoming solar radiation and land surface hydrothermal status therefore the annual solution of amplitude parameters provides a physical perspective to well identify the model boundaries of feature space meanwhile the difference of amplitude parameters in dry and wet edges a max a min also indicates that there is a slight temperature variations in the eastern region that means the well water conditions were generally obtained at eastern region due to the principle of thermal inertia especially in the northeast conus meanwhile well water conditions usually corresponding to homogeneous hydrothermal conditions throughout the year and inadequate model boundary conditions may be included in such situation garcia et al 2014 also emphasized the effective application of feature space method may be suitable when the region was water limited rather than energy limited this partially explained the reason why the sites in eastern region that reported in table 7 have large discrepancies with in situ observations consequently the physical meanings of new proposed parameterization scheme has also been enhanced from another perspective once the dry edge and wet edge were determined the daily et distribution can be estimated using constant evaporative fraction method of eq 6 the distribution of average daily et in the year 2008 was presented in fig 10 a which was similar to the distribution of amplitude parameters in fig 9 in addition the et distribution also indicated drought was obvious at western region of conus with the et values less than 1 0 mm d the higher et estimates with the values more than 5 mm d was produced at southeast region of conus as previous studies suggested the high et values in the southeast region are mainly due to heavy precipitation and dense vegetation cover xu et al 2019 he et al 2020b to make a comparison with other product that released at conus or global the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop et product was selected in this study senay et al 2013 senay 2018 the daily et estimates from ssebop was averaged over the whole year its distribution was presented in fig 10 b the et estimates between these two methods have high agreements at either et value magnitudes or entire variation trends the spatial similarity between amplitude parameters in fig 9 and ssebop derived et estimates also demonstrated the validity of boundary parameters besides the et estimates produced by ssebop and nps of 14 ground sites were also compared in general both nps and ssebop et estimates can capture the annual variation of in situ et measurements meanwhile the et estimates from ssebop et product are highly consistent with the et estimates from nps at both clear and partially cloudy sky days with the r mae rmse and b values of 0 67 27 186 w m2 36 929 w m2 and 0 23 respectively however ssebop et slightly underestimated measured values while nps greatly reduced this underestimation at most sites consequently the simplicity and reasonably good performance make the nps a considerable choice among other products 5 discussions 5 1 comparison with other studies to the best of our knowledge there were few literatures have applied the feature space model to such a large extended region like conus due to the assumption of relatively uniform atmospheric forcing an appropriate regional et estimation was reported in most previous studies jiang et al 1999 tang et al 2010 long et al 2012 chen et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 therefore this study could be regarded as a novel attempt to estimate large scale et distribution with respect to both spatial domain and temporal domain information for the selection of spatial domain de tomás et al 2014 has emphasized the importance of a prior calibration for selecting a proper window domain long et al 2012 indicated the traditional empirical feature space models appear to perform well across an area of approximately 10 000 km2 meanwhile biggs et al 2016 also emphasized the study of long et al 2011 that domain size greater than 20 000 30 000 km2 may increase error in surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model unlike the findings in long et al 2012 the optimal grid size of 22 500 km2 was output in this study and it was located the recommended grid size of long et al 2011 and biggs et al 2016 the fig 7 and table 4 indicated the statistical errors of et estimates were gradually increased when the grid size was 40 000 km2 therefore it also demonstrated the conclusions of previous studies on the basis of long et al 2012 and tang et al 2013 incomplete inclusion of spatial grids were discovered and its influence on the accuracy of et estimates was also evaluated in this study however the mechanism of incomplete inclusion caused different hydrothermal conditions should be highlighted or concerned in the further development of empirical feature space model as for the selection of temporal domain we utilized the spatial domain information of rectangle feature space and parameterized at annual scale it should be noticed that unlike the temporal domain applied in pixel or the whole region reported in previous studies this study was operated at divided sub regions within the entire large region minacapilli et al 2016 zhu et al 2017a zhu et al 2020 therefore it would be more operational and has great potential in retrieving et distribution globally in addition the sub regions division has not only conformedto the inherent hypothesis of feature space model but also provided more clear sky days for the parameterization of model boundary conditions generally the feature space model can only be applied to very few days over one year i e 24 days in the research conducted by tang et al 2010 19 days in filion et al 2016 and 89 days in zhu et al 2020 however the average clear sky days recorded in table 3 is 165 which enables us to capture the extreme information of model boundary conditions throughout the year more importantly the utilization of temporal domain information also provided an opportunity to characterize the model boundary conditions at partially cloudy sky days zhu et al 2021 meanwhile the et estimation under partially cloudy sky conditions has an accuracy comparable to those produced under clear sky conditions compared with the et estimates under clear sky conditions that reported in most previous studies the new parameterization scheme can be regarded as a promising solution to obtain temporally continuous et estimates wang et al 2006 tang et al 2010 zhu et al 2017a chen et al 2020 besides the comparison of model parameterization scheme it is also necessary to conduct a comparison of model performance with other feature space based studies for better understanding the accuracy of our proposed method however the performance of models counts not only on the areas of the spatial domain but also the resolution of satellite observations long et al 2012 de tomás et al 2014 in view of this only previous studies which applied the feature space method to estimate et at daily scale were used in our comparison in the study of stisen et al 2008 the geostationary msg seviri sensor was utilized to estimate daily et producing the rmse of 41 45 w m2 over senegal river basin in the year 2005 msg seviri based daily available energy and modis terra based instantaneous ef were adopted in the study of sun et al 2012a and sun et al 2012b the daily et was tended to underestimate by 13 to 35 compared with site observations chen et al 2020 used a trapezoidal framework based model pcalep to estimate daily et over the junction of southwest and southeastern china the rmse obtained in their study were 36 3 w m2 and 39 7 w m2 at two ground sites in three clear sky days respectively it should be noted that these three studies were produced at clear sky days the accuracy of temporally continuous et estimates achieved in this study is comparable with those produced by other methods applied to regional scale besides this study cui et al 2020 developed a gap filling algorithm using deep neural network dnn based feature space model to obtain the temporally continuous daily et estimation the mae and rmse achieved in their study for one site over three years were 18 414 w m2 and 24 363 w m2 respectively although the accuracy of continuous et estimation was higher than this study the number of validation samples and the size of study area were far lower than this study nevertheless the gap filling algorithm using machine learning provides a unique perspective distinct from this study to capture the continuous model input parameters and et estimates in summary the present study is the first comprehensive research to estimate large scale temporally continuous et over a full year and the accuracy of et estimates has reached a comparable level by comparing with other studies 5 2 assessment of the new parameterization scheme the most significant attribute of the new proposed method is the combination of the spatial and temporal domain information of feature space model unlike the previous studies applied the temporal information to specific pixel this study aims at retaining the spatial domain information and re reviewing the boundary conditions at each spatial domain to excavate the temporal information that means the dry edge and wet edge used to define the extreme evapotranspiration rate conditions are each spatial domain specific as a result it has not only retained the initial intention imposed by the feature space model but also made it possible to conduct a temporally continuous monitoring of evapotranspiration specifically a rectangle feature space was adopted to define the model boundaries and a large number of pixels obtained under clear sky conditions were required to parameterize dry edge and wet edge the dry edge and wet edge at each domain grid were calculated using spatial domain based temporal domain information in contrast with the spatial domain based feature space method et of each pixel can be retrieved regardless of the weather conditions of surrounding pixels as summarized by tang et al 2010 the feature space approach presents mainly two common advantages in general 1 the relative position of pixels within the model boundaries are used to estimate et and highly accurate t s retrievals are not necessarily required 2 parameter is a replacement for the aerodynamic term therefore ancillary meteorological measurements and complex parameterization process are avoided in contrast to the intrinsic advantages the new parameterization scheme used in this study also has other significant advantages in particular 1 the large scale et estimation by feature space method is achieved for the first time especially provides an reference in selecting a proper window domain for large scale et estimation 2 the major hypothesis of traditional spatial domain feature space method in uniform atmospheric conditions is retained in this study because we only divide a large spatial domain into many sub regions following the previous studies recommended and numerical experiment tested results 3 the model boundary parameters at partially cloudy sky conditions are well captured by new parameterization scheme therefore temporally continuous estimation of et is achieved 4 the input parameters are entirely counted on the satellite observations and pre calibration workflow using in situ observations is not included therefore it provides an opportunity to retrieve et distribution globally zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 5 the theoretical mechanism is enhanced by the annual solution of boundary parameters it has more physical meanings on the reflection of land surface hydrothermal conditions and model boundary conditions additionally the new parameterization scheme also has its own disadvantages described below 1 as long et al 2012 suggested although the utilization of observed dry edge and wet edge in feature space models may result in coincidently reasonable et estimates the et distribution over surfaces pixels approaching the observed limiting edges maybe distorted this is also the reason why some peak values are underestimated and trough values are overestimated at most sites it is unavoidable in empirical feature space models therefore further investigation of special issues and mechanism are indispensable 2 as fig 8 presented the et estimates also have missing days since the deficiency of enough t s t a and f c pixels at both clear and partially cloudy days therefore gap filling methods of input parameters and objective parameter would be the focus of our further studies certainly the parameterization scheme would be modified or investigated when the interpolated or filled input variables are adopted 3 the new parameterization scheme relies heavily on the satellite observations therefore higher quality of the input variables is required meanwhile the utilization of satellite observations maybe further operated at google earth engine gee planetary scale platform it provides powerful parallel computing capability zhang et al 2019 6 conclusions in view of the difficulties of feature space model in estimating large scale temporally continuous et distribution an operational new parameterization scheme nps using spatial domain based temporal domain information of feature space model was proposed in this study specifically a prior calibration workflow for selecting a proper window domain was initially designed following de tomás et al 2014 the 50 km 100 km 150 km and 200 km spatial grids were adopted as spatial references to divide the large extended region into many sub regions the dry and wet edges of these sub regions were first fitted by the cosine function and corresponding observed maximum and minimum surface temperature under clear sky conditions respectively the scale dependencies of different spatial domains were investigated and the most suitable spatial domain was final selected the nps was applied to the entire contiguous united states conus in the year 2008 using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and global land surface satellite glass products the traditional parameterization scheme tps was also adopted to demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method the results show that the utilization of observed dry edge and wet edge at different sub regions may cause inadequate model boundary conditions though coincidently reasonable et estimates were achieved meanwhile the incomplete inclusion of spatial grids was also existed in different sub regions and also has influence on the accuracy of et estimation it s unavoidable in current empirical feature space model therefore further investigation of special issues and mechanism are indispensable the optimal domain size of 150 km was outputted in our comparison the accuracy of the nps under clear sky conditions has an accuracy improvement compared with that of tps the nps also enables us to retrieve continuous et distribution over conus the overall accuracy of the correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse the mean bias b values were 0 62 28 430 w m2 36 133 w m2 and 0 059 respectively the present study is the first comprehensive research to estimate large scale temporally continuous et over a full year and the accuracy of et estimates has reached a comparable level with other released large scale et product although the feature space method with spatial domain based temporal domain information provides an opportunity to retrieve temporally continuous et distribution its operational application was still required to enhance the physical mechanism of model boundaries as reported by zhu et al 2021 besides the calibration of theoretical model boundaries using in situ observations the combination of the new parameterization scheme with microwave based soil moisture products maybe holds great potential to obtain statistically theoretical model boundaries once the model physical mechanism is enhanced the suitable computational grids without missing data are also essential to draw continuous et distribution therefore the spatially and temporally continuous input data that produced by spatial interpolation methods and publicly published reanalysis data would be used in our ongoing work credit authorship contribution

4257,a recent review has suggested relatively simple contextual models would remain attractive in the estimation of evapotranspiration et the surface temperature vegetation index feature space model is a typical representative since it provides direct monitoring of et using simply and effective contextual information however the temporally continuous estimation and large scale application issues are not well identified at previous studies under this background the main motivation for this study is to develop an operational new parameterization scheme within the feature space framework for large scale temporally continuous et estimation specifically the spatial domain division strategy was first designed to obtain the optimal grid division size for large scale et estimation the model boundaries of these sub regions were parameterized using spatial domain based temporal domain information at seasonal scale the applicability of new method was demonstrated over the entire contiguous united states conus in the year 2008 using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and global land surface satellite glass products the comparison between present method and traditional method indicates that the new parameterization scheme produced at different reference spatial domains has a slight accuracy improvement over the 14 fluxnet sites in addition the new method holds unique advantages in its simplicity and continuity especially superior in the temporally continuous estimation of et over a large extended region the validation results of 14 fluxnet sites indicate the correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse the mean bias b values for continuous estimation of daily et were 0 62 28 430 w m2 36 133 w m2 and 0 059 respectively the comparison results with existing et product also demonstrated the comparable of et distribution and estimates meanwhile the boundary parameters obtained at seasonal scale also enhanced the physical meanings of feature space model consequently the new parameterization scheme proposed in this study can be regarded as a suitable tool to provide large scale temporally continuous estimation of et keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing large scale temporally continuous feature space model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is one of the major components in land surface water and energy balance a large variety of field observatory networks have been established to measure et by eddy covariance ec towers energy balance bowen ratio ebbr systems and large aperture scintillometer las with relatively high accuracy baldocchi et al 1996 cheng and li 2015 liu et al 2018 however such field observations are usually costly time consuming and made at point scale abdolghafoorian et al 2017 xu et al 2020 besides in situ measurements et maps can be produced from land surface model dong and dai 2017 jung et al 2017 data assimilation method lievens et al 2017 he et al 2020a machine learning method jung et al 2009 xu et al 2018 physically based model fisher et al 2008 mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 and empirical semi empirical model wang and liang 2008 yao et al 2019 among them remote sensing rs observations provide an alternative to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of et and its related explanatory parameters which is unachievable from sparse filed networks although the driving parameters of et e g soil water availability land surface biophysical vegetation cover type and etc have been well produced based on rs technology there still exist some limitations in the deficiency of suitable computational grids at interested spatial and temporal scales 100 m 1000 m daily weekly tang et al 2013 hssaine et al 2018 cuxart and boone 2020 such factors weigh heavily for operational applications at significantly long integration periods and large extended domain therefore the utilization of most rs based model is a trade off between extensibility and accuracy biggs et al 2016 zhu et al 2017a under this context a unique et parameterization scheme using contextual feature space model with remotely sensed radiative temperature t s and fractional vegetation cover f c information has been widely recognized as an alternative solution to strike this compromise jiang and islam 2001 sandholt et al 2002 tang et al 2010 yang and shang 2013 zhu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 in general a low f c value is in response to a high t s value for the same pixel where slight et would be observed and vice versa consequently the scatterplots of t s and f c measurements would be conceptually triangle technically trapezoid and simplified rectangle shapes if there exists sufficient pixels that representing soil moisture availability and vegetation cover conditions over the study domain the spatial contextual information of t s versus f c first reported by goward et al 1985 has been applied widely to the estimation of et due to its simply mechanism less data input and appropriate performance jiang and islam 2001 tang and li 2017a carlson and petropoulos 2019 chen et al 2020 huang et al 2020 although the feature space based et estimation methods have been developed many different versions they are mostly grounded in the parameterization of upper dry and lower wet edges since the model boundary information is the most important in the feature space method batra et al 2006 tang et al 2010 zhu et al 2020 in general the model boundaries of feature space can be retrieved either from empirical linear regression or theoretical surface energy balance approach sandholt et al 2002 zhang et al 2008 tang et al 2010 long and singh 2012a zhu et al 2017b tang and li 2017a cui et al 2020 huang et al 2020 comprehensive reviews on the estimation of et from the feature space method can be learned from carlson 2007 li et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 and chen and liu 2020 in summary the recently developed theoretical calculation of dry edge and wet edge has improved the mechanism and performance of feature space based et estimation sun 2016 tang and li 2017a however the theoretical method determined by surface energy balance principle and penman monteith equation usually requires complex parameterization process and ancillary meteorological measurements this contradicts to some extent with the intention of feature space method because this method was initially designed to bypass the reliance on ancillary meteorological observations and complex parameterization of heat and water transfer carlson 2007 jiang et al 2009 long and singh 2012a zhu et al 2017a a recent review of et models also suggested relatively simple contextual models are attractive and valuable to practitioners and researchers chen and liu 2020 therefore it is necessary to retain the intention of feature space method and make essential improvement from a perspective of theoretical analysis with model boundary parameters however several common issues associated with t s f c feature space have not been adequately addressed firstly one intrinsic assumption is the feature space method only works well under relatively uniform atmospheric forcing garcia et al 2014 that is the reason why the application of feature space method at regional scale has been commonly reported in most previous studies nishida et al 2003 tang et al 2010 stefan et al 2015 although several studies have documented the scale dependencies and the impact of end member selection at regional scale few literatures have investigated whether the above findings have prospects to large scale et estimation long et al 2012 tang et al 2013 de tomás et al 2014 secondly t s gaps caused by large cloud cover may bring in huge uncertainties in the determination of edge parameters of feature space leng et al 2017 sun 2017 therefore a large amount of studies focused on the t s reconstruction under partically cloudy sky conditions and et estimation under clear sky conditions metz et al 2014 the solution of edge parameters at partially cloudy days were still not well identified which directly leads to the temporally discontinuous thirdly most previous feature space methods were performed with spatial domain of edge parameters although the validity of empirical linear regression and theoretical surface energy balance approaches has been proved the edge parameters were still retrieved at daily scale jiang and islam 2001 long and singh 2012a as several studies indicated a procedure with the temporal domain information could overcome the limitations involved in the spatial domain based methods carlson 2007 minacapilli et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 consequently exploring the characteristics of temporal domain information with respect to the spatial domain may bring possibility to parameterize edge parameters at seasonal or annual scale according to the evolution and limitation of feature space based et estimation this study aims at re reviewing the traditional feature space method from the insights of theoretical solution to estimate temporally continuous et distribution over a large extended area using an operational new parameterization scheme the objectives of this study were to 1 propose a spatial domain division strategies under the background of uniform atmospheric conditions and develop an operational new parameterization scheme nps with respect to the theoretical definition of model boundaries 2 investigate the spatial scale dependencies of model boundary parameters and compare the model performance of nps and traditional parameterization scheme tps at these divided sub regions 3 estimate temporally continuous et distribution over the entire large extended region using the most suitable spatial domain size and nps and validate its consistency with existing et product 2 methodology 2 1 overview of feature space model the feature space method developed by goward et al 1985 has been widely used for the et estimation in many different regions worldwide wang et al 2006 tang et al 2010 chen et al 2020 the basic hypotheses are interpreted as follows if there are enough pixels representing broadly land surface temperature t s and fractional vegetation cover f c conditions over an interested region the envelope of these pixels would constitute a physically meaningful triangle trapezoid or rectangle shape their upper and lower boundaries represent two limiting cases of evapotranspiration consequently et of each pixel within the feature space can be deduced by the interpolation procedures according to its relative position between the dry and wet edges carlson 2007 tang et al 2010 according to long et al 2012 there are basically three kinds of rs based et parameterization schemes derived from feature space method including triangle model trapezoid model and rectangle model see fig 1 among them both triangle and rectangle models entail derivation of dry and wet edges directly from the scatterplot of t s f c conceptual sketch for a certain size of satellite images in contrast trapezoid model employs the surface energy balance equation to detect extreme dry and wet edges without a prior knowledge of a broad of fractional vegetation cover and soil moisture wetness although these three feature space methods are distinct from each other in shape configuration they all utilize the priestley taylor p t formulation to parameterize et distribution jiang and islam 2001 due to the simplicity and operability of the rectangle model over the triangle and trapezoid model only the rectangle model is used in this study to develop an operational new parameterization scheme for large scale temporally continuous et estimation the basic framework of the feature space model is described as below based on an extension of the p t formulation and the definition of evaporative fraction ef the ratio of latent heat flux le to available energy rn g the mathematical expression of et in the feature space is generally described as 1 le δ δ γ r n g where δ represents the gradient of the saturated vapor pressure to the air temperature kpa c 1 γ represents a psychrometric constant kpa c 1 r n and g represent the net radiation and soil heat flux w m 2 represents an integrated priestley taylor parameter accounting for the surface and canopy resistances although parameter looks similar to the α pt α pt 1 26 in the initial version of p t formulation the wide range of surface evaporative conditions is encompassed to estimate et distribution over unsaturated underlying surface the distinct difference of these three models is the parameterization scheme of which is related to the dry edge configuration of feature space for the rectangle feature space abce in fig 1 the calculation scheme of for each pixel is expressed as 2 i a b c e t smax i i i i t s i t smax i i i i t w i max where t smax i i i i and t w i denotes the observed maximum and minimum surface temperature t s i throughout an entire scene respectively unlike t smax i i and t smax i i i which vary with t s f c in triangle and trapezoid feature space t smax i i i i retains constant and therefore constitutes a horizontal upper limit likewise the parameter min i of the dry edge is also set as zero dry edge of rectangle model theoretically corresponds to the driest surfaces for a wide range of fractional vegetation cover and soil moisture conditions the rectangle model is implied in the studies of batra et al 2006 and jiang et al 2009 long and singh 2012b also demonstrated the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal is a rectangular shape compared with triangle and trapezoid parameterization scheme the rectangle feature space is characterized by its simplicity operability and especially its potential for large scale et estimation 2 2 new parameterization scheme of et estimation there are some literatures suggesting that controlled by the incoming solar radiation the seasonal variations of theoretical maximum temperature of bare soil and full vegetated canopy followed a trend similar to cosine curves at a specific spatial domain sun et al 2012a sun et al 2012b zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 inspired by this a new large scale parameterization scheme of et was developed through the combination of the spatial domain based rectangle feature space and temporal domain based statistical fitting method specifically a large extended area is first divided into many sub regions following the hypothesis of uniform atmosphere forcing thereafter the dry edge and wet edge of the rectangle feature space are fitted using cosine function at these sub regions as reported by jiang et al 2009 and long and singh 2012a the dry and wet edges of rectangle were constituted by the surface maximum and minimum temperature in view of these theoretical basis the dry and wet edges of sub regions can be expressed as follows zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 3 t max j a max cos a max θ j b max 4 t min j a min cos a min θ j b min 5 t w j m i n t min j t min j where t max j and t min j represent the fitted dry and wet edges of rectangle feature space respectively a max a max and b max are the fitted parameters of dry edge using daily observed surface maximum temperature t max j and average solar zenith angle time series data as inputs likewise a min a min and b min are the fitted parameters of wet edge by observed surface minimum temperature t min j and average solar zenith angle t w j represents the wet edge which is adopted by the minimum value of fitted surface minimum temperature and observed surface minimum temperature it should be noticed that these input data are all collected under clear sky conditions under this context i in eq 1 can be estimated by eqs 3 5 in a manner of statistically theoretical fitting method to further testify the applicability of new proposed method we would make a comparison with traditional rectangle method which directly uses observed surface maximum and minimum temperature to calculate model boundary information differ from traditional method one motivation of this study is to achieve temporally continuous estimation of et regardless of the weather conditions that is to estimate t max j and t min j of eqs 3 and 4 using only solar zenith angle that under partially cloudy conditions as inputs therefore it s a new attempt to achieve temporally continuous estimation of et based on the temporal domain information of spatial domain based feature space model we only focus on the introduction of new nps and traditional tps parameterization scheme in this section the detailed technical and data processing stream will be explained in the following section due to the feature space model only provides instantaneous snapshots of latent heat flux at the satellite overpass times daily latent heat flux estimation has more application fields than instantaneous values following the studies of tang and li 2017b and cui et al 2020 the instantaneous fluxes are scaled to daily values by assuming that the ef is constant throughout the daytime that means ef obtained at the satellite overpass time is approximately equal to the daytime value using above assumption the daily et value is extrapolated using the following formulation vinukollu et al 2011 6 et daily i n max t max j t s i t max j t w j δ δ γ i r n g daytime i where n is set as 1 07 following the study of sugita and brutsaert 1991 which includes the evaporation from night time to avoid the complex calculation of radiative transfer equation involved in most feature space based latent heat flux estimation we take full advantage of the existing daytime net radiation product which is provided by global land surface satellite glass jiang et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 besides the determination of surface heat flux is interpreted as 7 g daytime i r n d a y t i m e i γ veg 1 f c i γ soil γ veg 8 f c i ndvi i ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min 2 where γ veg and γ soil are the coefficients over full vegetation and bare soil which can be taken as 0 05 and 0 315 respectively daughtry et al 1990 vinukollu et al 2011 yang et al 2017 f c i represents the fractional vegetation cover which is calculated by the squared relationship with ndvi gillies et al 1997 ndvi min and ndvi max represent the minimum and maximum ndvi values over the entire study region respectively following the study of zhang et al 2009 and sun et al 2013 the full vegetated surface is defined as ndvi max 0 95 and bare soil is recognized as ndvi min 0 05 2 3 strategies of scale dependencies and sub region division de tomás et al 2014 suggested that a prior selection of spatial domain size is a non trivial but decisive task in general the enlarging of domain size would be helpful to maximize the probability of finding true dry and wet edges but the assumption of relatively uniform atmospheric forcing may be compromised garcia et al 2014 inspired by this besides the modification of traditional feature space method we also investigate the scale dependencies to choose a proper window size for large scale et estimation under the background of uniform atmospheric conditions specifically scale dependencies were determined from two aspects firstly the spatial domain dependencies of observed model boundaries over the rectangle feature space were explored secondly the spatial domain dependencies of et estimates at both new and traditional parameterization scheme were compared the purpose of scale dependencies was to comprehend the influence of spatial domain expansion on the model boundaries and model performance it would provide a promising reference for us to choose a suitable reference domain size for large scale et estimation due to the limitation of uniform atmosphere forcing it s necessary to divide a large extended region to many sub regions using a grid mask as previous studies suggested 50 km 100 km 150 km and 200 km were adopted as reference grid masks to divide the large extended region into many different sub regions respectively long et al 2012 tang et al 2013 biggs et al 2016 molero et al 2016 babaeian et al 2018 in addition the clear sky condition was required to well distinguish the model boundaries at each sub region therefore a cloud cover less than 20 at interested region was adopted to define the clear sky days following the studies of venturini et al 2008 and zhu et al 2020 specifically the land cover type product at 1 km spatial resolution was used to calculate the reference number of valid clear sky pixels and make the template of clear sky days the surface temperature product at daily scale was adopted to evaluate whether it s under clear sky conditions by comparing the number of valid temperature data with the aforementioned reference value on this basis we can obtain the maximum and minimum surface temperature distribution at each sub region under clear sky conditions the corresponding daily average solar zenith angle of each sub region was also extracted according to eqs 4 and 5 the dry edge and wet edge parameters of new parameterization scheme nps at 50 km 100 km 150 km and 200 km sub regions can be fitted under clear sky conditions meanwhile the traditional parameterization scheme tps can be driven by the input of maximum and minimum surface temperature in these sub regions after the investigation of scale dependencies we would choose the optimal spatial domain size to estimate et distribution over a large extended region composed of these sub regions the workflow of this study is summarized schematically in fig 2 2 4 error metrics there are no generally accepted methodologies to evaluate the accuracy of et retrieved from rs observations due to the mismatch in spatial scale with field measurements following most previous studies et observations obtained at site scale were used directly to validate the accuracy of rs based estimates at 1 km spatial resolution walker et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 feng et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 four error metrics were employed to assess the accuracy of et estimates they are correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse the mean bias b entekhabi et al 2010 9 r i 1 n p i p i o i o i i 1 n p i p i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 10 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 12 b p i o i 1 where p i represents the estimated et o i represents the observed et p i and o i represent the mean values of et estimates and et observations respectively 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the contiguous united states conus region is located in latitude between 24 8 n to 49 5 n and in longitude from 66 5 w to 124 8 w fig 3 this study area is large and the ecoclimatic characteristics in different regions are obviously diverse the dominant vegetation types of conus are grassland cropland forest and shrubland influenced by warm and humid airstream in the atlantic the precipitation increases gradually from west to east with an annual average value about 760 mm he et al 2020b a large variety of flux networks have been established over this region to monitor moisture momentum fluxes and surface heat i e first international satellite land surface climatology project field experiment fife ameriflux atmospheric radiation measurement arm and etc sellers et al 1988 baldocchi et al 1996 besides the abundant datasets the heterogeneous distribution of air temperature precipitation topography and vegetation system also makes the conus region an ideal domain for the development of model and evaluation of model performance senay et al 2013 xu et al 2019 he et al 2020b 3 2 ground based measurements flux and meteorological data from 14 sites retrieved from the fluxnet2015 network https fluxnet fluxdata org were utilized in this study table 1 the 14 sites used in this study span over different climate zone covering the diverse vegetation cover type and a wide range of environmental gradients fig 3 therefore the consideration of these sites enables the testing of the broader applicability of our proposed method on a large extended region all sites use the eddy covariance ec flux method to measure energy fluxes and all observations used in this study were collected in the year 2008 in this study daily latent heat le were utilized to evaluate the accuracy of et estimation the meteorological data of air temperature collected at 30 min interval was applied to validate the accuracy of air temperature estimation at satellite overpass time generally the available energy rn g is prone to be more than the sum of the sensible and latent heat fluxes h le from the ec system foken 2008 thus bowen ratio method br was applied to correct values of le observations from ec 3 3 satellite data besides ground based measurements the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra products and global land surface satellite glass product were also used in this study table 2 both of them provided global coverage and long observation period 2000 to present for modis and 2000 to 2018 for glass specifically the modis products consisted of daily t s observations at 1 km spatial resolution mod11a1 was adopted to retrieve maximum t max j and minimum t min j surface temperature daily solar zenith θ angle observations at 1 km spatial resolution mod03 was employed to estimate spatially average solar zenith angle the daily cloud observations mod06 l2 and daily atmosphere profile observations mod07 l2 at 5 km spatial resolution were resampled to 1 km and adopted for the estimation of near surface air temperature t a following zhu et al 2017c the vegetation cover type observations at 500 m spatial resolution mcd12q1 was resampled to 1 km and employed to make clear sky template the 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product at 1 km spatial resolution mod13a2 was time series smoothed using the algorithm proposed by chen et al 2006 and interpolated to the daily value the fractional vegetation cover f c was calculated using the squared relationship with ndvi proposed by gillies et al 1997 in addition to the modis products glass product includes daytime net radiation at 5 km spatial resolution was employed and resampled to 1 km jiang et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 to make a comparison with other widely used products the principle of 1 km spatial resolution and produced at daily scale were designed to acquire the qualified et products on this basis the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop et product was selected in this study senay et al 2013 senay 2018 it should be noted that the nearest interpolation method was adopted to obtain input parameters with 1 km spatial resolution meanwhile the lower quality data from these products were removed by the additional quality control information sun 2016 4 results 4 1 variations of dry and wet edges with domain size to investigate the variations of dry and wet edges with domain enlarging the spatial domain grids of 14 ground sites are considered as a representative example the number of clear sky days for these spatial grids is first calculated which is presented in table 3 the decrease of clear sky days with the increase of domain size were observed at most sites and the number of clear sky days was diverse among different grids specifically us whs and us wkg located grids have nearly the highest clear sky days than other sites the number of clear sky days over us ib2 and us oho were at a low level with an average values of 100 96 85 and 78 for these four domains respectively the difference in the number of clear sky days maybe contributed to the geographical location water vapor conditions and local circulation once the clear sky days was masked at these four domains we can easily derived the dry edge and wet edge of the rectangle feature space fig 4 presents the annual variations of observed dry and wet edges for four domains under clear sky conditions in general the samples within each site located spatial grid are distributed evenly throughout the year which enables us to capture the seasonal variations of dry and wet edges it is apparent that the upper limits of these curves at different spatial grids present a trend similar to cosine characteristic in contrast to upper limits the lower limits seem to be poorly demarcated at some sites like us src us srg and srm that a doublecosinecurve were observed besides the shapes of dry and wet edges the amplitudes of these limits also implicitly indicate the overall hydrothermal conditions the amplitudes of dry edge with a lower maximum surface temperature were produced at sites us arm us ib2 us mms and us oho compared with other sites meanwhile the differences of amplitudes for dry and wet edges also indicated these sites have a slight variation of temperature over four domains this maybe hamper the requirement of a broad range of soil moisture and temperature conditions that intrinsic in feature space method therefore we would further investigate the influence of deficient model boundary conditions on the accuracy of et estimates in the following section as reported by long et al 2012 increasing the domain size would increase the heterogeneity in the land surface for a general case and consequently result in variations in the boundary conditions of feature space model this discovery can also be demonstrated in this study that the maximum surface temperature is increased and minimum surface temperature is decreased with an enlarging domain size however some particular cases were also observed at sites us me2 us mms with the maximum surface temperature mostly obtained at 150 km domain and us ton us var with the minimum surface temperature also mostly obtained at 150 km domain fig 5 presents the distribution of surface temperature at these four sites over four domains it is obvious that the incomplete inclusion relationship was generally existed in site located four domains only 50 km grid was included in other three spatial domain grids the lower area overlappingproportion promotes the heterogeneity of temperature distribution which was especially significant at 150 km and 200 km grids the maximum temperature of us me2 located 150 km domain was obviously higher than the 200 km domain as opposite to the maximum temperature the minimum surface temperature at 150 km domain was lower at site us me2 than 200 km domain in terms of site us mms the area overlappingproportion was larger than us me2 and the distribution of maximum and minimum temperature over 150 km and 200 km were very similar with each other to illustrate more reasonable we calculated the maximum and minimum temperature of these two grids the maximum temperature with 315 36 k and 312 32 k and minimum temperature with 290 78 k and 290 78 k were produced over 150 km and 200 km domains respectively besides the particular cases in maximum temperature the significant difference in minimum temperature was observed at sites us ton and us var these two sites located in the same four spatial domains therefore they share common model boundaries the minimum temperature with 287 16 k and 296 64 k were obtained at 150 km and 200 km domains respectively it is obvious that the minimum temperature obtained at 150 km domain was far lower than 200 km domain due to the intrinsic disadvantage in the division of large extended region the issue of incomplete inclusion was unavoidable therefore we would also display the influence of incomplete inclusion on the accuracy of et estimation in the following section 4 2 variations of et estimates with domain size for the purpose of reminder the traditional parameterization scheme tps of rectangle feature space can be expressed by eqs 1 and 2 with the maximum and minimum temperature at four domains the proposed new parameterization scheme nps requires theoretical fitted maximum and minimum temperature eqs 3 5 combined with eqs 1 and 2 besides the spatially average solar zenith angle used for the fitting function the air temperature t a and net radiation r n were also essential for the performance of nps and tps fortunately the validity of glass net radiation products released by jiang et al 2016 and jiang et al 2018 has been demonstrated at global scale which containing the 17 measurement networks compared with r n t a was also indispensable in the expression of term δ δ γ in eq 1 therefore the accuracy of t a estimates was further evaluated since the method proposed by zhu et al 2017b was only demonstrated at basin scale fig 6 presents the accuracy of t a estimates over different vegetation cover types the r mae rmse and b of t a estimates were 0 97 2 32 k 2 97 k and 0 06 which are consistent with the accuracy of zhu et al 2017c therefore the terms in eq 1 has been well quantified and only the performance of dry and wet edges requires to be recognized in terms of the accuracy of et estimates over four domains fig 7 shows the taylor diagrams of et estimates against the et observations at different spatial grids it is used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the modeled and observed behavior from three statistics thepearson correlation coefficient r theroot mean square error rmse and thestandard deviation sd taylor 2001 because the et observations of these 14 sites were different from each other the relative sd and rmse rsd and rrmse were utilized in the presentation of taylor diagram meanwhile the taylor diagram solely characterizes the centered pattern error we also summarize the information about overall bias of nps and tps over four domains in table 4 the annual series from tps and nps estimates are similar and are located close to each other in the taylor diagrams specifically the tps and nps over four domains have similar r values mostly ranging between 0 6 and 0 9 and the rmse values are ranged from 23 020 w m2 to 76 643 w m2 however a slight accuracy improvement was observed at nps in the average values of rmse and b over four domains which has been reduced by 0 832 w m2 and 0 106 respectively besides the comparison of different parameterization schemes we found the optimal performance of nps and tps was achieved at 150 km spatial domain the average values of rmse and b were 36 985 w m2 and 0 128 over these two parameterization schemes respectively meanwhile the worst accuracy of et estimates was obtained at 50 km spatial domain with the average rmse and b values of 44 387 w m2 and 0 717 across all sites the best performance was observed at 150 km domain derived nps with r rmse and b values of 0 65 36 340 w m2 and 0 093 respectively therefore the nps with 150 km spatial grid was recognized as the most suitable spatial reference for et estimation over entire conus as we mentioned above the influence in the deficiency of model boundary conditions and incomplete inclusion of spatial grids are existed in this study for the former factor the significant influence was observed at aforementioned sites of us arm us ib2 us mms and us oho specifically the average rmse values with nps at these four sites were 45 289 w m2 34 665 w m2 76 052 w m2 and 43 648 w m2 respectively meanwhile the worse accuracy of et estimates for sites us ib2 us mms and us oho were produced at 50 km domain this partly explains the model boundaries with wide range of fractional vegetation cover and soil moisture conditions was also necessary in rectangle feature space for the later factor the accuracy difference was apparent at site us me2 with rmse values of 37 422 w m2 and 76 643 w m2 and at site us mms with rmse values of 43 335 w m2 and 71 971 w m2 over 150 km and 200 km spatial domains respectively although the incomplete inclusion of spatial grids may be eliminated when a suitable window size was selected to large scale application it s also valuable to investigate the influence of different hydrothermal conditions in addition it should also be noticed that site us mms has the worst performance with rmse values of 75 8 w m2 79 794 w m2 76 643 w m2 and 71 971 w m2 when tps is employed at four different spatial domains respectively although the accuracy of et estimates achieved at sites us mms has been improved by nps the worst performance was still observed across all 14 sites thus both the model boundary conditions and spatial grids selection will affect the accuracy of et estimates especially over such large extended region this also emphasizes the importance of prior calibration for selecting a proper window domain de tomás et al 2014 4 3 accuracy of temporally continuous et estimation both empirical and theoretical feature space methods require a broad range of vegetation cover and soil moisture availability pixels for the construction model boundaries as a result most previous feature space models only work well when the cloud cover of interested region is less than the threshold similarly the new proposed parameterization scheme was also performed under clear sky conditions however unlike previous empirical and theoretical methods parameterized at daily scale the nps was designed at seasonal scale once the fitted parameters in eqs 3 and 4 were produced at clear sky days the model boundaries at daily scale can be retrieved directly by using solar zenith as input here we presented the fitted parameters of dry and wet edges in table 5 the parameters a max a min b max and b min were very similar at these 14 sites to further investigate the ability of nps for continuous estimation of et the fitted parameters from eqs 3 and 4 under clear sky conditions at 150 km spatial domain were directly applied to the estimation of et under partially cloudy conditions the partially cloudy conditions defined here refer to the cloud cover over each spatial domain is more than 20 the results of temporally continuous estimation of et across these 14 sites were presented in fig 8 and the accuracy of tps and nps produced at clear sky days were also summarized in table 6 in general the seasonal variation trend of et at most sites could be captured by the new parameterization scheme with r ranging from 0 51 to 0 77 though there were some significant mismatches on individual days overall the four statistical metrics produced by nps under all weather conditions were 0 66 29 997 w m2 37 343 w m2 0 160 respectively the above statistics were a little higher than those produced under clear sky conditions which were 0 65 29 548 w m2 36 340 w m2 0 093 respectively the good agreements between nps produced et estimates under clear sky conditions and partially cloudy sky conditions demonstrated the ability of temporally continuous et estimation by nps in addition to the overall evaluation the significant difference in the accuracy of et were also site specific for sites us arm us ib2 and us oho the errors were mainly caused by the inadequate model boundary conditions that leads to the underestimation of et peak values although this underestimation was also observed at sites us src us srm and us srg the overestimation of et trough values played a partial role unlike the underestimation of et peak values implied at sites us arm us ib2 and us oho the large values of mae and rmse at site us mms were mainly caused by the large underestimation of et at trough values there are also a special case at the 150 km spatial domain that is us src us srg us srm us wks and us wkg share common model boundaries although the heterogeneous land cover type were apart them from each other the similarity in accuracy demonstrated the importance of prior calibration for the window domain this relationship and similar performance can also be obtained at sites us ton and us var though these two sites have overestimated et at both peak and through values moreover controlled by the cosine function of t smax the time series of et estimates were similar to a cosine curve with the peak value arising in summer on the contrary the seasonal fluctuation of et observations was much more significant and complex for example at sites us src us srg and us srm there were two peak values arising in the curves of observed et fortunately a distinct doublesinecurve at wet edge and indistinct doublesinecurve at dry edge were captured by remote sensing based surface temperature observations fig 4 b this contributed to the effectively capture from these sharp variations of et observations 4 4 et distribution over conus a close look at table 5 indicates the parameters a and b produced by eqs 3 and 4 were similar at most sites respectively inspired by this we adopt the average values of a and b as 0 489 and 0 114 to estimate et for these 14 sites the results of fitted amplitude parameters in dry edge and wet edge were summarized in table 7 the overall accuracy with r mae rmse and b values for continuous et estimation were 0 62 28 430 w m2 36 133 w m2 and 0 059 which has a slight improvement compared with those produced in table 5 this slight difference can be explained from two aspects firstly as long et al 2012 suggested the utilization of observed dry edge and wet edge in feature space model may result in coincidently reasonable et estimates therefore it s not surprised to obtain the similar overall accuracy when constant parameters a and b were used in the parameterization of model boundaries secondly yang and shang 2013 indicated t s was sensitive to the variation of et estimates and long et al 2012 also suggested the et distribution over surfaces pixels approaching the observed limiting edges maybe distorted when the model boundaries were overestimated or underestimated therefore this is also the reason why the overall agreement of accuracy was observed from fig 8 and table 7 whereas independent discrepancies were also observed at some sites i e us arm and us srm considering the improvement of b and simplicity required in large scale application the constant values of a and b were adopted for the et estimation over the entire conus fig 9 presents the spatial distribution of amplitude parameters in dry edge and wet edge and the parameters a and b were retained constant throughout the entire conus the amplitude parameters within dry edge and wet edge were ranged from 298 25 k to 330 50 k and from 278 36 k to 315 37 k respectively as indicated in most previous studies the soil moisture index t max j t s i t max j t w j that implied in eq 6 has ability to reflect the soil moisture conditions sun et al 2012a sun et al 2012b zhu et al 2017b bai et al 2020 in general high amplitude parameters in t max j usually represent relative low soil moisture content therefore we can easily infer that the western region of conus suffers from serious drought than the eastern region as indicated by sun et al 2012a sun et al 2012b and zhu et al 2017a theoretical upper limit was controlled by the incoming solar radiation whereas statistically based upper limit developed in this study can be regarded as an integration of incoming solar radiation and land surface hydrothermal status therefore the annual solution of amplitude parameters provides a physical perspective to well identify the model boundaries of feature space meanwhile the difference of amplitude parameters in dry and wet edges a max a min also indicates that there is a slight temperature variations in the eastern region that means the well water conditions were generally obtained at eastern region due to the principle of thermal inertia especially in the northeast conus meanwhile well water conditions usually corresponding to homogeneous hydrothermal conditions throughout the year and inadequate model boundary conditions may be included in such situation garcia et al 2014 also emphasized the effective application of feature space method may be suitable when the region was water limited rather than energy limited this partially explained the reason why the sites in eastern region that reported in table 7 have large discrepancies with in situ observations consequently the physical meanings of new proposed parameterization scheme has also been enhanced from another perspective once the dry edge and wet edge were determined the daily et distribution can be estimated using constant evaporative fraction method of eq 6 the distribution of average daily et in the year 2008 was presented in fig 10 a which was similar to the distribution of amplitude parameters in fig 9 in addition the et distribution also indicated drought was obvious at western region of conus with the et values less than 1 0 mm d the higher et estimates with the values more than 5 mm d was produced at southeast region of conus as previous studies suggested the high et values in the southeast region are mainly due to heavy precipitation and dense vegetation cover xu et al 2019 he et al 2020b to make a comparison with other product that released at conus or global the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop et product was selected in this study senay et al 2013 senay 2018 the daily et estimates from ssebop was averaged over the whole year its distribution was presented in fig 10 b the et estimates between these two methods have high agreements at either et value magnitudes or entire variation trends the spatial similarity between amplitude parameters in fig 9 and ssebop derived et estimates also demonstrated the validity of boundary parameters besides the et estimates produced by ssebop and nps of 14 ground sites were also compared in general both nps and ssebop et estimates can capture the annual variation of in situ et measurements meanwhile the et estimates from ssebop et product are highly consistent with the et estimates from nps at both clear and partially cloudy sky days with the r mae rmse and b values of 0 67 27 186 w m2 36 929 w m2 and 0 23 respectively however ssebop et slightly underestimated measured values while nps greatly reduced this underestimation at most sites consequently the simplicity and reasonably good performance make the nps a considerable choice among other products 5 discussions 5 1 comparison with other studies to the best of our knowledge there were few literatures have applied the feature space model to such a large extended region like conus due to the assumption of relatively uniform atmospheric forcing an appropriate regional et estimation was reported in most previous studies jiang et al 1999 tang et al 2010 long et al 2012 chen et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 therefore this study could be regarded as a novel attempt to estimate large scale et distribution with respect to both spatial domain and temporal domain information for the selection of spatial domain de tomás et al 2014 has emphasized the importance of a prior calibration for selecting a proper window domain long et al 2012 indicated the traditional empirical feature space models appear to perform well across an area of approximately 10 000 km2 meanwhile biggs et al 2016 also emphasized the study of long et al 2011 that domain size greater than 20 000 30 000 km2 may increase error in surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model unlike the findings in long et al 2012 the optimal grid size of 22 500 km2 was output in this study and it was located the recommended grid size of long et al 2011 and biggs et al 2016 the fig 7 and table 4 indicated the statistical errors of et estimates were gradually increased when the grid size was 40 000 km2 therefore it also demonstrated the conclusions of previous studies on the basis of long et al 2012 and tang et al 2013 incomplete inclusion of spatial grids were discovered and its influence on the accuracy of et estimates was also evaluated in this study however the mechanism of incomplete inclusion caused different hydrothermal conditions should be highlighted or concerned in the further development of empirical feature space model as for the selection of temporal domain we utilized the spatial domain information of rectangle feature space and parameterized at annual scale it should be noticed that unlike the temporal domain applied in pixel or the whole region reported in previous studies this study was operated at divided sub regions within the entire large region minacapilli et al 2016 zhu et al 2017a zhu et al 2020 therefore it would be more operational and has great potential in retrieving et distribution globally in addition the sub regions division has not only conformedto the inherent hypothesis of feature space model but also provided more clear sky days for the parameterization of model boundary conditions generally the feature space model can only be applied to very few days over one year i e 24 days in the research conducted by tang et al 2010 19 days in filion et al 2016 and 89 days in zhu et al 2020 however the average clear sky days recorded in table 3 is 165 which enables us to capture the extreme information of model boundary conditions throughout the year more importantly the utilization of temporal domain information also provided an opportunity to characterize the model boundary conditions at partially cloudy sky days zhu et al 2021 meanwhile the et estimation under partially cloudy sky conditions has an accuracy comparable to those produced under clear sky conditions compared with the et estimates under clear sky conditions that reported in most previous studies the new parameterization scheme can be regarded as a promising solution to obtain temporally continuous et estimates wang et al 2006 tang et al 2010 zhu et al 2017a chen et al 2020 besides the comparison of model parameterization scheme it is also necessary to conduct a comparison of model performance with other feature space based studies for better understanding the accuracy of our proposed method however the performance of models counts not only on the areas of the spatial domain but also the resolution of satellite observations long et al 2012 de tomás et al 2014 in view of this only previous studies which applied the feature space method to estimate et at daily scale were used in our comparison in the study of stisen et al 2008 the geostationary msg seviri sensor was utilized to estimate daily et producing the rmse of 41 45 w m2 over senegal river basin in the year 2005 msg seviri based daily available energy and modis terra based instantaneous ef were adopted in the study of sun et al 2012a and sun et al 2012b the daily et was tended to underestimate by 13 to 35 compared with site observations chen et al 2020 used a trapezoidal framework based model pcalep to estimate daily et over the junction of southwest and southeastern china the rmse obtained in their study were 36 3 w m2 and 39 7 w m2 at two ground sites in three clear sky days respectively it should be noted that these three studies were produced at clear sky days the accuracy of temporally continuous et estimates achieved in this study is comparable with those produced by other methods applied to regional scale besides this study cui et al 2020 developed a gap filling algorithm using deep neural network dnn based feature space model to obtain the temporally continuous daily et estimation the mae and rmse achieved in their study for one site over three years were 18 414 w m2 and 24 363 w m2 respectively although the accuracy of continuous et estimation was higher than this study the number of validation samples and the size of study area were far lower than this study nevertheless the gap filling algorithm using machine learning provides a unique perspective distinct from this study to capture the continuous model input parameters and et estimates in summary the present study is the first comprehensive research to estimate large scale temporally continuous et over a full year and the accuracy of et estimates has reached a comparable level by comparing with other studies 5 2 assessment of the new parameterization scheme the most significant attribute of the new proposed method is the combination of the spatial and temporal domain information of feature space model unlike the previous studies applied the temporal information to specific pixel this study aims at retaining the spatial domain information and re reviewing the boundary conditions at each spatial domain to excavate the temporal information that means the dry edge and wet edge used to define the extreme evapotranspiration rate conditions are each spatial domain specific as a result it has not only retained the initial intention imposed by the feature space model but also made it possible to conduct a temporally continuous monitoring of evapotranspiration specifically a rectangle feature space was adopted to define the model boundaries and a large number of pixels obtained under clear sky conditions were required to parameterize dry edge and wet edge the dry edge and wet edge at each domain grid were calculated using spatial domain based temporal domain information in contrast with the spatial domain based feature space method et of each pixel can be retrieved regardless of the weather conditions of surrounding pixels as summarized by tang et al 2010 the feature space approach presents mainly two common advantages in general 1 the relative position of pixels within the model boundaries are used to estimate et and highly accurate t s retrievals are not necessarily required 2 parameter is a replacement for the aerodynamic term therefore ancillary meteorological measurements and complex parameterization process are avoided in contrast to the intrinsic advantages the new parameterization scheme used in this study also has other significant advantages in particular 1 the large scale et estimation by feature space method is achieved for the first time especially provides an reference in selecting a proper window domain for large scale et estimation 2 the major hypothesis of traditional spatial domain feature space method in uniform atmospheric conditions is retained in this study because we only divide a large spatial domain into many sub regions following the previous studies recommended and numerical experiment tested results 3 the model boundary parameters at partially cloudy sky conditions are well captured by new parameterization scheme therefore temporally continuous estimation of et is achieved 4 the input parameters are entirely counted on the satellite observations and pre calibration workflow using in situ observations is not included therefore it provides an opportunity to retrieve et distribution globally zhu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 5 the theoretical mechanism is enhanced by the annual solution of boundary parameters it has more physical meanings on the reflection of land surface hydrothermal conditions and model boundary conditions additionally the new parameterization scheme also has its own disadvantages described below 1 as long et al 2012 suggested although the utilization of observed dry edge and wet edge in feature space models may result in coincidently reasonable et estimates the et distribution over surfaces pixels approaching the observed limiting edges maybe distorted this is also the reason why some peak values are underestimated and trough values are overestimated at most sites it is unavoidable in empirical feature space models therefore further investigation of special issues and mechanism are indispensable 2 as fig 8 presented the et estimates also have missing days since the deficiency of enough t s t a and f c pixels at both clear and partially cloudy days therefore gap filling methods of input parameters and objective parameter would be the focus of our further studies certainly the parameterization scheme would be modified or investigated when the interpolated or filled input variables are adopted 3 the new parameterization scheme relies heavily on the satellite observations therefore higher quality of the input variables is required meanwhile the utilization of satellite observations maybe further operated at google earth engine gee planetary scale platform it provides powerful parallel computing capability zhang et al 2019 6 conclusions in view of the difficulties of feature space model in estimating large scale temporally continuous et distribution an operational new parameterization scheme nps using spatial domain based temporal domain information of feature space model was proposed in this study specifically a prior calibration workflow for selecting a proper window domain was initially designed following de tomás et al 2014 the 50 km 100 km 150 km and 200 km spatial grids were adopted as spatial references to divide the large extended region into many sub regions the dry and wet edges of these sub regions were first fitted by the cosine function and corresponding observed maximum and minimum surface temperature under clear sky conditions respectively the scale dependencies of different spatial domains were investigated and the most suitable spatial domain was final selected the nps was applied to the entire contiguous united states conus in the year 2008 using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and global land surface satellite glass products the traditional parameterization scheme tps was also adopted to demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method the results show that the utilization of observed dry edge and wet edge at different sub regions may cause inadequate model boundary conditions though coincidently reasonable et estimates were achieved meanwhile the incomplete inclusion of spatial grids was also existed in different sub regions and also has influence on the accuracy of et estimation it s unavoidable in current empirical feature space model therefore further investigation of special issues and mechanism are indispensable the optimal domain size of 150 km was outputted in our comparison the accuracy of the nps under clear sky conditions has an accuracy improvement compared with that of tps the nps also enables us to retrieve continuous et distribution over conus the overall accuracy of the correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse the mean bias b values were 0 62 28 430 w m2 36 133 w m2 and 0 059 respectively the present study is the first comprehensive research to estimate large scale temporally continuous et over a full year and the accuracy of et estimates has reached a comparable level with other released large scale et product although the feature space method with spatial domain based temporal domain information provides an opportunity to retrieve temporally continuous et distribution its operational application was still required to enhance the physical mechanism of model boundaries as reported by zhu et al 2021 besides the calibration of theoretical model boundaries using in situ observations the combination of the new parameterization scheme with microwave based soil moisture products maybe holds great potential to obtain statistically theoretical model boundaries once the model physical mechanism is enhanced the suitable computational grids without missing data are also essential to draw continuous et distribution therefore the spatially and temporally continuous input data that produced by spatial interpolation methods and publicly published reanalysis data would be used in our ongoing work credit authorship contribution

4258,the easy accessibility of groundwater in the alluvial plains of the kosi river basin has considerably altered the crop calendar and farmers irrigation response especially in the dry years after 2004 the present study attempts to develop a framework for analyzing the spatio temporal variation in the groundwater recharge extraction pattern as well as river and aquifer flux exchange due to increasing anthropogenic activities in the basin the influence of anthropogenic activities over groundwater recharge extraction statistics has been discussed in laveti et al 2021 the estimated groundwater recharge laveti et al 2021 along with aquifer characteristics hydraulic conductivity porosity and specific storage and riverbed conductance were used as inputs to the groundwater flow transient model in the study the model observed an increasing groundwater dependency for agricultural activities results in a continuous increase of flux from the river to the aquifer between 1997 and 2010 the river to aquifer flux increased by almost 1 of the average river discharge this increase in river to aquifer flux exchange was evident especially during the dry periods after 2004 which coincided with the government s million shallow tube well programme mstp in the basin the increasing trend of the river to aquifer flux transfer and the decreasing trend of the aquifer to river flux transfer observed in the kosi basin can have disturbing long term effects in terms of reduced river flow and river stage therefore the concerned authorities and the stakeholders must take immediate notice of the observations keywords river aquifer interaction groundwater flow modelling anthropogenic activities indian basins groundwater recharge actual evapotranspiration 1 introduction the interaction between a river and aquifer system is a crucial aspect of any hydrological process that needs to be investigated at a river reach scale winter et al 1998 the transfer of water through this interaction process can be in both directions river to aquifer or aquifer to river depending on several governing factors the influent or effluent nature of flux transfer may change spatially and temporally with alteration in river stage and groundwater levels engeler et al 2011 the hydraulic gradient between a river and an aquifer and the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed are the major factors influencing the exchange of flux doppler et al 2007 most of the base flow during low flow season comes from the groundwater flow through the hyporheic zone in most river basins therefore understanding and quantifying the river aquifer exchange flux is essential for effective groundwater management sophocleous 2002 the river aquifer interaction has been studied by multiple researchers at different spatial and temporal scales bailey et al 2016 chitsazan et al 2015 derx et al 2010 eikenberg et al 2001 miller et al 2003 rushton 2007 sahoo and sahoo 2019 tang et al 2017 vrzel et al 2018 workman et al 1997 various methodologies and approaches have been used to understand and quantify river aquifer exchange epting et al 2018 mccallum et al 2014 rahman et al 2016 ward et al 2013 wen et al 2019 the field based approaches include measurement of streambed temperature profiles anibas et al 2011 essaid and caldwell 2017 and seepage meters brodie et al 2009 the measurement using these field based approaches may offer some degree of accuracy but the spatial scale of their applicability is limited several numerical modelling techniques have been employed to quantify river aquifer exchange flux at larger scales bailey et al 2016 kumar and nagaraj 2018 rushton 2007 sanz et al 2011 werner et al 2006 modflow is also a popular numerical model to simulate river aquifer interaction barlow and harbaugh 2006 furman 2008 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 groundwater pumping for irrigation purposes peña arancibia et al 2020 yue et al 2020 can significantly impact the recharge pattern of an agricultural dominated river basin these recharge effects in turn significantly impact the influx or efflux to a river from the underlying aquifer system therefore any effort to study the river aquifer interaction without incorporating the influence of groundwater extraction patterns may lead to imprecise conclusions however no significant effort has been observed in the literature addressing the impact of such anthropogenic influence on the river aquifer interaction therefore the present study attempts to understand the impact on the river and aquifer interactions due to enhanced groundwater utilization for irrigational activities the alluvial part in the southern part of the kosi river basin in bihar in the indian sub continent was considered as the study region the part of the basin under discussion has been subjected to intense agricultural activities over recent years ninety percent of the study region is covered with agricultural lands laveti 2020 the groundwater demands to sustain such intense agricultural activities in the study area have also increased significantly covering almost 80 of total irrigation demands sinha et al 2018 the implementation of the green revolution programme during 1970 1971 has transformed the agricultural practices in the ganga basin the total number of groundwater extraction systems used for irrigational activities has increased from 0 37 million 1976 1977 to 1 56 million 1997 1998 in just two decades kumar et al 2017 as a result in two decades the area under irrigation has increased from 28 8 during 1970 71 season to around 43 5 in 1989 90 season wilson 2002 the development of irrigational systems along with supplementary measures have ensured substantial enhancements in agricultural productions and productivity in the region singh et al 2004 the number of groundwater irrigation systems has further increased since the million shallow tube well programme mstp in 2004 kishore et al 2019 this program has improved the accessibility of groundwater to the state s farmers and as a result it has significantly increased the net irrigated area the accessibility of groundwater for agricultural purposes has resulted in substantial growth in agricultural production and the state s economy the increasing trend of groundwater utilization depleted the groundwater resources in terms of decline in water table laveti et al 2021 the present study further extends the findings of laveti et al 2021 and develops a framework that can account for the impact of anthropogenic activities in terms of alteration in groundwater utilization on the river aquifer interaction pattern the framework itself and its outcomes are crucial for developing a sustainable water resources strategy in any agriculture dominated alluvial river basin 2 study area and data used the study area included the alluvial parts of the kosi basin one of the major tributaries of ganga river in india encompassing nine major districts in bihar supaul saharsa araria khagaria bhagalpur madhepura and purnia rai et al 2018 sinha and friend 1994 fig 1 in laveti et al 2021 the entire kosi basin was discretized into various sub basins using the watershed delineation processes in the soil and water assessment tool swat model the present study considered the sub basins s 11 s 12 s 13 s 14 s 15 s 16 and s 17 from the kosi basin for analyzing the anthropogenic influence on river aquifer exchange processes the river s length in the study area is 240 km from kosi barrage upstream until its confluence point with river ganga downstream two observation well stations supaul and jaynagar located in sub basins s 15 and s 12 were used to calibrate and validate the groundwater model the basin falls in the sub tropical belt and experiences a humid climate in the southern part of the basin and a cold arid climate in the northern mountainous region shrestha et al 2017 the average annual rainfall over the basin is 1000 mm more than 80 of which occurs during the monsoon season rajbhandari et al 2017 shrestha 2000 the basin experiences a wide range of spatial temperature variations with temperatures generally decreasing towards the northern part of the basin himalayan region in general the highest temperatures are recorded in june approximate 27 c and 32 c in the mountains regions and the hilly regions respectively and the lowest in december or january 0 c and 5 c in the mountains and the hills respectively agarwal et al 2016 a significant part of the kosi basin under discussion has been subjected to extreme agricultural activities 90 of the total area predominantly for paddy cultivation during the monsoon season siddiq 2006 though the area receives high annual rainfall the agricultural activities are supported mainly by groundwater irrigation the groundwater resources supply around 80 of the total irrigational demands of the area sinha et al 2018 therefore it can be deduced that the anthropogenic activity is affecting the recharge and runoff processes laveti et al 2021 in the present study the river aquifer exchange flux assessment was carried out using a transient sub surface hydrological flow model the datasets required for groundwater modeling are topography soil characteristics aquifer characteristics and inflows into and outflows from the groundwater system table 1 historical groundwater levels obtained from the observation well stations at supaul and jaynagar were utilized to calibrate and validate the model 3 methodology transient sub surface hydrological modeling was carried out for the kosi river sub basins using the modflow package in gms version 10 2 available aquifer characteristics and external stresses were used to predict spatio temporal variations in groundwater levels and river aquifer exchange fluxes the present study s methodology flowchart is presented in fig a1 of the appendix section the estimated groundwater recharge using satellite based evapotranspiration data gridded rainfall data soil moisture data and runoff data obtained from the swb method laveti et al 2021 and appropriate boundary and initial conditions were used to build the modflow model as the area s agricultural activities intensified laveti et al 2021 due to the million shallow tube well programme mstp in 2004 the dependence of agricultural activities on the monsoonal rainfall declined and the crop pattern changed the influence of these changes in anthropogenic activities on groundwater recharge was accounted via actual evapotranspiration data collected from noaa 8 km 8 km during 1996 2000 and modis 1 km 1 km during 2000 2010 please refer to laveti et al 2021 for further details the developed transient model was calibrated and validated with observed groundwater heads from the observation wells situated at supaul and jaynagar the modflow riv river package was used to quantify river aquifer exchange fluxes in the basin the value of effective hydraulic conductivity keff used in the analysis is 4 62 m day as estimated using laboratory based sandbox experiments laveti 2020 3 1 sub surface hydrological modelling using modflow modlfow is a three dimensional finite difference groundwater flow model developed by united states geological survey usgs the model can adjust to various applications through its modular structure modlfow 2005 halford and hanson 2002 harbaugh 2005 simulates steady and unsteady groundwater flows in irregularly shaped aquifer systems the aquifers may be confined unconfined or a combination of both water mass and flow from external stresses such as areal recharge evapotranspiration flow to wells flow to drains and flow through river beds can also be simulated boundary conditions like specified head and specified flux can be applied according to the relevant boundaries mcdonald 1994 for this study the transient groundwater flow is modeled using the conceptual modeling approach in gms modflow to obtain groundwater level variations and river aquifer exchange fluxes the governing equations to describe the saturated groundwater flow and river aquifer flux exchange riv package can be found in mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 3 2 groundwater flow modelling for kosi river basin in order to assess the groundwater levels and river aquifer exchange flux in the kosi river basin a conceptual model was developed for the period 1996 2010 using gms modflow the boundary conditions initial conditions and all the information used in the model are explained table 2 as a part of the conceptual model building process the stratigraphy at the site was replicated as a set of solids using borehole cross section the conceptual model also utilized topographic data and aquifer properties such as porosity specific storage and hydraulic conductivities of different layers source of these data sets are provided in table 1 fig 2 shows the borehole cross sections and fence diagram of lithology or soil stratification of the study area constructed using borehole data provided by cgwb patna the fence diagram shows that the study area consists of three different soils clay fine to medium sands and sands with pebble or boulder at varying depths in order to obtain the monthly groundwater level variation and river aquifer exchange fluxes at the reach scale groundwater flow was modeled in transient conditions from the year 1996 to 2010 for this purpose the basin domain was discretized into 100 rows latitude and 100 columns longitude with a grid size of 2132 1907 m with three vertical layers before commencing the transient flow simulations steady state modeling for the reach was performed using the first month data to initiate the modeling and provide initial values the developed conceptual model was calibrated for the years 1997 to 2003 and validated for the years 2004 2010 at two observed groundwater well locations supaul and jaynagar located in the districts of supaul and madhubani in bihar 3 3 model calibration and validation the groundwater hydrograph variation between observed and simulated data at the supaul well station is presented in fig 3 a calibration period 1997 2003 and fig 3 b validation period 2004 2010 similarly the simulated and the observed groundwater levels are compared at jaynagar stations for calibration and validation periods fig 4 a b there is reasonable agreement between the observed data points and the simulated curves for the two stations during both calibration and validation from the scatter plots of simulated and observed groundwater levels at supaul station fig 3c d the values of r2 nse and rmse validate the use of modflow in the present analysis similar observations are present in the scatter plots of simulated and observed groundwater levels at jaynagar station fig 4c d thereby confirming the applicability of the numerical model for the study 4 results and discussion this section attempts to describe the flux exchange between the river and aquifer over the study period 1996 2010 using the calibrated and validated transient groundwater model during the study period the wettest and driest years for the s 15 sub basin were 2001 and 2005 respectively whereas for the s 12 sub basin they were 2007 and 2005 respectively fig a2 however the wettest and driest years in the entire study area were 1999 and 2005 respectively the basin experienced a dry year cycle from 2005 to 2010 laveti et al 2021 4 1 river aquifer exchange flux the utilization of groundwater for irrigational activities were intensified in the study area on the implementation of mstp in 2004 the following sub sections discuss the impact of such enhanced groundwater dependency for agricultural activities on the river aquifer flux exchange and is quantifying them the variation in flux exchange rate along the river upstream downstream with time month is presented in fig 5 the positive values in the flux exchange rate indicate efflux from the river to the aquifer whereas the negative values indicate influx to the river from the aquifer the entire river reach upstream downstream was divided into three critical zones demarcated in fig 5 based on the modeled flux rate in zone i to 80 km downstream from the upstream boundary of the study area the direction of flux is mainly towards the aquifer from the river whereas in zone iii from 40 km upstream of the confluence point till the confluence point flux is mainly towards the river from the aquifer the direction of flux in zone ii varies spatially and temporally based on the quantity of annual rainfall and farmers groundwater extraction for irrigation in response the average flux exchange rates in zone i zone ii and zone iii were 433 m3 day 262 m3 day and 177 m3 day the direction of river aquifer exchange fluxes along the kosi river and influencing factors are presented through a conceptual diagram fig 6 the difference in ground surface elevations explain some of these results in zone i at higher ground elevations the groundwater table is always below the river water surface and the river water flow towards the aquifer in zone iii at lower ground elevations the groundwater table is often above the river water surface resulting in flux towards the river from the aquifer however in zone ii the direction of river aquifer flux depends primarily on the wet and dry year cycles and responses of farmers to these cycles in terms of groundwater extraction the groundwater levels tend to rise above the river water levels during wet years and drops below the river water levels during the dry seasons similar observation can be found in a study carried out on wetland river interactions in the kosi river basin chembolu et al 2019 the effect of groundwater extraction in wet and dry years on river aquifer interaction is discussed in the following sections 4 2 influence of farmers agricultural response on river aquifer exchange flux the kosi basin has been subjected to continuously increasing groundwater irrigation during the last three decades this increase can be considered as a result of the improvement in the region s socio economic condition the groundwater extraction for irrigation intensified after 2004 fig 7 due to the implementation of the million shallow tube well programme mstp the groundwater recharge extraction pattern in laveti et al 2021 points toward an increasing dependency on groundwater irrigation the area also witnessed significant enhancements in the investments for the agricultural sector fig 7 as a result of this increased groundwater dependency the crop calendar of the study area has significantly altered and much more cropping is done in pre monsoon and winter seasons kishore et al 2019 furthermore after the year 2007 groundwater utilization for agricultural activities has increased even during the dry years the variation in yearly average flux exchange as a percentage of river discharge from river to aquifer and aquifer to river is presented in fig 8 a and fig 8 b respectively during 1997 to 2010 the standard precipitation index spi values are also presented in the figures to compare the flux exchange variations with that of annual precipitation variations between 1997 and 2010 the river to aquifer flux has increased by almost 1 of the average river discharge fig 8a a complete shift in the flux exchange behavior can be observed from 1998 onwards the years 1997 through 1999 were wet and dependence on groundwater extraction for agricultural activities was at its minimum laveti et al 2021 resulting in reduced flux from the river to the aquifer during that period fig 8a the greater dependence on groundwater observed after 1999 caused by decreased annual rainfall and enhanced groundwater extraction laveti et al 2021 increased river to aquifer flux after 1999 the impact of further enhanced groundwater extraction during dry years 2008 2010 due to the implementation of mstp in 2004 is evident from the rise in the river to aquifer flux after the year 2008 fig 8a independent of changes in groundwater extraction the water table can be expected to fall during dry years resulting in a decrease in the aquifer to river flux while during the wet years the water table is likely to rise and the flux increase from the aquifer to the river fig 9 represents the exchange indices flux from aquifer to river and river to aquifer in relation to the spi and cumulative annual groundwater extraction the exchange indices and groundwater extractions are calculated using the formula for spi mckee et al 1995 the alteration in groundwater extraction behavior during dry and wet periods especially the increase after the implementation of mstp in 2004 is evident from the figure the basin experienced a wet period during 1998 2004 probably resulting in the lowered groundwater extraction the rise in the groundwater table because of low groundwater extraction and high rainfall may have enhanced with respect to normal flux from the aquifer to river represented by positive values of the river to aquifer flux exchange index and reduced with respect to normal flux from the river to the aquifer represented by negative values of the river to aquifer flux exchange index because before 2004 the groundwater extraction remained low relative to average during the entire study period the variation in flux were dependent mainly on the variations in rainfall as the annual rainfall decreased between 2000 and 2004 the flux from the aquifer to the river fell below the average and the river to aquifer flux increased after 2004 the wet cycle was followed by a dry cycle and mstp implementation significantly increased the number of groundwater pumping systems the resulting increase in groundwater extraction for irrigation led to a significant groundwater table decline which may have reduced aquifer to river flux and increased river to aquifer flux fig 9 observed variation in socio economy rainfall statistics along with modeled variation in groundwater recharge extraction and flux exchanges are presented in table 3 for ease of understanding for the reader arrows indicate the trend direction increasing or decreasing the average numerical values of these parameters for the specific period are provided as a reference however the average values presented in the table were developed for conceptual understanding only the detailed variation patterns for each of these parameters have been discussed in laveti et al 2021 and presented elsewhere in the current paper 4 2 1 alteration in flux exchange for dry years three representative dry years 1997 2005 and 2009 were selected to understand the alteration in dry year fluxes during the study period the study basin experienced a period of wet years during 1996 2004 in which 1997 was the only dry year on the other hand the study area experienced a dry cycle during 2004 2010 during this period 2005 and 2009 were the driest years laveti et al 2021 4 2 1 1 flux statistics in zone i the flux rates corresponding to zone i are presented in fig 10 as discussed earlier the flux exchange in zone i is always towards the aquifer from the river due to the large difference in elevation in the reach no significant variation in flux was observed during the pre monsoon period march may the pre monsoon flux depends on rainfall received during the previous season and subsequent groundwater utilization this part of the kosi river zone i is in the s 15 sub basin which experienced a slightly wet year during 1996 a moderately wet year during 2004 and a moderately dry year during 2008 fig a2 during 1996 basin scale groundwater extraction statistics suggest moderately enhanced groundwater extraction during october laveti et al 2021 similarly the groundwater utilization statistics of 2004 suggest a high groundwater extraction during october furthermore although groundwater extraction statistics in 2008 suggest a reduced extraction during october there is a significant enhancement in groundwater extraction for winter crops november february these factors combined to make the groundwater exchanges in the pre monsoon season appeared similar for 1997 2005 and 2008 in zone i further the flux rates during the monsoon surplus period october fig 10c are significantly reduced than the other three periods under discussion this could be due to the improvement of the groundwater table resulting from increased recharge and reduced groundwater extraction during monsoon surplus period further the river water surface elevations during this period decline the resulting reduction in head difference between surface and groundwater reduces the river aquifer fluxes 4 2 1 2 flux statistics in zone ii the influence of agricultural activities on the river aquifer exchange is most evident in zone ii fig 11 the trend observed during pre monsoon march may fig 11a monsoon june september fig 11b monsoon surplus october fig 11c and winter november february fig 11d during 1997 2005 and 2009 points towards an increasing flux from the river to the aquifer this result is consistent with an increase in groundwater extraction after 2004 as is observed in laveti et al 2021 which explains the increasing trend of flux exchange from the river to the aquifer easy accessibility to groundwater resources has allowed the farmers in the region to continue their agricultural activities during the dry years resulting in groundwater depletion the depletion in the groundwater table causes enhanced flux transfer from the river to the aquifer 4 2 1 3 flux statistics in zone iii the direction of flux exchange in most portions of zone iii is towards the river from aquifer presented as negative exchange flux in fig 12 the volume of flux depends on the amount of rainfall and groundwater extraction for irrigation rainfall during the monsoon season increases the groundwater level that causes excess flux transfer from aquifer to river similarly reduced groundwater extraction during winter season maintain the water table higher that also increase the flux transfer from aquifer to river the influence of these two factor over the flux exchange is clearly visible from fig 12 flux transfer from aquifer to river was significantly greater during monsoon 12b and winter seasons 12d the general trend observed in this zone for the monsoon fig 12b monsoon surplus fig 12c and winter fig 12d indicates a gradual reduction in flux from the aquifer to river the flux observed in 2009 was significantly less than in the previous dry years i e 1997 and 2005 this low rate is due to a decline in the groundwater table due to increased groundwater extraction the trend observed in the pre monsoon fig 12a suggests that the flux in 2005 was significantly less than in 1997 and 2009 rainfall in the area zone iii or s 17 received during 2004 was significantly lower in 1996 and 2008 fig a2 in addition basin scale data on groundwater extraction for irrigation indicate high extraction throughout 2004 laveti et al 2021 the decreased rainfall in the previous monsoon and increased extraction can explain reduced flux from the aquifer to the river during 2005 overall this analysis points towards a gradually increasing flux from the river to the aquifer and a gradually decreasing flux from the aquifer to the river especially for zone ii the observed trend of the flux between river and aquifer is in exact agreement with the previously observed groundwater utilization statistics for the area laveti et al 2021 5 conclusions the present study extends our findings on the impact of anthropogenic activities on the groundwater storage in the kosi river basin in india laveti et al 2021 the paper addresses the spatio temporal variation in the river aquifer flux in the kosi river basin due to anthropogenic activities a framework has been developed using a fully distributed transient groundwater model with remote sensing data groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration aquifer characteristics hydraulic conductivity porosity and specific storage and riverbed conductance as inputs groundwater recharge in the model was estimated using the swb method discussed in laveti et al 2021 study conclusions are as follows there are three distinct interaction zones between the kosi barrage and the river s confluence with ganga river in zone i the direction of flux is mostly towards the aquifer from river and in zone iii the direction of flux is mainly towards the aquifer from the river however in the middle reaches zone ii the flux can be either ways depending on the groundwater storage and extraction the river to aquifer flux steadily increased in dry years after the implementation of mstp in 2004 this increase corresponds to increasing dependence on groundwater for agricultural irrigation visible reduction in the flux from the aquifer to the river was observed especially after 2007 this observation corresponds to the fact that groundwater extraction in the region increased significantly after 2007 since 2007 flux as a percent of the average river discharge has decreased to an extent that river flow is observably affected because trends in river aquifer exchanges are likely to be resulting in reduced river flows authorities and stakeholders should be seriously concerned the concerned authorities and stakeholders should extend their efforts towards implementing a more efficient water management approach for the study area and similar areas furthermore efforts should be made to increase public awareness regarding groundwater utilization during wet and dry years and its impact on river resources the trends observed in this study can be tested for the following years using the framework presented here and extended after incorporating the effect of climate change wet dry year cycles the framework presented here can study the groundwater storage extraction pattern and river aquifer interaction in other agriculture dominated alluvial river basins credit authorship contribution statement naga venkata satish laveti

temporally with alteration in river stage and groundwater levels engeler et al 2011 the hydraulic gradient between a river and an aquifer and the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed are the major factors influencing the exchange of flux doppler et al 2007 most of the base flow during low flow season comes from the groundwater flow through the hyporheic zone in most river basins therefore understanding and quantifying the river aquifer exchange flux is essential for effective groundwater management sophocleous 2002 the river aquifer interaction has been studied by multiple researchers at different spatial and temporal scales bailey et al 2016 chitsazan et al 2015 derx et al 2010 eikenberg et al 2001 miller et al 2003 rushton 2007 sahoo and sahoo 2019 tang et al 2017 vrzel et al 2018 workman et al 1997 various methodologies and approaches have been used to understand and quantify river aquifer exchange epting et al 2018 mccallum et al 2014 rahman et al 2016 ward et al 2013 wen et al 2019 the field based approaches include measurement of streambed temperature profiles anibas et al 2011 essaid and caldwell 2017 and seepage meters brodie et al 2009 the measurement using these field based approaches may offer some degree of accuracy but the spatial scale of their applicability is limited several numerical modelling techniques have been employed to quantify river aquifer exchange flux at larger scales bailey et al 2016 kumar and nagaraj 2018 rushton 2007 sanz et al 2011 werner et al 2006 modflow is also a popular numerical model to simulate river aquifer interaction barlow and harbaugh 2006 furman 2008 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 groundwater pumping for irrigation purposes peña arancibia et al 2020 yue et al 2020 can significantly impact the recharge pattern of an agricultural dominated river basin these recharge effects in turn significantly impact the influx or efflux to a river from the underlying aquifer system therefore any effort to study the river aquifer interaction without incorporating the influence of groundwater extraction patterns may lead to imprecise conclusions however no significant effort has been observed in the literature addressing the impact of such anthropogenic influence on the river aquifer interaction therefore the present study attempts to understand the impact on the river and aquifer interactions due to enhanced groundwater utilization for irrigational activities the alluvial part in the southern part of the kosi river basin in bihar in the indian sub continent was considered as the study region the part of the basin under discussion has been subjected to intense agricultural activities over recent years ninety percent of the study region is covered with agricultural lands laveti 2020 the groundwater demands to sustain such intense agricultural activities in the study area have also increased significantly covering almost 80 of total irrigation demands sinha et al 2018 the implementation of the green revolution programme during 1970 1971 has transformed the agricultural practices in the ganga basin the total number of groundwater extraction systems used for irrigational activities has increased from 0 37 million 1976 1977 to 1 56 million 1997 1998 in just two decades kumar et al 2017 as a result in two decades the area under irrigation has increased from 28 8 during 1970 71 season to around 43 5 in 1989 90 season wilson 2002 the development of irrigational systems along with supplementary measures have ensured substantial enhancements in agricultural productions and productivity in the region singh et al 2004 the number of groundwater irrigation systems has further increased since the million shallow tube well programme mstp in 2004 kishore et al 2019 this program has improved the accessibility of groundwater to the state s farmers and as a result it has significantly increased the net irrigated area the accessibility of groundwater for agricultural purposes has resulted in substantial growth in agricultural production and the state s economy the increasing trend of groundwater utilization depleted the groundwater resources in terms of decline in water table laveti et al 2021 the present study further extends the findings of laveti et al 2021 and develops a framework that can account for the impact of anthropogenic activities in terms of alteration in groundwater utilization on the river aquifer interaction pattern the framework itself and its outcomes are crucial for developing a sustainable water resources strategy in any agriculture dominated alluvial river basin 2 study area and data used the study area included the alluvial parts of the kosi basin one of the major tributaries of ganga river in india encompassing nine major districts in bihar supaul saharsa araria khagaria bhagalpur madhepura and purnia rai et al 2018 sinha and friend 1994 fig 1 in laveti et al 2021 the entire kosi basin was discretized into various sub basins using the watershed delineation processes in the soil and water assessment tool swat model the present study considered the sub basins s 11 s 12 s 13 s 14 s 15 s 16 and s 17 from the kosi basin for analyzing the anthropogenic influence on river aquifer exchange processes the river s length in the study area is 240 km from kosi barrage upstream until its confluence point with river ganga downstream two observation well stations supaul and jaynagar located in sub basins s 15 and s 12 were used to calibrate and validate the groundwater model the basin falls in the sub tropical belt and experiences a humid climate in the southern part of the basin and a cold arid climate in the northern mountainous region shrestha et al 2017 the average annual rainfall over the basin is 1000 mm more than 80 of which occurs during the monsoon season rajbhandari et al 2017 shrestha 2000 the basin experiences a wide range of spatial temperature variations with temperatures generally decreasing towards the northern part of the basin himalayan region in general the highest temperatures are recorded in june approximate 27 c and 32 c in the mountains regions and the hilly regions respectively and the lowest in december or january 0 c and 5 c in the mountains and the hills respectively agarwal et al 2016 a significant part of the kosi basin under discussion has been subjected to extreme agricultural activities 90 of the total area predominantly for paddy cultivation during the monsoon season siddiq 2006 though the area receives high annual rainfall the agricultural activities are supported mainly by groundwater irrigation the groundwater resources supply around 80 of the total irrigational demands of the area sinha et al 2018 therefore it can be deduced that the anthropogenic activity is affecting the recharge and runoff processes laveti et al 2021 in the present study the river aquifer exchange flux assessment was carried out using a transient sub surface hydrological flow model the datasets required for groundwater modeling are topography soil characteristics aquifer characteristics and inflows into and outflows from the groundwater system table 1 historical groundwater levels obtained from the observation well stations at supaul and jaynagar were utilized to calibrate and validate the model 3 methodology transient sub surface hydrological modeling was carried out for the kosi river sub basins using the modflow package in gms version 10 2 available aquifer characteristics and external stresses were used to predict spatio temporal variations in groundwater levels and river aquifer exchange fluxes the present study s methodology flowchart is presented in fig a1 of the appendix section the estimated groundwater recharge using satellite based evapotranspiration data gridded rainfall data soil moisture data and runoff data obtained from the swb method laveti et al 2021 and appropriate boundary and initial conditions were used to build the modflow model as the area s agricultural activities intensified laveti et al 2021 due to the million shallow tube well programme mstp in 2004 the dependence of agricultural activities on the monsoonal rainfall declined and the crop pattern changed the influence of these changes in anthropogenic activities on groundwater recharge was accounted via actual evapotranspiration data collected from noaa 8 km 8 km during 1996 2000 and modis 1 km 1 km during 2000 2010 please refer to laveti et al 2021 for further details the developed transient model was calibrated and validated with observed groundwater heads from the observation wells situated at supaul and jaynagar the modflow riv river package was used to quantify river aquifer exchange fluxes in the basin the value of effective hydraulic conductivity keff used in the analysis is 4 62 m day as estimated using laboratory based sandbox experiments laveti 2020 3 1 sub surface hydrological modelling using modflow modlfow is a three dimensional finite difference groundwater flow model developed by united states geological survey usgs the model can adjust to various applications through its modular structure modlfow 2005 halford and hanson 2002 harbaugh 2005 simulates steady and unsteady groundwater flows in irregularly shaped aquifer systems the aquifers may be confined unconfined or a combination of both water mass and flow from external stresses such as areal recharge evapotranspiration flow to wells flow to drains and flow through river beds can also be simulated boundary conditions like specified head and specified flux can be applied according to the relevant boundaries mcdonald 1994 for this study the transient groundwater flow is modeled using the conceptual modeling approach in gms modflow to obtain groundwater level variations and river aquifer exchange fluxes the governing equations to describe the saturated groundwater flow and river aquifer flux exchange riv package can be found in mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 3 2 groundwater flow modelling for kosi river basin in order to assess the groundwater levels and river aquifer exchange flux in the kosi river basin a conceptual model was developed for the period 1996 2010 using gms modflow the boundary conditions initial conditions and all the information used in the model are explained table 2 as a part of the conceptual model building process the stratigraphy at the site was replicated as a set of solids using borehole cross section the conceptual model also utilized topographic data and aquifer properties such as porosity specific storage and hydraulic conductivities of different layers source of these data sets are provided in table 1 fig 2 shows the borehole cross sections and fence diagram of lithology or soil stratification of the study area constructed using borehole data provided by cgwb patna the fence diagram shows that the study area consists of three different soils clay fine to medium sands and sands with pebble or boulder at varying depths in order to obtain the monthly groundwater level variation and river aquifer exchange fluxes at the reach scale groundwater flow was modeled in transient conditions from the year 1996 to 2010 for this purpose the basin domain was discretized into 100 rows latitude and 100 columns longitude with a grid size of 2132 1907 m with three vertical layers before commencing the transient flow simulations steady state modeling for the reach was performed using the first month data to initiate the modeling and provide initial values the developed conceptual model was calibrated for the years 1997 to 2003 and validated for the years 2004 2010 at two observed groundwater well locations supaul and jaynagar located in the districts of supaul and madhubani in bihar 3 3 model calibration and validation the groundwater hydrograph variation between observed and simulated data at the supaul well station is presented in fig 3 a calibration period 1997 2003 and fig 3 b validation period 2004 2010 similarly the simulated and the observed groundwater levels are compared at jaynagar stations for calibration and validation periods fig 4 a b there is reasonable agreement between the observed data points and the simulated curves for the two stations during both calibration and validation from the scatter plots of simulated and observed groundwater levels at supaul station fig 3c d the values of r2 nse and rmse validate the use of modflow in the present analysis similar observations are present in the scatter plots of simulated and observed groundwater levels at jaynagar station fig 4c d thereby confirming the applicability of the numerical model for the study 4 results and discussion this section attempts to describe the flux exchange between the river and aquifer over the study period 1996 2010 using the calibrated and validated transient groundwater model during the study period the wettest and driest years for the s 15 sub basin were 2001 and 2005 respectively whereas for the s 12 sub basin they were 2007 and 2005 respectively fig a2 however the wettest and driest years in the entire study area were 1999 and 2005 respectively the basin experienced a dry year cycle from 2005 to 2010 laveti et al 2021 4 1 river aquifer exchange flux the utilization of groundwater for irrigational activities were intensified in the study area on the implementation of mstp in 2004 the following sub sections discuss the impact of such enhanced groundwater dependency for agricultural activities on the river aquifer flux exchange and is quantifying them the variation in flux exchange rate along the river upstream downstream with time month is presented in fig 5 the positive values in the flux exchange rate indicate efflux from the river to the aquifer whereas the negative values indicate influx to the river from the aquifer the entire river reach upstream downstream was divided into three critical zones demarcated in fig 5 based on the modeled flux rate in zone i to 80 km downstream from the upstream boundary of the study area the direction of flux is mainly towards the aquifer from the river whereas in zone iii from 40 km upstream of the confluence point till the confluence point flux is mainly towards the river from the aquifer the direction of flux in zone ii varies spatially and temporally based on the quantity of annual rainfall and farmers groundwater extraction for irrigation in response the average flux exchange rates in zone i zone ii and zone iii were 433 m3 day 262 m3 day and 177 m3 day the direction of river aquifer exchange fluxes along the kosi river and influencing factors are presented through a conceptual diagram fig 6 the difference in ground surface elevations explain some of these results in zone i at higher ground elevations the groundwater table is always below the river water surface and the river water flow towards the aquifer in zone iii at lower ground elevations the groundwater table is often above the river water surface resulting in flux towards the river from the aquifer however in zone ii the direction of river aquifer flux depends primarily on the wet and dry year cycles and responses of farmers to these cycles in terms of groundwater extraction the groundwater levels tend to rise above the river water levels during wet years and drops below the river water levels during the dry seasons similar observation can be found in a study carried out on wetland river interactions in the kosi river basin chembolu et al 2019 the effect of groundwater extraction in wet and dry years on river aquifer interaction is discussed in the following sections 4 2 influence of farmers agricultural response on river aquifer exchange flux the kosi basin has been subjected to continuously increasing groundwater irrigation during the last three decades this increase can be considered as a result of the improvement in the region s socio economic condition the groundwater extraction for irrigation intensified after 2004 fig 7 due to the implementation of the million shallow tube well programme mstp the groundwater recharge extraction pattern in laveti et al 2021 points toward an increasing dependency on groundwater irrigation the area also witnessed significant enhancements in the investments for the agricultural sector fig 7 as a result of this increased groundwater dependency the crop calendar of the study area has significantly altered and much more cropping is done in pre monsoon and winter seasons kishore et al 2019 furthermore after the year 2007 groundwater utilization for agricultural activities has increased even during the dry years the variation in yearly average flux exchange as a percentage of river discharge from river to aquifer and aquifer to river is presented in fig 8 a and fig 8 b respectively during 1997 to 2010 the standard precipitation index spi values are also presented in the figures to compare the flux exchange variations with that of annual precipitation variations between 1997 and 2010 the river to aquifer flux has increased by almost 1 of the average river discharge fig 8a a complete shift in the flux exchange behavior can be observed from 1998 onwards the years 1997 through 1999 were wet and dependence on groundwater extraction for agricultural activities was at its minimum laveti et al 2021 resulting in reduced flux from the river to the aquifer during that period fig 8a the greater dependence on groundwater observed after 1999 caused by decreased annual rainfall and enhanced groundwater extraction laveti et al 2021 increased river to aquifer flux after 1999 the impact of further enhanced groundwater extraction during dry years 2008 2010 due to the implementation of mstp in 2004 is evident from the rise in the river to aquifer flux after the year 2008 fig 8a independent of changes in groundwater extraction the water table can be expected to fall during dry years resulting in a decrease in the aquifer to river flux while during the wet years the water table is likely to rise and the flux increase from the aquifer to the river fig 9 represents the exchange indices flux from aquifer to river and river to aquifer in relation to the spi and cumulative annual groundwater extraction the exchange indices and groundwater extractions are calculated using the formula for spi mckee et al 1995 the alteration in groundwater extraction behavior during dry and wet periods especially the increase after the implementation of mstp in 2004 is evident from the figure the basin experienced a wet period during 1998 2004 probably resulting in the lowered groundwater extraction the rise in the groundwater table because of low groundwater extraction and high rainfall may have enhanced with respect to normal flux from the aquifer to river represented by positive values of the river to aquifer flux exchange index and reduced with respect to normal flux from the river to the aquifer represented by negative values of the river to aquifer flux exchange index because before 2004 the groundwater extraction remained low relative to average during the entire study period the variation in flux were dependent mainly on the variations in rainfall as the annual rainfall decreased between 2000 and 2004 the flux from the aquifer to the river fell below the average and the river to aquifer flux increased after 2004 the wet cycle was followed by a dry cycle and mstp implementation significantly increased the number of groundwater pumping systems the resulting increase in groundwater extraction for irrigation led to a significant groundwater table decline which may have reduced aquifer to river flux and increased river to aquifer flux fig 9 observed variation in socio economy rainfall statistics along with modeled variation in groundwater recharge extraction and flux exchanges are presented in table 3 for ease of understanding for the reader arrows indicate the trend direction increasing or decreasing the average numerical values of these parameters for the specific period are provided as a reference however the average values presented in the table were developed for conceptual understanding only the detailed variation patterns for each of these parameters have been discussed in laveti et al 2021 and presented elsewhere in the current paper 4 2 1 alteration in flux exchange for dry years three representative dry years 1997 2005 and 2009 were selected to understand the alteration in dry year fluxes during the study period the study basin experienced a period of wet years during 1996 2004 in which 1997 was the only dry year on the other hand the study area experienced a dry cycle during 2004 2010 during this period 2005 and 2009 were the driest years laveti et al 2021 4 2 1 1 flux statistics in zone i the flux rates corresponding to zone i are presented in fig 10 as discussed earlier the flux exchange in zone i is always towards the aquifer from the river due to the large difference in elevation in the reach no significant variation in flux was observed during the pre monsoon period march may the pre monsoon flux depends on rainfall received during the previous season and subsequent groundwater utilization this part of the kosi river zone i is in the s 15 sub basin which experienced a slightly wet year during 1996 a moderately wet year during 2004 and a moderately dry year during 2008 fig a2 during 1996 basin scale groundwater extraction statistics suggest moderately enhanced groundwater extraction during october laveti et al 2021 similarly the groundwater utilization statistics of 2004 suggest a high groundwater extraction during october furthermore although groundwater extraction statistics in 2008 suggest a reduced extraction during october there is a significant enhancement in groundwater extraction for winter crops november february these factors combined to make the groundwater exchanges in the pre monsoon season appeared similar for 1997 2005 and 2008 in zone i further the flux rates during the monsoon surplus period october fig 10c are significantly reduced than the other three periods under discussion this could be due to the improvement of the groundwater table resulting from increased recharge and reduced groundwater extraction during monsoon surplus period further the river water surface elevations during this period decline the resulting reduction in head difference between surface and groundwater reduces the river aquifer fluxes 4 2 1 2 flux statistics in zone ii the influence of agricultural activities on the river aquifer exchange is most evident in zone ii fig 11 the trend observed during pre monsoon march may fig 11a monsoon june september fig 11b monsoon surplus october fig 11c and winter november february fig 11d during 1997 2005 and 2009 points towards an increasing flux from the river to the aquifer this result is consistent with an increase in groundwater extraction after 2004 as is observed in laveti et al 2021 which explains the increasing trend of flux exchange from the river to the aquifer easy accessibility to groundwater resources has allowed the farmers in the region to continue their agricultural activities during the dry years resulting in groundwater depletion the depletion in the groundwater table causes enhanced flux transfer from the river to the aquifer 4 2 1 3 flux statistics in zone iii the direction of flux exchange in most portions of zone iii is towards the river from aquifer presented as negative exchange flux in fig 12 the volume of flux depends on the amount of rainfall and groundwater extraction for irrigation rainfall during the monsoon season increases the groundwater level that causes excess flux transfer from aquifer to river similarly reduced groundwater extraction during winter season maintain the water table higher that also increase the flux transfer from aquifer to river the influence of these two factor over the flux exchange is clearly visible from fig 12 flux transfer from aquifer to river was significantly greater during monsoon 12b and winter seasons 12d the general trend observed in this zone for the monsoon fig 12b monsoon surplus fig 12c and winter fig 12d indicates a gradual reduction in flux from the aquifer to river the flux observed in 2009 was significantly less than in the previous dry years i e 1997 and 2005 this low rate is due to a decline in the groundwater table due to increased groundwater extraction the trend observed in the pre monsoon fig 12a suggests that the flux in 2005 was significantly less than in 1997 and 2009 rainfall in the area zone iii or s 17 received during 2004 was significantly lower in 1996 and 2008 fig a2 in addition basin scale data on groundwater extraction for irrigation indicate high extraction throughout 2004 laveti et al 2021 the decreased rainfall in the previous monsoon and increased extraction can explain reduced flux from the aquifer to the river during 2005 overall this analysis points towards a gradually increasing flux from the river to the aquifer and a gradually decreasing flux from the aquifer to the river especially for zone ii the observed trend of the flux between river and aquifer is in exact agreement with the previously observed groundwater utilization statistics for the area laveti et al 2021 5 conclusions the present study extends our findings on the impact of anthropogenic activities on the groundwater storage in the kosi river basin in india laveti et al 2021 the paper addresses the spatio temporal variation in the river aquifer flux in the kosi river basin due to anthropogenic activities a framework has been developed using a fully distributed transient groundwater model with remote sensing data groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration aquifer characteristics hydraulic conductivity porosity and specific storage and riverbed conductance as inputs groundwater recharge in the model was estimated using the swb method discussed in laveti et al 2021 study conclusions are as follows there are three distinct interaction zones between the kosi barrage and the river s confluence with ganga river in zone i the direction of flux is mostly towards the aquifer from river and in zone iii the direction of flux is mainly towards the aquifer from the river however in the middle reaches zone ii the flux can be either ways depending on the groundwater storage and extraction the river to aquifer flux steadily increased in dry years after the implementation of mstp in 2004 this increase corresponds to increasing dependence on groundwater for agricultural irrigation visible reduction in the flux from the aquifer to the river was observed especially after 2007 this observation corresponds to the fact that groundwater extraction in the region increased significantly after 2007 since 2007 flux as a percent of the average river discharge has decreased to an extent that river flow is observably affected because trends in river aquifer exchanges are likely to be resulting in reduced river flows authorities and stakeholders should be seriously concerned the concerned authorities and stakeholders should extend their efforts towards implementing a more efficient water management approach for the study area and similar areas furthermore efforts should be made to increase public awareness regarding groundwater utilization during wet and dry years and its impact on river resources the trends observed in this study can be tested for the following years using the framework presented here and extended after incorporating the effect of climate change wet dry year cycles the framework presented here can study the groundwater storage extraction pattern and river aquifer interaction in other agriculture dominated alluvial river basins credit authorship contribution statement naga venkata satish laveti

4259,in this study a multiscale long short term memory model with attention mechanism mlstm am is proposed to improve the accuracy of monthly precipitation forecasting in the mlstm am model à trous wavelet transform atwt is first employed to decompose the standardized monthly precipitation anomaly and climate indices into a certain number of subseries with different time scales then at each of time scales a long short term memory lstm model is constructed to predict the precipitation anomaly subseries by coupling with partial information pi algorithm for selecting the model inputs and attention mechanism am for optimizing the model structure finally all the predicted subseries are summed and then the summed series is transformed as the monthly precipitation prediction the proposed mlstm am model is examined with 129 stations over the yangtze river basin and compared with the mlstm lstm and multiple linear regression mlr the mlstm is formed by coupling the lstm with the atwt for comparison the inputs of all the models are identified by the pi algorithm results show that the prediction of all the models is more skillful in the western region than in the eastern region of the basin which is strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of the variability of precipitation the lstm outperforms the mlr in terms of two performance evaluation indicators at most of stations the mlstm and mlstm am improve monthly precipitation forecasts at all of 129 stations over the basin compared to the lstm and the mlstm am provides the best prediction performance among all these models keywords long short term memory attention mechanism wavelet transform partial information selection monthly precipitation prediction 1 introduction reliable precipitation forecasting both short term and long term has great significance in the fields of water resources management flood control disaster reduction and agricultural management venkata ramana et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 tao et al 2017 however precipitation is a complicated nonlinear atmospheric process which is space and time dependent he et al 2015 thus it has been challenging to understand the complexity and predictability of precipitation and produce accurate forecasts of precipitation silva et al 2006 peng et al 2014 in precipitation forecasting the beginning duration and end of the rainy season are defined by the month bagirov and mahmood 2018 moreover monthly precipitation provides more accurate intra year precipitation distribution than seasonal precipitation omotosho et al 2000 therefore it is essential to forecast precipitation at the monthly time scale in the past decades predictions of precipitation have usually been made by using physically based models lim et al 2009 and machine learning methods shi et al 2015 the physically based models are very complicated to solve the physical trajectory equation which need to process a great amount of meteorological data within a prescribed time zhang et al 2020 in order to avoid large errors meteorological experts will participate in the forecasting process based on the physical model by judging and modifying the forecast results yu et al 2018 this verification method not only consumes a lot of manpower and computing resources but is also difficult for meteorologists with many years of experience zhang et al 2020 however machine learning methods can explore the spatial and temporal patterns hidden in historical data and do not require information on physical processes shi et al 2015 which can save manpower and computing resources compared with physically based models in addition many cases have been confirmed that machine learning methods can obtain a better prediction result than physically based models chu and chang 2009 karandish and šimunek 2016 artificial neural networks anns are a group of machine learning methods that have a strong ability of nonlinear mapping and have been successfully used in diverse fields including agriculturalplanning and water resource management huang et al 2014 he et al 2014 kenabatho et al 2015 there are many variants of neural network models including feed forward neural network recurrent neural network rnn and convolutional neural network cnn the rnn is dedicated to a kind of sequence model which maintains a vector of hidden activation that is propagated through time graves 2012 bai et al 2018 the intuitive appeal of recurrent modeling is that the hidden state can act as a representation of everything that has been seen so far in the sequence bai et al 2018 however one drawback of the rnn is that it can struggle to learn long sequences which leads to the vanishing gradient problem when training conventional rnn with long term lags ni et al 2020 liu et al 2020 long short term memory lstm is an improved version of a typical rnn equipped with the capacity to retain long time dependencies which can avoid the gradient problem in the rnn training liu et al 2020 recently the lstm model has already been used as an advanced model to deal with the time series prediction problem qiu et al 2017 kratzert et al 2018 kao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 explored the potential of the lstm for rainfall runoff modelling results showed that the lstm is well competing with the performance of the well established conceptual model kao et al 2020 developed a lstm based encoder decoder model lstm ed for multi step ahead flood forecasting results showed that the lstm ed model can improve the reliability of flood forecasting and increase the interpretability of model internals however it is difficult to explain what role each input feature series plays in the forecasting if raw time series are used directly as model inputs to address this problem assigning an optimal weight to each of input feature series based on its importance is proposed in the past decades many methods including analytic hierarchy process ahp park and han 2002 partial information correlation pic sharma and mehrotra 2014 and attention mechanism am zhang et al 2019 have been used to calculate the weights of input time series in the ahp and pic methods the calculation of weights of input features is independent to the regression model however the weights derived by the am are closely related to the units of the ann model which allows that am weights can be optimized by learning in recent years the am coupled with the deep learning model has been widely used and performed well in many fields such as speech recognition image captioning and visual question answering kim et al 2017 lu et al 2017 yu et al 2017 in addition some related works on improving prediction accuracy of time series have been done by adding an attention layer to the existing models liang et al 2018 li et al 2019 for example li et al 2020 proposed an attention based cnn lstm model to predict urban fine particulate matter results showed that the attention based layer can automatically weigh the past feature states to improve prediction accuracy therefore to improve monthly precipitation forecasting we attempt to add an attention layer into the lstm model in this study considering that hydrological data are random and non stationary and the time series consists of different frequency components directly analyzing the original time series would ignores some features of different time scales which leads to the weak forecast accuracy of hydrological models karthikeyan and nagesh kumar 2013 zhu et al 2016 kalteh 2016 the wavelet transform wt is a widely used data preprocessing technique to extract features such as short term and long term fluctuations of the original series at different time scales by decomposing the time series chong et al 2020 which can improve the forecast results compared to the traditional fourier transform the wt is more effective in studying non stationary time series nourani et al 2009 some successful cases of the wt have been provided by previousresearches in the field of hydrology liu et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 the improvement of the wt to the ann in nonstationary time series forecasting was explored by he et al 2015 results showed that the wt based model could effectively predict the monthly rainfall altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 used the wt to improve daily rainfall forecasting hence it is necessary to decompose the original time series before precipitation forecasting many researches have demonstrated that large scale climatic patterns have significant influence on the regional precipitation variability hartmann et al 2008 kim and kim 2010 peng et al 2014 jiang 2020 considering the relationship between precipitation and climate indices several studies have developed the precipitation forecast models with the climate indices and antecedent precipitation as model inputs kim and kim 2010 he et al 2015 however it leads to a large set of candidate inputs and complex computational process when the antecedent precipitation and or other lagged climate related indices are considered as model inputs to predict precipitation therefore the adaptive choice of input variables is an important step for improving computational efficiency in the development of precipitation prediction models tran et al 2015 the mutual information mi technique proposed by fraser and swinney 1986 has been successfully applied to identify the explanatory variables for non linear time series babel et al 2015 dhamge et al 2012 however it cannot be used to measure the partial dependence among multiple variables to address this problem sharma and mehrotra 2014 developed a partial information pi algorithm with stepwise selection for model predictor identification by extending the mi to the pi measure thus the pi algorithm is employed to adaptively select the appropriate inputs to lstm models in this study the objectives of this study are to investigate the potential of the lstm for forecasting monthly precipitation and develop a multiscale lstm with am mlstm am to enhance forecast accuracy of the lstm in the proposed model the standardized monthly precipitation anomaly and climate indices are first decomposed into their subseries with different time scales by the wt then at each time scale the pi selection algorithm is used to identify an appropriate subset of lstm inputs from a large set of candidate predictors and the am is applied to optimize the lstm model structure next each of precipitation anomaly subseries is forecasted from the identified predictors finally the standardized monthly precipitation is obtained by summing all the predicted precipitation anomaly subseries and then the monthly precipitation prediction is acquired by transforming the standardized monthly precipitation forecasts the proposed mlstm am is tested with 129 stations over the yangtze river basin yrb and compared to the lstm and mlstm models wheremlstm is established by combining the lstm and wt additionally a multiple linear regression mlr model is also included as a reference case for the comparison of predicting skill it should be noted that the inputs of all models are identified by the pi algorithm in this study the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the methodology is presented first in section 2 section 3 describes the details of the study area and data used in this study section 4 provides the description of two statistical indicators to evaluate the forecast performance the improvement of forecast accuracy from the mlstm am model and the results of comparison with three reference models are given in section 5 some conclusions are made for this research in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 information entropy the information entropy h is a statistical quantity which indicates the complexity of a physical process the entropy of a variable x is defined as shannon 1948 1 h x f x l o g f x d x where f x is the probability density function pdf of x it should be noted that the statistical uncertainty or variability of monthly precipitation series can be measured by the use of the information entropy generally higher entropy value indicates higher statistical uncertainty and lower predictability of time series and vice versa li and zhang 2008 for additional details on the entropy readers can refer to elsner and tsonis 1993 and li and zhang 2008 2 2 partial information selection it is essential to identify a small and appropriate set of model inputs from a large set of candidate variables for model development the pi selection algorithm developed by sharma and mehrotra 2014 based on the information theory is used to select significant input variables for the prediction models in this study the pi algorithm starts with an empty preexisting input set z along with a set of candidate predictor variables x that could be useful in model prediction the basic steps in the pi algorithm process are as follows sharma and mehrotra 2014 1 compute p i c where p i c represents the estimated partial information correlation between output y and each of input variables in x conditional to z 2 identify the highest of these p i c as pic and set a threshold pi c α for a given significance level α the pi c α can be obtained by t p i c m 1 p i c 2 following the student s t distribution with degree of freedom m n l where n denotes the total number of observations for each variable and l the number of conditioning variables 3 judge whether this pic is significant or not if pic p i c α the candidate input corresponding to the pic is a significant predictor and is added to preexisting input set z and remove it from x 4 repeat steps 1 3 as many times as needed the algorithm stops only when all significant input predictors have been selected the readers are referred to sharma 2000 and sharma and mehrotra 2014 for additional details as well as to sharma et al 2016 for the open source software needed to estimate the p i c 2 3 wavelet transform the wt as an effective tool has been successfully used to get a complete time scale representation of time series and their relationships sang 2013 liu et al 2014 since monthly precipitation and climate index data are recorded in discrete time intervals the discrete wt dwt is utilized in this study the typical discrete wavelet function can be expressed as daubechies 1992 2 ψ j k t 2 j 2 ψ 2 j t k where ψ t is the mother wavelet j is the decomposition level and k is a location index the research of wavelet based time series forecasting in hydrologicalfield is growing popular in recent years however the dwt is a non redundant transform which makes it shift sensitive to boundary conditions quilty and adamowski 2018 this shift sensitivity is an undesirable feature which leads to some future information being brought into forecasts when the dwt is performed this problem can be overcome by a stepwise decomposition based sdb sampling technique which produces predictor variables of all of the samples completely depending on decomposing past observations lagging behind the time series to be forecasted fang et al 2019 as a result information on future observations can be strictly excluded from the predictor variables however there are some disadvantages in the sdb technique such as the high computational cost considering the à trous algorithm can overcome the high computational cost of the sdb technique and avoid the impact of future information on the result of forecasting ni et al 2020 the à trous wavelet transform atwt is applied to perform time series decomposition which does not require data from the future time t to calculate wavelet scaling coefficients at the present at t maheswaran and khosa 2012 ni et al 2020 by using atwt the approximation components of the time series x t at different time scales can be derived as follows maheswaran and khosa 2012 3 a 0 t x t a j t l h l a j t 2 j 1 l where j takes values from 1 to j j is the highest decomposition level and h is a low pass filter with compact support the detail component of the time series x t at level j is generated by maheswaran and khosa 2012 4 d j t a j 1 t a j t accordingly the time series x t can be decomposed into a finite number of approximation a and detail d components then the original time series x t with the highest decomposition level j can be reconstructed from the approximation and detail components as 5 x t a j t j 1 j d j t the detailed discussions of the atwt can be referred to shensa 1992 rathinasamy et al 2013 and ni et al 2020 2 4 long short term memory the lstm introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is an advancement of the rnn designed to overcome the weakness of the traditional rnn to learn long term dependencies the lstm extends the rnn architecture of a memory cell with gating mechanism which controls the information across the network the gating mechanism includes three units the forget input and output gates to determine whether to forget past cell status or to deliver output to the last state which allows the lstm to store and access information over long periods the first gate is the forget gate which is to determine whether information should be discarded from the previous state the formulation is as follows huang et al 2018 6 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where x t is the input at time t h t 1 is the output of the hidden layer at time t 1 f t is the output of forget gate at time t w f is the weight connecting h t 1 and x t to the forget gate b f is the corresponding bias term and σ indicates the logistic sigmoid function the next step contains two parts which is to decide how much new information needs to be added to the cell state in the first part the input gate layer determines which information is used to update the cell state in the current time step and then a potential update vector c t is generated from a tanh layer by the current input x t and the last hidden state h t 1 at last these two parts are combined to create an update to the state the formulations are defined as huang et al 2018 7 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 8 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c here i t is the output of input gate at time t c t is the cell input state at time t w i and w c are the weights connecting h t 1 and x t to the input gate and cell input respectively b i and b c are their corresponding bias terms tanh denotes the hyperbolic tangent function then the old cell state c t 1 is updated to the new cell state c t by the following equation ding et al 2020 9 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where c t and c t 1 represent the cell output states at time t and t 1 respectively and is element wise multiplication the last gate is output gate which is used to control the information of the cell state c t that flows into the new hidden state h t the output gate and the new hidden state are calculated by ding et al 2020 10 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 11 h t o t tanh c t respectively where o t is the output of output gate at time t w o is the weight connecting h t 1 and x t to the output gate b o is the corresponding bias term and h t is the output of the hidden layer at time t 2 5 attention layer the importance of various predictors in precipitation forecasting is different in precipitation prediction we need to pay more attention to more significant predictors therefore the am can be used to optimize the input feature series in time series prediction by assigning different weights to input feature series based on their importance the input series of attention layer is a raw feature time series the am can adaptively select more relevant input features and give higher weights to the corresponding original feature series then we use the output of the attention layer as the input data for the lstm to constructthe attention based lstm model that is using the previous information with attention weight to predict the future time series for a certain feature series x q at time t its attention weight can be calculated by the previous hidden state h t 1 and cell state c t 1 in the lstm unit as zhang et al 2019 12 e q t v tanh w 1 h t 1 c t 1 w 2 x q 13 β q t s o f t max e q t exp e q t ι 1 τ exp e ι t where v w 1 and w 2 are learnable parameters β q is the attention weight and τ is the number of feature series the output of attention layer x t is calculated by zhang et al 2019 14 x t β 1 t x 1 t β 2 t x 2 t β τ t x τ t then x t is used to replace x t in eqs 7 8 and 10 to finish the work of converting the time series to attention based time series thus the lstm with attention mechanism lstm am is constructed 2 6 integration of models in this subsection we describe briefly the construction of the mlstm am model as shown in fig 1 the implementation framework of the integrated mlstm am model is generally composed of the following steps 1 divide the candidate predictor set x t and predictand y t into training dataset x train y train and test dataset x test y test 2 decompose x train and y train into their detail and approximation components respectively by the atwt let s j t r a i n x j 1 j and s j 1 t r a i n x denote the sets of detail and approximation components of x train respectively s j t r a i n y j 1 j and s j 1 t r a i n y represent the detail and approximation components of y train respectively 3 select a small and significant subset for a given predictand component s j t r a i n y j 1 j 1 from the corresponding predictor component set s j t r a i n x by the pi algorithm the identified significant model inputs are denoted as s j t r a i n sign j 1 j 1 4 input s j t r a i n sign and s j t r a i n y into the lstm am to train respective component prediction model at different time scales 5 call separately the built component lstm am models to forecast the predictand components by inputting the corresponding significant predictors in the test period 6 sum all the forecasted component subseries to achieve the predictand forecasts in addition we note that the mlstm model can be constructed easily by replacing the lstm am in steps 4 and 5 with the lstm 3 study area and used data in the study the yrb shown in fig 2 is selected as the study area to evaluate and compare the performance of the mlstm am mlstm lstm and mlr in forecasting monthly precipitation additionally we select the previous monthly precipitation data and 30 large scale climate indices at lag times of 1 12 months as the candidate inputs for forecasting monthly precipitation over the yrb 3 1 study area the yrb 24 27 35 54 n 90 33 122 19 e with a drainage area of 1 8 10 6 k m 2 is the largest in china the yangtze river originates in the qinghai tibet plateau and flows about 6300 km eastwards to the east china sea zhang et al 2008 tao et al 2020 a subtropical monsoon climate dominates the yrb which leads to spatially and temporally unequally distributed of the annual precipitation about 70 80 of annual precipitation occurs in the rainy season may october and the dry season occurs from november to april yu et al 2009 wang et al 2010 the average precipitation for the western region is 270 500 mm per year and the average annual precipitation ranges from 1600 to 1900 mm in the eastern region of the yrb gemmer et al 2008 3 2 precipitation data the monthly precipitation data covering january 1966 december 2016 are collected from 129 stations over the yrb we downloaded the datasets from the website of the china meteorological data sharing system http data cma cn in this study the data in the 40 year period of january 1966 to december 2005 are used as a training set whilst those in the 11 year period of january 2006 to december 2016 as a test set 3 3 climate indices many researches have been undertaken to relate the occurrence of widespread rainfall in the region to changes in the atmospheric or oceanic circulation the sea surface temperature sst is usually recognized as a reliable predictor for precipitation prediction lang and wang 2010 in the past decades many models have been developed for forecasting precipitation just with the signal sst anomalies which leads to the pooroutcomes and the reliability of the prediction tends to be low thus only one climate index cannot measure and monitor the entire precipitation system perfectly to get a more comprehensive characterization of precipitation in the yrb a total of 30 climate indices in table 1 are selected as candidate predictors in this study the original monthly precipitation and climate indices vary widely which will have a negative effect onthe model s ability to learn therefore all the monthly precipitation and climate indices need to be standardized before forecasting to ensure they remainon the same scale this pre processing can guarantee a stable convergence of parameters in the modeldevelopment zhang et al 2018 the standardized anomaly series can be derived by subtracting the mean of the corresponding month from each of observations and dividing by the standard deviation of that month lohani et al 2012 4 evaluation metrics the performance of the models can be assessed using various statistical measures the statistics indicators the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative absolute error rae have been widely used to evaluate the prediction performance of models chen et al 2015 he et al 2015 more detailed information about these two indicators can be obtained from the cited references the nse and rae are respectively defined as follows 15 nse 1 i 1 m y for i y obs i i 1 m y obs i y obs 16 rae i 1 m y for i y obs i i 1 m y obs i where m stands for the number of observations in the test period y obs i and y for i are the observed and forecasted rainfall values respectively and y obs denotes the mean of observations in addition the occasional negative forecasting values are adjusted to zero rainfall as a physical constraint in the models for monthly precipitation forecasting before the performance evaluation indicators are calculated clearly the closer the nse value is to 1 the better the model performance is and the smaller value for rae implies the higher performance of the model 5 results and discussion in this section four models the mlstm am mlstm lstm and mlr are applied to forecast monthly precipitation with a one month lead time at each of 129 stations in the yrb generally the maximum correlation between precipitation anomaly and climate signals often occurs with certain time lags referring to he and guan 2013 and zhu et al 2016 the 372 31 12 initial inputs derived from the antecedent precipitation anomaly and 30 large scale climate indices at lags of 1 12 months are utilized as candidate model inputs in this study comparing between the models we comprehensively examine the forecast performance of the lstm and the ability of the atwt and am to improve the lstm for monthly precipitation forecasting 5 1 data decomposition as for the mlstm am and mlstm the original data are decomposed by the atwt with the daubechies wavelet of order 4 db4 following the suggestion by the work of farajzadeh and alizadeh 2018 which has shown that the db4 leads to the best prediction of monthly rainfall compared with haar wavelet sym wavelet and other mother wavelets five decomposition levels are employed in the study for a sampling period of 1 month the time scales of the wavelet decomposition are 2 4 8 16 and 32 months respectively for the decomposition levels j 1 2 3 4 and 5 therefore these components can reflect the fluctuations of original time series at monthly seasonal and interannual scales as suggested by he et al 2014 these decomposition levels allow examining usefulness of a range of time scale signals in precipitation forecasting as an example five detail components d 1 d 2 d 5 and one approximation component a 5 corresponding to the original series for monthly precipitation anomaly of station 56 096 and arctic oscillation ao index are shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3 that the details exhibit changing frequencies amplitudes and wavelengths the d 1 contains the maximum amplitude highest frequency and shortest wavelength part of the signal as the decomposition level increases the following detail components decrease successively in the amplitude and frequency and increase successively in the wavelength to examine whether other mother wavelets can help to enhance forecastingaccuracyor not we applied the daubechies wavelet of order 1 for time series decomposition however the prediction performance of models is not improved from the rae and nse viewpoints thus we only give the performance statistics of the mlstm am and mlstm models with the db4 wavelet decomposition 5 2 input identification the selection of a small and appropriate subset of model inputs and the determination of appropriate lags for each input variable are the vital phases in developing satisfactory forecast models to prevent overfitting the data and improve computational efficiency a maximum of 10 significant predictors are determined from 372 candidate inputs by the pi algorithm for each component model in the multiscale models at each of stations similarly for the models without wavelet decomposition their significant predictors are identified by the pi algorithm from the initial inputs as a result for each of models without wavelet decomposition 8 9 significant predictors are selected by the pi algorithm with α 0 01 for each component prediction model with wavelet decomposition 7 9 inputs are identified as significant predictors afterstatistically analyzing the identified significant inputs across all stations over the yrb it is found that the sst with 9 month lag over kuroshio current western pacific index with 10 month lag and indian ocean dipole mode index with 2 month lag are the first three most frequently selected predictors for the models without wavelet decomposition the antecedent precipitation anomaly components with 1 month lag at all decomposition levels and 2 month lag at the decomposition levels j 2 and 5 oceanic niño index components with 5 month lag at the decomposition levels j 1 and 3 and sst component with 5 month lag and decomposition level 4 over bay of bengal are the significant component predictors with higher selection frequencies across the yrb for the multiscale models in addition to test whether or not more predictor variables included in the final models help to make an improvement in model skill a looser criterion of α 0 05 is examined in the pi algorithm for models the results showed that the mlstm am mlstm lstm and mlr models with the looser criterion do not provide the improved results thus here we only give the performance statistics of the four models with α 0 01 5 3 comparison of model performance after decomposing the data and identifying the significant model inputs the mlstm am model is performed to forecast the monthly precipitation in the yrb at the same time the monthly precipitation series is also predicted by the mlstm lstm and mlr models then the forecast results of the four different models are respectively presented and then compared by two model performance criteria nse and rae the spatial distributions of the nse and rae indicators are mapped in figs 4 and 5 respectively for the four different models with the test period of 2006 2016 at 129 stations over the yrb as can be observed form figs 4a 4d and 5a 5d the forecast results of all the four models exhibit significant spatial variability over the basin but tell similar spatial characteristics of the model forecast skill with a clear west east distribution the western region of the basin is dominated by stations having larger nse and smaller rae values while the stations with smaller nse and larger rae values are mostly located in the eastern region this indicates that all the four models have better performance in the western region than in the eastern of the yrb for forecasting monthly rainfall to explore what impact the variability of precipitation has on the spatial variation of the forecast results we calculated the entropy value of monthly rainfall series at each of selected stations across the yrb fig 6 depicts the spatial distribution of the entropy which exhibits a rough west east pattern from fig 6 it can be seen that the entropy values range from 6 42 to 9 07 and 30 of 129 stations obtain the smaller entropy values 7 85 86 7 of which are situated in the western region of the basin at the same time 31 of 129 stations acquire the larger entropy values 8 35 83 9 of which are located in the eastern region of the yrb comparing figs 4a 4d and 5a 5d with fig 6 we can observe that the predictions of all the models are more skillful in the western region with lower entropy values and they show limited skill in the eastern region with higher entropy values this indicates that the variability of precipitation has a significant impact on the forecast performance of the models although the forecast results of all the four models exhibit a similar spatial pattern these four models have different abilities for forecasting monthly precipitation in the yrb the mlstm and mlstm am improve monthly precipitation forecasts at all of 129 stations over the basin compared to the lstm and the mlstm am provides the best prediction results and the mlr exhibits the weakest prediction ability among all these four models specifically over all of 129 stations the average nse values are 0 66 0 65 0 50 and 0 46 respectively and the average rae values are 0 35 0 35 0 41 and 0 44 respectively for the mlstm am mlstm lstm and mlr the lstm gives better average results than the mlr with increasing average nse by 0 04 and decreasing average rae by 0 03 the mlstm am gives the highest average of nse among these four models and the mlstm increases the average nse by 0 15 and decreases the average rae by 0 06 relative to the lstm theseaveragesreveal that the performance of the mlr is the poorest among these four models the mlstm am and mlstm have a better overall performance for forecasting monthly precipitation than the lstm and the mlstm am has the most powerful forecast capacity to further examine the spatial distribution of performance differences between four models in monthly precipitation prediction figs 4e 4g and 5e 5g exhibit the comparisons of nse and rae for the four models at 129 selected stations across the basin compared to the mlstm the mlstm am provides the increased nse and reduced rae at approximately 60 of stations in the basin figs 4e and 5e which implies that overall the mlstm am outperforms the mlstm all stations are labeled by increased nse and reduced rae obtained by the mlstm relative to the lstm figs 4f and 5f which indicates that the use of the atwt can improve monthly precipitation prediction accuracy of the lstm at the entire yrb specifically comparedto thelstm the mlstm increases the nse by 0 02 0 15 at 65 out of 129 stations 66 2 of which are situated in the western region and by 0 16 0 32 at 64 out of 129 stations 79 7 of which are situated in the eastern region of thebasin fig 4f this impliesthatthe improvement obtained by the mlstm in comparison with the lstm is more significant at most of the stations in the eastern region when there is a higher variability of precipitation inaddition it can be also found that the lstm provides the increased nse and reduced rae relative to the mlr at more than 75 of stations in the basin figs 4g and 5g which indicates that the lstm generally performs better than the mlr in order to further compare the performance of the mlstm am mlstm lstm and mlr and evaluate the improvement of the atwt and am to the lstm in monthly precipitation forecasting the frequency histograms of the number of stations for the nse and rae obtained by the four models over the yrb are depicted in fig 7 from fig 7a it can be seen that about 70 5 and 62 0 of stations obtain a nse 0 61 by the mlstm am and mlstm respectively and no station acquires a nse 0 40 by these two models whereas only 25 6 of stations get a nse 0 61 and approximately 28 7 of stations acquire a nse 0 40 by the lstm and only 24 0 of stations get a nse 0 61 and more than 38 7 of stations obtain a nse 0 40 by the mlr these data imply that the am and atwt can act to effectively enhance the accuracy of the monthly precipitation forecasting and the lstm has more powerful ability to forecast monthly precipitation than the mlr from fig 7b a rae 0 40 is identified at about 85 4 and 82 9 of stations for the mlstm am and mlstm respectively and no station gets a rae 0 51 for these two models however only 35 7 of stations get a rae 0 40 and about 6 2 of stations obtain a rae 0 51 by the lstm and only 26 4 of stations get a rae 0 40 and about 19 4 of stations obtain a rae 0 51 by the mlr these results further demonstrate that the mlstm am performs overall better than the mlstm and lstm and the mlr delivers the poorest performance among four models for monthly precipitation forecasting in the yrb in addition to evaluatethe ability of the models in predicting the dispersion of precipitation relative to itsmean fig 8 presents the scatter plots of the standard deviations of predicted and observed monthly precipitation in the test period across all the stations for four models as we can see from fig 8 the forecasted values by the mlstm am are closest to the 45 degree line compared with other three models which furtherdemonstrates the improvementof the mlstm am in forecasting precipitation the complex and nonstationary predictor variables are decomposed by using the atwt into several subseries components as model inputs this leads to the features of the subseries such as seasonal annual and interannual variabilities can be seen more clearly than the original signal huang et al 2014 thus the atwt based models can optimally utilize the information contained in the different subseries and are able to capture the influences of the predictors on the precipitation anomaly under the different time scales meanwhile the am can capture the importance degrees of different feature states based on past time this may be why the use of the atwt and am can improve the prediction accuracy of the lstm to examine how the detailed monthly forecasts match with the observations fig 9 illustrates the precipitation forecasts by the four different models in the test period 2007 2016 for four stations highlighted by red dots in fig 2 stations 56479 57106 58 238 and 58437 it can be observed that all of these models have a reasonable accuracy for predicting the monthly precipitation we can also see from fig 9 that compared to mlr the lstm with the larger nse value is more capable of capturing the fluctuation of the monthly precipitation as the forecasts by the lstm are closer to the observed than those by the mlr furthermore the mlstm am and mlstm are more powerful for forecasting monthly precipitation than the lstm and the mlstm am is the most effective in forecasting the fluctuation of the monthly precipitation however all the models underestimate some large peaks of precipitation in the summer rainy season it may be explained by the occurrence of extreme precipitation typhoons are the majorcauseof the large peaks in summer precipitation in the eastern region of the yrb shen et al 2013 li et al 2018 moreover it is difficult to predict the impacts of typhoons on monthly precipitation due to the complexities of typhoon influences including pathway intensity and life span kim et al 2018 to further appraise the prediction performance of the four models on the extreme precipitation the annual monthly maximum precipitation in the test period at each of all 129 stations over the yrb and their predicted values obtained by four different models are shown in fig 10 it can be inferred from fig 10 that the mlstm am with the largest nse value has the best performance for forecasting extreme precipitation as trend line from the mlstm am is closer to the 45 degree line than those from the mlstm lstm and mlr in addition the trend line from the mlstm is closer to the 45 degree line than those from the lstm and mlr indicating that the performance of the mlstm is better than the lstm and mlr for extreme precipitation predicting even though the mlstm am improves forecastresults obtained by other three models the scatter plot indicates that the mlstm am still underestimates extreme precipitation therefore it is worth further exploring how to improve extreme precipitation forecast in the future 6 conclusions in this study for improving the accuracy of monthly precipitation forecasting a multiscale long short term memory model with attention mechanism has been developed by incorporating the atwt for data decomposition the pi algorithm for input identification and the am for lstm model structure optimization the proposed mlstm am model has been assessed and discussed by comparing with the mlstm lstm and mlr models at 129 stations over the yrb the results show that the forecast skill of all these four models exhibits a similar west east spatial pattern in the yrb the skill of models is more powerful at stations in the western region with smaller entropy values and is generally limited at stations in the eastern region of the basin with larger entropy values which shows a strong correlation with the spatial distribution of the variability of precipitation from the comparison of results it can be concluded that the lstm performs better than the mlr for forecasting monthly precipitation at most of stations both the mlstm am and mlstm can effectively improve the forecast precision of the lstm model at all of 129 stations over the yrb and the mlstm am has the best performance among all of these four models relative to the lstm the mlstm increases the average nse by 0 15 and reduces the average rae by 0 06 and the improvement is more significant at most of the stations in the eastern region when there is a higher variability of precipitation credit authorship

4259,in this study a multiscale long short term memory model with attention mechanism mlstm am is proposed to improve the accuracy of monthly precipitation forecasting in the mlstm am model à trous wavelet transform atwt is first employed to decompose the standardized monthly precipitation anomaly and climate indices into a certain number of subseries with different time scales then at each of time scales a long short term memory lstm model is constructed to predict the precipitation anomaly subseries by coupling with partial information pi algorithm for selecting the model inputs and attention mechanism am for optimizing the model structure finally all the predicted subseries are summed and then the summed series is transformed as the monthly precipitation prediction the proposed mlstm am model is examined with 129 stations over the yangtze river basin and compared with the mlstm lstm and multiple linear regression mlr the mlstm is formed by coupling the lstm with the atwt for comparison the inputs of all the models are identified by the pi algorithm results show that the prediction of all the models is more skillful in the western region than in the eastern region of the basin which is strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of the variability of precipitation the lstm outperforms the mlr in terms of two performance evaluation indicators at most of stations the mlstm and mlstm am improve monthly precipitation forecasts at all of 129 stations over the basin compared to the lstm and the mlstm am provides the best prediction performance among all these models keywords long short term memory attention mechanism wavelet transform partial information selection monthly precipitation prediction 1 introduction reliable precipitation forecasting both short term and long term has great significance in the fields of water resources management flood control disaster reduction and agricultural management venkata ramana et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 tao et al 2017 however precipitation is a complicated nonlinear atmospheric process which is space and time dependent he et al 2015 thus it has been challenging to understand the complexity and predictability of precipitation and produce accurate forecasts of precipitation silva et al 2006 peng et al 2014 in precipitation forecasting the beginning duration and end of the rainy season are defined by the month bagirov and mahmood 2018 moreover monthly precipitation provides more accurate intra year precipitation distribution than seasonal precipitation omotosho et al 2000 therefore it is essential to forecast precipitation at the monthly time scale in the past decades predictions of precipitation have usually been made by using physically based models lim et al 2009 and machine learning methods shi et al 2015 the physically based models are very complicated to solve the physical trajectory equation which need to process a great amount of meteorological data within a prescribed time zhang et al 2020 in order to avoid large errors meteorological experts will participate in the forecasting process based on the physical model by judging and modifying the forecast results yu et al 2018 this verification method not only consumes a lot of manpower and computing resources but is also difficult for meteorologists with many years of experience zhang et al 2020 however machine learning methods can explore the spatial and temporal patterns hidden in historical data and do not require information on physical processes shi et al 2015 which can save manpower and computing resources compared with physically based models in addition many cases have been confirmed that machine learning methods can obtain a better prediction result than physically based models chu and chang 2009 karandish and šimunek 2016 artificial neural networks anns are a group of machine learning methods that have a strong ability of nonlinear mapping and have been successfully used in diverse fields including agriculturalplanning and water resource management huang et al 2014 he et al 2014 kenabatho et al 2015 there are many variants of neural network models including feed forward neural network recurrent neural network rnn and convolutional neural network cnn the rnn is dedicated to a kind of sequence model which maintains a vector of hidden activation that is propagated through time graves 2012 bai et al 2018 the intuitive appeal of recurrent modeling is that the hidden state can act as a representation of everything that has been seen so far in the sequence bai et al 2018 however one drawback of the rnn is that it can struggle to learn long sequences which leads to the vanishing gradient problem when training conventional rnn with long term lags ni et al 2020 liu et al 2020 long short term memory lstm is an improved version of a typical rnn equipped with the capacity to retain long time dependencies which can avoid the gradient problem in the rnn training liu et al 2020 recently the lstm model has already been used as an advanced model to deal with the time series prediction problem qiu et al 2017 kratzert et al 2018 kao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 explored the potential of the lstm for rainfall runoff modelling results showed that the lstm is well competing with the performance of the well established conceptual model kao et al 2020 developed a lstm based encoder decoder model lstm ed for multi step ahead flood forecasting results showed that the lstm ed model can improve the reliability of flood forecasting and increase the interpretability of model internals however it is difficult to explain what role each input feature series plays in the forecasting if raw time series are used directly as model inputs to address this problem assigning an optimal weight to each of input feature series based on its importance is proposed in the past decades many methods including analytic hierarchy process ahp park and han 2002 partial information correlation pic sharma and mehrotra 2014 and attention mechanism am zhang et al 2019 have been used to calculate the weights of input time series in the ahp and pic methods the calculation of weights of input features is independent to the regression model however the weights derived by the am are closely related to the units of the ann model which allows that am weights can be optimized by learning in recent years the am coupled with the deep learning model has been widely used and performed well in many fields such as speech recognition image captioning and visual question answering kim et al 2017 lu et al 2017 yu et al 2017 in addition some related works on improving prediction accuracy of time series have been done by adding an attention layer to the existing models liang et al 2018 li et al 2019 for example li et al 2020 proposed an attention based cnn lstm model to predict urban fine particulate matter results showed that the attention based layer can automatically weigh the past feature states to improve prediction accuracy therefore to improve monthly precipitation forecasting we attempt to add an attention layer into the lstm model in this study considering that hydrological data are random and non stationary and the time series consists of different frequency components directly analyzing the original time series would ignores some features of different time scales which leads to the weak forecast accuracy of hydrological models karthikeyan and nagesh kumar 2013 zhu et al 2016 kalteh 2016 the wavelet transform wt is a widely used data preprocessing technique to extract features such as short term and long term fluctuations of the original series at different time scales by decomposing the time series chong et al 2020 which can improve the forecast results compared to the traditional fourier transform the wt is more effective in studying non stationary time series nourani et al 2009 some successful cases of the wt have been provided by previousresearches in the field of hydrology liu et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 the improvement of the wt to the ann in nonstationary time series forecasting was explored by he et al 2015 results showed that the wt based model could effectively predict the monthly rainfall altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 used the wt to improve daily rainfall forecasting hence it is necessary to decompose the original time series before precipitation forecasting many researches have demonstrated that large scale climatic patterns have significant influence on the regional precipitation variability hartmann et al 2008 kim and kim 2010 peng et al 2014 jiang 2020 considering the relationship between precipitation and climate indices several studies have developed the precipitation forecast models with the climate indices and antecedent precipitation as model inputs kim and kim 2010 he et al 2015 however it leads to a large set of candidate inputs and complex computational process when the antecedent precipitation and or other lagged climate related indices are considered as model inputs to predict precipitation therefore the adaptive choice of input variables is an important step for improving computational efficiency in the development of precipitation prediction models tran et al 2015 the mutual information mi technique proposed by fraser and swinney 1986 has been successfully applied to identify the explanatory variables for non linear time series babel et al 2015 dhamge et al 2012 however it cannot be used to measure the partial dependence among multiple variables to address this problem sharma and mehrotra 2014 developed a partial information pi algorithm with stepwise selection for model predictor identification by extending the mi to the pi measure thus the pi algorithm is employed to adaptively select the appropriate inputs to lstm models in this study the objectives of this study are to investigate the potential of the lstm for forecasting monthly precipitation and develop a multiscale lstm with am mlstm am to enhance forecast accuracy of the lstm in the proposed model the standardized monthly precipitation anomaly and climate indices are first decomposed into their subseries with different time scales by the wt then at each time scale the pi selection algorithm is used to identify an appropriate subset of lstm inputs from a large set of candidate predictors and the am is applied to optimize the lstm model structure next each of precipitation anomaly subseries is forecasted from the identified predictors finally the standardized monthly precipitation is obtained by summing all the predicted precipitation anomaly subseries and then the monthly precipitation prediction is acquired by transforming the standardized monthly precipitation forecasts the proposed mlstm am is tested with 129 stations over the yangtze river basin yrb and compared to the lstm and mlstm models wheremlstm is established by combining the lstm and wt additionally a multiple linear regression mlr model is also included as a reference case for the comparison of predicting skill it should be noted that the inputs of all models are identified by the pi algorithm in this study the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the methodology is presented first in section 2 section 3 describes the details of the study area and data used in this study section 4 provides the description of two statistical indicators to evaluate the forecast performance the improvement of forecast accuracy from the mlstm am model and the results of comparison with three reference models are given in section 5 some conclusions are made for this research in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 information entropy the information entropy h is a statistical quantity which indicates the complexity of a physical process the entropy of a variable x is defined as shannon 1948 1 h x f x l o g f x d x where f x is the probability density function pdf of x it should be noted that the statistical uncertainty or variability of monthly precipitation series can be measured by the use of the information entropy generally higher entropy value indicates higher statistical uncertainty and lower predictability of time series and vice versa li and zhang 2008 for additional details on the entropy readers can refer to elsner and tsonis 1993 and li and zhang 2008 2 2 partial information selection it is essential to identify a small and appropriate set of model inputs from a large set of candidate variables for model development the pi selection algorithm developed by sharma and mehrotra 2014 based on the information theory is used to select significant input variables for the prediction models in this study the pi algorithm starts with an empty preexisting input set z along with a set of candidate predictor variables x that could be useful in model prediction the basic steps in the pi algorithm process are as follows sharma and mehrotra 2014 1 compute p i c where p i c represents the estimated partial information correlation between output y and each of input variables in x conditional to z 2 identify the highest of these p i c as pic and set a threshold pi c α for a given significance level α the pi c α can be obtained by t p i c m 1 p i c 2 following the student s t distribution with degree of freedom m n l where n denotes the total number of observations for each variable and l the number of conditioning variables 3 judge whether this pic is significant or not if pic p i c α the candidate input corresponding to the pic is a significant predictor and is added to preexisting input set z and remove it from x 4 repeat steps 1 3 as many times as needed the algorithm stops only when all significant input predictors have been selected the readers are referred to sharma 2000 and sharma and mehrotra 2014 for additional details as well as to sharma et al 2016 for the open source software needed to estimate the p i c 2 3 wavelet transform the wt as an effective tool has been successfully used to get a complete time scale representation of time series and their relationships sang 2013 liu et al 2014 since monthly precipitation and climate index data are recorded in discrete time intervals the discrete wt dwt is utilized in this study the typical discrete wavelet function can be expressed as daubechies 1992 2 ψ j k t 2 j 2 ψ 2 j t k where ψ t is the mother wavelet j is the decomposition level and k is a location index the research of wavelet based time series forecasting in hydrologicalfield is growing popular in recent years however the dwt is a non redundant transform which makes it shift sensitive to boundary conditions quilty and adamowski 2018 this shift sensitivity is an undesirable feature which leads to some future information being brought into forecasts when the dwt is performed this problem can be overcome by a stepwise decomposition based sdb sampling technique which produces predictor variables of all of the samples completely depending on decomposing past observations lagging behind the time series to be forecasted fang et al 2019 as a result information on future observations can be strictly excluded from the predictor variables however there are some disadvantages in the sdb technique such as the high computational cost considering the à trous algorithm can overcome the high computational cost of the sdb technique and avoid the impact of future information on the result of forecasting ni et al 2020 the à trous wavelet transform atwt is applied to perform time series decomposition which does not require data from the future time t to calculate wavelet scaling coefficients at the present at t maheswaran and khosa 2012 ni et al 2020 by using atwt the approximation components of the time series x t at different time scales can be derived as follows maheswaran and khosa 2012 3 a 0 t x t a j t l h l a j t 2 j 1 l where j takes values from 1 to j j is the highest decomposition level and h is a low pass filter with compact support the detail component of the time series x t at level j is generated by maheswaran and khosa 2012 4 d j t a j 1 t a j t accordingly the time series x t can be decomposed into a finite number of approximation a and detail d components then the original time series x t with the highest decomposition level j can be reconstructed from the approximation and detail components as 5 x t a j t j 1 j d j t the detailed discussions of the atwt can be referred to shensa 1992 rathinasamy et al 2013 and ni et al 2020 2 4 long short term memory the lstm introduced by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is an advancement of the rnn designed to overcome the weakness of the traditional rnn to learn long term dependencies the lstm extends the rnn architecture of a memory cell with gating mechanism which controls the information across the network the gating mechanism includes three units the forget input and output gates to determine whether to forget past cell status or to deliver output to the last state which allows the lstm to store and access information over long periods the first gate is the forget gate which is to determine whether information should be discarded from the previous state the formulation is as follows huang et al 2018 6 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where x t is the input at time t h t 1 is the output of the hidden layer at time t 1 f t is the output of forget gate at time t w f is the weight connecting h t 1 and x t to the forget gate b f is the corresponding bias term and σ indicates the logistic sigmoid function the next step contains two parts which is to decide how much new information needs to be added to the cell state in the first part the input gate layer determines which information is used to update the cell state in the current time step and then a potential update vector c t is generated from a tanh layer by the current input x t and the last hidden state h t 1 at last these two parts are combined to create an update to the state the formulations are defined as huang et al 2018 7 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 8 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c here i t is the output of input gate at time t c t is the cell input state at time t w i and w c are the weights connecting h t 1 and x t to the input gate and cell input respectively b i and b c are their corresponding bias terms tanh denotes the hyperbolic tangent function then the old cell state c t 1 is updated to the new cell state c t by the following equation ding et al 2020 9 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where c t and c t 1 represent the cell output states at time t and t 1 respectively and is element wise multiplication the last gate is output gate which is used to control the information of the cell state c t that flows into the new hidden state h t the output gate and the new hidden state are calculated by ding et al 2020 10 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 11 h t o t tanh c t respectively where o t is the output of output gate at time t w o is the weight connecting h t 1 and x t to the output gate b o is the corresponding bias term and h t is the output of the hidden layer at time t 2 5 attention layer the importance of various predictors in precipitation forecasting is different in precipitation prediction we need to pay more attention to more significant predictors therefore the am can be used to optimize the input feature series in time series prediction by assigning different weights to input feature series based on their importance the input series of attention layer is a raw feature time series the am can adaptively select more relevant input features and give higher weights to the corresponding original feature series then we use the output of the attention layer as the input data for the lstm to constructthe attention based lstm model that is using the previous information with attention weight to predict the future time series for a certain feature series x q at time t its attention weight can be calculated by the previous hidden state h t 1 and cell state c t 1 in the lstm unit as zhang et al 2019 12 e q t v tanh w 1 h t 1 c t 1 w 2 x q 13 β q t s o f t max e q t exp e q t ι 1 τ exp e ι t where v w 1 and w 2 are learnable parameters β q is the attention weight and τ is the number of feature series the output of attention layer x t is calculated by zhang et al 2019 14 x t β 1 t x 1 t β 2 t x 2 t β τ t x τ t then x t is used to replace x t in eqs 7 8 and 10 to finish the work of converting the time series to attention based time series thus the lstm with attention mechanism lstm am is constructed 2 6 integration of models in this subsection we describe briefly the construction of the mlstm am model as shown in fig 1 the implementation framework of the integrated mlstm am model is generally composed of the following steps 1 divide the candidate predictor set x t and predictand y t into training dataset x train y train and test dataset x test y test 2 decompose x train and y train into their detail and approximation components respectively by the atwt let s j t r a i n x j 1 j and s j 1 t r a i n x denote the sets of detail and approximation components of x train respectively s j t r a i n y j 1 j and s j 1 t r a i n y represent the detail and approximation components of y train respectively 3 select a small and significant subset for a given predictand component s j t r a i n y j 1 j 1 from the corresponding predictor component set s j t r a i n x by the pi algorithm the identified significant model inputs are denoted as s j t r a i n sign j 1 j 1 4 input s j t r a i n sign and s j t r a i n y into the lstm am to train respective component prediction model at different time scales 5 call separately the built component lstm am models to forecast the predictand components by inputting the corresponding significant predictors in the test period 6 sum all the forecasted component subseries to achieve the predictand forecasts in addition we note that the mlstm model can be constructed easily by replacing the lstm am in steps 4 and 5 with the lstm 3 study area and used data in the study the yrb shown in fig 2 is selected as the study area to evaluate and compare the performance of the mlstm am mlstm lstm and mlr in forecasting monthly precipitation additionally we select the previous monthly precipitation data and 30 large scale climate indices at lag times of 1 12 months as the candidate inputs for forecasting monthly precipitation over the yrb 3 1 study area the yrb 24 27 35 54 n 90 33 122 19 e with a drainage area of 1 8 10 6 k m 2 is the largest in china the yangtze river originates in the qinghai tibet plateau and flows about 6300 km eastwards to the east china sea zhang et al 2008 tao et al 2020 a subtropical monsoon climate dominates the yrb which leads to spatially and temporally unequally distributed of the annual precipitation about 70 80 of annual precipitation occurs in the rainy season may october and the dry season occurs from november to april yu et al 2009 wang et al 2010 the average precipitation for the western region is 270 500 mm per year and the average annual precipitation ranges from 1600 to 1900 mm in the eastern region of the yrb gemmer et al 2008 3 2 precipitation data the monthly precipitation data covering january 1966 december 2016 are collected from 129 stations over the yrb we downloaded the datasets from the website of the china meteorological data sharing system http data cma cn in this study the data in the 40 year period of january 1966 to december 2005 are used as a training set whilst those in the 11 year period of january 2006 to december 2016 as a test set 3 3 climate indices many researches have been undertaken to relate the occurrence of widespread rainfall in the region to changes in the atmospheric or oceanic circulation the sea surface temperature sst is usually recognized as a reliable predictor for precipitation prediction lang and wang 2010 in the past decades many models have been developed for forecasting precipitation just with the signal sst anomalies which leads to the pooroutcomes and the reliability of the prediction tends to be low thus only one climate index cannot measure and monitor the entire precipitation system perfectly to get a more comprehensive characterization of precipitation in the yrb a total of 30 climate indices in table 1 are selected as candidate predictors in this study the original monthly precipitation and climate indices vary widely which will have a negative effect onthe model s ability to learn therefore all the monthly precipitation and climate indices need to be standardized before forecasting to ensure they remainon the same scale this pre processing can guarantee a stable convergence of parameters in the modeldevelopment zhang et al 2018 the standardized anomaly series can be derived by subtracting the mean of the corresponding month from each of observations and dividing by the standard deviation of that month lohani et al 2012 4 evaluation metrics the performance of the models can be assessed using various statistical measures the statistics indicators the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative absolute error rae have been widely used to evaluate the prediction performance of models chen et al 2015 he et al 2015 more detailed information about these two indicators can be obtained from the cited references the nse and rae are respectively defined as follows 15 nse 1 i 1 m y for i y obs i i 1 m y obs i y obs 16 rae i 1 m y for i y obs i i 1 m y obs i where m stands for the number of observations in the test period y obs i and y for i are the observed and forecasted rainfall values respectively and y obs denotes the mean of observations in addition the occasional negative forecasting values are adjusted to zero rainfall as a physical constraint in the models for monthly precipitation forecasting before the performance evaluation indicators are calculated clearly the closer the nse value is to 1 the better the model performance is and the smaller value for rae implies the higher performance of the model 5 results and discussion in this section four models the mlstm am mlstm lstm and mlr are applied to forecast monthly precipitation with a one month lead time at each of 129 stations in the yrb generally the maximum correlation between precipitation anomaly and climate signals often occurs with certain time lags referring to he and guan 2013 and zhu et al 2016 the 372 31 12 initial inputs derived from the antecedent precipitation anomaly and 30 large scale climate indices at lags of 1 12 months are utilized as candidate model inputs in this study comparing between the models we comprehensively examine the forecast performance of the lstm and the ability of the atwt and am to improve the lstm for monthly precipitation forecasting 5 1 data decomposition as for the mlstm am and mlstm the original data are decomposed by the atwt with the daubechies wavelet of order 4 db4 following the suggestion by the work of farajzadeh and alizadeh 2018 which has shown that the db4 leads to the best prediction of monthly rainfall compared with haar wavelet sym wavelet and other mother wavelets five decomposition levels are employed in the study for a sampling period of 1 month the time scales of the wavelet decomposition are 2 4 8 16 and 32 months respectively for the decomposition levels j 1 2 3 4 and 5 therefore these components can reflect the fluctuations of original time series at monthly seasonal and interannual scales as suggested by he et al 2014 these decomposition levels allow examining usefulness of a range of time scale signals in precipitation forecasting as an example five detail components d 1 d 2 d 5 and one approximation component a 5 corresponding to the original series for monthly precipitation anomaly of station 56 096 and arctic oscillation ao index are shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3 that the details exhibit changing frequencies amplitudes and wavelengths the d 1 contains the maximum amplitude highest frequency and shortest wavelength part of the signal as the decomposition level increases the following detail components decrease successively in the amplitude and frequency and increase successively in the wavelength to examine whether other mother wavelets can help to enhance forecastingaccuracyor not we applied the daubechies wavelet of order 1 for time series decomposition however the prediction performance of models is not improved from the rae and nse viewpoints thus we only give the performance statistics of the mlstm am and mlstm models with the db4 wavelet decomposition 5 2 input identification the selection of a small and appropriate subset of model inputs and the determination of appropriate lags for each input variable are the vital phases in developing satisfactory forecast models to prevent overfitting the data and improve computational efficiency a maximum of 10 significant predictors are determined from 372 candidate inputs by the pi algorithm for each component model in the multiscale models at each of stations similarly for the models without wavelet decomposition their significant predictors are identified by the pi algorithm from the initial inputs as a result for each of models without wavelet decomposition 8 9 significant predictors are selected by the pi algorithm with α 0 01 for each component prediction model with wavelet decomposition 7 9 inputs are identified as significant predictors afterstatistically analyzing the identified significant inputs across all stations over the yrb it is found that the sst with 9 month lag over kuroshio current western pacific index with 10 month lag and indian ocean dipole mode index with 2 month lag are the first three most frequently selected predictors for the models without wavelet decomposition the antecedent precipitation anomaly components with 1 month lag at all decomposition levels and 2 month lag at the decomposition levels j 2 and 5 oceanic niño index components with 5 month lag at the decomposition levels j 1 and 3 and sst component with 5 month lag and decomposition level 4 over bay of bengal are the significant component predictors with higher selection frequencies across the yrb for the multiscale models in addition to test whether or not more predictor variables included in the final models help to make an improvement in model skill a looser criterion of α 0 05 is examined in the pi algorithm for models the results showed that the mlstm am mlstm lstm and mlr models with the looser criterion do not provide the improved results thus here we only give the performance statistics of the four models with α 0 01 5 3 comparison of model performance after decomposing the data and identifying the significant model inputs the mlstm am model is performed to forecast the monthly precipitation in the yrb at the same time the monthly precipitation series is also predicted by the mlstm lstm and mlr models then the forecast results of the four different models are respectively presented and then compared by two model performance criteria nse and rae the spatial distributions of the nse and rae indicators are mapped in figs 4 and 5 respectively for the four different models with the test period of 2006 2016 at 129 stations over the yrb as can be observed form figs 4a 4d and 5a 5d the forecast results of all the four models exhibit significant spatial variability over the basin but tell similar spatial characteristics of the model forecast skill with a clear west east distribution the western region of the basin is dominated by stations having larger nse and smaller rae values while the stations with smaller nse and larger rae values are mostly located in the eastern region this indicates that all the four models have better performance in the western region than in the eastern of the yrb for forecasting monthly rainfall to explore what impact the variability of precipitation has on the spatial variation of the forecast results we calculated the entropy value of monthly rainfall series at each of selected stations across the yrb fig 6 depicts the spatial distribution of the entropy which exhibits a rough west east pattern from fig 6 it can be seen that the entropy values range from 6 42 to 9 07 and 30 of 129 stations obtain the smaller entropy values 7 85 86 7 of which are situated in the western region of the basin at the same time 31 of 129 stations acquire the larger entropy values 8 35 83 9 of which are located in the eastern region of the yrb comparing figs 4a 4d and 5a 5d with fig 6 we can observe that the predictions of all the models are more skillful in the western region with lower entropy values and they show limited skill in the eastern region with higher entropy values this indicates that the variability of precipitation has a significant impact on the forecast performance of the models although the forecast results of all the four models exhibit a similar spatial pattern these four models have different abilities for forecasting monthly precipitation in the yrb the mlstm and mlstm am improve monthly precipitation forecasts at all of 129 stations over the basin compared to the lstm and the mlstm am provides the best prediction results and the mlr exhibits the weakest prediction ability among all these four models specifically over all of 129 stations the average nse values are 0 66 0 65 0 50 and 0 46 respectively and the average rae values are 0 35 0 35 0 41 and 0 44 respectively for the mlstm am mlstm lstm and mlr the lstm gives better average results than the mlr with increasing average nse by 0 04 and decreasing average rae by 0 03 the mlstm am gives the highest average of nse among these four models and the mlstm increases the average nse by 0 15 and decreases the average rae by 0 06 relative to the lstm theseaveragesreveal that the performance of the mlr is the poorest among these four models the mlstm am and mlstm have a better overall performance for forecasting monthly precipitation than the lstm and the mlstm am has the most powerful forecast capacity to further examine the spatial distribution of performance differences between four models in monthly precipitation prediction figs 4e 4g and 5e 5g exhibit the comparisons of nse and rae for the four models at 129 selected stations across the basin compared to the mlstm the mlstm am provides the increased nse and reduced rae at approximately 60 of stations in the basin figs 4e and 5e which implies that overall the mlstm am outperforms the mlstm all stations are labeled by increased nse and reduced rae obtained by the mlstm relative to the lstm figs 4f and 5f which indicates that the use of the atwt can improve monthly precipitation prediction accuracy of the lstm at the entire yrb specifically comparedto thelstm the mlstm increases the nse by 0 02 0 15 at 65 out of 129 stations 66 2 of which are situated in the western region and by 0 16 0 32 at 64 out of 129 stations 79 7 of which are situated in the eastern region of thebasin fig 4f this impliesthatthe improvement obtained by the mlstm in comparison with the lstm is more significant at most of the stations in the eastern region when there is a higher variability of precipitation inaddition it can be also found that the lstm provides the increased nse and reduced rae relative to the mlr at more than 75 of stations in the basin figs 4g and 5g which indicates that the lstm generally performs better than the mlr in order to further compare the performance of the mlstm am mlstm lstm and mlr and evaluate the improvement of the atwt and am to the lstm in monthly precipitation forecasting the frequency histograms of the number of stations for the nse and rae obtained by the four models over the yrb are depicted in fig 7 from fig 7a it can be seen that about 70 5 and 62 0 of stations obtain a nse 0 61 by the mlstm am and mlstm respectively and no station acquires a nse 0 40 by these two models whereas only 25 6 of stations get a nse 0 61 and approximately 28 7 of stations acquire a nse 0 40 by the lstm and only 24 0 of stations get a nse 0 61 and more than 38 7 of stations obtain a nse 0 40 by the mlr these data imply that the am and atwt can act to effectively enhance the accuracy of the monthly precipitation forecasting and the lstm has more powerful ability to forecast monthly precipitation than the mlr from fig 7b a rae 0 40 is identified at about 85 4 and 82 9 of stations for the mlstm am and mlstm respectively and no station gets a rae 0 51 for these two models however only 35 7 of stations get a rae 0 40 and about 6 2 of stations obtain a rae 0 51 by the lstm and only 26 4 of stations get a rae 0 40 and about 19 4 of stations obtain a rae 0 51 by the mlr these results further demonstrate that the mlstm am performs overall better than the mlstm and lstm and the mlr delivers the poorest performance among four models for monthly precipitation forecasting in the yrb in addition to evaluatethe ability of the models in predicting the dispersion of precipitation relative to itsmean fig 8 presents the scatter plots of the standard deviations of predicted and observed monthly precipitation in the test period across all the stations for four models as we can see from fig 8 the forecasted values by the mlstm am are closest to the 45 degree line compared with other three models which furtherdemonstrates the improvementof the mlstm am in forecasting precipitation the complex and nonstationary predictor variables are decomposed by using the atwt into several subseries components as model inputs this leads to the features of the subseries such as seasonal annual and interannual variabilities can be seen more clearly than the original signal huang et al 2014 thus the atwt based models can optimally utilize the information contained in the different subseries and are able to capture the influences of the predictors on the precipitation anomaly under the different time scales meanwhile the am can capture the importance degrees of different feature states based on past time this may be why the use of the atwt and am can improve the prediction accuracy of the lstm to examine how the detailed monthly forecasts match with the observations fig 9 illustrates the precipitation forecasts by the four different models in the test period 2007 2016 for four stations highlighted by red dots in fig 2 stations 56479 57106 58 238 and 58437 it can be observed that all of these models have a reasonable accuracy for predicting the monthly precipitation we can also see from fig 9 that compared to mlr the lstm with the larger nse value is more capable of capturing the fluctuation of the monthly precipitation as the forecasts by the lstm are closer to the observed than those by the mlr furthermore the mlstm am and mlstm are more powerful for forecasting monthly precipitation than the lstm and the mlstm am is the most effective in forecasting the fluctuation of the monthly precipitation however all the models underestimate some large peaks of precipitation in the summer rainy season it may be explained by the occurrence of extreme precipitation typhoons are the majorcauseof the large peaks in summer precipitation in the eastern region of the yrb shen et al 2013 li et al 2018 moreover it is difficult to predict the impacts of typhoons on monthly precipitation due to the complexities of typhoon influences including pathway intensity and life span kim et al 2018 to further appraise the prediction performance of the four models on the extreme precipitation the annual monthly maximum precipitation in the test period at each of all 129 stations over the yrb and their predicted values obtained by four different models are shown in fig 10 it can be inferred from fig 10 that the mlstm am with the largest nse value has the best performance for forecasting extreme precipitation as trend line from the mlstm am is closer to the 45 degree line than those from the mlstm lstm and mlr in addition the trend line from the mlstm is closer to the 45 degree line than those from the lstm and mlr indicating that the performance of the mlstm is better than the lstm and mlr for extreme precipitation predicting even though the mlstm am improves forecastresults obtained by other three models the scatter plot indicates that the mlstm am still underestimates extreme precipitation therefore it is worth further exploring how to improve extreme precipitation forecast in the future 6 conclusions in this study for improving the accuracy of monthly precipitation forecasting a multiscale long short term memory model with attention mechanism has been developed by incorporating the atwt for data decomposition the pi algorithm for input identification and the am for lstm model structure optimization the proposed mlstm am model has been assessed and discussed by comparing with the mlstm lstm and mlr models at 129 stations over the yrb the results show that the forecast skill of all these four models exhibits a similar west east spatial pattern in the yrb the skill of models is more powerful at stations in the western region with smaller entropy values and is generally limited at stations in the eastern region of the basin with larger entropy values which shows a strong correlation with the spatial distribution of the variability of precipitation from the comparison of results it can be concluded that the lstm performs better than the mlr for forecasting monthly precipitation at most of stations both the mlstm am and mlstm can effectively improve the forecast precision of the lstm model at all of 129 stations over the yrb and the mlstm am has the best performance among all of these four models relative to the lstm the mlstm increases the average nse by 0 15 and reduces the average rae by 0 06 and the improvement is more significant at most of the stations in the eastern region when there is a higher variability of precipitation credit authorship
