14025,the use of materials with high reflectivity on the surfaces of inner walls plays a significant role in enhancing the performance of ultraviolet uv reactors in this study the reactor efficiency is evaluated by changing the materials of the inner wall surfaces of the multi lamp reactor from stainless steel to aluminum the effect of water uv transmittance flow rate lamp power and different modes of active lamps is studied on the effectiveness of inner wall reflection four turbulence models including standard k ε realizable k ε standard k ω and sst k ω are used for the simulation of the flow field in a cross flow uv reactor the discrete ordinates model is applied to calculate the uv radiation field the prediction of the velocity field showed that the sst k ω model fits better with the experimental data the results showed that if the inner wall is made of aluminum the effect of reflection on the reactor performance increases with increasing uv transmittance and lamp power and decreasing flow rate investigations on lamp position showed that the effect of reflectivity becomes more apparent by reducing the lamp distance from the inner wall therefore the reactor performance

century 1 chlorine is the most common disinfectant in the water treatment industry and because of the strong oxidizing effect it has the ability to cope with many microorganisms 2 3 however the production of toxic and harmful byproducts such as trihalomethanes in chlorination has triggered the tendency to use other reliable methods 4 6 ultraviolet uv disinfection is not only an effective and safe way to inactivate resistant pathogens but also a method without producing chemicals in the water disinfection process 7 9 uv disinfection is more expensive than common disinfection methods therefore in the past two decades researchers have devoted much effort for simulating and optimizing disinfection uv reactors 10 simulation of the two phase flow field and uv radiation field are two essential steps in investigating the performance of water disinfection uv reactors simulation of the flow field in uv reactors using the three turbulence models by sozzi and taghipour 11 showed that the realizable k ε model shows the best conformity with the experimental data also sozzi and taghipour 12 by examining both eulerian and lagrangian approaches on the particulate flow concluded that at high flow rates the results of the two approaches are very close to each other and there is a relatively small difference in low flow rates between eulerian and lagrangian approaches liu et al 13 predicted the flow field in a cross flow uv reactor using six turbulence models they reported that the obtained results using standard k ω and sst k ω models in the wake region were in a good agreement with empirical measurements in addition the sst k ω model was much more successful in calculating the outside of the wake region compared to the standard k ω model concluding that the selected turbulence model dramatically affected the dose distribution curve in the field of radiation calculations ho 14 considered the reflection and refraction of the quartz walls and the effect of reflection from the uv reactor inner surfaces results showed that the radiation distribution obtained by discrete ordinates do model was able to estimate the experimental data successfully xu et al 15 evaluated the effect of multiple parameters on the disinfection process of the uv reactors using the realizable k ε turbulence model they observed that the size and shape of microorganism particles did not have a significant impact on the particles dose distribution curve following this work xu et al 16 investigated the effect of lamp arrangement on the radiation field and the log inactivation of several uv reactors versus flow rates results revealed that a more uniform radiation field distribution achieved but the reactor performance was not improved further with the increase in the lamp number li et al 17 studied the effect of water uv transmittance uvt lamp power and flow rate on the uv dose distribution and the average dose in the uv reactor the water flow field was simulated using the standard k ε turbulence model and the uv radiation field was calculated using the do model the results showed that increasing the lamp power and water uvt and decreasing the flow rate led to an increasing trend in the received dose of particles also the radiation rate and the average dose increased exponentially by increasing uvt part of the uv light is wasted since it reaches the inner walls using materials that can prevent this loss of uv radiation is one way to improve the performance of the uv reactors the most common material used in the uv reactors is stainless steel 17 18 which reflects a small portion of the light being received researchers have begun studies about the use of highly reflective materials on surfaces of inner wall yang et al 19 showed that aluminum has a good reflectivity in the uv range navntoft et al 20 used an aluminum reflector to improve the solar disinfection efficiency li et al 21 investigated the effect of reflection of three different inner wall materials including aluminum foil stainless steel and black cloth on the radiation distribution in the uv reactor experiments showed that at wavelength of 254 nm the reflection coefficients of aluminum foil and stainless steel were 80 5 and 26 1 respectively polishing the inner wall is common in the most uv reactor manufacturing processes however li et al 21 showed that the inner wall with a rough surface that enhances more diffuse reflection could lead to a better uv dose distribution in the uv reactor li et al 22 investigated the effect of inner walls reflection on the performance of uv single lamp reactors relying on the role of diffuse reflection the radiation field inside the reactor was calculated using the do calibrated model using highly and lowly reflective walls the results of this study showed that uv reactors with a highly reflective wall have a higher radiation rate and reduction equivalent dose red than those with the lowly reflective walls in addition an increase in red was observed by increasing the diffuse reflection in this paper the effectiveness of the materials of the reactor inner walls is evaluated by focusing on the role of uv reflection from inner walls to enhance the performance of the multi lamp uv reactor to achieve a higher accuracy turbulence model the flow field prediction is performed using four turbulence models including standard k ε realizable k ε standard k ω and sst k ω using the do model the uv radiation field is calculated for the reactor inner walls with two different materials including stainless steel and aluminum the effectiveness level of wall material change on the reactor performance is examined by changing parameters such as uvt flow rate lamp power and different modes of lamps being on in addition the effect of the reflection type specular or diffuse is studied on the radiation field and the log inactivation 2 governing equations the velocity field in the uv reactor is obtained by solving the three dimensional continuum and navier stokes equations 23 24 the fluid is assumed isothermal incompressible and newtonian with constant physical properties 25 26 and the steady state conditions are considered to solve the flow field 27 thus the continuum and navier stokes equations can be described as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t u i x j where u i and u j are the velocity component xi and xj are the coordinate component p is the pressure ρ is the water s density ν is the water s kinematic viscosity and νt is the turbulent eddy viscosity in this study reynolds numbers are in the range of 2800 28 000 leading to turbulent flow the standard k ε realizable k ε standard k ω and sst k ω models are used to simulate the turbulent flow 28 according to previous studies the trajectory of the particles is modeled by the lagrangian framework 27 29 30 the particle volume ratio is much smaller than one therefore the effect of particles on each other and on the flow field can be ignored and the flow is said to be one way coupled 31 thus the particle trajectories are computed based on a steady or transient continuous phase flow field in this study the simulation of flow field is performed in the steady and transient conditions which showed similar results furthermore the reference geometry of this paper has been used in the studies of sobhani et al 27 and wols 32 who considered the steady conditions to solve the flow field of the uv reactor therefore the particle trajectories are calculated using the results of steady flow field the lagrangian framework solves the particle trajectories transiently equation of particle momentum requires the carrier phase instantaneous velocity which is the sum of the mean and fluctuating components the mean velocity can be solved using the reynolds averaged continuity and navier stokes equations the fluctuating velocity component is determined by the discrete random walk drw model velocity and trajectory of each particle can be obtained by considering the balance of forces on each particle in eq 3 17 3 m p d u p d t f i where mp is the particle mass up is the velocity vector of the particle fi is the force applied to each particle and t is the time variable in study of wols 32 the uv dose distributions are determined by lagrangian actinometry experiments where fluorescent microspheres are added to the water by a 1 μm filter and the uv doses received by microspheres are measured bacteriophage ms2 is extensively used as the target microorganism in the study of uv disinfection reactors and the diameter of ms2 is assumed 1 μm in the numerical simulations 16 33 34 ducoste et al 35 showed that the disinfection predicted by numerical simulation is not sensitive to the diameter of the particles in addition according to xu et al 15 particle to particle and particle to fluid interaction are not affected by the diameter changes 0 5 μm up to 10 μm and the shape of microorganism particles consequently the uv dose received by the particles would not significantly change therefore all microorganism particles with spherical shape and with a diameter of 1 μm are injected into the reactor inlet drag gravity and buoyancy forces are the forces applied to particles because the density of microorganism particles and the density of water are approximately equal the virtual mass and pressure gradient forces cannot be ignored 17 31 36 37 since the temperature gradient caused by the low pressure uv lamps is low thermophoresis force is also neglected 17 the final equation of balance of forces is written as eq 4 4 d u p d t ρ p ρ ρ p g 18 μ ρ p d p 2 c d r e 24 u u p 3 ρ π ρ p 2 d p 3 d d t u u p 6 ρ π ρ p 2 d p 3 u p u where u is the fluid velocity μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity ρ is the fluid density ρp is the particle density dp is the particle diameter re is the relative reynolds number and cd is the drag coefficient for spherical particles re and cd are calculated according to eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 r e ρ d p u u p μ 6 c d c 1 c 2 r e c 3 r e 2 c1 c2 and c3 are constant values that can be extracted from the work of morsi and alexander 36 based on the previous studies in this field the do model is used for radiation field calculations 17 38 39 in this model the radiation transfer equation rte is solved at each control volume for a finite number of spatial angles for non gray radiation 27 in this study a low pressure lamp is considered the low pressure uv lamp emits a single wavelength of approximately 254 nm 40 41 in fact microorganisms have the peak absorption of uv radiation at this wavelength 42 uv emission is ignored because of the low water temperature about 20 c 43 the radiation transfer equation is simplified to the eq 7 by neglecting the radiation scattering of the suspended particle 44 7 i r s s a i r s 0 where i is the radiation intensity r is the position vector s is the direction vector and a is the absorption coefficient beer lambert states the relationship between uvt and the water absorption coefficient according to eq 8 30 8 u v t e a x x is the distance between two points in the media per centimeter when uv rays hit the wall of the reactor a part of them is reflected the reflection is done in both specular and diffuse ways according to eq 9 eqs 10 13 express the radiation boundary condition for the opaque inner walls 43 9 i r e f l e c t i o n f d i d i f f u s e 1 f d i s p e c u l a r 10 e n 2 ε w σ t w 4 11 r d f d 1 ε w q i n 12 r s 1 f d 1 ε w q i n 13 a ε w q i n where e is the emission energy from the wall surface n is the refractive index εw is the wall emissivity tw is the wall temperature rd is the diffusely reflected energy fd is the diffuse fraction qin is the total energy rs is the specularly reflected energy and a is the energy absorbed in the wall 45 in experiment of li et al 21 the stainless steel type 304 is mechanically polished that has a glossy and smooth surface and the aluminum foil has many wrinkles appearing on its surface the aluminum foil wall has a higher reflection coefficient and a better diffuse property than the stainless steel wall the results show that the reflection from these materials is neither absolute specular reflection nor absolute diffuse reflection the uv dose received for each particle is obtained by the time integral of the uv radiation intensity across the particle s path of motion according to eq 14 14 d 0 t i d t d is the particle dose i is the radiation intensity and t is the residence time of the particles the simplest disinfection model is the chick watson model obtained according to the experimental results 15 d n d t k μ c b n were n is the concentration of microorganisms b is the coefficient of dilution kμ is the inactivation rate and c is the disinfectant concentration in uv disinfection processes the uv intensity is used in the eq 15 instead of disinfectant concentration thus in the case of b 1 the chick watson inactivation kinetics is derived as 32 16 d n d t k μ i n dose response inactivation function is derived using eq 14 and the integration form of eq 16 17 n n 0 e k μ d where n0 is the initial concentration of microorganisms the uv dose range of particles is broken into infinitesimal subintervals and the frequency of each subinterval is achieved then the normalized concentration of surviving microorganisms is calculated as 46 18 n n 0 j 1 m f d j e d j where m is the subinterval number dj represents the dose of particles in the subinterval j and e dj is the particles number fraction that receive the dose dj in the subinterval j where 19 j 1 m e d j 1 the total inactivation is calculated by summation over all the particles thus the overall microbial inactivation is achieved by finding the particles dose distribution and applying eq 14 13 20 n n 0 0 f d e d d d n n0 denotes the normalized concentration of surviving microorganisms n is the number of surviving microorganisms at time t n0 is the number of surviving microorganisms at initial time f d is the dose response inactivation function and e d is the particles number fraction that receive the dose d in uv disinfection experiments irradiation intensity is maintained at a specified level and the desired uv doses light intensity exposure time are kept within a definite range which are obtained by changing exposure time the level of microbial inactivation results from collimated beam experiments at each uv dose then data analysis is performed using the inactivation curves the selection of the collimated beam dose response inactivation function would be based on a linear fitting analysis 47 48 the inactivation function of the dose response varies according to the type of microorganism in this study bacteriophage ms2 is considered as the target microorganism bacteriophage ms2 is an organismic model for human intestinal viruses this bacteriophage is widely used as an organismic index or organismic model for intestinal viruses and is more resistant to disinfection than other human pathogenic viruses 49 in this study a chick watson relationship is used to describe the ms2 phage log linear dose response kinetics and is shown in eq 21 13 46 21 n n 0 10 k 1 d k 2 the constants used are defined below 22 k 1 0 064 c m 2 m j s e c k 2 0 361 3 simulation procedure the geometric model used in this study is a cross flow uv reactor fig 1 the diameter of the reactor inflow pipe is 0 125 m and its length is 50 times its diameter to achieve a fully developed turbulent flow the outflow pipe has 0 125 m diameter and 1 m length a cylinder with a diameter of 0 3 m and a depth of 0 15 m is placed perpendicular to the direction of the flow four quartz tubes the uv lamp sleeve are inside the cylinder and the diameter of each quartz tubes is 0 0478 m the four lamps are marked as a b c and d the geometric model is meshed in a hybrid actually a structured mesh is used in the inflow and outflow pipes and an unstructured mesh is employed in the main part of the reactor due to the complexity of the geometry the boundary layer meshing scheme is applied in the region proximate to the walls such as the reactor walls and quartz sleeve the commercial package ansys fluent 17 2 is used to simulate the flow field radiation field and trajectory of microorganisms the first order upwind and second order upwind scheme are used to discrete for the convection terms in k ε models and k ω models respectively the simple algorithm is applied to combine velocity and pressure 50 the reactor inlet boundary condition is uniform velocity and the constant pressure boundary condition is set in the reactor outlet no slip condition is assumed for all walls 51 the normalized residuals less than 10 5 are the convergence criterion for continuity momentum and turbulence equations the do radiation model solves the rte for a finite number of discrete solid angles in this study the angular discretization and pixilation are set to 7 7 and 5 5 respectively the surface of each lamp is considered semi transparent and other surfaces such as uv reactor walls are considered opaque 52 the boundary condition at the surface of each lamp is obtained by dividing the lamp power on the external wall area of the lamp 53 the internal emissivity of the inner walls is set to 0 195 and 0 739 for aluminum wall and stainless steel wall respectively 21 a particle sensitivity analysis is performed on the dose distribution curve for three particle numbers of 1000 5000 and 10 000 investigations indicate that the results of 5000 and 10 000 particles are close to each other therefore 5000 particles are injected into the flow from the reactor inlet the particle wall and outlet boundary conditions are considered the reflection and the escape respectively the drw model is used to apply the turbulence effect on the particles 54 the particles received dose is computed using a trapezoidal integration of eq 14 15 for this purpose a user defined function udf code is compiled in fluent finally the log inactivation is calculated using the target microorganism inactivation kinetic model eq 21 4 results 4 1 mesh independency the lines 1 2 3 and 4 are located on the middle plane of the uv reactor fig 2 the mesh independency is investigated in four different mesh sizes including 160 000 320 000 618 000 and 1 280 000 computational cells results of the mesh independency for the axial and vertical velocities in four mesh sizes are shown on lines 3 and 4 fig 3 the differences of results between the mesh sizes of 618 000 and 1 280 000 are very small therefore 618 000 computational cells are selected as the optimal mesh size 4 2 turbulence models the lines 1 2 3 and 4 are located on the middle plane of the uv reactor fig 2 axial and vertical velocities dimensionless at an average velocity in the pipe are plotted on lines 1 3 and 4 the velocities calculated by turbulence models including standard k ε realizable k ε standard k ω and sst k ω are compared with the experimental and numerical data of wols 32 fig 4 accurate prediction of velocity between the quartz sleeves at this point is more important than other points since this area has a high flow velocity and most of the fluid passes through it in general present turbulence models offer a good prediction of the velocity field especially in high velocity regions however the standard k ω and sst k ω models predict the reversed flow located at range of 5 to 0 cm along line 3 and 0 5 cm along line 4 more precisely than the standard k ε and realizable k ε models vertical velocity in lines 3 and 4 indicates downward flow near the top wall and upward flow near the bottom wall especially at line 4 generally at line 4 the results of the standard k ω and sst k ω models achieve higher accuracy than the results of the standard k ε and realizable k ε models at range of 10 to 5 cm and 5 10 cm along line 1 axial and vertical velocities of the standard k ω and sst k ω models are better than the standard k ε and realizable k ε models and the present models predict the similar results at range of 5 to 5 cm along line 1 in table 1 the relative error values of the axial and vertical velocities of line 1 are calculated for the turbulence models used in the present study in fig 5 a and b the predicted dose distribution by the sst k ω turbulence model is compared with experimental and numerical results of wols 32 at water uvt of 87 7 and 78 5 the overall trend of the calculated dose distribution curves by the sst k ω model is similar to the experimental data and the numerical results of wols 32 deviation of the present numerical results from the lagrangian actinometry experimental data of wols 32 decreases favorably at uvt of 78 5 fig 5 a rather than uvt of 87 7 fig 5 b these results confirm the appropriate accuracy of the do model at low uvts the dose distribution curves indicate that a large number of microorganisms are located in the low dose range in fact these particles pass through the high velocity portion between the lamps overall the presence of fewer particles at a high dose range expresses that the particles are trapped in the wake regions of the flow field the present model is able to come closer to the experimental results in the high doses which illustrates the ability to predict the wake regions in the sst k ω model fig 6 shows the velocity field calculated using the sst k ω model at a flow rate of 5 m3 h the high velocity flow is seen in the space between the lamps and the low velocity region is observed in the top and bottom reactor and the wake area behind the lamps in fig 7 the received dose of 25 microorganisms is randomly displayed as shown most of the microorganisms pass through the high velocity region thus a lower dose is received in addition fewer particles succeed to receive the maximum dose by crossing longer paths 4 3 effect of reflection type diffuse and specular fig 8 shows the uv radiation field along line 2 for different diffuse fractions and two wall materials at two uvts the diffuse fraction of 0 0 5 and 1 represent the pure specular reflection a combination of specular diffuse reflection and the pure diffuse reflection respectively by changing the wall material from stainless steel to aluminum increasing the diffuse fraction leads to the increase of radiation near the walls however the effect of the diffuse fraction at uvt of 78 is negligible the effect of the diffuse fraction is well observed near the walls due to the higher radiation reaching the wall at higher uvt 98 as shown in the figure the radiation field is not considered at the intersection of line 2 and lamps as shown in fig 9 a and b the effect of reflection type is examined on the log inactivation values the results are obtained at uvt of 98 and 78 for stainless steel and aluminum inner walls under different diffuse fractions increasing the diffuse fraction does not change the log inactivation values at different uvts despite changing the inner walls of the reactor from stainless steel to aluminum generally the increase in diffuse fraction results in more radiation intensity and consequently an increase in the reactor performance however the performance of the studied multi lamp reactor is not increased even at higher uvts since an increase of the radiation intensity occurs in a small region and far from the center of the flow a much smaller portion of the flow succeeds to pass this region therefore increasing the diffuse fraction could not help to increase the reactor efficiency 4 4 impact of active lamps arrangement on reflection behavior in this section 15 different modes of active lamps are studied to assess the effect of highly reflective material on the multi lamp reactor performance comprehensively these modes are grouped into one two three and four groups of active lamps in fact the different modes of active lamps have different radiation fields and a similar flow field fig 10 indicates the uv reactor performance in different modes of active lamps considering a constant total reactor power 32 w in each group of active lamps power is allocated to each lamp so that the total reactor power remains at 32 w in each mode in fig 10 the reactor performance increases about 37 92 by changing the inner surfaces of the reactor from stainless steel to aluminum as shown in the figure the best performance of the reactor is obtained in the mode bc lamp b and c are active in fact in addition to saving the number of required lamps the mode bc two 16 w lamps has the ability to enhance the performance of about 25 relative to the mode abcd four 8 w lamps the reason is that the water flow carrying the microorganisms passes mainly through the position of lamps b and c indicating the major influence of the lamps arrangement design in the uv reactor the weakest disinfection reactor performance in the one lamp group occurs for lamp d or a expression of relative log inactivation increment rli is proposed for the simpler description of results and it is defined as the increase of log inactivation by changing the inner wall material from stainless steel wall to aluminum wall divided by log inactivation value with stainless steel wall rli is shown in eq 23 23 r l i l o g i n a c t i v a t i o n a l l o g i n a c t i v a t i o n s t l o g i n a c t i v a t i o n s t rli is significant in the lamps d rli of 92 and a rli of 87 since these lamps have a shorter distance to the reactor inner wall in comparison to other lamps the effect of lamp distance to the inner wall on reflection behavior needs to be further studied fig 11 shows the radiation field on the reactor middle plane at uvt of 98 as shown clearly the change of wall material from stainless steel fig 11 a to aluminum fig 11 b creates a more homogeneous space of radiation field within the reactor in addition at the aluminum wall of the reactor the maximum amount of radiation intensity between the lamps is increased which increases the dose received by microorganisms 4 5 effect of uvt on reflection performance fig 12 illustrates the dose distribution curve of the microorganisms at uvts of 98 and 78 for mode b and two different reflectivities the amount of uvt is affected by the presence of organic matter colloidal solids and other substances present in the water the lower amount of uvt decreases the penetration ability of uv radiation thereby decreasing the dose received by the microorganisms hence the minimum dose and the peak of the dose distribution curve were in the lower range at uvt of 78 than the same curve at 98 uvt the peak of the dose distribution curve shifts toward a high dose by changing the inner wall from stainless steel to aluminum at uvt of 98 however increasing the reflectivity does not change this curve at 78 uvt the reason is that most of uv radiation is absorbed by the suspended particles thereby a small proportion of the radiation reaches the inner wall to reflect it fig 13 shows the log inactivation values of bacteriophage ms2 at uvt of 98 the power of each lamp is considered 8 w to investigate the effect of highly reflective material on disinfection performance the materials of the inner wall are considered stainless steel 26 1 is wall reflectivity and aluminum 80 5 is wall reflectivity the highest log inactivation value in different modes with the stainless steel wall can be seen in the group of the four active lamps when the three lamps in the uv reactor are active the maximum log inactivation value belongs to mode abc in different modes of the group of 2 lamps being on the highest log inactivation values relate to bc mode and when 1 lamp is on the log inactivation values in mode b are maximum the maximum log inactivation value in each group of active lamps illustrates the prominent role of lamp b in the water disinfection process the uv reactor power in the mode bc two lamp group and modes abd and acd three lamp group are 16 w and 24 w respectively however the log inactivation in bc mode is more than modes abd and acd which still illustrates the effective role of the lamp b and c as shown clearly in each mode of active lamp increasing the wall reflectivity leads to an increase in the log inactivation values the rli differs by increasing reflectivity in each mode in the one lamp group the rli for lamps a b c and d is about 83 50 41 75 and respectively as shown as the lamp distance from the wall decreases the rli increases with increasing reflectivity altogether the use of highly reflective materials for the reactor inner walls at high uvts reduces the energy consumption and the cost of providing uv lamps for example the log inactivation of mode abc with aluminum wall is greater than mode abcd with stainless steel wall while the total reactor power in mode abc is 24 w and in the mode abcd is 32 w fig 14 shows the reactor performance at uvt of 78 in the different modes of active lamps with the two different materials of the reactor wall the log inactivation values significantly reduced at uvt of 78 in addition there is not a significant change in the log inactivation values with increasing reflectivity in other words the effect of increasing wall reflection on the disinfection process is practically insignificant at uvt of 78 at this uvt it is seen that the importance degree of each lamp follows a pattern similar to the different modes of active lamps at the uvt of 98 the stainless steel wall 4 6 effect of flow rate on reflection performance fig 15 shows the residence time distribution of the particles at different flow rates the peak of the residence time distribution curve shifts toward a high residence time with the flow rate reduction a narrower residence time distribution curve is indicative of more particles with a similar residence time becoming narrower with increasing the flow rate in fig 16 a only lamp d and in fig 16 b only lamp b is active in each figure the log inactivation values versus reflectivity are shown at several flow rates with a uvt of 98 increasing the reflectivity of the inner walls leads to an ascending trend of log inactivation values the microorganisms have more time to receive reflected beams from the wall by increasing the residence time at a low flow rate consequently the rli increases by decreasing the flow rate therefore the percentage of rli at the flow rate of 1 m3 h is 87 and 63 for lamp d and b respectively therefore applying highly reflective materials on the reactor inner walls is suggested at the low flow rates 4 7 effect of lamp power on reflection performance fig 17 shows the log inactivation values versus reflectivity with different lamp powers at uvt of 98 as shown in fig 17 a the log inactivation values increase with the increase of reflectivity and lamp power for mode d in addition the increase of lamp power leads to the increase of rli highlighting the importance of applying the highly reflective materials in the uv reactors as shown in fig 17 b the results of mode b follows the similar procedure with the results of the mode d however the mode b has higher log inactivation values due to the hydrodynamics position of lamp b in addition the slope of mode b curve is higher than lamp d by applying aluminum the rli with increasing lamp power is greater in the mode d 80 87 than in the mode b 50 58 which emanates from the position of each lamp to the inner wall in fact a shorter distance from the wall and more collision from the uv beam to the wall result in a high rli in mode d as a result the effect of reflection at high powers is sensible and cannot be ignored 5 conclusion increasing the reflection of the reactor inner walls is one way to improve the performance of uv reactors which is achieved by applying materials with high reflectivity on the inner surfaces the simulation of the flow field using four turbulence models shows that the sst k ω model achieved higher accuracy for velocity prediction the importance degree of each lamp in the disinfection process is investigated based on lamp position the lamp located at the reactor s central region and the lamp close to the reactor s wall are identified as the most effective and the least effective in water disinfection respectively the rli for lamps with shorter distance from the inner wall is seen about 87 92 by changing the wall material from stainless steel to aluminum at constant reactor power at high uvt highly reflective materials on the inner walls help to increase the reactor efficiency so that the rli is 36 83 for different modes of active lamps at uvt of 98 the rli increases by increasing the lamp power the effect of reflection on disinfection reactor performance should be taken into account as the lamp power increases after using aluminum the rli is 46 63 by decreasing the flow rate from 10 to 1 m3 h for the one active lamp placed in reactor central region therefore the application of highly reflective materials on the inner wall is essential at low flow rates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
14025,the use of materials with high reflectivity on the surfaces of inner walls plays a significant role in enhancing the performance of ultraviolet uv reactors in this study the reactor efficiency is evaluated by changing the materials of the inner wall surfaces of the multi lamp reactor from stainless steel to aluminum the effect of water uv transmittance flow rate lamp power and different modes of active lamps is studied on the effectiveness of inner wall reflection four turbulence models including standard k ε realizable k ε standard k ω and sst k ω are used for the simulation of the flow field in a cross flow uv reactor the discrete ordinates model is applied to calculate the uv radiation field the prediction of the velocity field showed that the sst k ω model fits better with the experimental data the results showed that if the inner wall is made of aluminum the effect of reflection on the reactor performance increases with increasing uv transmittance and lamp power and decreasing flow rate investigations on lamp position showed that the effect of reflectivity becomes more apparent by reducing the lamp distance from the inner wall therefore the reactor performance

century 1 chlorine is the most common disinfectant in the water treatment industry and because of the strong oxidizing effect it has the ability to cope with many microorganisms 2 3 however the production of toxic and harmful byproducts such as trihalomethanes in chlorination has triggered the tendency to use other reliable methods 4 6 ultraviolet uv disinfection is not only an effective and safe way to inactivate resistant pathogens but also a method without producing chemicals in the water disinfection process 7 9 uv disinfection is more expensive than common disinfection methods therefore in the past two decades researchers have devoted much effort for simulating and optimizing disinfection uv reactors 10 simulation of the two phase flow field and uv radiation field are two essential steps in investigating the performance of water disinfection uv reactors simulation of the flow field in uv reactors using the three turbulence models by sozzi and taghipour 11 showed that the realizable k ε model shows the best conformity with the experimental data also sozzi and taghipour 12 by examining both eulerian and lagrangian approaches on the particulate flow concluded that at high flow rates the results of the two approaches are very close to each other and there is a relatively small difference in low flow rates between eulerian and lagrangian approaches liu et al 13 predicted the flow field in a cross flow uv reactor using six turbulence models they reported that the obtained results using standard k ω and sst k ω models in the wake region were in a good agreement with empirical measurements in addition the sst k ω model was much more successful in calculating the outside of the wake region compared to the standard k ω model concluding that the selected turbulence model dramatically affected the dose distribution curve in the field of radiation calculations ho 14 considered the reflection and refraction of the quartz walls and the effect of reflection from the uv reactor inner surfaces results showed that the radiation distribution obtained by discrete ordinates do model was able to estimate the experimental data successfully xu et al 15 evaluated the effect of multiple parameters on the disinfection process of the uv reactors using the realizable k ε turbulence model they observed that the size and shape of microorganism particles did not have a significant impact on the particles dose distribution curve following this work xu et al 16 investigated the effect of lamp arrangement on the radiation field and the log inactivation of several uv reactors versus flow rates results revealed that a more uniform radiation field distribution achieved but the reactor performance was not improved further with the increase in the lamp number li et al 17 studied the effect of water uv transmittance uvt lamp power and flow rate on the uv dose distribution and the average dose in the uv reactor the water flow field was simulated using the standard k ε turbulence model and the uv radiation field was calculated using the do model the results showed that increasing the lamp power and water uvt and decreasing the flow rate led to an increasing trend in the received dose of particles also the radiation rate and the average dose increased exponentially by increasing uvt part of the uv light is wasted since it reaches the inner walls using materials that can prevent this loss of uv radiation is one way to improve the performance of the uv reactors the most common material used in the uv reactors is stainless steel 17 18 which reflects a small portion of the light being received researchers have begun studies about the use of highly reflective materials on surfaces of inner wall yang et al 19 showed that aluminum has a good reflectivity in the uv range navntoft et al 20 used an aluminum reflector to improve the solar disinfection efficiency li et al 21 investigated the effect of reflection of three different inner wall materials including aluminum foil stainless steel and black cloth on the radiation distribution in the uv reactor experiments showed that at wavelength of 254 nm the reflection coefficients of aluminum foil and stainless steel were 80 5 and 26 1 respectively polishing the inner wall is common in the most uv reactor manufacturing processes however li et al 21 showed that the inner wall with a rough surface that enhances more diffuse reflection could lead to a better uv dose distribution in the uv reactor li et al 22 investigated the effect of inner walls reflection on the performance of uv single lamp reactors relying on the role of diffuse reflection the radiation field inside the reactor was calculated using the do calibrated model using highly and lowly reflective walls the results of this study showed that uv reactors with a highly reflective wall have a higher radiation rate and reduction equivalent dose red than those with the lowly reflective walls in addition an increase in red was observed by increasing the diffuse reflection in this paper the effectiveness of the materials of the reactor inner walls is evaluated by focusing on the role of uv reflection from inner walls to enhance the performance of the multi lamp uv reactor to achieve a higher accuracy turbulence model the flow field prediction is performed using four turbulence models including standard k ε realizable k ε standard k ω and sst k ω using the do model the uv radiation field is calculated for the reactor inner walls with two different materials including stainless steel and aluminum the effectiveness level of wall material change on the reactor performance is examined by changing parameters such as uvt flow rate lamp power and different modes of lamps being on in addition the effect of the reflection type specular or diffuse is studied on the radiation field and the log inactivation 2 governing equations the velocity field in the uv reactor is obtained by solving the three dimensional continuum and navier stokes equations 23 24 the fluid is assumed isothermal incompressible and newtonian with constant physical properties 25 26 and the steady state conditions are considered to solve the flow field 27 thus the continuum and navier stokes equations can be described as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t u i x j where u i and u j are the velocity component xi and xj are the coordinate component p is the pressure ρ is the water s density ν is the water s kinematic viscosity and νt is the turbulent eddy viscosity in this study reynolds numbers are in the range of 2800 28 000 leading to turbulent flow the standard k ε realizable k ε standard k ω and sst k ω models are used to simulate the turbulent flow 28 according to previous studies the trajectory of the particles is modeled by the lagrangian framework 27 29 30 the particle volume ratio is much smaller than one therefore the effect of particles on each other and on the flow field can be ignored and the flow is said to be one way coupled 31 thus the particle trajectories are computed based on a steady or transient continuous phase flow field in this study the simulation of flow field is performed in the steady and transient conditions which showed similar results furthermore the reference geometry of this paper has been used in the studies of sobhani et al 27 and wols 32 who considered the steady conditions to solve the flow field of the uv reactor therefore the particle trajectories are calculated using the results of steady flow field the lagrangian framework solves the particle trajectories transiently equation of particle momentum requires the carrier phase instantaneous velocity which is the sum of the mean and fluctuating components the mean velocity can be solved using the reynolds averaged continuity and navier stokes equations the fluctuating velocity component is determined by the discrete random walk drw model velocity and trajectory of each particle can be obtained by considering the balance of forces on each particle in eq 3 17 3 m p d u p d t f i where mp is the particle mass up is the velocity vector of the particle fi is the force applied to each particle and t is the time variable in study of wols 32 the uv dose distributions are determined by lagrangian actinometry experiments where fluorescent microspheres are added to the water by a 1 μm filter and the uv doses received by microspheres are measured bacteriophage ms2 is extensively used as the target microorganism in the study of uv disinfection reactors and the diameter of ms2 is assumed 1 μm in the numerical simulations 16 33 34 ducoste et al 35 showed that the disinfection predicted by numerical simulation is not sensitive to the diameter of the particles in addition according to xu et al 15 particle to particle and particle to fluid interaction are not affected by the diameter changes 0 5 μm up to 10 μm and the shape of microorganism particles consequently the uv dose received by the particles would not significantly change therefore all microorganism particles with spherical shape and with a diameter of 1 μm are injected into the reactor inlet drag gravity and buoyancy forces are the forces applied to particles because the density of microorganism particles and the density of water are approximately equal the virtual mass and pressure gradient forces cannot be ignored 17 31 36 37 since the temperature gradient caused by the low pressure uv lamps is low thermophoresis force is also neglected 17 the final equation of balance of forces is written as eq 4 4 d u p d t ρ p ρ ρ p g 18 μ ρ p d p 2 c d r e 24 u u p 3 ρ π ρ p 2 d p 3 d d t u u p 6 ρ π ρ p 2 d p 3 u p u where u is the fluid velocity μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity ρ

to eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 r e ρ d p u u p μ 6 c d c 1 c 2 r e c 3 r e 2 c1 c2 and c3 are constant values that can be extracted from the work of morsi and alexander 36 based on the previous studies in this field the do model is used for radiation field calculations 17 38 39 in this model the radiation transfer equation rte is solved at each control volume for a finite number of spatial angles for non gray radiation 27 in this study a low pressure lamp is considered the low pressure uv lamp emits a single wavelength of approximately 254 nm 40 41 in fact microorganisms have the peak absorption of uv radiation at this wavelength 42 uv emission is ignored because of the low water temperature about 20 c 43 the radiation transfer equation is simplified to the eq 7 by neglecting the radiation scattering of the suspended particle 44 7 i r s s a i r s 0 where i is the radiation intensity r is the position vector s is the direction vector and a is the absorption coefficient beer lambert states the relationship between uvt and the water absorption coefficient according to eq 8 30 8 u v t e a x x is the distance between two points in the media per centimeter when uv rays hit the wall of the reactor a part of them is reflected the reflection is done in both specular and diffuse ways according to eq 9 eqs 10 13 express the radiation boundary condition for the opaque inner walls 43 9 i r e f l e c t i o n f d i d i f f u s e 1 f d i s p e c u l a r 10 e n 2 ε w σ t w 4 11 r d f d 1 ε w q i n 12 r s 1 f d 1 ε w q i n 13 a ε w q i n where e is the emission energy from the wall surface n is the refractive index εw is the wall emissivity tw is the wall temperature rd is the diffusely reflected energy fd is the diffuse fraction qin is the total energy rs is the specularly reflected energy and a is the energy absorbed in the wall 45 in experiment of li et al 21 the stainless steel type 304 is mechanically polished that has a glossy and smooth surface and the aluminum foil has many wrinkles appearing on its surface the aluminum foil wall has a higher reflection coefficient and a better diffuse property than the stainless steel wall the results show that the reflection from these materials is neither absolute specular reflection nor absolute diffuse reflection the uv dose received for each particle is obtained by the time integral of the uv radiation intensity across the particle s path of motion according to eq 14 14 d 0 t i d t d is the particle dose i is the radiation intensity and t is the residence time of the particles the simplest disinfection model is the chick watson model obtained according to the experimental results 15 d n d t k μ c b n were n is the concentration of microorganisms b is the coefficient of dilution kμ is the inactivation rate and c is the disinfectant concentration in uv disinfection processes the uv intensity is used in the eq 15 instead of disinfectant concentration thus in the case of b 1 the chick watson inactivation kinetics is derived as 32 16 d n d t k μ i n dose response inactivation function is derived using eq 14 and the integration form of eq 16 17 n n 0 e k μ d where n0 is the initial concentration of microorganisms the uv dose range of particles is broken into infinitesimal subintervals and the frequency of each subinterval is achieved then the normalized concentration of surviving microorganisms is calculated as 46 18 n n 0 j 1 m f d j e d j where m is the subinterval number dj represents the dose of particles in the subinterval j and e dj is the particles number fraction that receive the dose dj in the subinterval j where 19 j 1 m e d j 1 the total inactivation is calculated by summation over all the particles thus the overall microbial inactivation is achieved by finding the particles dose distribution and applying eq 14 13 20 n n 0 0 f d e d d d n n0 denotes the normalized concentration of surviving microorganisms n is the number of surviving microorganisms at time t n0 is the number of surviving microorganisms at initial time f d is the dose response inactivation function and e d is the particles number fraction that receive the dose d in uv disinfection experiments irradiation intensity is maintained at a specified level and the desired uv doses light intensity exposure time are kept within a definite range which are obtained by changing exposure time the level of microbial inactivation results from collimated beam experiments at each uv dose then data analysis is performed using the inactivation curves the selection of the collimated beam dose response inactivation function would be based on a linear fitting analysis 47 48 the inactivation function of the dose response varies according to the type of microorganism in this study bacteriophage ms2 is considered as the target microorganism bacteriophage ms2 is an organismic model for human intestinal viruses this bacteriophage is widely used as an organismic index or organismic model for intestinal viruses and is more resistant to disinfection than other human pathogenic viruses 49 in this study a chick watson relationship is used to describe the ms2 phage log linear dose response kinetics and is shown in eq 21 13 46 21 n n 0 10 k 1 d k 2 the constants used are defined below 22 k 1 0 064 c m 2 m j s e c k 2 0 361 3 simulation procedure the geometric model used in this study is a cross flow uv reactor fig 1 the diameter of the reactor inflow pipe is 0 125 m and its length is 50 times its diameter to achieve a fully developed turbulent flow the outflow pipe has 0 125 m diameter and 1 m length a cylinder with a diameter of 0 3 m and a depth of 0 15 m is placed perpendicular to the direction of the flow four quartz tubes the uv lamp sleeve are inside the cylinder and the diameter of each quartz tubes is 0 0478 m the four lamps are marked as a b c and d the geometric model is meshed in a hybrid actually a structured mesh is used in the inflow and outflow pipes and an unstructured mesh is employed in the main part of the reactor due to the complexity of the geometry the boundary layer meshing scheme is applied in the region proximate to the walls such as the reactor walls and quartz sleeve the commercial package ansys fluent 17 2 is used to simulate the flow field radiation field and trajectory of microorganisms the first order upwind and second order upwind scheme are used to discrete for the convection terms in k ε models and k ω models respectively the simple algorithm is applied to combine velocity and pressure 50 the reactor inlet boundary condition is uniform velocity and the constant pressure boundary condition is set in the reactor outlet no slip condition is assumed for all walls 51 the normalized residuals less than 10 5 are the convergence criterion for continuity momentum and turbulence equations the do radiation model solves the rte for a finite number of discrete solid angles in this study the angular discretization and pixilation are set to 7 7 and 5 5 respectively the surface of each lamp is considered semi transparent and other surfaces such as uv reactor walls are considered opaque 52 the boundary condition at the surface of each lamp is obtained by dividing the lamp power on the external wall area of the lamp 53 the internal emissivity of the inner walls is set to 0 195 and 0 739 for aluminum wall and stainless steel wall respectively 21 a particle sensitivity analysis is performed on the dose distribution curve for three particle numbers of 1000 5000 and 10 000 investigations indicate that the results of 5000 and 10 000 particles are close to each other therefore 5000 particles are injected into the flow from the reactor inlet the particle wall and outlet boundary conditions are considered the reflection and the escape respectively the drw model is used to apply the turbulence effect on the particles 54 the particles received dose is computed using a trapezoidal integration of eq 14 15 for this purpose a user defined function udf code is compiled in fluent finally the log inactivation is calculated using the target microorganism inactivation kinetic model eq 21 4 results 4 1 mesh independency the lines 1 2 3 and 4 are located on the middle plane of the uv reactor fig 2 the mesh independency is investigated in four different mesh sizes including 160 000 320 000 618 000 and 1 280 000 computational cells results of the mesh independency for the axial and vertical velocities in four mesh sizes are shown on lines 3 and 4 fig 3 the differences of results between the mesh sizes of 618 000 and 1 280 000 are very small therefore 618 000 computational cells are selected as the optimal mesh size 4 2 turbulence models the lines 1 2 3 and 4 are located on the middle plane of the uv reactor fig 2 axial and vertical velocities dimensionless at an average velocity in the pipe are plotted on lines 1 3 and 4 the velocities calculated by turbulence models including standard k ε realizable k ε standard k ω and sst k ω are compared with the experimental and numerical data of wols 32 fig 4 accurate prediction of velocity between the quartz sleeves at this point is more important than other points since this area has a high flow velocity and most of the fluid passes through it in general present turbulence models offer a good prediction of the velocity field especially in high velocity regions however the standard k ω and sst k ω models predict the reversed flow located at range of 5 to 0 cm along line 3 and 0 5 cm along line 4 more precisely than the standard k ε and realizable k ε models vertical velocity in lines 3 and 4 indicates downward flow near the top wall and upward flow near the bottom wall especially at line 4 generally at line 4 the results of the standard k ω and sst k ω models achieve higher accuracy than the results of the standard k ε and realizable k ε models at range of 10 to 5 cm and 5 10 cm along line 1 axial and vertical velocities of the standard k ω and sst k ω models are better than the standard k ε and realizable k ε models and the present models predict the similar results at range of 5 to 5 cm along line 1 in table 1 the relative error values of the axial and vertical velocities of line 1 are calculated for the turbulence models used in the present study in fig 5 a and b the predicted dose distribution by the sst k ω turbulence model is compared with experimental and numerical results of wols 32 at water uvt of 87 7 and 78 5 the overall trend of the calculated dose distribution curves by the sst k ω model is similar to the experimental data and the numerical results of wols 32 deviation of the present numerical results from the lagrangian actinometry experimental data of wols 32 decreases favorably at uvt of 78 5 fig 5 a rather than uvt of 87 7 fig 5 b these results confirm the appropriate accuracy of the do model at low uvts the dose distribution curves indicate that a large number of microorganisms are located in the low dose range in fact these particles pass through the high velocity portion between the lamps overall the presence of fewer particles at a high dose range expresses that the particles are trapped in the wake regions of the flow field the present model is able to come closer to the experimental results in the high doses which illustrates the ability to predict the wake regions in the sst k ω model fig 6 shows the velocity field calculated using the sst k ω model at a flow rate of 5 m3 h the high velocity flow is seen in the space between the lamps and the low velocity region is observed in the top and bottom reactor and the wake area behind the lamps in fig 7 the received dose of 25 microorganisms is randomly displayed as shown most of the microorganisms pass through the high velocity region thus a lower dose is received in addition fewer particles succeed to receive the maximum dose by crossing longer paths 4 3 effect of reflection type diffuse and specular fig 8 shows the uv radiation field along line 2 for different diffuse fractions and two wall materials at two uvts the diffuse fraction of 0 0 5 and 1 represent the pure specular reflection a combination of specular diffuse reflection and the pure diffuse reflection respectively by changing the wall material from stainless steel to aluminum increasing the diffuse fraction leads to the increase of radiation near the walls however the effect of the diffuse fraction at uvt of 78 is negligible the effect of the diffuse fraction is well observed near the walls due to the higher radiation reaching the wall at higher uvt 98 as shown in the figure the radiation field is not considered at the intersection of line 2 and lamps as shown in fig 9 a and b the effect of reflection type is examined on the log inactivation values the results are obtained at uvt of 98 and 78 for stainless steel and aluminum inner walls under different diffuse fractions increasing the diffuse fraction does not change the log inactivation values at different uvts despite changing the inner walls of the reactor from stainless steel to aluminum generally the increase in diffuse fraction results in more radiation intensity and consequently an increase in the reactor performance however the performance of the studied multi lamp reactor is not increased even at higher uvts since an increase of the radiation intensity occurs in a small region and far from the center of the flow a much smaller portion of the flow succeeds to pass this region therefore increasing the diffuse fraction could not help to increase the reactor efficiency 4 4 impact of active lamps arrangement on reflection behavior in this section 15 different modes of active lamps are studied to assess the effect of highly reflective material on the multi lamp reactor performance comprehensively these modes are grouped into one two three and four groups of active lamps in fact the different modes of active lamps have different radiation fields and a similar flow field fig 10 indicates the uv reactor performance in different modes of active lamps considering a constant total reactor power 32 w in each group of active lamps power is allocated to each lamp so that the total reactor power remains at 32 w in each mode in fig 10 the reactor performance increases about 37 92 by changing the inner surfaces of the reactor from stainless steel to aluminum as shown in the figure the best performance of the reactor is obtained in the mode bc lamp b and c are active in fact in addition to saving the number of required lamps the mode bc two 16 w lamps has the ability to enhance the performance of about 25 relative to the mode abcd four 8 w lamps the reason is that the water flow carrying the microorganisms passes mainly through the position of lamps b and c indicating the major influence of the lamps arrangement design in the uv reactor the weakest disinfection reactor performance in the one lamp group occurs for lamp d or a expression of relative log inactivation increment rli is proposed for the simpler description of results and it is defined as the increase of log inactivation by changing the inner wall material from stainless steel wall to aluminum wall divided by log inactivation value with stainless steel wall rli is shown in eq 23 23 r l i l o g i n a c t i v a t i o n a l l o g i n a c t i v a t i o n s t l o g i n a c t i v a t i o n s t rli is significant in the lamps d rli of 92 and a rli of 87 since these lamps have a shorter distance to the reactor inner wall in comparison to other lamps the effect of lamp distance to the inner wall on reflection behavior needs to be further studied fig 11 shows the radiation field on the reactor middle plane at uvt of 98 as shown clearly the change of wall material from stainless steel fig 11 a to aluminum fig 11 b creates a more homogeneous space of radiation field within the reactor in addition at the aluminum wall of the reactor the maximum amount of radiation intensity between the lamps is increased which increases the dose received by microorganisms 4 5 effect of uvt on reflection performance fig 12 illustrates the dose distribution curve of the microorganisms at uvts of 98 and 78 for mode b and two different reflectivities the amount of uvt is affected by the presence of organic matter colloidal solids and other substances present in the water the lower amount of uvt decreases the penetration ability of uv radiation thereby decreasing the dose received by the microorganisms hence the minimum dose and the peak of the dose distribution curve were in the lower range at uvt of 78 than the same curve at 98 uvt the peak of the dose distribution curve shifts toward a high dose by changing the inner wall from stainless steel to aluminum at uvt of 98 however increasing the reflectivity does not change this curve at 78 uvt the reason is that most of uv radiation is absorbed by the suspended particles thereby a small proportion of the radiation reaches the inner wall to reflect it fig 13 shows the log inactivation values of bacteriophage ms2 at uvt of 98 the power of each lamp is considered 8 w to investigate the effect of highly reflective material on disinfection performance the materials of the inner wall are considered stainless steel 26 1 is wall reflectivity and aluminum 80 5 is wall reflectivity the highest log inactivation value in different modes with the stainless steel wall can be seen in the group of the four active lamps when the three lamps in the uv reactor are active the maximum log inactivation value belongs to mode abc in different modes of the group of 2 lamps being on the highest log inactivation values relate to bc mode and when 1 lamp is on the log inactivation values in mode b are maximum the maximum log inactivation value in each group of active lamps illustrates the prominent role of lamp b in the water disinfection process the uv reactor power in the mode bc two lamp group and modes abd and acd three lamp group are 16 w and 24 w respectively however the log inactivation in bc mode is more than modes abd and acd which still illustrates the effective role of the lamp b and c as shown clearly in each mode of active lamp increasing the wall reflectivity leads to an increase in the log inactivation values the rli differs by increasing reflectivity in each mode in the one lamp group the rli for lamps a b c and d is about 83 50 41 75 and respectively as shown as the lamp distance from the wall decreases the rli increases with increasing reflectivity altogether the use of highly reflective materials for the reactor inner walls at high uvts reduces the energy consumption and the cost of providing uv lamps for example the log inactivation of mode abc with aluminum wall is greater than mode abcd with stainless steel wall while the total reactor power in mode abc is 24 w and in the mode abcd is 32 w fig 14 shows the reactor performance at uvt of 78 in the different modes of active lamps with the two different materials of the reactor wall the log inactivation values significantly reduced at uvt of 78 in addition there is not a significant change in the log inactivation values with increasing reflectivity in other words the effect of increasing wall reflection on the disinfection process is practically insignificant at uvt of 78 at this uvt it is seen that the importance degree of each lamp follows a pattern similar to the different modes of active lamps at the uvt of 98 the stainless steel wall 4 6 effect of flow rate on reflection performance fig 15 shows the residence time distribution of the particles at different flow rates the peak of the residence time distribution curve shifts toward a high residence time with the flow rate reduction a narrower residence time distribution curve is indicative of more particles with a similar residence time becoming narrower with increasing the flow rate in fig 16 a only lamp d and in fig 16 b only lamp b is active in each figure the log inactivation values versus reflectivity are shown at several flow rates with a uvt of 98 increasing the reflectivity of the inner walls leads to an ascending trend of log inactivation values the microorganisms have more time to receive reflected beams from the wall by increasing the residence time at a low flow rate consequently the rli increases by decreasing the flow rate therefore the percentage of rli at the flow rate of 1 m3 h is 87 and 63 for lamp d and b respectively therefore applying highly reflective materials on the reactor inner walls is suggested at the low flow rates 4 7 effect of lamp power on reflection performance fig 17 shows the log inactivation values versus reflectivity with different lamp powers at uvt of 98 as shown in fig 17 a the log inactivation values increase with the increase of reflectivity and lamp power for mode d in addition the increase of lamp power leads to the increase of rli highlighting the importance of applying the highly reflective materials in the uv reactors as shown in fig 17 b the results of mode b follows the similar procedure with the results of the mode d however the mode b has higher log inactivation values due to the hydrodynamics position of lamp b in addition the slope of mode b curve is higher than lamp d by applying aluminum the rli with increasing lamp power is greater in the mode d 80 87 than in the mode b 50 58 which emanates from the position of each lamp to the inner wall in fact a shorter distance from the wall and more collision from the uv beam to the wall result in a high rli in mode d as a result the effect of reflection at high powers is sensible and cannot be ignored 5 conclusion increasing the reflection of the reactor inner walls is one way to improve the performance of uv reactors which is achieved by applying materials with high reflectivity on the inner surfaces the simulation of the flow field using four turbulence models shows that the sst k ω model achieved higher accuracy for velocity prediction the importance degree of each lamp in the disinfection process is investigated based on lamp position the lamp located at the reactor s central region and the lamp close to the reactor s wall are identified as the most effective and the least effective in water disinfection respectively the rli for lamps with shorter distance from the inner wall is seen about 87 92 by changing the wall material from stainless steel to aluminum at constant reactor power at high uvt highly reflective materials on the inner walls help to increase the reactor efficiency so that the rli is 36 83 for different modes of active lamps at uvt of 98 the rli increases by increasing the lamp power the effect of reflection on disinfection reactor performance should be taken into account as the lamp power increases after using aluminum the rli is 46 63 by decreasing the flow rate from 10 to 1 m3 h for the one active lamp placed in reactor central region therefore the application of highly reflective materials on the inner wall is essential at low flow

hydroxyl radicals oh the in situ h2o2 generation combined with a reusable catalyst made the process more efficient economical and eco friendly keywords electrocatalysis fenton like magnetite graphene oxide oxygen reduction reaction 1 introduction environmental pollution increases day by day due to industrial activities which is a worldwide problem industries are polluting the environment directly or indirectly when discharged into water bodies without proper treatment industrial wastes are hazardous to aquatic life and humans the textile industries are one of the main sources of water pollution 1 because their wastewater has high stability and resistance to biodegradation in addition to strong coloration due to the presence of dyes high organic and inorganic matter turbidity ph and toxic chemicals the presence of a small amount of residual dye in the water is highly visible and consequently affects the receiving water body not only aesthetically but also disturbing aquatic life by preventing light penetration and oxygen transfer the carcinogenic and mutagenic capacity of various azo dyes and their precursors produce harmful effects on the environment in order to protect the environment textile wastewater must be treated up to the discharge safety limits as recommended by the legal organizations in different countries 2 advanced oxidation processes aops are more effective and efficient methods for the treatment of textile wastewater when compared to traditional processes as they promote dye discoloration and the degradation of toxic and recalcitrant compounds 3 1 aops use additional energy and or chemical reactants to generate highly reactive oxidant species most commonly the hydroxyl radical oh which is responsible for the non selective oxidative destruction of a wide variety of organic compounds 4 5 among the new wastewater treatment technologies aops have emerged as useful alternatives for the treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant substances such as textile dyes antibiotics and pesticides electro fenton ef technology is one of the most attractive aops in this process the continuous in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 occurs through the oxygen reduction reaction orr and regeneration of fe2 at the cathode the reaction between h2o2 and fe2 generates the hydroxyl radical oh which has an oxidation potential of 2 8 v 6 9 the utilization of a gas diffusion electrode gde is an efficient way of accelerating the diffusion of o2 and the production of h2o2 the gde is generally composed of three layers a diffusion layer a current collecting layer and a catalyst layer due to the high specific area and porosity of the diffusion layer o2 can efficiently pass through this layer and reach the interface between the catalyst layer and the electrolyte resulting in low energy consumption and high h2o2 production 10 11 a high efficiency in the orr for h2o2 electrogeneration is observed in carbon based electrodes such as carbon felt 12 graphite felt 13 activated carbon fiber 14 carbon cloth 15 reticulated vitreous carbon 16 and gdes produced from carbon black 17 18 carbon nanotubes 19 graphite 20 and graphene 21 the orr process has two pathways 4e and 2e pathway although the 4e pathway is more favorable thermodynamically the 2e reduction process of o2 to h2o2 is also very important 22 in situ electrogeneration of hydrogen peroxide through the oxygen reduction reaction represents a potentially greener route for wastewater treatment 23 given the infinity of materials that can be applied in gdes in an attempt to improve their efficiency in the h2o2 electrogeneration many researches have been carried out to find the perfect substrate for orr the use of reduced graphene oxide rgo as a gde modifier tends to improve its performance due to its excellent physical and chemical properties such as high electrical and thermal conductivities high mechanical resistance gas impermeability and excellent chemical stability 21 24 25 the go can also be used to improve the efficiency of catalysts magnetic nanoparticles supported on carbon based materials are a promising type of heterogeneous catalyst that is gaining attention recently by combining these compounds it is possible to obtain catalysts with high number of active sites 26 28 due to its aromatic rings the graphene surface is negatively charged exhibiting this way a strong tendency to share and or donate charges thus giving greater efficiency to the process by inducing the formation of oh radicals 29 30 with the development of these compounds it was possible to achieve a high efficiency for the treatment of textile wastewater by the ef process through a gde improved with rgo intensified with a heterogeneous fenton like reusable

according to 38 2 6 electro fenton system operating module the ef experiments fig 1 were performed using a direct current source instrutherm fa 1030 the oxygenation system was composed by a wimpel comp3 compressor with capacity of 10 l min 1 the anode used was stainless steel 316 l and the cathode was the gde with total area of 18 84 cm2 both placed in a beaker of 1000 ml the experiments were

are shown in fig 2 details of a go sheet varying from 8 to 10 μm can be noticed in fig 2a and b which show a rgo sheet that underwent chemical reduction and whose structure changed due to the removal of oxygenated functional groups ofgs after the reduction rgo presented more roughed sheets with particle size between 4 and 6 μm fig 2c shows the sem micrograph of the fe3o4 spherical shaped particles catalyst with size between 10 and 20 nm particles with such size and shape are characteristic of compounds produced by coprecipitation synthesis using fe2 and fe3 salts 39 40 fig 2d shows tem image of fe3o4 nanoparticles impregnated on the go sheet for the fe3o4 go15 catalyst the magnetic nanoparticles presented agglomeration points in the sheets of go and were more distributed in the borders the hydrophobic binder ptfe in the form of strips in the middle of carbon and rgo can be observed in fig 2e and f which show the gde after the sintering process presenting a smoother structure composed of carbon and rgo particles adhered to the structure magnetic hysteresis curves were determined for the fe3o4 and fe3o4 go nanocomposites with a magnetic field cycle varying between 20 and 20 koe fig 3 the magnetization hysteresis loops of most of the composites consisted of curves similar to an s which indicated superparamagnetic compounds the photograph insertion in the graph shows the nanoparticles dispersed in aqueous solution left and in the presence of a magnet right the specific saturation magnetization ms of the fe3o4 composite was 70 emu g 1 and for the fe3o4 go5 10 15 and 30 composites ms was 63 55 45 and 16 emu g 1 respectively the saturation magnetization of the fe3o4 go15 catalyst was 45 emu g 1 which was strong enough to ensure the convenient magnetic separation from the wastewater and its subsequent reuse xrd analyzes fig s1 show the characteristic bands of the go and rgo compounds after undergoing chemical exfoliation and reduction the band 002 of go can be observed in the fe3o4 go15 composite the ofgs of go appear in the ftir spectra fig s2 in which the carbon presented a band similar to that of the go in relation to the oh group located near to 3500 cm 1 the rgo presented a spectrum very similar to that found in graphite octahedral and tetrahedral sites characteristic of magnetic particles can be observed for the fe3o4 and fe3o4 go15 composites the d g and 2d bands can be observed in fig s3 in the micro raman analyzes 3 2 orr study electrocatalytic activity of the vulcan xc72r rgo based electrocatalysts for orr in alkaline medium was investigated using the rrde technique the voltammetric curves shown in fig 4 a were recorded with a scan rate of 5 mv s 1 and at 1600 rpm experiments were performed with gc supported vulcan xc72r electrodes containing different amounts of rgo and similar profiles were observed by comparing the voltammetric curves i e o2 is reduced at the disc producing ho2 ions and a fraction of such product is collected at the ring being oxidized back to o2 voltammograms show the same shape for all vulcan xc72r rgo based electrocatalysts and still exhibit a disc current close to that of vulcan xc72r indicating that the materials follow the two electron orr mechanism 41 comparing the ring current it can be observed that 5 and 10 vulcan xc72r rgo based electrocatalysts produced more ho2 ions than the reference material 0 rgo in addition by analyzing the polarization curves one can notice a shift in the onset potential towards less negative values for the electrocatalysts containing 5 10 e 15 rgo in comparison to the vulcan xc72r 0 rgo suggesting an improvement in the electrocatalytic activity with decrease in the energy consumption when such vulcan xc72r platforms incorporate rgo in order to understand more deeply the orr catalytic pathways the transferred electron number n and the amount of generated peroxide ho2 were calculated by taking into account disk and ring current values obtained in rrde measurements by elsewhere 42 fig 4b shows the results and the ho2 yield was 75 87 for 5 vulcan xc72r rgo and 70 85 for 10 vulcan xc72r rgo lower values were obtained for the other electrocatalysts according to the following sequence regarding the amount of rgo in the vulcan xc72r modifier 5 10 0 1 3 15 over the potential range of 0 25 to 0 8 v the electron transfer number changed in the reverse order during the orr process which is within 1 6 2 2 for 5 vulcan xc72r rgo and 1 1 2 3 for 10 vulcan xc72r rgo the results corroborate the data obtained from the k l plot fig s4 which indicates the near two electron pathway during the orr 3 3 effect of operational parameters on h2o2 electrogeneration the efficiency of the ef system for the removal of organic pollutants depends mainly on the generation of h2o2 however the amount of h2o2 generated by the o2 reduction at the cathode can be influenced by many factors such as ph current density air flow rate supporting electrolyte and electrolytic time 43 44 the effect of operating conditions ph o2 flow and electric current density on h2o2 productivity using modified gde is shown in fig 5 the h2o2 generation varied significantly with modification of gde with different percentages of rgo the h2o2 generation improved with the increasing of amount rgo from 0 to 10 wt and then decreased the maximum h2o2 production occurred with the gde modified with 5 wt of rgo 212 0 mg l 1 representing an increase in h2o2 generation of approximately 83 over the unmodified gde 116 0 mg l 1 this result in agreement with those obtained in the electrochemical experiments which showed that the gdes with 5 and 10 wt of rgo were the most efficient for orr the rgo can be a key in the cathode fabrication for the orr leading to better formation of the gas diffusion channel and the liquid electrolyte network the small increase in h2o2 generation with the modification of 1 and 3 wt is related to the low conductivity of the produced gde the orr performance to yield h2o2 is dependent on the formation of electrolyte network to transfer oh from the gdes to the liquid electrolyte 45 consequently depends also of the number of electrons transferred electrodes that have poor electrical conductivity have a small electron number transfer leading to a slower reduction of o2 and lower h2o2 concentration 18 high amount of rgo can lead to an increase in electrical conductivity on the other hand excess addition of rgo might block the gas diffusion channels resulting in low mass transfer of o2 gas and yield loss during h2o2 generation as observed in the 15 wt modification fig 5b shows that the lowest generation of h2o2 occurred when a minimum amount of o2 0 1 l min 1 was used as the o2 flow increased a corresponding increase in h2o2 generation was observed however at very high values 1 5 ml min 1 the efficiency was reduced in 40 of its maximum amount the maximum efficiency for h2o2 generation was observed with an o2 flow of 0 6 l min 1 the increase of the h2o2 concentration with increasing gas flow rate can be explained by two major factors first the origin of the effect can be due to oxygen being consumed in the h2o2 electrosynthesis by the two electron reaction reaction 1 and in the nonselective production of h2o by the four electron reaction reaction 2 second the hydrodynamics determine the rate of mass transfer between the liquid phase and the gde surface a h2o2 concentration gradient over the gde surface is created increasing the h2o2 decomposition reaction rate it is physically analogous to increasing the stirring rate in a batch reactor thus enhancing the air flow rate promotes the mass transfer rate which is beneficial to the h2o2 accumulation 44 1 o2 2h 2e h2o2 2 o2 4h 4e 2h2o as the gas flow rate increased the h2o2 concentration increased to the maximum value at the gas flow rate of 0 6 l min 1 after that point decreased in the h2o2 concentration was observed at higher gas flow rates the mass transfer between the gde surface and electrolyte will increase but probably more important is the increase in the mass transfer through the liquid layer surrounding the catalyst surface resulting in the low catalytic efficiency 44 the graph in fig 5c compares h2o2 concentrations as a function of applied current based on the results it was observed that a gradual increase in the h2o2 generation occurred with the increase of electric current until maximum value at 35 ma cm 2 and then decreased this improvement of h2o2 generation is probably because at these current densities the modifier can act as a catalyst of the reaction participating in both the chemical and electrochemical mechanisms for h2o2 generation the electrochemical mechanism occurs on the surface of the electrode with direct reduction of oxygen and the electrochemical chemical mechanism involves the electrochemical reduction of the modifier followed by the chemical mechanism in which the modifier is oxidized while the oxygen is reduced to h2o2 the application of 50 ma cm 2 led to a decrease in h2o2 generation this behavior can be attributed to the fact that there is an increase in charge at the triple interface of the gde formed by gas electrolyte electrode that can favor the generation of water via reduction of h2o2 by 2 electrons or via reduction of oxygen via 4 electrons 46 fig 5d shows the gde performance was better under acidic conditions a decrease in the h2o2 generation being noticed with increasing the ph the best performance was achieved at ph 3 0 because there was only two electron rro to produce h2o2 in acid solution reaction 1 depending on the solution ph secondary reactions compromising the h2o2 production may occur and reducing the h2o2 generation in very acid medium ph 2 5 h2o2 tends to react with h ions to form a new complex h3o2 more stable than h2o2 reaction 3 other reaction 4 that can occur is the scavenging effect of the ho radicals by h becomes stronger when there is a decrease in ph 2 5 in addition the reaction of residual h at the cathode to generate h2 reaction 5 is a concurrent reaction that decreases h2o2 production 8 21 48 49 3 h2o2 h h3o2 4 oh h e h2o 5 4e 4h2o 4oh 2h2 on the other hand the loss of h2o2 generation in alkaline solution is due to the occurrence of the four electron rro reaction 6 which limits the producing of h2o2 this also occurs because h2o2 presents a high decomposition rate to h2o reaction 7 preventing the formation of oh radicals therefore the generation rate of h2o2 and oh is restrained by solution ph and then the degradation efficiency decayed 21 47 6 o2 2h2o 4e 4oh 7 h2o2 oh h2o h2o 3 4 textile wastewater the textile wastewaters are a mixture of dyes metals and other contaminants typical characteristics of textile industry wastewater generally include a wide range of ph chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved solids strong color biochemical oxygen demand bod and salts therefore during the treatment processes it is important to monitor these parameters monitoring of the treatment performance regarding other parameters such as total organic carbon toc ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n is also required 50 52 table 1 shows the results on physicochemical characterization of textile wastewater before and after treatment all parameters of quality of wastewater treatment has significantly decreased except electrical conductivity and temperature this reduction demonstrates that this treatment method is a good environmental choice to textile wastewater high levels of bod5 may be associated with the presence of detergents soaps and other biodegradable organic compounds from the washing steps the high cod and toc values indicate that the dyeing process contributed to the incorporation of dyes and other additives in the wastewater high cod values may also be an indicator of the presence of o2 consuming substances such as fe2 mg2 nh4 and high chloride content 53 the ph of in natura wastewater was 5 68 however large variations in the final ph 5 0 12 0 may occur due to particularities in the production processes 54 55 high salinity measured by electrical conductivity and moderate to high sulfate concentrations are other characteristics of textile wastewater as a result of addition of salts during the dyeing process or may be formed by the oxidation of smaller sulfur species such used in the dyeing 56 the wastewater also showed an intense color which can be attributed to the presence of dyes from the finishing stonewash and washing process of denim from the uv vis absorption spectrum fig s5 it was found as a maximum absorbance band at about 660 nm referred to the chromophore group 57 3 5 efficiency of the textile wastewater treatment by ef in order to evaluate the effect of the fe3o4 amount on the efficiency of the ef treatment experiments were performed with 5 rgo gde and the optimum operating conditions found in topic 3 3 0 60 l min 1 of o2 35 ma cm 2 ph 3 0 the behavior of ph during ef experiments can be observed in the table s1 the efficiency was evaluated by the reduction of turbidity chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc the maximum efficiency for all parameters was observed with the use of 100 0 mg l 1 of fe3o4 resulting in a reduction of 90 4 in turbidity 65 8 in cod and 50 2 in toc the reduction of these parameters increased with the amount of catalyst until the maximum efficiency was reached after this a decrease in the efficiency was observed the lowest efficiency was observed at high catalyst amounts 250 0 mg l 1 and 500 0 mg l 1 respectively the amount of fe directly influences the reaction kinetics since fe is the catalyst for the decomposition of h2o2 to form oh however when fe2 is in excess these ions capture oh radicals for fe3 production 58 excess fe may also accumulate in the holes of the stainless steel plate of the gde occupying the active sites on the surface of the cathode and causing the reduction of h2o2 production 59 the effect of the catalyst modification with go on the treatment efficiency was evaluated regarding the unmodified catalyst fe3o4 and the results are shown in fig 6 b the modified catalysts showed high efficiency in relation to the fe3o4 catalyst regarding iron dissolution in the ef reaction analyzes performed on treated effluent samples table s2 under optimal operating conditions showed that the iron residual content was low in all samples where the fe3o4 catalyst was modified with go the average value of dissolved iron for fe3o4 go5 fe3o4 go10 fe3o4 go15 fe3o4 go30 were 0 69 0 51 0 40 0 44 mg l 1 respectively the conama standard 430 2011 brasil 60 states that the maximum dissolved iron limit for wastewater disposal should be 15 0 mg l 1 values higher than 15 0 mg l 1 were only observed in fe3o4 250 mg l 1 catalysts with an average of 18 14 mg l 1 and fe3o4 500 mg l 1 catalyst with an average 31 65 of dissolved iron fig s6 shows the profile of the effluent samples taken from an experiment under optimized conditions this effect is mainly due to the structure of the go which gave greater stability to the materials a reduction of 98 5 of turbidity 81 7 of cod and 70 3 of toc was observed for the fe3o4 go15 catalyst regarding the turbidity reduction no significant difference was noticed for catalysts modified with 5 and 10 go but in relation to cod and toc lower reduction values than the catalyst modified with 15 go were obtained but still with efficiency above 50 the fe3o4 go30 catalyst showed the lowest reduction in turbidity cod and toc studies about the incorporation of go on fe3o4 nanoparticles show that a high amount of go sheets induces the dominant stacking effect through the van der waals interaction in the basal field of the carbon structure this higher amount makes the effective diffusion and the contact of the reactants with the active sites of fe3o4 more difficult which impairs the formation of oh radicals necessary to decompose the pollutants 61 63 according wang et al 64 it is necessary to find supporting materials that not only can immobilize fe3o4 nanoparticles to avoid particle agglomeration but also facilitate electron transfer between catalyst surfaces and target organic compounds in aqueous solution 3 6 recycling capacity of the catalysts one of the major advantages of using magnetic catalysts is their reusability in subsequent experiments catalyst reuse is important for large scale operations such as the treatment of industrial wastewater in addition to the versatility and efficiency it provides recycling greatly reduces operating costs another important factor is the environmental issue since recycling tends to minimize the waste generation the recovery of the fe3o4 and fe3o4 go15 magnetic catalysts was evaluated in the treatment of the textile wastewater and recycling efficiency tests were performed for toc fig 7 the fe3o4 go15 catalyst presented higher stability and was more efficient in the reusability compared to fe3o4 in the first cycle the fe3o4 go15 compound presented a reduction of 69 0 in toc and after 10 cycles this value was 63 4 which represents only a 5 6 loss in efficiency indicating the high stability of the compound however the fe3o4 catalyst did not exhibit the same behavior for instance a reduction of 50 5 in toc was observed in the first cycle where a gradual decrease in such value was noticed in the further cycles suggesting that the fe3o4 compound could not maintain its stability a toc reduction of 50 5 46 8 and 42 1 respectively was observed in the first three cycles with a continuous decrease to less than 20 in the next ones zubir et al 29 have reported a comparative study on the degradation of acid orange 7 dye by using fe3o4 and fe3o4 go catalysts in a fenton like system during seven cycles the go modified catalyst showed dye reduction efficiency ranging from 98 to 99 however the efficiency of the fe3o4 catalyst was lower and declined very quickly wherein the approximate percentages of dye reduction from the first to the last cycle were 70 55 51 10 1 0 and 0 respectively according to the authors this severe catalytic deactivation is related to the fe2 ion being oxidized to fe3 and also to the adsorption of the dye and its intermediates on the catalyst active sites thus hindering the formation of hydroxyl radicals the stabilization of magnetic nanoparticles on the surface of the go allows a high accessibility of the compounds towards the active sites and can reduce some limitations imposed by the mass transfer during the catalytic reaction as the heterogeneous fenton reaction involves adsorption and concurrent reactions at the solid liquid interface the surface accessibility of fe3o4 go nanocomposites is crucial to maintain their catalytic activity 29 65 66 the reaction occurs at the active sites fe2 of fe3o4 bound to the surface of go sheets which decompose the h2o2 adsorbed into oh and o oh radicals reactions 8 and 9 show these steps during the process 29 67 8 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 9 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ooh h in addition to the active sites of fe3o4 h2o2 can also be decomposed on the surface of go fig 8 and this phenomenon is attributed to the properties of go which can act as donor or receptor of electrons according to reactions 10 and 11 29 10 go sp2 h2o2 go sp3 oh oh 11 go sp3 h2o2 go sp2 ooh h therefore it was evident the efficiency that the go provided to the ef system when combined to the fe3o4 catalyst being effective both in the adsorption of pollutants and in the generation of oh radicals 29 67 68 the introduction of go can increase surface area of catalyst enhance the catalyst stability and create new micropores at the interface of fe2o3 and go sheets facilitating mass transfer or reactants and products during the reaction in addition the aromatic ring structures of go also favorable for the adsorption of organic matter usually from dye and surfactant in the textile wastewater on its surface through π π interactions this adsorption increases the effective concentration of organic matter near the surface of fe2o3 go catalyst consequently electrons transfer between the two phases is facilitated and can induce a synergistic effect to enhance the catalytic activity hydrophilic nature of go can also contribute to better adsorption due to high dispersion of fe2o3 go catalyst in the aqueous media which promote the electron and mass transfer 68 71 4 conclusions incorporation of rgo into the gde structure increased by 83 the h2o2 generation capacity of the electrode fe3o4 go15 catalyst presented higher efficiency than unmodified fe3o4 for the treatment of the textile wastewater with a 98 5 reduction in turbidity 81 7 in cod 70 3 in toc and 96 7 reduction in absorbance fe3o4 go15 composite is a catalyst totally reusable due through its structure be preserved and stable after successive treatment processes without a loss in performance the increase in the reaction rate of ef experiment using fe3o4 go15 catalyst may be attributable to the fe2 ion regeneration process and go sheets

oxide oxygen reduction reaction 1 introduction environmental pollution increases day by day due to industrial activities which is a worldwide problem industries are polluting the environment directly or indirectly when discharged into water bodies without proper treatment industrial wastes are hazardous to aquatic life and humans the textile industries are one of the main sources of water pollution 1 because their wastewater has high stability and resistance to biodegradation in addition to strong coloration due to the presence of dyes high organic and inorganic matter turbidity ph and toxic chemicals the presence of a small amount of residual dye in the water is highly visible and consequently affects the receiving water body not only aesthetically but also disturbing aquatic life by preventing light penetration and oxygen transfer the carcinogenic and mutagenic capacity of various azo dyes and their precursors produce harmful effects on the environment in order to protect the environment textile wastewater must be treated up to the discharge safety limits as recommended by the legal organizations in different countries 2 advanced oxidation processes aops are more effective and efficient methods for the treatment of textile wastewater when compared to traditional processes as they promote dye discoloration and the degradation of toxic and recalcitrant compounds 3 1 aops use additional energy and or chemical reactants to generate highly reactive oxidant species most commonly the hydroxyl radical oh which is responsible for the non selective oxidative destruction of a wide variety of organic compounds 4 5 among the new wastewater treatment technologies aops have emerged as useful alternatives for the treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant substances such as textile dyes antibiotics and pesticides electro fenton ef technology is one of the most attractive aops in this process the continuous in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 occurs through the oxygen reduction reaction orr and regeneration of fe2 at the cathode the reaction between h2o2 and fe2 generates the hydroxyl radical oh which has an oxidation potential of 2 8 v 6 9 the utilization of a gas diffusion electrode gde is an efficient way of accelerating the diffusion of o2 and the production of h2o2 the gde is generally composed of three layers a diffusion layer a current collecting layer and a catalyst layer due to the high specific area and porosity of the diffusion layer o2 can efficiently pass through this layer and reach the interface between the catalyst layer and the electrolyte resulting in low energy consumption and high h2o2 production 10 11 a high efficiency in the orr for h2o2 electrogeneration is observed in carbon based electrodes such as carbon felt 12 graphite felt 13 activated carbon fiber 14 carbon cloth 15 reticulated vitreous carbon 16 and gdes produced from carbon black 17 18 carbon nanotubes 19 graphite 20 and graphene 21 the orr process has two pathways 4e and 2e pathway although the 4e pathway is more favorable thermodynamically the 2e reduction process of o2 to h2o2 is also very important 22 in situ electrogeneration of hydrogen peroxide through the oxygen reduction reaction represents a potentially greener route for wastewater treatment 23 given the infinity of materials that can be applied in gdes in an attempt to improve their efficiency in the h2o2 electrogeneration many researches have been carried out to find the perfect substrate for orr the use of reduced graphene oxide rgo as a gde modifier tends to improve its performance due to its excellent physical and chemical properties such as high electrical and thermal conductivities high mechanical resistance gas impermeability and excellent chemical stability 21 24 25 the go can also be used to improve the efficiency of catalysts magnetic nanoparticles supported on carbon based materials are a promising type of heterogeneous catalyst that is gaining attention recently by combining these compounds it is possible to obtain catalysts with high number of active sites 26 28 due to its aromatic rings the graphene surface is negatively charged exhibiting this way a strong tendency to share and or donate charges thus giving greater efficiency to the process by inducing the formation of oh radicals 29 30 with the development of these compounds it was possible to achieve a high efficiency for the treatment of textile wastewater by the ef process through a gde improved with rgo intensified with a heterogeneous fenton like reusable

according to 38 2 6 electro fenton system operating module the ef experiments fig 1 were performed using a direct current source instrutherm fa 1030 the oxygenation system was composed by a wimpel comp3 compressor with capacity of 10 l min 1 the anode used was stainless steel 316 l and the cathode was the gde with total area of 18 84 cm2 both placed in a beaker of 1000 ml the experiments were

are shown in fig 2 details of a go sheet varying from 8 to 10 μm can be noticed in fig 2a and b which show a rgo sheet that underwent chemical reduction and whose structure changed due to the removal of oxygenated functional groups ofgs after the reduction rgo presented more roughed sheets with particle size between 4 and 6 μm fig 2c shows the sem micrograph of the fe3o4 spherical shaped particles catalyst with size between 10 and 20 nm particles with such size and shape are characteristic of compounds produced by coprecipitation synthesis using fe2 and fe3 salts 39 40 fig 2d shows tem image of fe3o4 nanoparticles impregnated on the go sheet for the fe3o4 go15 catalyst the magnetic nanoparticles presented agglomeration points in the sheets of go and were more distributed in the borders the hydrophobic binder ptfe in the form of strips in the middle of carbon and rgo can be observed in fig 2e and f which show the gde after the sintering process presenting a smoother structure composed of carbon and rgo particles adhered to the structure magnetic hysteresis curves were determined for the fe3o4 and fe3o4 go nanocomposites with a magnetic field cycle varying between 20 and 20 koe fig 3 the magnetization hysteresis loops of most of the composites consisted of curves similar to an s which indicated superparamagnetic compounds the photograph insertion in the graph shows the nanoparticles dispersed in aqueous solution left and in the presence of a magnet right the specific saturation magnetization ms of the fe3o4 composite was 70 emu g 1 and for the fe3o4 go5 10 15 and 30 composites ms was 63 55 45 and 16 emu g 1 respectively the saturation magnetization of the fe3o4 go15 catalyst was 45 emu g 1 which was strong enough to ensure the convenient magnetic separation from the wastewater and its subsequent reuse xrd analyzes fig s1 show the characteristic bands of the go and rgo compounds after undergoing chemical exfoliation and reduction the band 002 of go can be observed in the fe3o4 go15 composite the ofgs of go appear in the ftir spectra fig s2 in which the carbon presented a band similar to that of the go in relation to the oh group located near to 3500 cm 1 the rgo presented a spectrum very similar to that found in graphite octahedral and tetrahedral sites characteristic of magnetic particles can be observed for the fe3o4 and fe3o4 go15 composites the d g and 2d bands can be observed in fig s3 in the micro raman analyzes 3 2 orr study electrocatalytic activity of the vulcan xc72r rgo based electrocatalysts for orr in alkaline medium was investigated using the rrde technique the voltammetric curves shown in fig 4 a were recorded with a scan rate of 5 mv s 1 and at 1600 rpm experiments were performed with gc supported vulcan xc72r electrodes containing different amounts of rgo and similar profiles were observed by comparing the voltammetric curves i e o2 is reduced at the disc producing ho2 ions and a fraction of such product is collected at the ring being oxidized back to o2 voltammograms show the same shape for all vulcan xc72r rgo based electrocatalysts and still exhibit a disc current close to that of vulcan xc72r indicating that the materials follow the two electron orr mechanism 41 comparing the ring current it can be observed that 5 and 10 vulcan xc72r rgo based electrocatalysts produced more ho2 ions than the reference material 0 rgo in addition by analyzing the polarization curves one can notice a shift in the onset potential towards less negative values for the electrocatalysts containing 5 10 e 15 rgo in comparison to the vulcan xc72r 0 rgo suggesting an improvement in the electrocatalytic activity with decrease in the energy consumption when such vulcan xc72r platforms incorporate rgo in order to understand more deeply the orr catalytic pathways the transferred electron number n and the amount of generated peroxide ho2 were calculated by taking into account disk and ring current values obtained in rrde measurements by elsewhere 42 fig 4b shows the results and the ho2 yield was 75 87 for 5 vulcan xc72r rgo and 70 85 for 10 vulcan xc72r rgo lower values were obtained for the other electrocatalysts according to the following sequence regarding the amount of rgo in the vulcan xc72r modifier 5 10 0 1 3 15 over the potential range of 0 25 to 0 8 v the electron transfer number changed in the reverse order during the orr process which is within 1 6 2 2 for 5 vulcan xc72r rgo and 1 1 2 3 for 10 vulcan xc72r rgo the results corroborate the data obtained from the k l plot fig s4 which indicates the near two electron pathway during the orr 3 3 effect of operational parameters on h2o2 electrogeneration the efficiency of the ef system for the removal of organic pollutants depends mainly on the generation of h2o2 however the amount of h2o2 generated by the o2 reduction at the cathode can be influenced by many factors such as ph current density air flow rate supporting electrolyte and electrolytic time 43 44 the effect of operating conditions ph o2 flow and electric current density on h2o2 productivity using modified gde is shown in fig 5 the h2o2 generation varied significantly with modification of gde with different percentages of rgo the h2o2 generation improved with the increasing of amount rgo from 0 to 10 wt and then decreased the maximum h2o2 production occurred with the gde modified with 5 wt of rgo 212 0 mg l 1 representing an increase in h2o2 generation of approximately 83 over the unmodified gde 116 0 mg l 1 this result in agreement with those obtained in the electrochemical experiments which showed that the gdes with 5 and 10 wt of rgo were the most efficient for orr the rgo can be a key in the cathode fabrication for the orr leading to better formation of the gas diffusion channel and the liquid electrolyte network the small increase in h2o2 generation with the modification of 1 and 3 wt is related to the low conductivity of the produced gde the orr performance to yield h2o2 is dependent on the formation of electrolyte network to transfer oh from the gdes to the liquid electrolyte 45 consequently depends also of the number of electrons transferred electrodes that have poor electrical conductivity have a small electron number transfer leading to a slower reduction of o2 and lower h2o2 concentration 18 high amount of rgo can lead to an increase in electrical conductivity on the other hand excess addition of rgo might block the gas diffusion channels resulting in low mass transfer of o2 gas and yield loss during h2o2 generation as observed in the 15 wt modification fig 5b shows that the lowest generation of h2o2 occurred when a minimum amount of o2 0 1 l min 1 was used as the o2 flow increased a corresponding increase in h2o2 generation was observed however at very high values 1 5 ml min 1 the efficiency was reduced in 40 of its maximum amount the maximum efficiency for h2o2 generation was observed with an o2 flow of 0 6 l min 1 the increase of the h2o2 concentration with increasing gas flow rate can be explained by two major factors first the origin of the effect can be due to oxygen being consumed in the h2o2 electrosynthesis by the two electron reaction reaction 1 and in the nonselective production of h2o by the four electron reaction reaction 2 second the hydrodynamics determine the rate of mass transfer between the liquid phase and the gde surface a h2o2 concentration gradient over the gde surface is created increasing the h2o2 decomposition reaction rate it is physically analogous to increasing the stirring rate in a batch reactor thus enhancing the air flow rate promotes the mass transfer rate which is beneficial to the h2o2 accumulation 44 1 o2 2h 2e h2o2 2 o2 4h 4e 2h2o as the gas flow rate increased the h2o2 concentration increased to the maximum value at the gas flow rate of 0 6 l min 1 after that point decreased in the h2o2 concentration was observed at higher gas flow rates the mass transfer between the gde surface and electrolyte will increase but probably more important is the increase in the mass transfer through the liquid layer surrounding the catalyst surface resulting in the low catalytic efficiency 44 the graph in fig 5c compares h2o2 concentrations as a function of applied current based on the results it was observed that a gradual increase in the h2o2 generation occurred with the increase of electric current until maximum value at 35 ma cm 2 and then decreased this improvement of h2o2 generation is probably because at these current densities the modifier can act as a catalyst of the reaction participating in both the chemical and electrochemical mechanisms for h2o2 generation the electrochemical mechanism occurs on the surface of the electrode with direct reduction of oxygen and the electrochemical chemical mechanism involves the electrochemical reduction of the modifier followed by the chemical mechanism in which the modifier is oxidized while the oxygen is reduced to h2o2 the application of 50 ma cm 2 led to a decrease in h2o2 generation this behavior can be attributed to the fact that there is an increase in charge at the triple interface of the gde formed by gas electrolyte electrode that can favor the generation of water via reduction of h2o2 by 2 electrons or via reduction of oxygen via 4 electrons 46 fig 5d shows the gde performance was better under acidic conditions a decrease in the h2o2 generation being noticed with increasing the ph the best performance was achieved at ph 3 0 because there was only two electron rro to produce h2o2 in acid solution reaction 1 depending on the solution ph secondary reactions compromising the h2o2 production may occur and reducing the h2o2 generation in very acid medium ph 2 5 h2o2 tends to react with h ions to form a new complex h3o2 more stable than h2o2 reaction 3 other reaction 4 that can occur is the scavenging effect of the ho radicals by h becomes stronger when there is a decrease in ph 2 5 in addition the reaction of residual h at the cathode to generate h2 reaction 5 is a concurrent reaction that decreases h2o2 production 8 21 48 49 3 h2o2 h h3o2 4 oh h e h2o 5 4e 4h2o 4oh 2h2 on the other hand the loss of h2o2 generation in alkaline solution is due to the occurrence of the four electron rro reaction 6 which limits the producing of h2o2 this also occurs because h2o2 presents a high decomposition rate to h2o reaction 7 preventing the formation of oh radicals therefore the generation rate of h2o2 and oh is restrained by solution ph and then the degradation efficiency decayed 21 47 6 o2 2h2o 4e 4oh 7 h2o2 oh h2o h2o 3 4 textile wastewater the textile wastewaters are a mixture of dyes metals and other contaminants typical characteristics of textile industry wastewater generally include a wide range of ph chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved solids strong color biochemical oxygen demand bod and salts therefore during the treatment processes it is important to monitor these parameters monitoring of the treatment performance regarding other parameters such as total organic carbon toc ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n is also required 50 52 table 1 shows the results on physicochemical characterization of textile wastewater before and after treatment all parameters of quality of wastewater treatment has significantly decreased except electrical conductivity and temperature this reduction demonstrates that this treatment method is a good environmental choice to textile wastewater high levels of bod5 may be associated with the presence of detergents soaps and other biodegradable organic compounds from the washing steps the high cod and toc values indicate that the dyeing process contributed to the incorporation of dyes and other additives in the wastewater high cod values may also be an indicator of the presence of o2 consuming substances such as fe2 mg2 nh4 and high chloride content 53 the ph of in natura wastewater was 5 68 however large variations in the final ph 5 0 12 0 may occur due to particularities in the production processes 54 55 high salinity measured by electrical conductivity and moderate to high sulfate concentrations are other characteristics of textile wastewater as a result of addition of salts during the dyeing process or may be formed by the oxidation of smaller sulfur species such used in the dyeing 56 the wastewater also showed an intense color which can be attributed to the presence of dyes from the finishing stonewash and washing process of denim from the uv vis absorption spectrum fig s5 it was found as a maximum absorbance band at about 660 nm referred to the chromophore group 57 3 5 efficiency of the textile wastewater treatment by ef in order to evaluate the effect of the fe3o4 amount on the efficiency of the ef treatment experiments were performed with 5 rgo gde and the optimum operating conditions found in topic 3 3 0 60 l min 1 of o2 35 ma cm 2 ph 3 0 the behavior of ph during ef experiments can be observed in the table s1 the efficiency was evaluated by the reduction of turbidity chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc the maximum efficiency for all parameters was observed with the use of 100 0 mg l 1 of fe3o4 resulting in a reduction of 90 4 in turbidity 65 8 in cod and 50 2 in toc the reduction of these parameters increased with the amount of catalyst until the maximum efficiency was reached after this a decrease in the efficiency was observed the lowest efficiency was observed at high catalyst amounts 250 0 mg l 1 and 500 0 mg l 1 respectively the amount of fe directly influences the reaction kinetics since fe is the catalyst for the decomposition of h2o2 to form oh however when fe2 is in excess these ions capture oh radicals for fe3 production 58 excess fe may also accumulate in the holes of the stainless steel plate of the gde occupying the active sites on the surface of the cathode and causing the reduction of h2o2 production 59 the effect of the catalyst modification with go on the treatment efficiency was evaluated regarding the unmodified catalyst fe3o4 and the results are shown in fig 6 b the modified catalysts showed high efficiency in relation to the fe3o4 catalyst regarding iron dissolution in the ef reaction analyzes performed on treated effluent samples table s2 under optimal operating conditions showed that the iron residual content was low in all samples where the fe3o4 catalyst was modified with go the average value of dissolved iron for fe3o4 go5 fe3o4 go10 fe3o4 go15 fe3o4 go30 were 0 69 0 51 0 40 0 44 mg l 1 respectively the conama standard 430 2011 brasil 60 states that the maximum dissolved iron limit for wastewater disposal should be 15 0 mg l 1 values higher than 15 0 mg l 1 were only observed in fe3o4 250 mg l 1 catalysts with an average of 18 14 mg l 1 and fe3o4 500 mg l 1 catalyst with an average 31 65 of dissolved iron fig s6 shows the profile of the effluent samples taken from an experiment under optimized conditions this effect is mainly due to the structure of the go which gave greater stability to the materials a reduction of 98 5 of turbidity 81 7 of cod and 70 3 of toc was observed for the fe3o4 go15 catalyst regarding the turbidity reduction no significant difference was noticed for catalysts modified with 5 and 10 go but in relation to cod and toc lower reduction values than the catalyst modified with 15 go were obtained but still with efficiency above 50 the fe3o4 go30 catalyst showed the lowest reduction in turbidity cod and toc studies about the incorporation of go on fe3o4 nanoparticles show that a high amount of go sheets induces the dominant stacking effect through the van der waals interaction in the basal field of the carbon structure this higher amount makes the effective diffusion and the contact of the reactants with the active sites of fe3o4 more difficult which impairs the formation of oh radicals necessary to decompose the pollutants 61 63 according wang et al 64 it is necessary to find supporting materials that not only can immobilize fe3o4 nanoparticles to avoid particle agglomeration but also facilitate electron transfer between catalyst surfaces and target organic compounds in aqueous solution 3 6 recycling capacity of the catalysts one of the major advantages of using magnetic catalysts is their reusability in subsequent experiments catalyst reuse is important for large scale operations such as the treatment of industrial wastewater in addition to the versatility and efficiency it provides recycling greatly reduces operating costs another important factor is the environmental issue since recycling tends to minimize the waste generation the recovery of the fe3o4 and fe3o4 go15 magnetic catalysts was evaluated in the treatment of the textile wastewater and recycling efficiency tests were performed for toc fig 7 the fe3o4 go15 catalyst presented higher stability and was more efficient in the reusability compared to fe3o4 in the first cycle the fe3o4 go15 compound presented a reduction of 69 0 in toc and after 10 cycles this value was 63 4 which represents only a 5 6 loss in efficiency indicating the high stability of the compound however the fe3o4 catalyst did not exhibit the same behavior for instance a reduction of 50 5 in toc was observed in the first cycle where a gradual decrease in such value was noticed in the further cycles suggesting that the fe3o4 compound could not maintain its stability a toc reduction of 50 5 46 8 and 42 1 respectively was observed in the first three cycles with a continuous decrease to less than 20 in the next ones zubir et al 29 have reported a comparative study on the degradation of acid orange 7 dye by using fe3o4 and fe3o4 go catalysts in a fenton like system during seven cycles the go modified catalyst showed dye reduction efficiency ranging from 98 to 99 however the efficiency of the fe3o4 catalyst was lower and declined very quickly wherein the approximate percentages of dye reduction from the first to the last cycle were 70 55 51 10 1 0 and 0 respectively according to the authors this severe catalytic deactivation is related to the fe2 ion being oxidized to fe3 and also to the adsorption of the dye and its intermediates on the catalyst active sites thus hindering the formation of hydroxyl radicals the stabilization of magnetic nanoparticles on the surface of the go allows a high accessibility of the compounds towards the active sites and can reduce some limitations imposed by the mass transfer during the catalytic reaction as the heterogeneous fenton reaction involves adsorption and concurrent reactions at the solid liquid interface the surface accessibility of fe3o4 go nanocomposites is crucial to maintain their catalytic activity 29 65 66 the reaction occurs at the active sites fe2 of fe3o4 bound to the surface of go sheets which decompose the h2o2 adsorbed into oh and o oh radicals reactions 8 and 9 show these steps during the process 29 67 8 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 9 fe3 h2o2 fe2 ooh h in addition to the active sites of fe3o4 h2o2 can also be decomposed on the surface of go fig 8 and this phenomenon is attributed to the properties of go which can act as donor or receptor of electrons according to reactions 10 and 11 29 10 go sp2 h2o2 go sp3 oh oh 11 go sp3 h2o2 go sp2 ooh h therefore it was evident the efficiency that the go provided to the ef system when combined to the fe3o4 catalyst being effective both in the adsorption of pollutants and in the generation of oh radicals 29 67 68 the introduction of go can increase surface area of catalyst enhance the catalyst stability and create new micropores at the interface of fe2o3 and go sheets facilitating mass transfer or reactants and products during the reaction in addition the aromatic ring structures of go also favorable for the adsorption of organic matter usually from dye and surfactant in the textile wastewater on its surface through π π interactions this adsorption increases the effective concentration of organic matter near the surface of fe2o3 go catalyst consequently electrons transfer between the two phases is facilitated and can induce a synergistic effect to enhance the catalytic activity hydrophilic nature of go can also contribute to better adsorption due to high dispersion of fe2o3 go catalyst in the aqueous media which promote the electron and mass transfer 68 71 4 conclusions incorporation of rgo into the gde structure increased by 83 the h2o2 generation capacity of the electrode fe3o4 go15 catalyst presented higher efficiency than unmodified fe3o4 for the treatment of the textile wastewater with a 98 5 reduction in turbidity 81 7 in cod 70 3 in toc and 96 7 reduction in absorbance fe3o4 go15 composite is a catalyst totally reusable due through its structure be preserved and stable after successive treatment processes without a loss in performance the increase in the reaction rate of ef experiment using fe3o4 go15 catalyst may be attributable to the fe2 ion regeneration process and go sheets

keywords zero valent iron organic dye sulfate radicals fenton reagent generation of h2o2 1 introduction dyes are pollutants with large molecules which are considered by environmental scientists due to toxic effect on aquatic environment around 7 105 tons of dyes are annually consumed in the world in which two thirds of them are used in textile industry 1 2 they are often water soluble compounds in which a small amount of them can produce intensive color in water 3 therefore color production is the first important effect on water resources they are extremely resistant to biodegradation due to their toxicity for microbes biodegradation is a slow process and very sensitive to environmental conditions 1 conventional chemical treatments chlorine oxidation coagulation and adsorption are often insufficient for complete removal of dyes and may produce toxic intermediates or sludge due to their low power in mineralization of organic pollutants hence new chemical process is required to investigate the degradation of organic dyes in aqueous solution 4 advanced oxidation processes aops have been extremely used in the degradation of persistent organic pollutants aops are usually classified based on generated reactive radicals including hydroxyl radical based aops and sulfate radical based aops 5 8 aops produce free radicals with high reactive to oxidize organic contaminants there are several methods for the generation of both hydroxyl radicals ho and sulfate so4 pds radicals as a conventional method use of a chemical oxidant has been widely used to produce hydroxyl and sulfate radicals hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and peroxydisulfate anion s2o8 2 have been applied for this purpose 9 10 to active chemical oxidant several methods are suggested to generate free radicals

to excellent catalytic activity zvi is an excellent alternative for ferrous ions for fenton oxidation since it can gradually release ferrous ions moreover zvi is a practical economic and efficient catalyst for activation of peroxygens 14 16 meanwhile zvi as an alternative of ferrous ions can gradually release ferrous ions zvi has demonstrated high catalytic activity for oxygen to generate hydrogen peroxide and fenton reagent in fact zvi reduces oxygen molecule to generate hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion in acidic conditions and forms fenton reagent for generation of hydroxyl radicals eq 1 in addition hydrogen peroxide also can be reduced to water and produce ferrous ions to generate hydroxyl radical as described at eqs 2 and 3 17 18 zvi aeration is a compelling process for degradation of organic compounds however the adequacy of free radical production for degradation of refractory organic pollutants is doubtful hence enhanced procedure is needed for more production of

s o 4 f e 3 s o 4 2 the use of system of zvi pds aeration may be a promising design in terms of activation methods in this design zvi not only produces hydrogen peroxide in the presence of air but it also activates both hydrogen peroxide and persulfate simultaneously in fact there are direct and indirect activations for the production of free radical several studies have demonstrated the function of pds zvi 21 24 and zvi aeration 25 26 systems in degradation of organic pollutant in contaminated water howbeit according to literature no study has been reported pds mzvi aeration system for any pollutants yet in this work by focusing on application of pds mzvi aeration for dye degradation we have tested effect of influential factors on the pds mzvi aeration performance into degradation of organic dye acid blue 9 ab9 moreover the effect of some anions was studied on dye removal the kinetic model of dye degradation was also investigated the scavenging experiments were considered to determine contribution of oxidative agents carboxylic acids generated were monitored during oxidation time the characteristics of reacted mzvi were also investigated by several techniques 2 materials

alcohol zanjan company and merck company respectively 2 2 experimental procedure ab9 solution was daily prepared by dissolving 500 mg of ab9 powder in 500 ml double distilled water this solution was kept in a dark place as stock solution 200 ml of ab9 solution 25 mg l was introduced in a cylindrical reactor with volume of 300 ml a known quantity of mzvi was added to the solution an aquarium pump was used for air sparging using air stone aerator with flow of 1 l min the solution ph was adjusted by sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide 0 5 mm a certain amount of pds was added to the solution after that degradation reaction of ab9 was started predetermined amounts of sample were undertaken from the reaction solution at defined reaction time intervals the decolorization rate by pds mzvi aeration system was evaluated as function of solution ph catalyst loading and ps dosage during 50 min reaction to determine the optimum conditions afterwards scavenging and mineralization tests as well as reaction mechanism were performed under the optimized conditions moreover the effect of anions was studied using sodium based salt for sulfate carbonate nitrate and nitrite anions while potassium dihydrogen phosphate was used for the effect of h2po4 on ab9 removal the performance of pds mzvi pds aeration mzvi aeration mzvi pds and aeration systems were exactly examined similar with pds mzvi aeration process in the term of ab9 decolorization 2 3 analytical methods ab9 was measured by a spectrophotometer perkin elmer lambeda 35 according to maximum absorbance of ab9 at visible region 628 nm toc was determined by a toc analyzer shimatzu to determine the mineralization degree of process the concentration of released iron in the solutions was also determined by an atomic absorption spectroscopy perkin elmer the solution ph was determined by a ph meter mettler toledo sevencompact the carboxylic acid intermediates were detected using high performance liquid chromatography hplc uv waters usa at 220 nm a c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 2 5 μm waters usa was used with an eluent of 4 mm h2so4 at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min iron was determined by 1 a 1 10 phenanthroline method x ray diffraction xrd analysis was carried out by using x ray diffractometer bruker d8 discover usa with monochromatized cu kα radiation λ 1 5418 å at 40 kv and 30 ma the morphology of reacted mzvi was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem analysis mira 3 xmu which is integrated by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds to determine the elements in reacted mzvi 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effects of solution ph mzvi and pds dosages on ab9 degradation in pds mzvi aeration process the effect of the main operating factors on ab9 degradation was studied by focusing on solution ph mzvi and pds dosages the solution ph is influential parameter in zvi based processes due to the effect of ph on zvi corrosion moreover ph can influence h2o2 generation according to eq 2 herein the effect of solution ph on the decolorization efficiency was considered in range of 3 0 11 0 fig 1 a as can be seen acidic and near neutral conditions were suitable for pds mzvi aeration system compared to alkaline media the maximum removal efficiencies were obtained at ph 3 0 and 5 0 during 50 min reaction time low efficiency of ab9 removal in neutral and alkaline conditions can be attributed to the decrease of mzvi oxidation and the reduction of iron released consequently in addition the presence of protons is necessary for hydrogen peroxide generation therefore neutral and alkaline conditions cannot provide sufficient hydrogen ions at ph 3 0 there was a drop in efficiency of ab9 removal compared to ph 5 0 it should be noted that h2o2 is stabilized by excess hydrogen ions ph 3 0 in form of oxonium according eq 6 oxonium is a stable and electrophilic form whose reactivity is low for the reaction with iron to generate hydroxyl radical 27 in addition excess hydrogen ions can have a detrimental effect on aops via scavenging sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals eq 7 strong acidic conditions may also inhibit the generation of sulfate radicals through acid catalyzing persulfate according to eqs 8 and 9 28 the solution ph 5 0 showed high efficiency for pds mzvi aeration process thus it was chosen as optimum value of ph for subsequent tests 6 h 2 o 2 h h 3 o 2 7 s o 4 o r h o h e h s o 4 o r h 2 o 8 h s 2 o 8 2 h s 2 o 8 9 h s 2 o 8 h 2 o h 2 s o 5 h s o 4 the effect of mzvi loading was investigated on ab9 removal over pds mzvi aeration system and the results are presented in fig 1b it is clear that increase in mzvi dosage results in more production of ferrous ions catalyzing both h2o2 and pds for the generation of free oxidizing radicals ab9 removals obtained were 67 1 76 4 77 8 83 4 81 5 for mzvi loading of 0 125 0 25 0 375 0 5 0 625 g l respectively the mzvi loading of 0 5 g l provided the best results for ab9 removal it is worth to mention that the number reactive sites on the mzvi surface decreased significantly through aggregation of catalyst particles at excess dosages of mzvi similar trends have been reported in the literature for the degradation of different organics over sulfate radical based oxidation studies 29 30 the effect of pds dosage on ab9 removal was investigated under ph 5 0 and mzvi loading of 0 5 g l fig 1c with increase in pds dosage enhanced ab9 removal through increase of free radicals resulting from pds activation with adding only 0 25 mm pds ab9 degradation rate was developed and reached 55 4 during 50 min reaction time higher pds dosage accelerated the degradation rate in which around 80 removal efficiency was achieved at only 10 min these results indicated that pds dosage is the main parameter for the generation of free radicals after 1 5 mm pds dosage degradation rate was almost constant the high scavenging effect for excess pds was not observed in this study higher pds concentration probably reacted with ferrous ions rapidly to generate sulfate radicals in this way the reaction rate of sulfate radical with ab9 molecules may be faster than that of sulfate radical with pds 3 2 the evaluation of different processes the ab9 degradation was evaluated by different treatments under 50 min reaction time and similar operating conditions fig 2 a shows ab9 degradation rate by pds mzvi aeration pds aeration mzvi aeration pds aeration and pds mzvi aeration processes fig 2a demonstrates pds mzvi aeration had higher oxidation capacity than other systems pds mzvi and aeration alone indicated a weak performance into ab9 degradation implying minimal adsorption potential of mzvi and also low oxidation ability of pds and aeration these results showed that individual processes were unable for the generation of sufficient free radicals and efficient decolorization mzvi aeration could degrade 32 1 of ab9 in which fenton reagent was likely formed during 50 min time little generation of hydrogen peroxide in mzvi aeration treatment may be the main reason of low removal efficiency of ab9 on the other hand pds mzvi enhanced the degradation efficiency 66 at 10 min indicating that the presence of catalyst and pds is necessary for the generation of adequate reactive oxidizing species however the main treatment pds mzvi aeration demonstrated a significant effect in combination of each component theoretically although aeration can produce hydrogen peroxide it also oxidizes ferrous ions to ferric ions reducing the amount of hydroxyl radicals in the reaction mixture hence enhanced degradation must be found in another mechanism hydrogen peroxide generated can directly react with pds to form hydroxyl and sulfate radicals simultaneously in fact h2o2 was appeared in role of pds activator according to eq 10 31 10 h 2 o 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 2 h o to confirm this hypothesis two series experiments i e pds h2o2 and pds mzvi h2o2 were conducted fig 2b depicts degradation rate of ab9 in presence of 1 mm h2o2 1 5 mm pds and 0 5 g l mzvi combined pds h2o2 illustrated a synergistic effect compared sole utilization of h2o2 and pds pds h2o2 degraded 37 8 of dye indicating the formation of free radicals in the reaction solution the results of pds mzvi h2o2 were exactly similar with pds mzvi aeration representing that two phenomena of in situ generation of h2o2 and catalytic behavior of h2o2 for pds activation occurred in the pds mzvi aeration system simultaneously hence the presence of aeration not only is effective for the production of fenton reagent but it also plays an indirect critical role in pds activation pseudo first order kinetic model was used to explain ab9 degradation rate the rate constants k of ab9 degradation was calculated based on the following equation 32 11 ln c 0 c t k t where c 0 and ct are the concentration of ab9 at the first and t reaction time respectively the k is rate constant of pseudo first order model which is obtained through the calculation of slop plotting ln c 0 ct vs t in addition in order to obtain half life t 1 2 of ab9 following equation was used 12 t 1 2 l n 2 k according to fig 2a degradation rate was very rapid at the first 10 min reaction after that the degradation rate was significantly reduced up to 50 min reaction time hence the degradation rate of ab9 is attributed to the first 10 min in fact in this stage oxidants were vigorously consumed by ferrous ions and high amount of free radicals were produced table 2 shows the rate constants r squared correlation between ln c 0 ct vs t and half time of ab9 for different processes as shown the rate constant of the main process was 2 folds and 23 folds more than that of pds mzvi and pds aeration respectively this finding indicated a synergistic effect between components of this process 3 3 comparison of zvi with zero valent aluminum zero valent aluminum has been recently used for pds activation 33 accordingly micro zero valent aluminum mzval was also tested instead of mzvi in pds mzvi aeration fig 3 shows ab9 degradation rate in different treatments as can be seen mzval was totally ineffective for pds activation in pds mzval 14 2 removal efficiency during 50 min reaction and in situ generation of h2o2 in mzval aeration 8 9 removal efficiency in 50 min pds mzval aeration was almost inefficient with 20 3 decolorization efficiency within 50 min compared to pds mzvi aeration with 94 1 decolorization in fact mzvi was so superior to mzval in terms of catalytic behavior and reducing action for pds activation and in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide 3 4 the effect of anions on ab9 removal in pds mzvi aeration anions are often known as an inhibitory agent in aops since pds mzvi aeration consists of pds generated h2o2 ferrous ions and mzvi heterogeneous catalyst anions can affect the oxidants the surface of mzvi and also formation of free radicals the effect of several anions in three levels of concentrations 5 10 and 20 mm were studied under 1 5 mm pds ph 5 0 and 0 5 g l mzvi studied anions include chloride nitrate nitrite carbonate sulfate dihydrogen phosphate bromide and iodide ions fig 4 a depicts that chloride ions had a negative effect on ab9 degradation with increase in concentration of chloride ions inhabitation effect was boosted chloride ions can scavenge both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals with constant rate of 2 8 108 and 6 109 m 1 s 1 respectively 34 in addition a chain reaction occurs to consume free radicals to generate hocl with weak reactivity e 1 48 v compared to so4 and ho eqs 13 17 35 13 s o 4 cl cl s o 4 2 14 ho cl cloh 15 cloh cl oh 16 cl cl cl 2 17 cl 2 ho hocl cl fig 4b demonstrates that nitrate ions up to 10 mm concentration had a neutral effect while higher concentrations suppressed the ab9 degradation rate significantly in comparison with other anions nitrate ions have low reactivity with sulfate radicals with rate constant of 2100 m 1 s 1 36 hence nitrate ions cannot be a strong scavenger for the main system however its hampering effect might be originated from the adsorption of nitrate ions on the mzvi leading to decrease surface catalytic activity of mzvi it should be noted that these results were consistent with other pds based processes 36 37 the effect of sulfate ions on ab9 degradation is presented in fig 4c low level of sulfate ions did not affect ab9 degradation while higher concentrations of sulfate ions 10 and 20 mm reduced the ab9 degradation in a way that 76 of ab9 was eliminated during 50 min compared to 94 in control condition the higher concentration of sulfate ions could affect the oxidation reduction potential orp of so4 so4 2 indeed according nernst equation for half reaction so4 e so4 2 higher concentration of sulfate ions decreases of redox potential of so4 so4 2 reducing the dye removal efficiency 38 the effect of carbonate ions was considered for pds mzvi aeration process and the results are presented in fig 4d carbonate ion is well known as a strong scavenger for hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals based process as can be seen the presence of carbonate ions in all levels significantly decreased the performance of pds mzvi aeration process carbonate ion has a high reaction rate with hydroxyl radical 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 and sulfate radical 6 1 106 m 1 s 1 39 carbonate radical produced co3 is a weak oxidant which is ignored as oxidation agent for degradation of organic pollutants 40 moreover carbonate radical removes hydrogen peroxide and persulfate from activation cycle and produces hydroperoxyl radicals and perxydisulfate radicals the scavenging reactions carbonate ions are listed as follow 18 s o 4 c o 3 2 c o 3 s o 4 2 19 h o c o 3 2 c o 3 h o 20 h 2 o 2 c o 3 h c o 3 h o 2 21 s 2 o 8 2 c o 3 s 2 o 8 c o 3 2 besides as above mentioned pds mzvi aeration is highly depended on solution ph carbonate ions significantly increased solution ph in which with adding 5 10 and 20 mm sodium carbonate solution ph increased to 7 9 10 2 and 12 3 respectively as above mentioned alkaline conditions decreases iron releasing from mzvi in addition higher ph solution precipitates ferrous and ferric ions in form of hydroxide fe oh n that are not able to activate pds and h2o2 41 hence carbonate ion is a powerful inhibiting agent for pds mzvi aeration due to removing free radicals precipitating iron and increasing solution ph the effect of dihydrogen phosphate h2po4 was also studied on ab9 degradation under 50 min reaction time fig 4e at 5 mm h2po4 there was a slight reduction in ab9 degradation rate but a notable reduction was observed at higher dosages of h2po4 10 and 20 mm in spite of scavenging effect of h2po4 phosphate species has an attaching property preventing surface reaction of mzvi with pds as the most important reason for reduction of ab9 degradation rate in presence of h2po4 it should be mentioned to the precipitation of iron phosphate at the solution 42 in fact iron released is consumed for precipitation of dihydrogen phosphate instead of pds and h2o2 activation the effect of nitrite ions has been rarely considered for aops due to high quenching property of nitrite ions fig 4f demonstrates the effect of nitrite ion on ab9 degradation during 50 min similar with carbonate ions nitrite ion acts as a potent scavenger for free radicals as shown in fig 4f in the presence of no2 ab9 degradation rate is considerably decreased nitrite ion in three levels repressed ab9 degradation rate in which ab9 removals were less than 15 nitrite radical no2 as product of scavenging effect of nitrite on sulfate radical and hydroxyl radicals eqs 22 and 23 is a weak oxidation agent with low redox potential e 1 1 v moreover nitrite ions probably remove h2o2 through direct reaction the reaction of nitrite ions with hydrogen peroxide produces peroxynitrous acid which is not stable in solution and is decomposed to nitrate ions 43 these sequential reactions may occur for pds and nitrite to generate nitrate hence pds and h2o2 activation may be disturbed in the presence of nitrite 22 s o 4 n o 2 n o 2 s o 4 2 23 h o n o 2 n o 2 h o 24 h 2 o 2 n o 2 h o o n o h o 25 h o o n o n o 3 h the effect of iodide ion as ki on ab9 degradation by pds mzvi aeration was also investigated fig 4g iodide ion reduced ab9 removal markedly in similar trend for three levels 5 10 and 20 mm accordingly around 44 ab9 removal was achieved in the presence of iodide ions during 50 min reaction time iodide ion can scavenge both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals through eq 26 iodine radical i with redox potential e 1 35 v has low reactivity for the degradation of organic compounds 44 moreover iodide ions react with pds and h2o2 in acidic condition to produce iodine it has been reported that ki can be an inhibiting agent for surface bond preventing reaction of pds with mzvi 45 46 hence iodide ion has adverse effect on both reaction solution and surface of catalyst 26 s o 4 o r h o i s o 4 2 o r h o i the effect of bromide ions br on ab9 removal is shown in fig 4h as the concentration of br increases the ab9 removal rate is decreased in which at the 20 mm br a significant decrease was observable the bromide ion can potentially scavenge sulfate radicals with high rate constant 4 73 1010 m 1 s 1 as shown in eq 27 bromine radical is generated with redox potential of e 2 0 v 36 47 the presence of high concentration of bromide ion can result in the formation of br2 1 62 10 11 m 1 s 1 according to eq 28 accordingly the main agent of oxidation so4 would be removed in the presence of bromide ions 27 s o 4 b r b r s o 4 2 28 b r b r b r 2 according to results the order of inhibiting effect of anions on the performance of pds mzvi aeration system follows co3 2 no2 i h2po4 br cl no3 so4 2 3 5 quenching experiments the contribution of sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals can be determined by quenching experiments the tert butyl alcohol tba and ethanol etoh efficaciously quench hydroxyl radicals and both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals respectively in order to study these quenchers two concentrations were considered 100 and 300 mm according to the rate constant of tba with hydroxyl radicals 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and sulfate radicals 4 9 1 104 m 1 s 1 48 and the rate constant of etoh with hydroxyl radicals 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and sulfate radicals 1 6 7 7 104 m 1 s 1 49 sulfate radical contribution is determined by difference between ab9 degradation in the presence of etoh and tba fig 5 demonstrates ab9 degradation rate in the presence of tba and etoh at 100 mm tba there was no change compared to control condition with increase of tba concentration 300 mm a small reduction in ab9 degradation rate was observed this indicated negligible contribution of the ho species in ab9 degradation on the other hand in the presence of 100 mm etoh ab9 degradation reached 47 in 50 min this reduction in ab9 degradation was intensified in 300 mm etoh in a way that only 23 of the dye was eliminated during 50 min these results indicated that so4 radicals were dominant and played the main role in ab9 degradation during pds mzvi aeration system 3 6 mineralization and carboxylic acid monitoring blue acid dyes are often large molecules which are hard to degradation although high decolorization was obtained for pds mzvi aeration it cannot be enough in point of environmental view hence mineralization degree should be determined by toc index fig 6 a shows decolorization and toc removal during 120 min reaction as previous indicated decolorization rate was very rapid in which at only 15 min 87 of ab9 was degraded and more than 95 of ab9 was removed at 30 min on the other hand toc removal was gradually enhanced by reaction time only 18 1 of toc was eliminated at 15 min reaction time while after 120 min toc removal obtained was 60 4 according to pseudo first order reaction rate constants for toc and ab9 removals were obtained 0 0079 and 0 2039 min 1 respectively ab9 degraded by pds mzvi aeration process was analyzed by hplc to determine carboxylic acids generated through oxidation of ab9 five conventional carboxylic acids tartronic succinic malic oxalic and formic acids were monitored during 120 min reaction fig 6b demonstrates the concentration of carboxylic acids generated resulting from ab9 oxidation by pds mzvi aeration tartronic succinic and malic acids directly derive from the opening ring and cleavage of aromatic rings ab9 with five aromatic rings is destructed probably by cleavage of aromatic rings as shown the concentration of tartronic and malic acids were 9 2 and 5 1 mg l at the first 30 min respectively after 30 min their concentrations tartronic and malic acids were decreased to 1 5 and 1 2 mg l respectively while the concentration of succinic acid was almost constant during oxidation reaction the reduction of these compounds may result in the production of oxalic and formic acids it has been reported that tartronic and malic acids are transformed into oxalic and formic acids 50 oxalic and formic acids are well known as final organic compounds since they can be directly mineralized in current study oxalic acid concentration was raised up to 9 4 mg l at 90 min reaction time further oxidation after 90 min decreased the concentration to 3 3 mg l these results indicated that further oxidation led to generation of the small molecules of carboxylic acids and consequently efficient mineralization 3 7 iron release to the solution iron released in the solution was monitored during reaction time fig 7 shows the concentration of total fe and ferrous ions in different processes in the main process pds mzvi aeration total iron was increased during 50 min reaction time and reached 35 1 mg l fig 7a the concentration of ferrous ions was enhanced to 28 8 mg l at 30 min reaction time after that reaction time a decrease trend was observed from 30 to 50 min reaction time in which ferrous ion concentration obtained was 22 5 mg l this decrease can be an evidence for the formation of iron hydroxides and consumption of ferrous ion by pds and the generation of sulfate radicals a lower production of iron both fe ii and total iron was observed in pds mzvi fig 7b 28 7 mg l total iron and 20 1 mg l of fe2 were released in pds mzvi process during 50 min reaction time similar with previous system a decline in fe2 concentration was observed after 40 min reaction these results demonstrated that the presence of aeration in pds mzvi aeration system increased releasing iron in the solution and improved the generation of free radicals iron releasing of mzvi was significantly reduced in mzvi aeration system fig 7c indicating that pds is a powerful agent for the oxidation of mzvi surface and corrosion of iron in this way there were 15 6 mg l of total iron and 11 1 mg l of ferrous ion in 50 min reaction time these values were dropped when mzvi was applied alone in the solution fig 7d this illustrated that aeration had a bold role in iron releasing in the solution accordingly sole application of mzvi released only 10 0 mg l total iron and 7 3 mg l fe2 in the solution based on fig 7 the presence of oxidants pds generated h2o2 and oxygen aeration had a pivotal role in releasing of iron to determine the efficacy of mzvi to generate iron in the solution the ratio of released total iron to mzvi dosage was calculated based on following equation 29 i r o n e f f i c i e n c y t o t a l i r o n r e l e a s e d m z v i d o s a g e 100 iron efficiencies were 7 0 5 76 3 12 and 2 0 for pds mzvi aeration pds mzvi mzvi aeration and mzvi respectively the concurrent presence of pds and aeration increased iron released 3 5 time more than alone mzvi this proved that higher iron released is related to the higher oxidant and decolorization efficiency 3 8 characteristics of reacted mzvi when mzvi particles are oxidized in pds mzvi aeration system they are changed in terms of morphology and structure fig 8 depicts the fesem images and eds spectrums of mzvi before and after the reaction fig 8a implies the results of fesem and eds analyses of mzvi particles which are brain like in micron scale image as li et al demonstrated previously 51 the elements of mzvi consisted of 97 04 of iron and 2 96 of oxygen the surface of mzvi was relatively smooth and mzvi form was clearly brain like fesem and eds analyses of reacted mzvi were presented in fig 8b as can be seen the surface of mzvi was obviously corroded the yellow boxes in fesem image fig 8b demonstrated a flaky and shelly shape of mzvi driven from oxidation by pds and h2o2 besides amount of iron released may be deposited on mzvi in a part of mzvi a precipitated iron was observed in fig 8b red box in fact corrosion and deposition phenomenon took place in surface of mzvi this corrosion induced the reduction of fe element and increase of oxygen element in mzvi in which weigh percent of iron reduced to 59 84 and weigh percent of oxygen increased to 40 16 this result showed that mzvi is gravely oxidized in the presence of pds and h2o2 the results of xrd analysis is presented in fig 9 for mzvi a sharp peak was observed in 44 9 corresponding to zvi which is in a good agreement with reference code 00 001 1267 moreover the peak of 82 7 is also corresponded to zvi after oxidation by pds mzvi aeration process mzvi is completely oxidized to fe2o3 in which the peaks of 33 24 33 70 53 97 and 64 09 were appeared in the spectrum relating to hematite reference code 01 073 0603 52 this result showed that the simultaneous presence of oxidants pds h2o2 and o2 oxidized mzvi to hematite 4 conclusion in this work a new hybrid approach pds mzvi aeration was used for degradation organic pollutants for the first time simultaneous use of pds and generated h2o2 in the presence of mzvi degraded synergistically the dye through more generation of sulfate radicals mzvi played successfully both roles of reductant to generate h2o2 and catalyst source of iron in this system in contrast with mzvi mzval did not demonstrate any activity in the presence of pds and aeration carbonate nitrite and iodide ions strongly inhibited decolorization efficiency in this process carboxylic acids tartronic succinic malic oxalic and formic acids were monitored during oxidation time all carboxylic acids were reduced during 60 min reaction time in which mineralization degree was around 60 after 120 min the presence of pds and aeration improved iron released in the solution the evaluation of reacted mzvi showed that mzvi is oxidized into fe2o3 finally pds mzvi aeration revealed a simple and powerful process for the degradation of organic pollutants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

14027,water pollution by organic dyes has been considered by water and wastewater engineers several methods have been suggested in literature especially advanced oxidation processes peroxydisulfate pds based processes are a powerful technique for the degradation of organic pollutants micro zero valent iron mzvi aeration is also a simple method for the generation of fenton reagent in this study pds mzvi aeration was used for the first time to degrade acid blue 9 ab9 operating parameters various anions iron release and reaction kinetic were comprehensively investigated a rapid degradation of ab9 was observed after only 10 min under conditions of pds 1 5 mm and mzvi 0 5 g l pseudo first order kinetic model was fitted for ab9 degradation with the rate constant of 0 2039 min 1 in contrast with mzvi zero valent aluminum was ineffective to activate pds scavenging tests demonstrated that sulfate radical so4 was dominated for the degradation of ab9 carbonate and nitrite anions almost completely suppressed ab9 degradation the negative effect of anions on the process was based on this order co3 2 no2 i h2po4 br cl no3 so4 2 carboxylic acids generated arise from ab9 degradation were monitored the results showed that further oxidation led to the generation of the small molecules of carboxylic acids around 60 of organic carbon of ab9 was mineralized during 120 min reaction 7 0 of mzvi was released in the solution fesem eds and xrd analyses showed that mzvi was oxidized to fe2o3 finally pds mzvi aeration showed a simple and efficient process for degradation of organic dye keywords zero valent iron organic dye sulfate radicals fenton reagent generation of h2o2 1 introduction dyes are pollutants with large molecules which are considered by environmental scientists due to toxic effect on aquatic environment around 7 105 tons of dyes are annually consumed in the world in which two thirds of them are used in textile industry 1 2 they are often water soluble compounds in which a small amount of them can produce intensive color in water 3 therefore color production is the first important effect on water resources they are extremely resistant to biodegradation due to their toxicity for microbes biodegradation is a slow process and very sensitive to environmental conditions 1 conventional chemical treatments chlorine oxidation coagulation and adsorption are often insufficient for complete removal of dyes and may produce toxic intermediates or sludge due to their low power in mineralization of organic pollutants hence new chemical process is required to investigate the degradation of organic dyes in aqueous solution 4 advanced oxidation processes aops have been extremely used in the degradation of persistent organic pollutants aops are usually classified based on generated reactive radicals including hydroxyl radical based aops and sulfate radical based aops 5 8 aops produce free radicals with high reactive to oxidize organic contaminants there are several methods for the generation of both hydroxyl radicals ho and sulfate so4 pds radicals as a conventional method use of a chemical oxidant has been widely used to produce hydroxyl and sulfate radicals hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and peroxydisulfate anion s2o8 2 have been applied for this purpose 9 10 to active chemical oxidant several methods are suggested to generate free radicals including transition metals carbon based catalysts uv irradiation ultrasound waves heat and electrochemical processes 11 13 zero valent iron zvi is a benign material which is broadly used in aops due to excellent catalytic activity zvi is an excellent alternative for ferrous ions for fenton oxidation since it can gradually release ferrous ions moreover zvi is a practical economic and efficient catalyst for activation of peroxygens 14 16 meanwhile zvi as an alternative of ferrous ions can gradually release ferrous ions zvi has demonstrated high catalytic activity for oxygen to generate hydrogen peroxide and fenton reagent in fact zvi reduces oxygen molecule to generate hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion in acidic conditions and forms fenton reagent for generation of hydroxyl radicals eq 1 in addition hydrogen peroxide also can be reduced to water and produce ferrous ions to generate hydroxyl radical as described at eqs 2 and 3 17 18 zvi aeration is a compelling process for degradation of organic compounds however the adequacy of free radical production for degradation of refractory organic pollutants is doubtful hence enhanced procedure is needed for more production of

also activates both hydrogen peroxide and persulfate simultaneously in fact there are direct and indirect activations for the production of free radical several studies have demonstrated the function of pds zvi 21 24 and zvi aeration 25 26 systems in degradation of organic pollutant in contaminated water howbeit according to literature no study has been reported pds mzvi aeration system for any pollutants yet in this work by focusing on application of pds mzvi aeration for dye degradation we have tested effect of influential factors on the pds mzvi aeration performance into degradation of organic dye acid blue 9 ab9 moreover the effect of some anions was studied on dye removal the kinetic model of dye degradation was also investigated the scavenging experiments were considered to determine contribution of oxidative agents carboxylic acids generated were monitored during oxidation time the characteristics of reacted mzvi were also investigated by several techniques 2 materials

alcohol zanjan company and merck company respectively 2 2 experimental procedure ab9 solution was daily prepared by dissolving 500 mg of ab9 powder in 500 ml double distilled water this solution was kept in a dark place as stock solution 200 ml of ab9 solution 25 mg l was introduced in a cylindrical reactor with volume of 300 ml a known quantity of mzvi was added to the solution an aquarium pump was used for air sparging using air stone aerator with flow of 1 l min the solution ph was adjusted by sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide 0 5 mm a certain amount of pds was added to the solution after that degradation reaction of ab9 was started predetermined amounts of sample were undertaken from the reaction solution at defined reaction time intervals the decolorization rate by pds mzvi aeration system was evaluated as function of solution ph catalyst loading and ps dosage during 50 min reaction to determine the optimum conditions afterwards scavenging and mineralization tests as well as reaction mechanism were performed under the optimized conditions moreover the effect of anions was studied using sodium based salt for sulfate carbonate nitrate and nitrite anions while potassium dihydrogen phosphate was used for the effect of h2po4 on ab9 removal the performance of pds mzvi pds aeration mzvi aeration mzvi pds and aeration systems were exactly examined similar with pds mzvi aeration process in the term of ab9 decolorization 2 3 analytical methods ab9 was measured by a spectrophotometer perkin elmer lambeda 35 according to maximum absorbance of ab9 at visible region 628 nm toc was determined by a toc analyzer shimatzu to determine the mineralization degree of process the concentration of released iron in the solutions was also determined by an atomic absorption

diffraction xrd analysis was carried out by using x ray diffractometer bruker d8 discover usa with monochromatized cu kα radiation λ 1 5418 å at 40 kv and 30 ma the morphology of reacted mzvi was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem analysis mira 3 xmu which is integrated by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds to determine the elements in reacted mzvi 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effects of solution ph mzvi and pds dosages on ab9 degradation in pds mzvi aeration process the effect of the main operating factors on ab9 degradation was studied by focusing on solution ph mzvi and pds dosages the solution ph is influential parameter in zvi based processes due to the effect of ph on zvi corrosion moreover ph can influence h2o2 generation according to eq 2 herein the effect of solution ph on the decolorization efficiency was considered in range of 3 0 11 0 fig 1 a as can be seen acidic and near neutral conditions were suitable for pds mzvi aeration system compared to alkaline media the maximum removal efficiencies were obtained at ph 3 0 and 5 0 during 50 min reaction time low efficiency of ab9 removal in neutral and alkaline conditions can be attributed to the decrease of mzvi oxidation and the reduction of iron released consequently in addition the presence of protons is necessary for hydrogen peroxide generation therefore neutral and alkaline conditions cannot provide sufficient hydrogen ions at ph 3 0 there was a drop in efficiency of ab9 removal compared to ph 5 0 it should be noted that h2o2 is stabilized by excess hydrogen ions ph 3 0 in form of oxonium according eq 6 oxonium is a stable and electrophilic form whose reactivity is low for the reaction with iron to generate hydroxyl radical 27 in addition excess hydrogen ions can have a detrimental effect on aops via scavenging sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals eq 7 strong acidic conditions may also inhibit the generation of sulfate radicals through acid catalyzing persulfate according to eqs 8 and 9 28 the solution ph 5 0 showed high efficiency for pds mzvi aeration process thus it was chosen as optimum value of ph for subsequent tests 6 h 2 o 2 h h 3 o 2 7 s o 4 o r h o h e h s o 4 o r h 2 o 8 h s 2 o 8 2 h s 2 o 8 9 h s 2 o 8 h 2 o h 2 s o 5 h s o 4 the effect of mzvi loading was investigated on ab9 removal over pds mzvi aeration system and the results are presented in fig 1b it is clear that increase in mzvi dosage results in more production of ferrous ions catalyzing both h2o2 and pds for the generation of free oxidizing radicals ab9 removals obtained were 67 1 76 4 77 8 83 4 81 5 for mzvi loading of 0 125 0 25 0 375 0 5 0 625 g l respectively the mzvi loading of 0 5 g l provided the best results for ab9 removal it is worth to mention that the number reactive sites on the mzvi surface decreased significantly through aggregation of catalyst particles at excess dosages of mzvi similar trends have been reported in the literature for the degradation of different organics over sulfate radical based oxidation studies 29 30 the effect of pds dosage on ab9 removal was investigated under ph 5 0 and mzvi loading of 0 5 g l fig 1c with increase in pds dosage enhanced ab9 removal through increase of free radicals resulting from pds activation with adding only 0 25 mm pds ab9 degradation rate was developed and reached 55 4 during 50 min reaction time higher pds dosage accelerated the degradation rate in which around 80 removal efficiency was achieved at only 10 min these results indicated that pds dosage is the main parameter for the generation of free radicals after 1 5 mm pds dosage degradation rate was almost constant the high scavenging effect for excess pds was not observed in this study higher pds concentration probably reacted with ferrous ions rapidly to generate sulfate radicals in this way the reaction rate of sulfate radical with ab9 molecules may be faster than that of sulfate radical with pds 3 2 the evaluation of different processes the ab9 degradation was evaluated by different treatments under 50 min reaction time and similar operating conditions fig 2 a shows ab9 degradation rate by pds mzvi aeration pds aeration mzvi aeration pds aeration and pds mzvi aeration processes fig 2a demonstrates pds mzvi aeration had higher oxidation capacity than other systems pds mzvi and aeration alone indicated a weak performance into ab9 degradation implying minimal adsorption potential of mzvi and also low oxidation ability of pds and aeration these results showed that individual processes were unable for the generation of sufficient free radicals and efficient decolorization mzvi aeration could degrade 32 1 of ab9 in which fenton reagent was likely formed during 50 min time little generation of hydrogen peroxide in mzvi aeration treatment may be the main reason of low removal efficiency of ab9 on the other hand pds mzvi enhanced the degradation efficiency 66 at 10 min indicating that the presence of catalyst and pds is necessary for the generation of adequate reactive oxidizing species however the main treatment pds mzvi aeration demonstrated a significant effect in combination of each component theoretically although aeration can produce hydrogen peroxide it also oxidizes ferrous ions to ferric ions reducing the amount of hydroxyl radicals in the reaction mixture hence enhanced degradation must be found in another mechanism hydrogen peroxide generated can directly react with pds to form hydroxyl and sulfate radicals simultaneously in fact h2o2 was appeared in role of pds activator according to eq 10 31 10 h 2 o 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 s o 4 2 h o to confirm this hypothesis two series experiments i e pds h2o2 and pds mzvi h2o2 were conducted fig 2b depicts degradation rate of ab9 in presence of 1 mm h2o2 1 5 mm pds and 0 5 g l mzvi combined pds h2o2 illustrated a synergistic effect compared sole utilization of h2o2 and pds pds h2o2 degraded 37 8 of dye indicating the formation of free radicals in the reaction solution the results of pds mzvi h2o2 were exactly similar with pds mzvi aeration representing that two phenomena of in situ generation of h2o2 and catalytic behavior of h2o2 for pds activation occurred in the pds mzvi aeration system simultaneously hence the presence of aeration not only is effective for the production of fenton reagent but it also plays an indirect critical role in pds activation pseudo first order kinetic model was used to explain ab9 degradation rate the rate constants k of ab9 degradation was calculated based on the following equation 32 11 ln c 0 c t k t where c 0 and ct are the concentration of ab9 at the first and t reaction time respectively the k is rate constant of pseudo first order model which is obtained through the calculation of slop plotting ln c 0 ct vs t in addition in order to obtain half life t 1 2 of ab9 following equation was used 12 t 1 2 l n 2 k according to fig 2a degradation rate was very rapid at the first 10 min reaction after that the degradation rate was significantly reduced up to 50 min reaction time hence the degradation rate of ab9 is attributed to the first 10 min in fact in this stage oxidants were vigorously consumed by ferrous ions and high amount of free radicals were produced table 2 shows the rate constants r squared correlation between ln c 0 ct vs t and half time of ab9 for different processes as shown the rate constant of the main process was 2 folds and 23 folds more than that of pds mzvi and pds aeration respectively this finding indicated a synergistic effect between components of this process 3 3 comparison of zvi with zero valent aluminum zero valent aluminum has been recently used for pds activation 33 accordingly micro zero valent aluminum mzval was also tested instead of mzvi in pds mzvi aeration fig 3 shows ab9 degradation rate in different treatments as can be seen mzval was totally ineffective for pds activation in pds mzval 14 2 removal efficiency during 50 min reaction and in situ generation of h2o2 in mzval aeration 8 9 removal efficiency in 50 min pds mzval aeration was almost inefficient with 20 3 decolorization efficiency within 50 min compared to pds mzvi aeration with 94 1 decolorization in fact mzvi was so superior to mzval in terms of catalytic behavior and reducing action for pds activation and in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide 3 4 the effect of anions on ab9 removal in pds mzvi aeration anions are often known as an inhibitory agent in aops since pds mzvi aeration consists of pds generated h2o2 ferrous ions and mzvi heterogeneous catalyst anions can affect the oxidants the surface of mzvi and also formation of free radicals the effect of several anions in three levels of concentrations 5 10 and 20 mm were studied under 1 5 mm pds ph 5 0 and 0 5 g l mzvi studied anions include chloride nitrate nitrite carbonate sulfate dihydrogen phosphate bromide and iodide ions fig 4 a depicts that chloride ions had a negative effect on ab9 degradation with increase in concentration of chloride ions inhabitation effect was boosted chloride ions can scavenge both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals with constant rate of 2 8 108 and 6 109 m 1 s 1 respectively 34 in addition a chain reaction occurs to consume free radicals to generate hocl with weak reactivity e 1 48 v compared to so4 and ho eqs 13 17 35 13 s o 4 cl cl s o 4 2 14 ho cl cloh 15 cloh cl oh 16 cl cl cl 2 17 cl 2 ho hocl cl fig 4b demonstrates that nitrate ions up to 10 mm concentration had a neutral effect while higher concentrations suppressed the ab9 degradation rate significantly in comparison with other anions nitrate ions have low reactivity with sulfate radicals with rate constant of 2100 m 1 s 1 36 hence nitrate ions cannot be a strong scavenger for the main system however its hampering effect might be originated from the adsorption of nitrate ions on the mzvi leading to decrease surface catalytic activity of mzvi it should be noted that these results were consistent with other pds based processes 36 37 the effect of sulfate ions on ab9 degradation is presented in fig 4c low level of sulfate ions did not affect ab9 degradation while higher concentrations of sulfate ions 10 and 20 mm reduced the ab9 degradation in a way that 76 of ab9 was eliminated during 50 min compared to 94 in control condition the higher concentration of sulfate ions could affect the oxidation reduction potential orp of so4 so4 2 indeed according nernst equation for half reaction so4 e so4 2 higher concentration of sulfate ions decreases of redox potential of so4 so4 2 reducing the dye removal efficiency 38 the effect of carbonate ions was considered for pds mzvi aeration process and the results are presented in fig 4d carbonate ion is well known as a strong scavenger for hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals based process as can be seen the presence of carbonate ions in all levels significantly decreased the performance of pds mzvi aeration process carbonate ion has a high reaction rate with hydroxyl radical 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 and sulfate radical 6 1 106 m 1 s 1 39 carbonate radical produced co3 is a weak oxidant which is ignored as oxidation agent for degradation of organic pollutants 40 moreover carbonate radical removes hydrogen peroxide and persulfate from activation cycle and produces hydroperoxyl radicals and perxydisulfate radicals the scavenging reactions carbonate ions are listed as follow 18 s o 4 c o 3 2 c o 3 s o 4 2 19 h o c o 3 2 c o 3 h o 20 h 2 o 2 c o 3 h c o 3 h o 2 21 s 2 o 8 2 c o 3 s 2 o 8 c o 3 2 besides as above mentioned pds mzvi aeration is highly depended on solution ph carbonate ions significantly increased solution ph in which with adding 5 10 and 20 mm sodium carbonate solution ph increased to 7 9 10 2 and 12 3 respectively as above mentioned alkaline conditions decreases iron releasing from mzvi in addition higher ph solution precipitates ferrous and ferric ions in form of hydroxide fe oh n that are not able to activate pds and h2o2 41 hence carbonate ion is a powerful inhibiting agent for pds mzvi aeration due to removing free radicals precipitating iron and increasing solution ph the effect of dihydrogen phosphate h2po4 was also studied on ab9 degradation under 50 min reaction time fig 4e at 5 mm h2po4 there was a slight reduction in ab9 degradation rate but a notable reduction was observed at higher dosages of h2po4 10 and 20 mm in spite of scavenging effect of h2po4 phosphate species has an attaching property preventing surface reaction of mzvi with pds as the most important reason for reduction of ab9 degradation rate in presence of h2po4 it should be mentioned to the precipitation of iron phosphate at the solution 42 in fact iron released is consumed for precipitation of dihydrogen phosphate instead of pds and h2o2 activation the effect of nitrite ions has been rarely considered for aops due to high quenching property of nitrite ions fig 4f demonstrates the effect of nitrite ion on ab9 degradation during 50 min similar with carbonate ions nitrite ion acts as a potent scavenger for free radicals as shown in fig 4f in the presence of no2 ab9 degradation rate is considerably decreased nitrite ion in three levels repressed ab9 degradation rate in which ab9 removals were less than 15 nitrite radical no2 as product of scavenging effect of nitrite on sulfate radical and hydroxyl radicals eqs 22 and 23 is a weak oxidation agent with low redox potential e 1 1 v moreover nitrite ions probably remove h2o2 through direct reaction the reaction of nitrite ions with hydrogen peroxide produces peroxynitrous acid which is not stable in solution and is decomposed to nitrate ions 43 these sequential reactions may occur for pds and nitrite to generate nitrate hence pds and h2o2 activation may be disturbed in the presence of nitrite 22 s o 4 n o 2 n o 2 s o 4 2 23 h o n o 2 n o 2 h o 24 h 2 o 2 n o 2 h o o n o h o 25 h o o n o n o 3 h the effect of iodide ion as ki on ab9 degradation by pds mzvi aeration was also investigated fig 4g iodide ion reduced ab9 removal markedly in similar trend for three levels 5 10 and 20 mm accordingly around 44 ab9 removal was achieved in the presence of iodide ions during 50 min reaction time iodide ion can scavenge both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals through eq 26 iodine radical i with redox potential e 1 35 v has low reactivity for the degradation of organic compounds 44 moreover iodide ions react with pds and h2o2 in acidic condition to produce iodine it has been reported that ki can be an inhibiting agent for surface bond preventing reaction of pds with mzvi 45 46 hence iodide ion has adverse effect on both reaction solution and surface of catalyst 26 s o 4 o r h o i s o 4 2 o r h o i the effect of bromide ions br on ab9 removal is shown in fig 4h as the concentration of br increases the ab9 removal rate is decreased in which at the 20 mm br a significant decrease was observable the bromide ion can potentially scavenge sulfate radicals with high rate constant 4 73 1010 m 1 s 1 as shown in eq 27 bromine radical is generated with redox potential of e 2 0 v 36 47 the presence of high concentration of bromide ion can result in the formation of br2 1 62 10 11 m 1 s 1 according to eq 28 accordingly the main agent of oxidation so4 would be removed in the presence of bromide ions 27 s o 4 b r b r s o 4 2 28 b r b r b r 2 according to results the order of inhibiting effect of anions on the performance of pds mzvi aeration system follows co3 2 no2 i h2po4 br cl no3 so4 2 3 5 quenching experiments the contribution of sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals can be determined by quenching experiments the tert butyl alcohol tba and ethanol etoh efficaciously quench hydroxyl radicals and both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals respectively in order to study these quenchers two concentrations were considered 100 and 300 mm according to the rate constant of tba with hydroxyl radicals 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and sulfate radicals 4 9 1 104 m 1 s 1 48 and the rate constant of etoh with hydroxyl radicals 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and sulfate radicals 1 6 7 7 104 m 1 s 1 49 sulfate radical contribution is determined by difference between ab9 degradation in the presence of etoh and tba fig 5 demonstrates ab9 degradation rate in the presence of tba and etoh at 100 mm tba there was no change compared to control condition with increase of tba concentration 300 mm a small reduction in ab9 degradation rate was observed this indicated negligible contribution of the ho species in ab9 degradation on the other hand in the presence of 100 mm etoh ab9 degradation reached 47 in 50 min this reduction in ab9 degradation was intensified in 300 mm etoh in a way that only 23 of the dye was eliminated during 50 min these results indicated that so4 radicals were dominant and played the main role in ab9 degradation during pds mzvi aeration system 3 6 mineralization and carboxylic acid monitoring blue acid dyes are often large molecules which are hard to degradation although high decolorization was obtained for pds mzvi aeration it cannot be enough in point of environmental view hence mineralization degree should be determined by toc index fig 6 a shows decolorization and toc removal during 120 min reaction as previous indicated decolorization rate was very rapid in which at only 15 min 87 of ab9 was degraded and more than 95 of ab9 was removed at 30 min on the other hand toc removal was gradually enhanced by reaction time only 18 1 of toc was eliminated at 15 min reaction time while after 120 min toc removal obtained was 60 4 according to pseudo first order reaction rate constants for toc and ab9 removals were obtained 0 0079 and 0 2039 min 1 respectively ab9 degraded by pds mzvi aeration process was analyzed by hplc to determine carboxylic acids generated through oxidation of ab9 five conventional carboxylic acids tartronic succinic malic oxalic and formic acids were monitored during 120 min reaction fig 6b demonstrates the concentration of carboxylic acids generated resulting from ab9 oxidation by pds mzvi aeration tartronic succinic and malic acids directly derive from the opening ring and cleavage of aromatic rings ab9 with five aromatic rings is destructed probably by cleavage of aromatic rings as shown the concentration of tartronic and malic acids were 9 2 and 5 1 mg l at the first 30 min respectively after 30 min their concentrations tartronic and malic acids were decreased to 1 5 and 1 2 mg l respectively while the concentration of succinic acid was almost constant during oxidation reaction the reduction of these compounds may result in the production of oxalic and formic acids it has been reported that tartronic and malic acids are transformed into oxalic and formic acids 50 oxalic and formic acids are well known as final organic compounds since they can be directly mineralized in current study oxalic acid concentration was raised up to 9 4 mg l at 90 min reaction time further oxidation after 90 min decreased the concentration to 3 3 mg l these results indicated that further oxidation led to generation of the small molecules of carboxylic acids and consequently efficient mineralization 3 7 iron release to the solution iron released in the solution was monitored during reaction time fig 7 shows the concentration of total fe and ferrous ions in different processes in the main process pds mzvi aeration total iron was increased during 50 min reaction time and reached 35 1 mg l fig 7a the concentration of ferrous ions was enhanced to 28 8 mg l at 30 min reaction time after that reaction time a decrease trend was observed from 30 to 50 min reaction time in which ferrous ion concentration obtained was 22 5 mg l this decrease can be an evidence for the formation of iron hydroxides and consumption of ferrous ion by pds and the generation of sulfate radicals a lower production of iron both fe ii and total iron was observed in pds mzvi fig 7b 28 7 mg l total iron and 20 1 mg l of fe2 were released in pds mzvi process during 50 min reaction time similar with previous system a decline in fe2 concentration was observed after 40 min reaction these results demonstrated that the presence of aeration in pds mzvi aeration system increased releasing iron in the solution and improved the generation of free radicals iron releasing of mzvi was significantly reduced in mzvi aeration system fig 7c indicating that pds is a powerful agent for the oxidation of mzvi surface and corrosion of iron in this way there were 15 6 mg l of total iron and 11 1 mg l of ferrous ion in 50 min reaction time these values were dropped when mzvi was applied alone in the solution fig 7d this illustrated that aeration had a bold role in iron releasing in the solution accordingly sole application of mzvi released only 10 0 mg l total iron and 7 3 mg l fe2 in the solution based on fig 7 the presence of oxidants pds generated h2o2 and oxygen aeration had a pivotal role in releasing of iron to determine the efficacy of mzvi to generate iron in the solution the ratio of released total iron to mzvi dosage was calculated based on following equation 29 i r o n e f f i c i e n c y t o t a l i r o n r e l e a s e d m z v i d o s a g e 100 iron efficiencies were 7 0 5 76 3 12 and 2 0 for pds mzvi aeration pds mzvi mzvi aeration and mzvi respectively the concurrent presence of pds and aeration increased iron released 3 5 time more than alone mzvi this proved that higher iron released is related to the higher oxidant and decolorization efficiency 3 8 characteristics of reacted mzvi when mzvi particles are oxidized in pds mzvi aeration system they are changed in terms of morphology and structure fig 8 depicts the fesem images and eds spectrums of mzvi before and after the reaction fig 8a implies the results of fesem and eds analyses of mzvi particles which are brain like in micron scale image as li et al demonstrated previously 51 the elements of mzvi consisted of 97 04 of iron and 2 96 of oxygen the surface of mzvi was relatively smooth and mzvi form was clearly brain like fesem and eds analyses of reacted mzvi were presented in fig 8b as can be seen the surface of mzvi was obviously corroded the yellow boxes in fesem image fig 8b demonstrated a flaky and shelly shape of mzvi driven from oxidation by pds and h2o2 besides amount of iron released may be deposited on mzvi in a part of mzvi a precipitated iron was observed in fig 8b red box in fact corrosion and deposition phenomenon took place in surface of mzvi this corrosion induced the reduction of fe element and increase of oxygen element in mzvi in which weigh percent of iron reduced to 59 84 and weigh percent of oxygen increased to 40 16 this result showed that mzvi is gravely oxidized in the presence of pds and h2o2 the results of xrd analysis is presented in fig 9 for mzvi a sharp peak was observed in 44 9 corresponding to zvi which is in a good agreement with reference code 00 001 1267 moreover the peak of 82 7 is also corresponded to zvi after oxidation by pds mzvi aeration process mzvi is completely oxidized to fe2o3 in which the peaks of 33 24 33 70 53 97 and 64 09 were appeared in the spectrum relating to hematite reference code 01 073 0603 52 this result showed that the simultaneous presence of oxidants pds h2o2 and o2 oxidized mzvi to hematite 4 conclusion in this work a new hybrid approach pds mzvi aeration was used for degradation organic pollutants for the first time simultaneous use of pds and generated h2o2 in the presence of mzvi degraded synergistically the dye through more generation of sulfate radicals mzvi played successfully both roles of reductant to generate h2o2 and catalyst source of iron in this system in contrast with mzvi mzval did not demonstrate any activity in the presence of pds and aeration carbonate nitrite and iodide ions strongly inhibited decolorization efficiency in this process carboxylic acids tartronic succinic malic oxalic and formic acids were monitored during oxidation time all carboxylic acids were reduced during 60 min reaction time in which mineralization degree was around 60 after 120 min the presence of pds and aeration improved iron released in the solution the evaluation of reacted mzvi showed that mzvi is oxidized into fe2o3 finally pds mzvi aeration revealed a simple and powerful process for the degradation of organic

14028,laccase was produced by cultivation of trametes versicolor on non expensive substrates barley husk and eggshell in solid state conditions an efficiency of crude laccase extract in free and immobilized form for the degradation of aniline based dye was investigated in batch experiments up to 91 of dye conversion was achieved using free crude enzyme while the use of partially purified enzyme led to 60 9 of conversion crude laccase was immobilized on calcium alginate beads and used in 10 cycles repetitive batch experiments where complete decolourization was achieved the results of this study suggest that a barley husk and eggshell can be used for laccase production without the need to add additional carbon and nitrogen sources or mineral compounds b crude laccase entrapped in alginate beads can be applied in aniline based dye decolourization in repetitive batch experiments keywords solid state fermentation t versicolor laccase dye decolourization water purification 1 introduction azo dyes belong to the largest and diverse group of textile dyes with the high recalcitrance and the low biodegradability whereby their persistence in the environment even at the low concentrations can be harmful to living organisms they are one of the oldest organic compounds to be synthesized industrially 1 aniline purple created by william henry perkin in 1856 was the first commercially available synthetic dye 2 today problems related to dyes environmental contamination have reached wide scales even though azo dyes are organic pollutants they are being used in different industries they are known to be resistant to photobleaching light water oxidizing agents high temperature washing detergents and microbial attacks therefore removing them from effluents is challenging especially having on mind that they are toxic endocrine disruptors mutagens and carcinogens 3 biological methods such as application of bacteria fungi or algae can be a good alternative to the existing physical chemical or combined physicochemical methods for the decolourization and degradation of dyes 1 4 5 in biological processes several factors affect the decolourization and degradation of dyes such as temperature ph concentration of dissolved oxygen dye structure and concentration electron donors and the presence of redox mediators aerobic wastewater treatment methods which are commonly used in different industries are inefficient because dyes are highly stable to biological oxidation and they poorly adsorb on activated sludge some bacterial and fungal genera can degrade azo dyes whereas numerous studies are focused on exploring the lignin degrading white rot fungi 6 8 the mechanism of dye removal by bacteria or fungi occurs by dye adsorption on the biomass called biosorption biosorption is defined as the passive uptake of organic or inorganic species from aqueous solutions by microbial biomasses or waste materials such as e g lignocellulose 9 the low ph needed for optimal activities of fungal enzymes the long hydraulic retention time to obtain complete decolorization possible toxicity of dyes for the microorganism as well as later disposal of the microorganism with adsorbed dyes are some of the limitations of application of fungi in dyes removal 10 in general the use of pure enzymes such as e g laccases brings important benefits 4 laccase decolorizes azo dyes through a highly nonspecific free radical mechanism thereby avoiding the formation of toxic aromatic amines 11 as well known the use of soluble enzymes limits practical application owing to enzyme s non reusability sensitivity towards denaturing agents and the low stability 12 if immobilized enzyme is used it is possible to increase the enzyme stability facilitate

beads are used for laccase immobilization previously crosslinked with glutaraldehyde for the purpose of bisphenol a removal 19 solid state fermentation ssf is cultivation of microorganisms on solid substrates mainly lignocellulose under controlled conditions ssf has received much attention in the past decades because of the great environmental concern and the fact that the process is cheaper compared to submerged cultivation in this work laccase was produced by cultivation of t versicolor on barley husk with or without the addition of eggshell these materials are chosen based on their broad availability chemical composition and properties and because they have never been exploited for this purpose so far barley husk is a lignocellulose type of the waste from food industry to use barley in a bakery or in a human diet it is necessary to remove the husk from the kernel because husk is not digestible eggshell can be easily collected from restaurants or households considering basic aspects of solid state fermentation technology such as the importance of the suitable substrate s particle size and oxygen transfer limitations combination of those two substrates is ideal there is no need to use extra energy for milling because barley husk size is optimal for solid state fermentation for example harvest residues or fruit peels need to be milled or cut prior fermentation this is important since it can have positive influence on the process costs the purpose of eggshell is to improve the porosity of nutrient media and to enable oxygen transfer deeper inside the reaction

until the tracking dye reached the bottom gel was stained with coomassie brilliant blue stain 2 5 3 effect of ph temperature and metal ions on laccase activity in order to evaluate the effect of temperature and ph on laccase activity activities of crude and partially purified enzymes were measured influence of ph was evaluated in the range from ph 2 5 to ph 6 using 0 1 mol dm 3 glycine hcl buffer while influence of the temperature was analysed in the range from 20 c to 90 c in both experiments 3 mmol dm 3 abts solution was used as a substrate each measurement was carried out in triplicate in order to determine the influence of metals on laccase activity 8 different metal ions fe2 mn2 mg2 hg2 zn2 cu2 k and ca2 in the form of salts were added in reaction mixture in the concentration of 20 mmol dm 3 the mixture was pre incubated for 30 min at 25 c on laboratory shaker at 600 rpm thermo shaker thermo fisher scientific co ltd china 2 6 laccase immobilization crude enzyme was entrapped in alginate beads according to the procedure described elsewhere 27 briefly 0 4 g of sodium alginate was dissolved in 30 cm3 of 0 1 mol dm 3 glycine hcl buffer ph 4 after 30 min of mixing 5 cm3 of crude enzyme solution γ enzyme 0 174 mg cm 3 was added the solution was mixed for additional 15 min to achieve homogeneity the beads were formed by dripping the polymer solution

out in a 100 cm3 glass reactor with the reaction volume of 50 cm3 using suspended enzyme as a biocatalyst as described in table 1 initial dye concentration in all experiments was 75 mg dm 3 the reaction started with the addition of 5 cm3 of crude laccase suspension v a 620 28 u dm 3 γ enzyme 0 174 mg cm 3 or 2 1 cm3 of partially purified laccase solution v a 608 25 u dm 3 γ enzyme 0 021 mg cm 3 to aqueous solution of dye the reaction mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer 400 rpm hot plate stirrer sb162 3 camlab uk and dye decolourization was followed spectrophotometrically as described below the percentage of decolourization was calculated in comparison to control samples that were not treated with the enzyme repetitive batch experiments two repetitive batch experiments were carried out in a 100 cm3 glass reactor with the reaction volume of 50 cm3 alginate beads with entrapped enzyme were used as catalysts alginate beads without enzyme were used in order to investigate the influence of dye adsorption on alginate beads on reaction rate experimental conditions were given in table 1 initial dye concentration in all experiments was 75 mg cm 3 the reaction started with the addition of alginate beads with or without the entrapped enzyme to aqueous solution of dye a fresh dye was added into the reactor every 24 h to assure always the same initial dye concentration the reaction mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer 400 rpm hot plate stirrer sb162 3 camlab uk and dye decolourization was followed spectrophotometrically as described below 2 8 measurements of dye concentration concentration of dye was measured spectrophotometrically at 548 nm after the sample was centrifuged hettich universal 320r andreas hettich gmbh co kg germany at 14

eq 1 1 d r e l a t i v e a c t i v i t y d t k d r e l a t i v e a c t i v i t y it was estimated by non linear regression analysis from experimental data the least squares method implemented in the scientist 3 0 software package micromath saint louis mo usa was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 laccase production during solid state fermentation given the previous experience in the field of solid state fermentation that the particle size of substrate moisture level inoculum concentration oxygen availability and sensitivity to mechanical mixing are some of the crucial parameters the process was designed in the way to obtain maximal efficiency 20 23 the results of volume activities of laccase during solid state fermentation are presented in fig 2 a while the moisture level and weight loss are presented in fig 2b the highest laccase activity was obtained after 7 days of cultivation in all three experiments varying from 270 u dm 3 to 306 u dm 3 in both cases the addition of eggshell had positive effect on laccase production therefore for the purpose of laccase purification and immobilization as well as for further application in dye decolorization experiments additional solid state fermentation experiments were performed with the use of eggshell powder to obtain the sufficient volume of crude laccase extracts the weight loss was monitored daily and in experiment without the addition of eggshell the weight loss was 14 74 lower weight loss occurred in experiments performed with the addition of crushed eggshell 13 42 while the addition of eggshell powder caused even lower weight loss 11 53 this is probably the consequence of the fact that the eggshell is not degraded by fungi eggshells act as a support for microorganism s growth and contribute to the better rheology of reaction mixture enabling more free spaces between the barley husk particles and consequently allowing more air to diffuse between the particles additionally it is a source of calcium ions which can act as laccase inducer laccase gene transcription is often regulated by metal ions 28 and it can be stimulated by calcium ions 29 the moisture level slightly decreased in experiment performed without addition of eggshell from 59 to 53 this mean that the loss of water by evaporation and water consumption for the hydrolysis of polysaccharides were higher than the water production by fungal metabolism in experiments performed with the addition of eggshells slight increase of moisture occurred from 57 to 59 in experiment with crushed eggshell and from 59 to 62 in experiment with eggshell powder as more water has been generated than consumed 3 2 laccase purification and characterization the laccase from t versicolor was partially purified by precipitation and dialysis with the yield of 40 49 table 2 additional purification steps such as gel chromatography or ion exchange chromatography were not applied because they increase overall purification costs and could not be justified since this work aims to develop a cost effective process before purification crude laccase was analysed on sds page a single band appeared on a gel the molecular weight was estimated to be 70 kda fig 3 this confirms previous findings in the literature where molecular weights of the most fungal laccase monomers are in the range from 50 to 90 kda 15 30 32 the majority of laccases from basidiomycetes have molecular weights from 55 to 80 kda 33 35 laccases from t versicolor are known to have molecular weights of 62 kda 28 66 kda 27 and 76 kda 26 in order to determine the enzyme activity and stability enzyme characterization was done the results of the influence of storage temperatures t 20 c 4 c 25 c on laccase activity are presented in fig 4 the original measurements are expressed as relative activities proteins are often unstable outside the native environments 36 and they can rapidly lose the ability to perform specific functions the loss of the activity can be the consequence of proteolysis aggregation and or storages under non optimal conditions crude laccase was stable within the first 11 days of storage at 25 c but after 20 days it lost approximately 50 of its activity activity of the enzyme stored at 4 c started to increase from the 2nd to the 11th day of the storage after 20 days enzyme activity was 1 72 times higher than the initial one activity of the samples kept at 20 c showed the similar trend with those kept at 4 c whereas the enzyme activity was 1 32 times higher after 20 days of the storage compared to the initial sample our observations are consistent with the previous researches 37 39 according to literature 40 two effects could be responsible for such behaviour such as the change of the ratio of monomeric and aggregated enzyme molecules in the solution and the change of the active site conformation after thermal treatment stepanova et al 41 confirmed that during the laccase incubation at 25 c the change of all three copper centres occurred in the way that they were rearranged the results of the influence of ph temperature and metal ions on laccase activity are given in fig 5 a c the highest enzyme activity for both crude and partially purified laccase was determined in a 0 1 mol dm 3 glycine hcl buffer at ph 4 partially purified laccase was less active towards abts in different ph then crude laccase at ph 5 5 no abts oxidation was noticed and the relative activity of crude laccase was about 40 the possible reason for this is the presence of other enzymes in crude extract the ph optimum of laccases is highly dependent on the substrate for abts the optimal ph is between ph 3 and ph 5 42 minussi et al 43 discovered that t versicolor cct 4521 strain had two isoenzymes with ph optimum of 4 for l1 and ph 5 for l2 isoenzyme laccase from trametes sp ah28 2 has optimal ph of 4 7 44 regarding the influence of temperature the both crude and partially purified enzyme have high activities in the temperature range from 45 to 70 c with the optimum at 55 c this is in accordance with the results of han et al 45 who isolated laccase from t versicolor 951022 which was stabile over a broad temperature range and showed maximal activity at 50 c the results of the effect of various metal ions in concentrations of 20 mmol dm 3 on the laccase activity showed that both crude and partially purified laccase was strongly inhibited by fe2 and hg2 the possible reason why the presence of hg2 strongly inhibits the laccase is the presence of thiol groups in laccase which are essential for the activity and hg2 shows high affinity towards thiol groups 46 xiwen et al 47 reported that fe2 inhibits laccase according to competitive inhibition there is no impact on the active centre of laccase but fe2 can react with abts when fe2 transfers completely in a form of fe3 there is no inhibition and the catalytic reaction continues 47 all metal ions except cu2 inhibited crude enzyme activity leaving its residual activity from 66 mg2 to 85 mn2 it is interesting to note that the activity of laccase was increased with the addition of copper knowing that the copper is one of the main metals found within the dye chromophores in textile effluents 48 in the case of partially purified laccase laccase activity was increased with the addition of cu2 and zn2 it is important to emphasise that compared to our research lower metal concentrations were tested in other researches 26 47 usually in the range from 1 to 10 mmol dm 3 however according to yaseen and scholz 48 metal concentrations can vary significantly depending on dye source brazkova et al 26 published that cadmium has a significant inhibition effect on laccase from t versicolor the inhibition increased from 8 to 60 with the increase of cadmium concentration from 8 mmol dm 3 to 10 mmol dm 3 3 3 dye decolourization experiments all experiments of dye decolourization with crude and partially purified laccase were performed using the same initial dye concentration and without the presence of any redox mediator dye concentration of 75 mg dm 3 was selected to obtain around 0 5 absorbance unit at the maximum wave length in the visible spectrum the concentration of dyes in wastewater can be in the range from 10 to 500 mg dm 3 48 50 51 experiments with crude laccase extracts were performed at three different process conditions the results are presented in fig 6 a two experiments were performed at 25 c using dye dissolved in water and dye dissolved in the buffer at ph which was previously shown to be optimal for laccase ph 4 after 24 h 24 9 of dye conversion was achieved in experiment performed in water it took 7 days to obtain conversion of 37 0 the reason for such low conversion can be attributed to the low laccase activity at ph 7 which was most likely below 20 according to trend presented in fig 5a after 24 h laccase lost 28 of its activity at the end of the process enzyme still held 43 8 of its initial activity even though we assumed that the conversion would continue to increase experiment was interrupted because the overall conversion in time was significantly lower compared to the other experiments when the experiment was performed in a buffer at ph 4 at 25 c almost two fold higher conversion was achieved after 24 h x 58 1 compared to experiments performed in water there was no improvement in decolourization until the end of experiment enzyme retained 83 9 of its initial activity showing that only slight enzyme deactivation occurred after 24 h however with the time enzyme activity was decreasing due to the increase in ph fig 6a at the end of the process after 168 h laccase remained 6 3 of its initial activity as expected the best results occurred in third experiment which was performed at optimal conditions of ph ph 4 and t 55 c 86 1 of dye decolourization occurred after 24 h while 91 conversion was gained after 72 h the results of enzyme activity showed that enzyme deactivation occurred after 24 h enzyme retained 9 9 of its activity after 72 h enzyme retained 3 4 of the activity this deactivation correlates to data obtained by brazkova et al 26 for laccase from t versicolor they showed that temperature has significant effect on laccase activity which was stable during first 5 h of incubation at different temperatures but after 24 h at t 50 c relative activity of laccase was 80 at the same time at t 60 c relative activity decreased to 40 enzyme was completely deactivated after 48 h in the experiment performed in water at 25 c kd was estimated according to eq 1 to be 0 0065 0 001 h 1 in the experiment performed in a buffer at 25 c kd was estimated to be 0 0154 0 0028 h 1 while in the experiment performed in buffer at 55 c kd was estimated to be 0 0913 0 0124 h 1 following the conclusions drawn from the results of experiments performed with crude enzyme the experiments with partially purified enzyme were performed only in buffer solutions additionally according to the results presented in fig 5a it was shown that partially purified laccase was not active at ph higher than 5 5 the first experiment with partially purified laccase was done at ph 4 and at 25 c and the second one was performed at ph 4 and 55 c the results are presented in fig 6b in this experiment ph was more stable phaverage 4 25 0 15 comparing the results of the experiments performed with crude and partially purified enzyme several conclusions can be made for example after 24 h 62 7 of dye decolorization occurred with partially purified enzyme while 58 1 occurred with crude enzyme fig 6a and b partially purified enzyme was more stable during 72 h of process duration than crude enzyme even though within the first 24 h the residual activity of partially purified enzyme was lower 78 compared with crude enzyme 83 9 in the experiment performed at 55 c overall the best results in the term of conversion 91 were reached when crude enzyme was used here again partially purified enzyme was more stable over a period of time which can be partially attributed to the stable ph phaverage 4 25 0 15 however 60 9 of dye conversion occurred after 72 h in experiment with partially purified enzyme at 55 c which was even lower than it was in experiments performed at 25 c stability decay rate constants were also estimated for partially purified laccase according to eq 1 in experiment performed in a buffer at 25 c kd was estimated to be 0 0069 0 0005 h 1 while in the experiment performed in buffer at 55 c kd was estimated to be 0 0837 0 0309 h 1 reactions with free enzymes are usually faster in comparison to those with immobilized enzymes however free enzymes are not reusable and are usually more sensitive to harsh environmental conditions enzyme immobilization increases enzyme stability protects the enzyme from denaturation makes the separation of the enzyme from the reaction mixture easier and catalytic activity can remain efficient over several reaction cycles 52 up to now laccase has been successfully immobilized on and into different materials 53 laccase from streptomyces psammoticus was used for decolourization of a variety of dyes 3 to 80 of dyes decolourisation occurred depending on the type of dye whereas the best result 80 of dye conversion was reached after 10 days 54 thakur et al 55 performed dye decolourisation in a 50 cm3 flask in batch and fed batch processes under optimal conditions and in the presence of mediator the use of free enzyme in fed batch led to 99 4 of decolourisation approximately the same conversion of dye 77 occurred in both batch and repetitive batch experiments using immobilized enzyme they concluded that there is a potential for using laccase immobilized in alginate beads for bioremediation at large scale 55 as mentioned in materials and method section in this research laccase was entrapped in alginate beads during the immobilization 538 spherical and regular shaped beads were formed with an average diameter of 5 mm measurements of the enzyme concentration in gel before immobilization and in the cacl2 solution after immobilization revealed there was no enzyme leaking and that the immobilization efficiency was 100 enzyme activity was not measured in this point but according to literature entrapment in alginate beads can lead to 25 32 of the loss of laccase activity 56 experiment with immobilized crude enzyme was performed at ph 4 and t 25 c using the same amount of enzyme as in batch experiments performed with free enzyme the certain reaction conditions crude enzyme ph 4 and t 25 c were chosen for several reasons firstly when the decolourization was performed in buffer at 25 c both crude and partially purified laccase gave similar results conversion of approx 60 secondly when the process was performed under optimal conditions ph 4 and t 55 c conversion was the highest but at the same time enzyme deactivation was the fastest in the first 24 h enzyme activity decreased for almost 90 and although immobilization would probably increase the enzyme stability deactivation was still too fast for the continuous process at the end the third reason is economical reason in industrial processes the main awareness is to develop efficient process with minimum expenses the minimum expense demands for the efficient dye decolourization process at 25 c can be fulfilled with immobilized crude laccase that could be reused several times according to literature when using immobilized enzymes dye removal can be caused by two mechanisms one is enzymatic biodegradation and the other is bioaccumulation or biosorption of dye onto alginate beads 57 to demonstrate that decolourization is not just the consequence of adsorption of dye on beads control experiment without the enzyme entrapped in beads was done the reaction started with the addition of alginate beads and alginate beads with entrapped enzyme to aqueous solution of dye while a fresh dye was added in the reactor every 24 h 10 cycles were done in total in each cycle the initial concentration of 75 mg dm 3 of the dye were used the results are presented in fig 7 during the time the samples were taken for the measurements of the dye concentration and laccase activity the laccase activity was measured in order to test the possible enzyme leaking some of the immobilized enzyme was lost from beads because laccase activity of 2 u dm 3 was detected decolouration of aniline by laccase was accompanied by the changes in absorption spectrum when immobilized laccase was used the visible peak 539 nm disappeared after 214 hours indicating total decolouration at the end of experiment after 10 cycles there was no visible peak the same trend of an increase of ph occurred in repetitive batch experiment as well as in all other experiments according to literature laccase immobilized into alginate beads retained 50 of initial activity even after 7 cycles but the process was stopped because beads were oversaturated with dye which caused diffusion problem 55 after inspecting the colour of the beads in control experiment it was noted that the beads became intensively coloured from the data shown in the fig 7a it is visible that a lot of dye was removed as presented in the fig 7b ph increases in the case when the enzyme is immobilized in alginate beads while it remains unchanged when the beads without the enzyme are used which is certainly an indication that the reaction takes place only in the presence of enzyme yet it can be concluded that the dominant mechanism for tested dye is biosorption according to the daâssi et al 58 59 type of mechanism depends on dyes characteristics therefore further work should cover a wider range of dyes and new supports for laccase immobilisation 4 conclusion the advantage of the methodology proposed in this work was a the use of the food industry waste for economically and environmentally friendly process of laccase production b demonstrating the advantage of the use of crude instead of partially purified enzyme for dye decolourization in both free and immobilized forms which significantly influence the process costs c possible application of repetitive batch process of dye degradation with immobilized laccase the future prospective will be in the field of the bioreactor development for the enhancement of the dye degradation process feasibility using laccase immobilized on various supports funding this work was supported by the croatian science foundation

14028,laccase was produced by cultivation of trametes versicolor on non expensive substrates barley husk and eggshell in solid state conditions an efficiency of crude laccase extract in free and immobilized form for the degradation of aniline based dye was investigated in batch experiments up to 91 of dye conversion was achieved using free crude enzyme while the use of partially purified enzyme led to 60 9 of conversion crude laccase was immobilized on calcium alginate beads and used in 10 cycles repetitive batch experiments where complete decolourization was achieved the results of this study suggest that a barley husk and eggshell can be used for laccase production without the need to add additional carbon and nitrogen sources or mineral compounds b crude laccase entrapped in alginate beads can be applied in aniline based dye decolourization in repetitive batch experiments keywords solid state fermentation t versicolor laccase dye decolourization water purification 1 introduction azo dyes belong to the largest and diverse group of textile dyes with the high recalcitrance and the low biodegradability whereby their persistence in the environment even at the low concentrations can be harmful to living organisms they are one of the oldest organic compounds to be synthesized industrially 1 aniline purple created by william henry perkin in 1856 was the first commercially available synthetic dye 2 today problems related to dyes environmental contamination have reached wide scales even though azo dyes are organic pollutants they are being used in different industries they are known to be resistant to photobleaching light water oxidizing agents high temperature washing detergents and microbial attacks therefore removing them from effluents is challenging especially having on mind that they are toxic endocrine disruptors mutagens and carcinogens 3 biological methods such as application of bacteria fungi or algae can be a good alternative to the existing physical chemical or combined physicochemical methods for the decolourization and degradation of dyes 1 4 5 in biological processes several factors affect the decolourization and degradation of dyes such as temperature ph concentration of dissolved oxygen dye structure and concentration electron donors and the presence of redox mediators aerobic wastewater treatment methods which are commonly used in different industries are inefficient because dyes are highly stable to biological oxidation and they poorly adsorb on activated sludge some bacterial and fungal genera can degrade azo dyes whereas numerous studies are focused on exploring the lignin degrading white rot fungi 6 8 the mechanism of dye removal by bacteria or fungi occurs by dye adsorption on the biomass called biosorption biosorption is defined as the passive uptake of organic or inorganic species from aqueous solutions by microbial biomasses or waste materials such as e g lignocellulose 9 the low ph needed for optimal activities of fungal enzymes the long hydraulic retention time to obtain complete decolorization possible toxicity of dyes for the microorganism as well as later disposal of the microorganism with adsorbed dyes are some of the limitations of application of fungi in dyes removal 10 in general the use of pure enzymes such as e g laccases brings important benefits 4 laccase decolorizes azo dyes through a highly nonspecific free radical mechanism thereby avoiding the formation of toxic aromatic amines 11 as well known the use of soluble enzymes limits practical application owing to enzyme s non reusability sensitivity towards denaturing agents and the low stability 12 if immobilized enzyme is used it is possible to increase the enzyme stability facilitate the efficient recovery and re use thus enabling their cost effective use in continuous processes 12 there are several reports on dyes degradation using soluble 13 16 and immobilized laccase 17 18 laccase from trametes pubescens was immobilized on alumina al2o3 spherical pellets 17 while gamma aluminium oxide pellets were used for immobilization of laccase from trametes modesta 18 ca alginate beads are used for laccase immobilization previously crosslinked with glutaraldehyde for the purpose of bisphenol a removal 19 solid state fermentation ssf is cultivation of microorganisms on solid substrates mainly lignocellulose under controlled conditions ssf has received much attention in the past decades because of the great environmental concern and the fact that the process is cheaper compared to submerged cultivation in this work laccase was produced by cultivation of t versicolor on barley husk with or without the addition of eggshell these materials are chosen based on their broad availability chemical composition and properties and because they have never been exploited for this purpose so far barley husk is a lignocellulose type of the waste from food industry to use barley in a bakery or in a human diet it is necessary to remove the husk from the kernel because husk is not digestible eggshell can be easily collected from restaurants or households considering basic aspects of solid state fermentation technology such as the importance of the suitable substrate s particle size and oxygen transfer limitations combination of those two substrates is ideal there is no need to use extra energy for milling because barley husk size is optimal for solid state fermentation for example harvest residues or fruit peels need to be milled or cut prior fermentation this is important since it can have positive influence on the process costs the purpose of eggshell is to improve the porosity of nutrient media and to enable oxygen transfer deeper inside the reaction mixture the aim of the study was to use free and immobilized laccase for dye degradation laccase was produced by cultivation of t versicolor on barley husk and eggshell in solid state conditions an

until the tracking dye reached the bottom gel was stained with coomassie brilliant blue stain 2 5 3 effect of ph temperature and metal ions on laccase activity in order to evaluate the effect of temperature and ph on laccase activity activities of crude and partially purified enzymes were measured influence of ph was evaluated in the range from ph 2 5 to ph 6 using 0 1 mol dm 3 glycine hcl buffer while influence of the temperature was analysed in the range from 20 c to 90 c in both experiments 3 mmol dm 3 abts solution was used as a substrate each measurement was carried out in triplicate in order to determine the influence of metals on laccase activity 8 different metal ions fe2 mn2 mg2 hg2 zn2 cu2 k and ca2 in the form of salts were added in reaction mixture in the concentration of 20 mmol dm 3 the mixture was pre incubated for 30 min at 25 c on laboratory shaker at 600 rpm thermo shaker thermo fisher scientific co ltd china 2 6 laccase immobilization crude

out in a 100 cm3 glass reactor with the reaction volume of 50 cm3 using suspended enzyme as a biocatalyst as described in table 1 initial dye concentration in all experiments was 75 mg dm 3 the

described below the percentage of decolourization was calculated in comparison to control samples that were not treated with the enzyme repetitive batch experiments two repetitive batch experiments were carried out in a 100 cm3 glass reactor with the reaction volume of 50 cm3 alginate beads with entrapped enzyme were used as catalysts alginate beads without enzyme were used in order to investigate the influence of dye adsorption on alginate beads on reaction rate experimental conditions were given in table 1 initial dye concentration in all experiments was 75 mg cm 3 the reaction started with the addition of alginate beads with or without the entrapped enzyme to aqueous solution of dye a fresh dye was added into the reactor every 24 h to assure always the same initial dye concentration the reaction mixture was stirred with a magnetic stirrer 400 rpm hot plate stirrer sb162 3 camlab uk and dye decolourization was followed spectrophotometrically as described below 2 8 measurements of dye concentration concentration of dye was measured spectrophotometrically at 548 nm after the sample was centrifuged hettich universal 320r andreas hettich gmbh co kg germany at 14 000 rpm and 4 c during 5 min 2 9 data processing the first order kinetics was used to describe enzyme operational stability decay rate constant kd for all experimental conditions according to equation eq 1 1 d r e l a t i v e a c t i v i t y d t k d r e l a t i v e a c t i v i t y it was estimated by non linear regression analysis from experimental data the least squares method implemented in the scientist 3 0 software package micromath saint louis mo usa was used 3 results and discussion 3 1 laccase production during solid state fermentation given the previous experience in the field of solid state fermentation that the particle size of substrate moisture level inoculum concentration oxygen availability and sensitivity to mechanical mixing are some of the crucial parameters the process was designed in the way to obtain maximal efficiency 20 23 the results of volume activities of laccase during solid state fermentation are presented in fig 2 a while the moisture level and weight loss are presented in fig 2b the highest laccase activity was obtained after 7 days of cultivation in all three experiments varying from 270 u dm 3 to 306 u dm 3 in both cases the addition of eggshell had positive effect on laccase production therefore for the purpose of laccase purification and immobilization as well as for further application in dye decolorization experiments additional solid state fermentation experiments were performed with the use of eggshell powder to obtain the sufficient volume of crude laccase extracts the weight loss was monitored daily and in experiment without the addition of eggshell the weight loss was 14 74 lower weight loss occurred in experiments performed with the addition of crushed eggshell 13 42 while the addition of eggshell powder caused even lower weight loss 11 53 this is probably the consequence of the fact that the eggshell is not degraded by fungi eggshells act as a support for microorganism s growth and contribute to the better rheology of reaction mixture enabling more free spaces between the barley husk particles and consequently allowing more air to diffuse between the particles additionally it is a source of calcium ions which can act as laccase inducer laccase gene transcription is often regulated by metal ions 28 and it can be stimulated by calcium ions 29 the moisture level slightly decreased in experiment performed without addition of eggshell from 59 to 53 this mean that the loss of water by evaporation and water consumption for the hydrolysis of polysaccharides were higher than the water production by fungal metabolism in experiments performed with the addition of eggshells slight increase of moisture occurred from 57 to 59 in experiment with crushed eggshell and from 59 to 62 in experiment with eggshell powder as more water has been generated than consumed 3 2 laccase purification and characterization the laccase from t versicolor was partially purified by precipitation and dialysis with the yield of 40 49 table 2 additional purification steps such as gel chromatography or ion exchange chromatography were not applied because they increase overall purification costs and could not be justified since this work aims to develop a cost effective process before purification crude laccase was analysed on sds page a single band appeared on a gel the molecular weight was estimated to be 70 kda fig 3 this confirms previous findings in the literature where molecular weights of the most fungal laccase monomers are in the range from 50 to 90 kda 15 30 32 the majority of laccases from basidiomycetes have molecular weights from 55 to 80 kda 33 35 laccases from t versicolor are known to have molecular weights of 62 kda 28 66 kda 27 and 76 kda 26 in order to determine the enzyme activity and stability enzyme characterization was done the results of the influence of storage temperatures t 20 c 4 c 25 c on laccase activity are presented in fig 4 the original measurements are expressed as relative activities proteins are often unstable outside the native environments 36 and they can rapidly lose the ability to perform specific functions the loss of the activity can be the consequence of proteolysis aggregation and or storages under non optimal conditions crude laccase was stable within the first 11 days of storage at 25 c but after 20 days it lost approximately 50 of its activity activity of the enzyme stored at 4 c started to increase from the 2nd to the 11th day of the storage after 20 days enzyme activity was 1 72 times higher than the initial one activity of the samples kept at 20 c showed the similar trend with those kept at 4 c whereas the enzyme activity was 1 32 times higher after 20 days of the storage compared to the initial sample our observations are consistent with the previous researches 37 39 according to literature 40 two effects could be responsible for such behaviour such as the change of the ratio of monomeric and aggregated enzyme molecules in the solution and the change of the active site conformation after thermal treatment stepanova et al 41 confirmed that during the laccase incubation at 25 c the change of all three copper centres occurred in the way that they were rearranged the results of the influence of ph temperature and metal ions on laccase activity are given in fig 5 a c the highest enzyme activity for both crude and partially purified laccase was determined in a 0 1 mol dm 3 glycine hcl buffer at ph 4 partially purified laccase was less active towards abts in different ph then crude laccase at ph 5 5 no abts oxidation was noticed and the relative activity of crude laccase was about 40 the possible reason for this is the presence of other enzymes in crude extract the ph optimum of laccases is highly dependent on the substrate for abts the optimal ph is between ph 3 and ph 5 42 minussi et al 43 discovered that t versicolor cct 4521 strain had two isoenzymes with ph optimum of 4 for l1 and ph 5 for l2 isoenzyme laccase from trametes sp ah28 2 has optimal ph of 4 7 44 regarding the influence of temperature the both crude and partially purified enzyme have high activities in the temperature range from 45 to 70 c with the optimum at 55 c this is in accordance with the results of han et al 45 who isolated laccase from t versicolor 951022 which was stabile over a broad temperature range and showed maximal activity at 50 c the results of the effect of various metal ions in concentrations of 20 mmol dm 3 on the laccase activity showed that both crude and partially purified laccase was strongly inhibited by fe2 and hg2 the possible reason why the presence of hg2 strongly inhibits the laccase is the presence of thiol groups in laccase which are essential for the activity and hg2 shows high affinity towards thiol groups 46 xiwen et al 47 reported that fe2 inhibits laccase according to competitive inhibition there is no impact on the active centre of laccase but fe2 can react with abts when fe2 transfers completely in a form of fe3 there is no inhibition and the catalytic reaction continues 47 all metal ions except cu2 inhibited crude enzyme activity leaving its residual activity from 66 mg2 to 85 mn2 it is interesting to note that the activity of laccase was increased with the addition of copper knowing that the copper is one of the main metals found within the dye chromophores in textile effluents 48 in the case of partially purified laccase laccase activity was increased with the addition of cu2 and zn2 it is important to emphasise that compared to our research lower metal concentrations were tested in other researches 26 47 usually in the range from 1 to 10 mmol dm 3 however according to yaseen and scholz 48 metal concentrations can vary significantly depending on dye source brazkova et al 26 published that cadmium has a significant inhibition effect on laccase from t versicolor the inhibition increased from 8 to 60 with the increase of cadmium concentration from 8 mmol dm 3 to 10 mmol dm 3 3 3 dye decolourization experiments all experiments of dye decolourization with crude and partially purified laccase were performed using the same initial dye concentration and without the presence of any redox mediator dye concentration of 75 mg dm 3 was selected to obtain around 0 5 absorbance unit at the maximum wave length in the visible spectrum the concentration of dyes in wastewater can be in the range from 10 to 500 mg dm 3 48 50 51 experiments with crude laccase extracts were performed at three different process conditions the results are presented in fig 6 a two experiments were performed at 25 c using dye dissolved in water and dye dissolved in the buffer at ph which was previously shown to be optimal for laccase ph 4 after 24 h 24 9 of dye conversion was achieved in experiment performed in water it took 7 days to obtain conversion of 37 0 the reason for such low conversion can be attributed to the low laccase activity at ph 7 which was most likely below 20 according to trend presented in fig 5a after 24 h laccase lost 28 of its activity at the end of the process enzyme still held 43 8 of its initial activity even though we assumed that the conversion would continue to increase experiment was interrupted because the overall conversion in time was significantly lower compared to the other experiments when the experiment was performed in a buffer at ph 4 at 25 c almost two fold higher conversion was achieved after 24 h x 58 1 compared to experiments performed in water there was no improvement in decolourization until the end of experiment enzyme retained 83 9 of its initial activity showing that only slight enzyme deactivation occurred after 24 h however with the time enzyme activity was decreasing due to the increase in ph fig 6a at the end of the process after 168 h laccase remained 6 3 of its initial activity as expected the best results occurred in third experiment which was performed at optimal conditions of ph ph 4 and t 55 c 86 1 of dye decolourization occurred after 24 h while 91 conversion was gained after 72 h the results of enzyme activity showed that enzyme deactivation occurred after 24 h enzyme retained 9 9 of its activity after 72 h enzyme retained 3 4 of the activity this deactivation correlates to data obtained by brazkova et al 26 for laccase from t versicolor they showed that temperature has significant effect on laccase activity which was stable during first 5 h of incubation at different temperatures but after 24 h at t 50 c relative activity of laccase was 80 at the same time at t 60 c relative activity decreased to 40 enzyme was completely deactivated after 48 h in the experiment performed in water at 25 c kd was estimated according to eq 1 to be 0 0065 0 001 h 1 in the experiment performed in a buffer at 25 c kd was estimated to be 0 0154 0 0028 h 1 while in the experiment performed in buffer at 55 c kd was estimated to be 0 0913 0 0124 h 1 following the conclusions drawn from the results of experiments performed with crude enzyme the experiments with partially purified enzyme were performed only in buffer solutions additionally according to the results presented in fig 5a it was shown that partially purified laccase was not active at ph higher than 5 5 the first experiment with partially purified laccase was done at ph 4 and at 25 c and the second one was performed at ph 4 and 55 c the results are presented in fig 6b in this experiment ph was more stable phaverage 4 25 0 15 comparing the results of the experiments performed with crude and partially purified enzyme several conclusions can be made for example after 24 h 62 7 of dye decolorization occurred with partially purified enzyme while 58 1 occurred with crude enzyme fig 6a and b partially purified enzyme was more stable during 72 h of process duration than crude enzyme even though within the first 24 h the residual activity of partially purified enzyme was lower 78 compared with crude enzyme 83 9 in the experiment performed at 55 c overall the best results in the term of conversion 91 were reached when crude enzyme was used here again partially purified enzyme was more stable over a period of time which can be partially attributed to the stable ph phaverage 4 25 0 15 however 60 9 of dye conversion occurred after 72 h in experiment with partially purified enzyme at 55 c which was even lower than it was in experiments performed at 25 c stability decay rate constants were also estimated for partially purified laccase according to eq 1 in experiment performed in a buffer at 25 c kd was estimated to be 0 0069 0 0005 h 1 while in the experiment performed in buffer at 55 c kd was estimated to be 0 0837 0 0309 h 1 reactions with free enzymes are usually faster in comparison to those with immobilized enzymes however free enzymes are not reusable and are usually more sensitive to harsh environmental conditions enzyme immobilization increases enzyme stability protects the enzyme from denaturation makes the separation of the enzyme from the reaction mixture easier and catalytic activity can remain efficient over several reaction cycles 52 up to now laccase has been successfully immobilized on and into different materials 53 laccase from streptomyces psammoticus was used for decolourization of a variety of dyes 3 to 80 of dyes decolourisation occurred depending on the type of dye whereas the best result 80 of dye conversion was reached after 10 days 54 thakur et al 55 performed dye decolourisation in a 50 cm3 flask in batch and fed batch processes under optimal conditions and in the presence of mediator the use of free enzyme in fed batch led to 99 4 of decolourisation approximately the same conversion of dye 77 occurred in both batch and repetitive batch experiments using immobilized enzyme they concluded that there is a potential for using laccase immobilized in alginate beads for bioremediation at large scale 55 as mentioned in materials and method section in this research laccase was entrapped in alginate beads during the immobilization 538 spherical and regular shaped beads were formed with an average diameter of 5 mm measurements of the enzyme concentration in gel before immobilization and in the cacl2 solution after immobilization revealed there was no enzyme leaking and that the immobilization efficiency was 100 enzyme activity was not measured in this point but according to literature entrapment in alginate beads can lead to 25 32 of the loss of laccase activity 56 experiment with immobilized crude enzyme was performed at ph 4 and t 25 c using the same amount of enzyme as in batch experiments performed with free enzyme the certain reaction conditions crude enzyme ph 4 and t 25 c were chosen for several reasons firstly when the decolourization was performed in buffer at 25 c both crude and partially purified laccase gave similar results conversion of approx 60 secondly when the process was performed under optimal conditions ph 4 and t 55 c conversion was the highest but at the same time enzyme deactivation was the fastest in the first 24 h enzyme activity decreased for almost 90 and although immobilization would probably increase the enzyme stability deactivation was still too fast for the continuous process at the end the third reason is economical reason in industrial processes the main awareness is to develop efficient process with minimum expenses the minimum expense demands for the efficient dye decolourization process at 25 c can be fulfilled with immobilized crude laccase that could be reused several times according to literature when using immobilized enzymes dye removal can be caused by two mechanisms one is enzymatic biodegradation and the other is bioaccumulation or biosorption of dye onto alginate beads 57 to demonstrate that decolourization is not just the consequence of adsorption of dye on beads control experiment without the enzyme entrapped in beads was done the reaction started with the addition of alginate beads and alginate beads with entrapped enzyme to aqueous solution of dye while a fresh dye was added in the reactor every 24 h 10 cycles were done in total in each cycle the initial concentration of 75 mg dm 3 of the dye were used the results are presented in fig 7 during the time the samples were taken for the measurements of the dye concentration and laccase activity the laccase activity was measured in order to test the possible enzyme leaking some of the immobilized enzyme was lost from beads because laccase activity of 2 u dm 3 was detected decolouration of aniline by laccase was accompanied by the changes in absorption spectrum when immobilized laccase was used the visible peak 539 nm disappeared after 214 hours indicating total decolouration at the end of experiment after 10 cycles there was no visible peak the same trend of an increase of ph occurred in repetitive batch experiment as well as in all other experiments according to literature laccase immobilized into alginate beads retained 50 of initial activity even after 7 cycles but the process was stopped because beads were oversaturated with dye which caused diffusion problem 55 after inspecting the colour of the beads in control experiment it was noted that the beads became intensively coloured from the data shown in the fig 7a it is visible that a lot of dye was removed as presented in the fig 7b ph increases in the case when the enzyme is immobilized in alginate beads while it remains unchanged when the beads without the enzyme are used which is certainly an indication that the reaction takes place only in the presence of enzyme yet it can be concluded that the dominant mechanism for tested dye is biosorption according to the daâssi et al 58 59 type of mechanism depends on dyes characteristics therefore further work should cover a wider range of dyes and new supports for laccase immobilisation 4 conclusion the advantage of the methodology proposed in this work was a the use of the food industry waste for economically and environmentally friendly process of laccase production b demonstrating the advantage of the use of crude instead of partially purified enzyme for dye decolourization in both free and immobilized forms which significantly influence the process costs c possible application of repetitive batch process of dye degradation with immobilized laccase the future prospective will be in the field of the bioreactor development for the enhancement of the dye degradation process feasibility using laccase immobilized on various supports funding this work was supported by the croatian science foundation

14029,aesthetics and water quality are primary issues of concern for sustainable water reuse since aesthetically unpleasant color and odor are likely to induce public misgiving this study utilizes aesthetic indicators and other bulk water quality parameters for evaluation it is found that ozonation during advanced treatment processes in a full scale water reclamation plant wrp could achieve satisfactory performance in decolorization and oxidation of aromatic and humic contents as limited efficacy on odor removal was detected in the wrp this study further researched the removal of the main odorant substances 2 methylisokanol 2 mib and geosmin gsm with different ozone dosage using solid phase extraction spe and gas phase mass spectrometry gc ms techniques according to the first order reaction kinetics it is inferred that competitive reactions during ozonation by organic matters and restricted ct values are major factors affecting the odor removal as such additional treatment approaches such as nanofiltration nf are suggested to be consider for aesthetic control towards sustainable and long term reclaimed water use keywords reclaimed water advanced treatment aesthetic control odor ozone 1 introduction nowadays an increasing number of regions and urban areas worldwide are facing rapidly growing water challenges due to urbanization climate change socio economic growth population increase etc 1 wastewater treatment and reuse is an effective way of alleviating water shortage problems and reducing water contamination with affordable cost and stable quantity compared to other alternative water resources e g rainfall dependent and desalinated water 2 at present reclaimed water is widely used in municipal miscellaneous uses such as garden greening car washing industrial cooling and agricultural irrigation etc 3 besides high quality reclaimed water can replenish groundwater or be utilized directly for potable purposes therefore for further development and expansion of reclaimed water market water quality guarantee and surveillance are vital during wastewater treatment and reuse processes 4 the aesthetic effects have always been a hot topic of concern in water supply industry particularly as it relates to public concern 5 in recent years due to ever growing demand on high quality reclaimed water supply in addition to health related contaminants e g pathogens and toxic chemicals the aesthetic qualities of reclaimed water increasingly arouse attention since public acceptance is critical for a project s success it is found that aesthetic indicators including turbidity color and odor are major concerns that affect the public acceptability on reclaimed water particularly for some applications with potential close human contact e g recreational uses and household uses such as toilet flushing and laundry 6 apart from indicators that can be visually inspected other water quality surrogates e g toc uv254 absorbance and fluorescence that indicate the treatment efficacy of organic matters can be adopted to demonstrate compliance with the aesthetic criteria 7 particularly while aesthetic parameters such as turbidity and color are commonly monitored at the outlets of water reclamation plants wrp olfactory impacts are less addressed many guidelines have stated that no odor nuisance should be associated with or induced by reclaimed water especially for urban applications 8 9 however there are still limited studies on identifying and quantifying odorous compounds in reclaimed water 10 according to existing literature the sources of odorous compounds in reclaimed water are complex and mainly divided into three categories one is the microbial metabolites mainly caused by aquatic organisms such as algae and actinomycetes 11 particularly the earthy musty smelling secondary metabolites geosmin gsm and 2 methylisoamyl alcohol 2 mib were mainly identified which were firstly isolated and extracted from cyanobacteria cultures 12 currently gsm and 2 mib from actinomycetes were considered as major sources of olfactory issue in drinking water 13 secondly wastewater derived compounds could also result in taste and odor issues some studies have focused on nuisance airborne emissions produced by wastewater treatment processes e g nitrogen sulfur and acids but few attempts have been made to quantify the odorants 10 thirdly the use of excessive chlorine in disinfection processes of wrps was also a common type of reported taste and odor issues 14 generally gsm and 2 mib are detected as off flavor at average thresholds of 16 and 18 ng l respectively in drinking water 15 although the general concentrations of these odorous compounds in water are not considered toxic they can result in public misgiving these issues become prominent when considering reclaimed water in urban applications 16 as for odorant detection several methods have been adopted for instance the olfactory threshold method is simple and easy to operate but the analytical results are subject to low sensitivity of the detectors 17 the enzyme linked immunoassay elisa method has been developed for 2 mib which is a rapid and inexpensive analytical method however it is difficult to obtain high titer antibodies since the molecular weight of odor substances is generally less than 300 da 18 comparatively gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms method is of high sensitivity high peak resolution and reproducibility and has been widely conducted to identify odorous compounds in water samples since the odorous compounds are aesthetically displeasing it is also vital to evaluate their presence and treatment efficacy during water reclamation processes some researchers concluded that the levels of mib and gsm in secondary effluents were both high and may even exceed the threshold levels but decreased slightly during advanced treatment in wrps 14 the reported treatment methods for odorant removal mainly include chemical oxidation such as chlorine hydrogen peroxide ozonation etc activated carbon adsorption such as powder activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac and biological treatment methods 19 particularly ozone has been widely applied in water treatment and reclamation for decolorization disinfection taste and odor control and to reduce concentrations of trace organic chemicals it generally decays rapidly and leaves no appreciable residual in reclaimed water 16 however it is found that there is limited effect of ozone on color and odor removal its removal efficiency is not only related to the ozone dosage and reaction time but also relies on the concentration and type of pollutants hence the efficacy of ozone on the removal of organic matters and aesthetic parameters in reclaimed water needs further investigation consequently this study aims to assess the removal of aesthetic indicators as well as surrogates of organic matters during advanced treatment processes a typical full scale wrp with denitrification ultrafiltration ozonation and uv treatment processes in beijing was selected to evaluate specific treatment efficacy afterwards different ozone dosages were further applied to analyze its effects on aesthetic indicators and surrogates the overall results are informative for aesthetic control towards sustainable water reuse 2 materials and methods 2 1

gas through milli q water that was cooled in a water bath 0 the indigo stock solution 600 mg l was diluted with 0 2 m phosphate buffer solution 20 times and 4 ml of indigo solution was taken out to mix and react with 4 ml of water sample in the erlenmeyer flask and then measured with a spectrophotometer p5 uv vis 2 3 2 odor test before odor detection the water sample needed to be pretreated the

procedure is shown in table 1 the detection conditions of the mass spectrometer were to select the electron impact source ei and 50 ev electron energy the solvent delay time was determined according to the peak of different substances selective ion mode sim was used to select detection ions based on the characteristic ions of each substance the number ions of 2 mib and gsm were 2 the precursor ions of 2 mib and gsm were 95 107 and 112 125 respectively total dwell time was selected 50 ms quality control was conducted during the analyses and the parameters for quality control are listed in

nm at an interval of 5 nm respectively by wang and zhang 22 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment efficacy on bulk water quality parameters of advanced treatment processes in the wrp as shown in section 2 2 and table 3 the advanced treatment processes in the full scale wrp can remove bulk physical and chemical parameters to a large extent detailed information on microbial water quality e g fecal coliform and microbial community changes over the advanced treatment processes are described in cui et al 20 after treatment the reclaimed water is mainly supplied for surrounding lakes for environmental and recreational uses the reclaimed water quality generally complies with the chinese national standard for urban scenic environment uses gb t18918 2019 and the local standard db11 890 2012 which require the limits of codcr 20 mg l ss 5 mg l tn 15 mg l tp 0 3 mg l bod 5 mg l toc 12 mg l color 15 degree and no unpleasant taste and odor after advanced treatment the tn dropped to 10 3 mg l the cod dropped to 15 mg l and the toc dropped to 10 4 mg l all of which met the requirements of the corresponding standards color is one of important aspects in reclaimed water since its aesthetics impacts will influence acceptance of using the reclaimed water table 3 showed that the color was 15 20 degree after ozone units 3 2 analysis of the sources of odor and its removal in the wrp the source of smell in the water was more complicated fungi such as actinomycetes in water were the first to be found to produce moldy substances 2 mib and gsm 12 it has been proven that dozens of actinomycetes can produce 2 mib and gsm 15 in addition more than 20 000 types of algae have been found to produce 2 mib and gsm 23 sulfur containing domestic wastewater as well as wastewater from certain industries e g food processing and aquaculture under anaerobic metabolism of microorganisms in water could produce odorous substances such as hydrogen sulfide thioether and mercaptan 24 the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus was still high in the secondary effluent as shown in table 3 which was liable for the reproduction and growth of algae at the same time the earthy musty smelling were found in collected reclaimed water samples according to existing literature 2 mib and gsm are considered as the major odorous substances in water fig 2 showed the concentrations of 2 mib and gsm in advanced treatment trains of the wrp as shown in fig 2 the highest concentration of 2 mib and gsm was detected in the dnbf effluent with the total value of 150 ng l and the lowest was found in the ozone effluent with the total value of 50 ng l according to the overall detection results it could also be seen that uf and ozone had a certain effect on the removal of odor and uv had no obvious effect on the removal of odor at the outlet there was a slight increase of odor concentration due to the transmission and distribution of reclaimed water from the disinfection units however the concentration of 2 mib and gsm over the entire advanced treatment processes exceeded the standard odor threshold of 10 ng l lloyd et al 1998 3 3 mechanism of odor 2 mib gsm removal by ozonation 3 3 1 conventional index removal with different ozone doses apart from reclaimed water quality the treatment efficacy of ozonation process on aesthetic parameters also depends largely on contact time and ozone dosage hence different ozone dosages were further evaluated at the laboratory scale in actual wrp ozone dosage was 3 mg l for comparison the range of ozone dosage in the laboratory test was set to be 0 5 mg l fig 3 showed that with the increase of ozone dosage from 0 5 mg l the concentration of 2 mib decreased from 75 to 50 ng l and the concentration of gsm dropped to 120 ng l the total removal rate of 2 mib and gsm increased with adding ozone dosage but not apparently the highest removal rate reached to 33 lalezary et al found that the removal rate of gsm and 2 mib was less than 30 by adding 8 mg l ozone with no existent natural organics 26 fig 4 showed that the variations of color turbidity doc and uv254 with the increasing of ozone concentrations it can be seen that the color turbidity and uv254 was decreasing with adding ozone dosage but doc kept unchanged it is indicated that ozonation cannot completely mineralize most organic matters but can degrade macromolecular organic compounds into smaller compounds the reaction of ozone with aromatic and humic contents in water could result in the reduction of color and uv254 particularly decolorization of humic substances can be easily achieved by the cleavage of unsaturated bonds in the molecule during ozonation 27 3 3 2 the variation of residual ozone concentration with different ozone doses in order to analyze the impact of ct values with concentration and time the ozone dosage was firstly set up to be 1 7 mg l but the residual ozone concentration could not be detected with adding ozone of 1 mg l until adding ozone dosage to 3 mg l the curve of result was appeared hence this study set ozone dosage from 3 to 7 mg l as shown in fig 5 the residual ozone concentration was improved with increasing ozone dose from 3 to 7 mg l but becoming 0 mg l after 100 s the ozone dose was 7 mg l the reacted time prolong to 300 s if expressing removal effect by ct value where c was residual ozone concentration t was reacting time it can be concluded that cttod 7 cttod 5 cttod 3 and the larger the ct value the better the removal effect as can be seen from fig 5 the ct value was only determined by ozone concentration however in the actual operational conditions of the wrt the maximum ozone dosage was added to 3 mg l due to energy saving and other considerations studies had reported that the reaction of odor pollutants with lower or slightly higher ozone concentration follows a pseudo first order kinetic model 28 ozone reacted with pollutants using the following eq 1 6 1 m i b o 3 p r o d u c t s 2 m i b o h p r o d u c t s 3 g s m o 3 p r o d u c t s 4 g s m o h p r o d u c t s 5 p o 3 p r o d u c t s 6 p o h p r o d u c t s where p denote the other pollutants of uf effluent except mib and gsm for an organic substance m the total removal rate can be expressed as eq 7 7 d c d t k d o 3 c k o h o h c in eq 7 c was the concentration of organic matter m dc dt was the total removal rate of m k d and k o h were the second order reaction rate constants of organic matter m with ozone and hydroxyl respectively ozone produced very few hydroxyl radicals in this study and can be ignored therefore the only oxidant for removing organic matter was ozone therefore eq 7 can be simplified to eq 8 8 d c d t k d o 3 c 9 ln m t m 0 k o 3 t where k o3 was the first order reaction rate with ozone from eq 9 and fig 5 it can be concluded that the larger the reaction rate constant with ozone the higher the removal rate of organic matter if k o 3 m k o 3 2 mib gsm existed in the water ozone firstly reacted with these substances k o 3 m and k o 3 2 mib gsm were the first order reaction rate constants of organic matter m and 2 mib gsm with ozone respectively table 3 showed kinetics of the oxidation of selected organic compounds with ozone and oh and the concentration of compounds in reclaimed water as can be seen from si the reaction rates of different organics with ozone varied significantly the odorous compounds 2 mib and gsm ppcps edcs and pesticide concentrations in reclaimed water were all at an order of magnitude of ng l the reaction rate with ozone was edcs ppcps pesticide odor the dom concentration level was at mg l the reaction rates was 1 103 therefore the competitiveness of ozone in the entire system was dom edcs ppcps pesticides odor 3 3 3 removal of organics with different ozone concentration by feem since the reaction of ozone with aromatic and humic contents in reclaimed water could also contribute to decolorization and partial odor reduction other water quality surrogates e g fluorescence are evaluated which can suggest the treatment efficacy of organic matters and the improvement of aesthetic aspects fig 6 showed feem spectra for uf effluent with different ozone concentrations in which the regions denote tyrosine tryptophan protein ⅱ polysaccharide ⅲ fulvic acid ⅳ and polyaromatic type humic acid ⅴ as showed in fig 6 a that the fluorescence intensity of uf effluent was higher in polysaccharide ⅲ fulvic acid ⅳ and polyaromatic type humic acid ⅴ indicating that removing pollutants was relatively limited by uf processes in reclaimed water polysaccharide ⅲ fulvic acid ⅳ and polyaromatic type humic acid ⅴ was apparently reduced with adding 1 mg l of ozone fig 6 b afterwards it was significantly decreased when increasing ozone dose from 3 to 5 mg l showed in fig 6 c and d it was further indicated that ozone firstly reacted with humic acid and fulvic acid in natural organic matters containing unsaturated bonds so that the oxidizing ability not fully contributed to the removal of odor 3 3 4 odor and color removal by other treatment methods this study demonstrates that although ozone process can reduce the concentration of odorous compounds namely the 2 mib and gsm to some extent it could hardly lower the olfactory impacts to undetectable levels hence extensive literature review on other treatment processes is also performed the processes with higher removal rates of 2 mib and gsm generally include pac biological filter bf bac nanofiltration nf advanced oxidation with ozone aopo3 and advanced oxidation with uv aopuv as shown in fig 7 the removal rates achieved by pac bf aopo3 aopuv varied largely the removal rate by pac can be up to 100 29 but can be as low as 47 30 in addition the removal rates which was about 70 had been reported 31 the overall removal rate by bf was higher than that of the pac which ranged from 65 to 100 32 the removal rate by bac was from 60 to 100 33 the removal rate by aopo3 was similar to that of the aopuv that ranged from 70 to 100 34 however nf was stable for odor removal almost from 90 to 100 35 both 2 mib and gsm are small molecules with molecular weights of 182 30 and 168 28 daltons respectively the nf membranes can remove the organic matters with less than 300 daltons 36 therefore as far as odor removal was concerned nf could be a useful method for removing odor instead of uf in advanced water treatment processes 4 conclusion aesthetic issues of reclaimed water are attracting increasing attention since they are likely to influence public perception and acceptance for further use and expansion this study analyzed the aesthetic indicators as well as other bulk water quality parameters of reclaimed water from a full scale wrp the results showed that ozone could result in good decolorization but had limited eliminating efficacy on odorous compounds in terms of 2 mib and gsm over the advanced treatment trains because of the existing noms toc 8 10 mg l even though an increase of ozone concentration to 5 mg l the highest removal rate was observed to be 30 which still could not satisfy the threshold level of 10 ng l based on ozone consumption curves the study illustrated that limited odor removal could be attributed to competitive reactions by organic matters and restricted ct values furthermore to achieve better odor removal the nf which could be an alternative to uf in advanced wastewater treatment processes was considered to be a possible approach in advanced treatment processes declaration of competing interest

14029,aesthetics and water quality are primary issues of concern for sustainable water reuse since aesthetically unpleasant color and odor are likely to induce public misgiving this study utilizes aesthetic indicators and other bulk water quality parameters for evaluation it is found that ozonation during advanced treatment processes in a full scale water reclamation plant wrp could achieve satisfactory performance in decolorization and oxidation of aromatic and humic contents as limited efficacy on odor removal was detected in the wrp this study further researched the removal of the main odorant substances 2 methylisokanol 2 mib and geosmin gsm with different ozone dosage using solid phase extraction spe and gas phase mass spectrometry gc ms techniques according to the first order reaction kinetics it is inferred that competitive reactions during ozonation by organic matters and restricted ct values are major factors affecting the odor removal as such additional treatment approaches such as nanofiltration nf are suggested to be consider for aesthetic control towards sustainable and long term reclaimed water use keywords reclaimed water advanced treatment aesthetic control odor ozone 1 introduction nowadays an increasing number of regions and urban areas worldwide are facing rapidly growing water challenges due to urbanization climate change socio economic growth population increase etc 1 wastewater treatment and reuse is an effective way of alleviating water shortage problems and reducing water contamination with affordable cost and stable quantity compared to other alternative water resources e g rainfall dependent and desalinated water 2 at present reclaimed water is widely used in municipal miscellaneous uses such as garden greening car washing industrial cooling and agricultural irrigation etc 3 besides high quality reclaimed water can replenish groundwater or be utilized directly for potable purposes therefore for further development and expansion of reclaimed water market water quality guarantee and surveillance are vital during wastewater treatment and reuse processes 4 the aesthetic effects have always been a hot topic of concern in water supply industry particularly as it relates to public concern 5 in recent years due to ever growing demand on high quality reclaimed water supply in addition to health related contaminants e g pathogens and toxic chemicals the aesthetic qualities of reclaimed water increasingly arouse attention since public acceptance is critical for a project s success it is found that aesthetic indicators including turbidity color and odor are major concerns that affect the public acceptability on reclaimed water particularly for some applications with potential close human contact e g recreational uses and household uses such as toilet flushing and laundry 6 apart from indicators that can be visually inspected other water quality surrogates e g toc uv254 absorbance and fluorescence that indicate the treatment efficacy of organic matters can be adopted to demonstrate compliance with the aesthetic criteria 7 particularly while aesthetic parameters such as turbidity and color are commonly monitored at the outlets of water reclamation plants wrp olfactory impacts are less addressed many guidelines have stated that no odor nuisance should be associated with or induced by reclaimed water especially for urban applications 8 9 however there are still limited studies on identifying and quantifying odorous compounds in reclaimed water 10 according to existing literature the sources of odorous compounds in reclaimed water are complex and mainly divided into three categories one is the microbial metabolites mainly caused by aquatic organisms such as algae and actinomycetes 11 particularly the earthy musty smelling secondary metabolites geosmin gsm and 2 methylisoamyl alcohol 2 mib were mainly identified which were firstly isolated and extracted from cyanobacteria cultures 12 currently gsm and 2 mib from actinomycetes were considered as major sources of olfactory issue in drinking water 13 secondly wastewater derived compounds could also result in taste and odor issues some studies have focused on nuisance airborne emissions produced by wastewater treatment processes e g nitrogen sulfur and acids but few attempts have been made to quantify the odorants 10 thirdly the use of excessive chlorine in disinfection processes of wrps was also a common type of reported taste and odor issues 14 generally gsm and 2 mib are detected as off flavor at average thresholds of 16 and 18 ng l respectively in drinking water 15 although the general concentrations of these odorous compounds in water are not considered toxic they can result in public misgiving these issues become prominent when considering reclaimed water in urban applications 16 as for odorant detection several methods have been adopted for instance the olfactory threshold method is simple and easy to operate but the analytical results are subject to low sensitivity of the detectors 17 the enzyme linked immunoassay elisa method has been developed for 2 mib which is a rapid and inexpensive analytical method however it is difficult to obtain high titer antibodies since the molecular weight of odor substances is generally less than 300 da 18 comparatively gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms method is of high sensitivity high peak resolution and reproducibility and has been widely conducted to identify odorous compounds in water samples since the odorous compounds are aesthetically displeasing it is also vital to evaluate their presence and treatment efficacy during water reclamation processes some researchers concluded that the levels of mib and gsm in secondary effluents were both high and may even exceed the threshold levels but decreased slightly during advanced treatment in wrps 14 the reported treatment methods for odorant removal mainly include chemical oxidation such as chlorine hydrogen peroxide ozonation etc activated carbon adsorption such as powder activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac and biological treatment methods 19 particularly ozone has been widely applied in water treatment and reclamation for decolorization disinfection taste and odor control and to reduce concentrations of trace organic chemicals it generally decays rapidly and leaves no appreciable residual in reclaimed water 16 however it is found that there is limited effect of ozone on color and odor removal its removal efficiency is not only related to the ozone dosage and reaction time but also relies on the concentration and type of pollutants hence the efficacy of ozone on the removal of organic matters and aesthetic parameters in reclaimed water needs further investigation consequently this study aims to assess the removal of aesthetic indicators as well as surrogates of organic matters during advanced treatment processes a typical full scale wrp with denitrification ultrafiltration ozonation and uv treatment processes in beijing was selected to evaluate specific treatment efficacy afterwards different ozone dosages were further applied to analyze its effects on aesthetic indicators and surrogates the overall results are informative for aesthetic control towards sustainable water reuse 2 materials and methods 2 1

oxidation with uv aopuv as shown in fig 7 the removal rates achieved by pac bf aopo3 aopuv varied largely the removal rate by pac can be up to 100 29 but can be as low as 47 30 in addition the removal rates which was about 70 had been reported 31 the overall removal rate by bf was higher than that of the pac which ranged from 65 to 100 32 the removal rate by bac was from 60 to 100 33 the removal rate by aopo3 was similar to that of the aopuv that ranged from 70 to 100 34 however nf was stable for odor removal almost from 90 to 100 35 both 2 mib and gsm are small molecules with molecular weights of 182 30 and 168 28 daltons respectively the nf membranes can remove the organic matters with less than 300 daltons 36 therefore as far as odor removal was concerned nf could be a useful method for removing odor instead of uf in advanced water treatment processes 4 conclusion aesthetic issues of reclaimed water are attracting increasing attention since they are likely to influence public perception and acceptance for further use and expansion this study analyzed the aesthetic indicators as well as other bulk water quality parameters of reclaimed water from a full scale wrp the results showed that ozone could result in good decolorization but had limited eliminating efficacy on odorous compounds in terms of 2 mib and gsm over the advanced treatment trains because of the existing noms toc 8 10 mg l even though an increase of ozone concentration to 5 mg l the highest removal rate was observed to be 30 which still could not satisfy the threshold level of 10 ng l based on ozone consumption curves the study illustrated that limited odor removal could be attributed to competitive reactions by organic matters and restricted ct values furthermore to achieve better odor removal the nf which could be an alternative to uf in advanced wastewater treatment processes was considered to be a possible approach in advanced treatment processes declaration of competing interest
