9705,center pivot irrigation systems are used globally to irrigate large fields they have higher water application efficiency than other sprinkler or surface irrigation approaches but this water application efficiency may be further improved by dynamically adjusting the nozzle height in response to plant growth and canopy heterogeneities this approach is referred to as dynamic elevation spray application desa the key data input required to achieve desa is the plant canopy height however this measurement is challenging to acquire in real time due to canopy heterogeneity and potential interference from active water spray an ultrasonic sensor was evaluated for this purpose both lab and field evaluations were conducted lab evaluations used view angles ranging from 0 to 35 at increments of 5 and heights ranging from 0 5 m to 1 75 m for corn clover and potato field evaluations used view angles of 0 and 5 and heights from 0 5 m to 1 25 m for green beans green peppers eggplants grass and ground regardless of plant type and height results from the lab suggest that desa sensor accuracy decreases about 0 5 with one unit increase in angle s degree when corn was used the sensor accuracy dropped almost 9 results for the field showed that the lowest accuracy 92 was observed at the green beans with 1 25 height field tests with active water spray yielded significantly different measurements from without water spray but sill had accuracies 97 these findings demonstrate the feasibility of using ultrasonic sensors for desa keywords angle of measurement arduino canopy height center pivots hc sr04 ultrasonic sensor sprinkler irrigation 1 introduction evaporative losses and wind drift contribute to reductions in water application efficiency in center pivot systems lower nozzle elevations reduce wind drift and evaporation losses rajan et al 2015 but also reduce the sprinkler pattern overlap either reducing uniformity or requiring more emitters this also risks that the plant growth exceeding the nozzle elevation droplet size is inversely correlated with evaporation losses small droplets evaporate more readily than larger droplets for example 2 of 1 5 mm droplets were lost to wind drift and evaporation while only 1 of 2 5 mm droplets were lost molle et al 2012 this study was performed on the supagro farm in the region of salon de provence south of the rhone valley france mediterranean climate molle et al also attributed 30 50 of total losses to evaporation and 50 70 of losses to wind drift that pushed the droplets outside of the target zone when this happens the uniformity of water application is reduced sadeghi et al 2015 presents statistical relationships between water application efficiency and wind speed another advantage of desa is that it has the potential to actually reduce consumptive use i e et this form of efficiency gain can result in more water available for downstream water users in the watershed this is in contrast to other approaches that exclusively reduce deep percolation perry et al 2009 this paper investigates a new approach to reduce losses dynamic elevation spray application desa where the nozzle elevation is automatically adjusted with a microcontroller in response to changes in canopy height these findings could help growers reduce water losses by using dynamic elevation spray application desa where the nozzle elevation is automatically adjusted with a microcontroller in response to changes in canopy height this approach requires that the canopy heights be monitored continuously with a sensor in this paper we evaluate an acoustic distance sensor to measure canopy height these sensors have been used to actuate pesticide and herbicide spray booms to improve application efficiency and uniformity desa should provide similar benefits for chemigation in overhead irrigation systems however actuation if the irrigation system represents a new challenge the sensor must work while the nozzle is active potentially contaminating the distance measurement 2 background ultrasonic distance sensors model hc sr04 have an established work history in agricultural and environmental applications arduino 2015 ultrasonic and laser measurements were used to measure citrus canopy volume compared to manual measurement methods tumbo el at 2002 and had an r2 0 85 ultrasonic and lidar sensors were compared with the traditional manual and destructive canopy measurement procedure llorens et al 2011 they found correlations between crop volume cvu values measured with ultrasonic sensors and leaf area index lai r2 0 51 and canopy volume measured with ultrasonic and lidar sensors r2 0 52 balsari et al 2008 used ultrasonic sensors to identify canopy target characteristics in terms of size and density to test a sprayer prototype guo et al 2002 used ultrasonic sensors to detect any moving object in front of the vicinity of agricultural machinery in real time to increase the safety sensing system ultrasonic distance sensors have been used to improve the efficiency of herbicide applications when coupled with an rgb camera a targeted and automated spray system used 20 2 less herbicide jejčič et al 2011 such sensors have been used for detection of water level 96 25 accuracy in surface waters saraswati et al 2012 early flood warning kuantama et al 2013 2012 mohamed and wei 2014 and to detect the seed level in a seed tank sabancı et al 2017 additionally these sensors have been used to safeguard pump sets by stopping pumps when water levels fall below the minimal operational levels rane 2016 these ultrasonic distance sensors have also been used to provide input into robotics systems for miscellaneous agricultural operations seeding irrigation weeding fertilizing etc agarwal and thakur 2016 ultrasonic sensors have a vigorous design and a history of operation in an unfavorable working environment humidity vibration dirt temperature fog and have low costs when compared to other electronic circuits berntsen et al 2006 the center pivot has a history of continuous improvement to increase efficiency by reducing water evaporation water loss and energy usage these improvements are achieved by increasing water application uniformity reducing the system pressure altering the drop size distribution or lowering the nozzle heights recently parod et al 2018 patented a system that would adjust drop hose heights dynamically in response to canopy growth to reduce wind drift and evaporation losses representing a next phase in the evolution of precision irrigation dynamic elevation spray elevation application desa the claim in the patent filing is that such systems would decrease water losses due to wind drift and evaporation al agele et al 2020 built a dynamic elevation spray application desa prototype and demonstrated how pressure flow rate strike plate and nozzle height impact the sprinkler pattern in the lab and field and compared these measurements to simulation they found that wet diameter overlap and uniformity coefficient increased with heights and pressures and that sprinkler pattern changes with increased pressures the field measured cus were lower than simulated but not significantly different the ultrasonic sensor is likely a good fit with desa because of its history of canopy assessment and agricultural applications the principle difference is that in desa ultrasonic sensor measurements and irrigation are concurrent the sensor must look through the spray the objective of the present study is to evaluate the technical feasibility of desa this was achieved by performing a series of tests lab field without the water spray with spray on canopy height measurements to determine the most accurate although there have been numerous studies on the environmental and agricultural application of the hc sr04 the targeted application of canopy height measurements meant for dynamic nozzle height adjustment have not yet been studied we seek to 1 evaluate the appropriateness of the sensor for a variety of canopy height measurements with different view angles and 2 quantify the error in the height measurement due to the water spray effect we evaluate the technical feasibility by assessing the key data input into the feedback control cycle for dynamic nozzle height 3 methodology 3 1 desa components desa enabled pivots would require that each nozzle or bank of associates nozzles be associated with a sensor microprocessor and a motorized means to adjust the position of the nozzle head the timescale of change is related to the length over which the change occurs δd and the speed of travel of the irrigation system ωr for pivots through the scaling equation δt δd ωr where ω is the rotation rate of the pivot and r is the outer radius of the pivot specifically the built prototype uses an arduino microcontroller connected to an ultrasonic sensor hc sr04 module and dc motor the motor rotates the drop tube around a water swivel to raise or lower the nozzle s position the entire system is controlled by a c program coded within the arduino which directs the operation of the sensors and dc motors the system was constructed to carry out the system tests described below we focused our effort on the low cost sensor as it provides the critical data input and would be operated in new conditions photographs of the components and entirely constructed desa prototype are presented in fig 1 the arduino uno r3 mega 2560 15 was selected for the present study for sensor designs and control the sensor is positioned 0 2 m above the nozzle to protect the sensor from the water and all electronic parts are secured inside the high density polymer enclosures this basic design contains flange 0 019 m 45 elbow 0 077 m 90 elbow pvc expansion fitting and other parts made by a laser cutter and a 3 d printer for a detailed description of the prototype see al agele et al 2020 3 2 hc sr04 ultrasonic sensor the hc sr04 ultrasonic sensor works by measuring the time of flight of a high frequency 40 khz sound wave echo madli et al 2015 assessed the accuracy of the hc sr04 and found it to be 0 2 m within a range of 4 m at an observation angle of 15 the sensor experiments were conducted to test the sensor accuracy when measuring canopies the principal concern is that the 15 view angle constraint may be violated since the leaf angle distribution of a canopy can span all angles from 0 to 90 vicari et al 2019 thus our experiment tested the sensor s performance for a variety of canopy observation angles the details of the sensor integration for controlling the motor and adjusting nozzle height is illustrated fig 2 the nozzle is positioned at the height of 50 cm with respect to the datum and 20 cm lower than the sensor position fig 2 shows the details of signal transmission and the algorithm flow chart followed to control the functioning of the motor 3 3 experimental design 3 3 1 pilot testing this experiment was first performed on the desa prototype in the newag lab at oregon state university three prevalent summer crops corn clover and potato were grown commencing from march 2017 with ten replicates for each individual observation angle the hc sr04 sensor was evaluated with respect to the datum i e ground before further tests and analysis of the canopy a scientific ruler positioned orthogonal w r t datum was used for measurements and recording of the values for comparison and analysis the testing was performed at eight view angles for each height heights were 0 5 m 0 75 m 1 25 m and 1 75 m and the sensor pitch angle was varied from 0 straight down to 35 at increments of 5 measured using a digital level 3 3 2 field testing field measurement was performed using the desa prototype at oregon state university s horticultural fields four crops green beans green peppers eggplant and grass and bare ground were measured on sep 26 2019 these measurements were informed by the lab tests and concentrated on the view angles with high accuracy 0 5 and three heights 0 5 m 0 75 m and 1 25 m ten replicate measurements were taken using the prototype fig 1a for each combination of canopy height and view angle the sensor was also tested with the irrigation system operating and the water droplets passed through the sensor s line of sight the canopy was wet prior to and during the measurements 3 4 data analysis to evaluate how the sensor is accurate eq 1 was used to create the dependent variable which is sensor accuracy sa for further analysis of both lab and field tests 1 sensor accuracy sa 100 abs observed measurment actual height actual height 100 for the lab test a general linear model glm was chosen for this experiment to explore the interactions between the independent variables jashami et al 2020 glm can easily accommodate categorical and continuous variables barlow et al 2019 three independent variables are included in the experiment 1 plant type which has four levels ground corn clover and potato 2 four levels of height 0 5 m 0 75 m 1 25 m and 1 75 m and 3 angle as a continuous variable table 1 shows the mean m and standard deviation sd values for sa for each level of every independent variable for the field test a factorial design 5 4 2 was chosen for this data set similarly to the lab experiment three independent variables were included in the model 1 plant type which has five levels ground green beans green peppers eggplant and grass 2 three levels of height 0 5 m 0 75 m and 1 25 m and 3 two levels of angle 0 and 5 recall that 0 is defined ad sensor pointing directly downwards only two angles were used in the field test based on the lab s outputs which will be discussed in the following section table 2 shows the mean m and standard deviation sd values for sa for each level of every independent variable data were analyzed in the r software package all tests were performed at a 95 confidence level three way anova was performed on the sensor accuracy to determine whether the average sa differed among the variables horne et al 2019 finally to test whether the accuracy of the sensor would be impacted during the irrigation time three independent variables were also included while keeping the type of plant constant ground only the variables are height with the four levels angle with three levels 0 5 10 and method type with two levels with water spray and without three way anova was also used to analyze this set of data table 3 shows the mean m and standard deviation sd values for sa for each level of every independent variable 4 analysis and results 4 1 lab testing a glm was used to estimate the relationship between the independent variables and sensor accuracy the results of the model are shown in table 4 the r squared was 68 which suggests that the model was a good fit akaike s information criteria aic and bayesian information criteria bic were used during the model selection process the lower aic or bic indicates a better model table 4 shows the values of aic and bic for the presented model are 8376 80 and 8545 11 respectively which were lower than the model without the interaction effect aic 9045 72 and bic 9091 97 the glm for the lab testing experiment found that the height treatment was not statistically significant p 0 05 for all levels but the angle was statistically significant p 0 001 one unit degree increase in the angle the sensor accuracy decreases by approximately half a percent the plant type the potato and clover level when compared to the ground level it was not statistically significant p value 0 05 which suggests that the sensor accuracy was approximately similar across these types on the other hand corn was statistically significant p value 0 001 and the sensor accuracy dropped almost 17 compared to ground level the interaction terms between the independent variables were also investigated in the case of statistically significant effects custom post hoc contrasts were performed for multiple comparisons using tukey s hsd test horne et al 2019 the interaction of plant and height angle and plant and the three way interaction were statistically significant p value 0 001 for all but the interaction term between angle and height was not regardless of the angle there is a strong probability that corn has lower accuracy about 67 at 0 5 m when compared to 0 75 m 1 25 m and 1 75 m fig 3 the sensor accuracy was above 95 for the clover plant at 0 75 and 1 75 but the accuracy dropped almost to 93 when the height was at both 1 25 m and 0 5 m the three way treatment interaction was visualized as is shown in fig 4 regardless of height and plant type the lab experiment results showed that the sensor accuracy on average dropped below 85 when the 15 angle was achieved except with the corn plant however when the angle was below 10 the sensor had 90 or higher accuracy for all plant types including corn in general bare ground resulted in a lower loss of accuracy 10 with all heights and angles the sa dropped from 90 to 80 for the potato when the height was changed from 1 25 m to 1 75 m at 35 hence the angle seemed to affect the sa with the potato plant slightly finally the 1 25 mm and 1 75 m height and above 20 angle generated less accuracy while testing the clover plant around 80 4 2 field testing a 3 way anova was used to estimate the relationship between the independent variables and sensor accuracy for the field experiment the results of the model are shown in table 5 the anova results showed that the height and angle treatment were not statistically significant p 0 05 for both for all levels but the plant type was p 0 001 the two way interaction resulted in two significant combinations between plant type and height p value 0 006 and between plant type and angle p value 0 06 additionally the three way interaction was also significant p value 0 001 fig 5 plots the percentage mean sa at each level of the plant height and angle as well as pairwise comparisons regardless of height all types of plants had an average accuracy above 95 at both angles except for the green beans similarly when the angle is held constant the sa dropped to 91 with green beans at 0 5 m height compared to 0 75 m and 1 25 mm height overall the sensor accuracy was above 90 at all treatments and their levels 4 3 field testing with irrigation a 3 way anova was used to estimate the relationship between the independent variables and sensor accuracy for the irrigation time the results of the model are shown in table 6 the anova results showed that all independent variables and their two way and three way interactions were statistically significant p 0 05 except for the height variable p 0 05 fig 6 plots the percentage mean sa at each level of method height and angle as well as pairwise comparisons regardless of height during the water spray method the sensor accuracy was lower at 0 5 and 10 angles than without water even though it was statistically different the accuracy during water spray was 97 similarly when the angle is held constant the sa was lower only 2 during the water spray than without for all heights in summary the sensor accuracy was not altered much minimum 96 during the irrigation time for all heights 0 5 m to 1 75 m and all angles 0 10 5 discussion sensor accuracy generally decreases with increasing view angle increasing distance and spray activity the highest fidelity between the set distance and the measured distance is achieved at low view angles for all heights the lab results show no significant differences between ground and clover and potato at p value 0 05 in comparison corn had the lowest accuracy among all other plants we attribute this to the top part of the canopies the upper part associated with clover and potato having a relatively higher density than the top part the upper part of the corn canopy corn canopy height was measured with the lowest sensor accuracy across most view angles we attribute this to the curved leaf shapes and less dense upper canopy relative to other crops lower view angles led to more accurate measurement across all crops and heights generally our interpretation of these laboratory measurements led us to restrict the scope of the field tests to low view angles the performance of the sensor was diminished by 1 4 in field conditions relative to laboratory conditions this is expected as wind and other confounding factors are present in field conditions the sensor s performance was also diminished during active irrigation statistically significant however this impact was less than the impact of viewing angle the overall change was from 99 accuracy no spray to 97 with dynamic spray we conclude that this impact although statistically significant is not sufficient to dismiss the acoustic sensor our results indicate that view angles lower than 10 are more appropriate for crop canopy height error increases 0 5 for every 1 increase in view angle the above results are based on individual distance observations further improvements in accuracy can be made by averaging an ensemble of distance measures the information and data gathered by the desa system may also have value to growers as it can be used to create dynamic maps of the canopy growth throughout the growing season which could be used to identify locations of reduced vigor 6 conclusions this work illustrates the potential of open inexpensive networked hardware combined with rapid prototyping in modern precision agriculture nozzle level information and adaptive control are possible and relatively inexpensive with off the shelf components desa could also adapt to the presence of multiple crop canopies in a single field if a diverse planting were strategically advantageous to a grower dynamic elevation spray application desa is technically feasible canopy height can be measured with the low cost hc sr04 sensor canopy structure significantly impacts the accuracy of the distance measurements and more crop varieties and canopy structures need to be investigated the financial viability of desa is still unknown and future work will assess the costs and

interaction was visualized as is shown in fig 4 regardless of height and plant type the lab experiment results showed that the sensor accuracy on average dropped below 85 when the 15 angle was achieved except with the corn plant however when the angle was below 10 the sensor had 90 or higher accuracy for all plant types including corn in general bare ground resulted in a lower loss of accuracy 10 with all heights and angles the sa dropped from 90 to 80 for the potato when the height was changed from 1 25 m to 1 75 m at 35 hence the angle seemed to affect the sa with the potato plant slightly finally the 1 25 mm and 1 75 m height and above 20 angle generated less accuracy while testing the clover plant around 80 4 2 field testing a 3 way anova was used to estimate the relationship between the independent variables and sensor accuracy for the field experiment the results of the model are shown in table 5 the anova results showed that the height and angle treatment were not statistically significant p 0 05 for both for all levels but the plant type was p 0 001 the two way interaction resulted in two significant combinations between plant type and height p value 0 006 and between plant type and angle p value 0 06 additionally the three way interaction was also significant p value 0 001 fig 5 plots the percentage mean sa at each level of the plant height and angle as well as pairwise comparisons regardless of height all types of plants had an average accuracy above 95 at both angles except for the green beans similarly when the angle is held constant the sa dropped to 91 with green beans at 0 5 m height compared to 0 75 m and 1 25 mm height overall the sensor accuracy was above 90 at all treatments and their levels 4 3 field testing with irrigation a 3 way anova was used to estimate the relationship between the independent variables and sensor accuracy for the irrigation time the results of the model are shown in table 6 the anova results showed that all independent variables and their two way and three way interactions were statistically significant p 0 05 except for the height variable p 0 05 fig 6 plots the percentage mean sa at each level of method height and angle as well as pairwise comparisons regardless of height during the water spray method the sensor accuracy was lower at 0 5 and 10 angles than without water even though it was statistically different the accuracy during water spray was 97 similarly when the angle is held constant the sa was lower only 2 during the water spray than without for all heights in summary the sensor accuracy was not altered much minimum 96 during the irrigation time for all heights 0 5 m to 1 75 m and all angles 0 10 5 discussion sensor accuracy generally decreases with increasing view angle increasing distance and spray activity the highest fidelity between the set distance and the measured distance is achieved at low view angles for all heights the lab results show no significant differences between ground and clover and potato at p value 0 05 in comparison corn had the lowest accuracy among all other plants we attribute this to the top part of the canopies the upper part associated with clover and potato having a relatively higher density than the top part the upper part of the corn canopy corn canopy height was measured with the lowest sensor accuracy across most view angles we attribute this to the curved leaf shapes and less dense upper canopy relative to other crops lower view angles led to more accurate measurement across all crops and heights generally our interpretation of these laboratory measurements led us to restrict the scope of the field tests to low view angles the performance of the sensor was diminished by 1 4 in field conditions relative to laboratory conditions this is expected as wind and other confounding factors are present in field conditions the sensor s performance was also diminished during active irrigation statistically significant however this impact was less than the impact of viewing angle the overall change was from 99 accuracy no spray to 97 with dynamic spray we conclude that this impact although statistically significant is not sufficient to dismiss the acoustic sensor our results indicate that view angles lower than 10 are more appropriate for crop canopy height error increases 0 5 for every 1 increase in view angle the above results are based on individual distance observations further improvements in accuracy can be made by averaging an ensemble of distance measures the information and data gathered by the desa system may also have value to growers as it can be used to create dynamic maps of the canopy growth throughout the growing season which could be used to identify locations of reduced vigor 6 conclusions this work illustrates the potential of open inexpensive networked hardware combined with rapid prototyping in modern precision agriculture nozzle level information and adaptive control are possible and relatively inexpensive with off the shelf components desa could also adapt to the presence of multiple crop canopies in a single field if a diverse planting were strategically advantageous to a grower dynamic elevation spray application desa is technically feasible canopy height can be measured with the low cost hc sr04 sensor canopy structure significantly impacts the accuracy of the distance measurements and more crop varieties and canopy structures need to be investigated the financial viability of desa is still unknown and future work will assess the costs and

9706,meteorological drought md is the source of agricultural drought ad and in depth understanding of the propagation process from md to ad can help ad early warning however previous studies primarily focused on average state of propagation time pt rather than from the perspective of various drought levels and had coarse spatiotemporal resolutions monthly and basin scales and also ignored the pt during critical stages of crop water demand to fill the knowledge gap this study used the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized soil moisture index ssmi to characterize md and ad then a framework for high resolution pt identification under different drought levels based on copula theory and conditional probability was proposed taking the rain fed agricultural region of loess plateau rflp as an example the pt of the critical stages of water demand for local crops spring maize winter wheat was calculated respectively result showed that 1 pt in summer and autumn is shorter than those in winter and spring and the higher drought level the faster the spreading rate in which the pt in spring summer autumn and winter under extreme md conditions were 3 15 1 6 1 8 and 4 16 ten days respectively 2 it should be noted that the central part of rflp is a hotspot with a shorter pt than any surrounding area 3 pt is mainly related to local water and heat characteristics and high potential evapotranspiration tends to accelerate the propagation process while sufficient soil moisture has a good buffering effect on md and can slow down the propagation 4 it was observed that pt in the jointing heading stage of wheat was significantly shortened which should be of great concern to the local agricultural authorities in general this study sheds new insights into high spatiotemporal resolution drought propagation which is helpful for ad risk management graphical abstract ga1 keywords different drought magnitudes rain fed agricultural systems early warning of drought loess plateau 1 introduction different form other natural disasters drought has an obvious time accumulation effect this means that as water scarcity continues the intensity and impact of drought is rapidly increasing as are the economic environmental and ecological losses allen et al 2010 jha et al 2019 tran et al 2017 generally when the precipitation in a certain area is lower than the normal level for the same period for a long time it will lead to the meteorological drought md with the further development of md if there is a lack of alternative water supply e g irrigation the soil water stored in the early stage will continue to dissipate until it cannot meet the water demand for the normal growth of crops which will trigger an agricultural drought ad das et al 2020 mishra and singh 2010 especially in the context of global warming the impact of drought on agriculture and food production is particularly significant data from ministry of water resources of china shows that since 1950 20 2 million hectares of crops have been affected by drought each year in china and the annual reduction in grain production due to drought exceeds 16 3 billion kilograms compared with irrigated regions soil moisture in the rain fed areas mainly comes from atmospheric precipitation the fluctuation of precipitation caused by meteorological drought will directly affect the growth and development of crops which leads to a closer relationship between md and ad in rain fed areas rost et al 2009 therefore rain fed agriculture systems are at higher risk in face of drought nielsen et al 2011 establishing a comprehensive understanding of drought is essential to its management vogt et al 2021 k zhou et al 2021 z zhou et al 2021 this requires consideration of physical processes and the driving factors behind drought especially their propagation in the hydrological cycle the transmission process of drought signal from one type of drought to another is considered as drought propagation wu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 specifically in terms of propagation from md to ad since the soil system has a long memory characteristic wu et al 2021 a small scale md may fail to trigger ad due to the influence of soil moisture in the early stage in other words there is a threshold for propagation between the two drought types and md can only cause severe ad if it maintains a certain intensity and persists for a long enough period of time the cumulative time required for a md to trigger an ad is referred to the drought propagation time pt the pt is mainly affected by the regional climate and underlying surface characteristics e g precipitation evaporation soil moisture content reflecting the physical connection between the two types of droughts bevacqua et al 2021 hao et al 2018 van loon and laaha 2015 zhang et al 2021 a shorter propagation time means soil water was consumed more quickly to intensify ad after ad develops to a certain extent soil evaporation tends to decrease which may impact the md in turn and aggravate the feedback of the two kinds of droughts overall pt is not only an important element to study the propagation process of both types of droughts but also an important bridge to understand the relationship between atmospheric and soil systems as well as an important auxiliary indicator for ad early warning and disaster control zhang et al 2021 in recent years several studies have investigated the propagation process from md to ad mo 2011 analyzed the occurrence and recovery of ad in the united states and found that ad usually occurred within a few months after md huang et al 2015 studied the process and factors influencing the propagation of md to ad on a seasonal scale in wei river basin china and found that the response time of md to ad was the fastest in summer and longer in winter and spring which was mainly related to the buffering effect of soil moisture on drought xu et al 2021 evaluated the propagation characteristic of md to ad in different climatic regions at seasonal scales in china and found that the pt gradually increased from 1 to 2 months in summer to 2 7 months in spring of the following year zhang et al 2021 used the spearman rank correlation coefficient to investigate the correlation and propagation process from md to ad in yellow river basin and yangtze river basin in china the results indicated there was a strong link between meteorological and agricultural droughts and the pt from md to ad in summer and autumn was shorter in summer and autumn than in winter and spring in both basins although the above studies are helpful to understand the propagation process from md to ad there is still space for improvement on the one hand in terms of the calculation method of the pt most of the previous studies used the correlation analysis method which is to calculate the linear correlation coefficient between standardized precipitation index spi with various cumulative scales and agricultural drought index e g standardized soil moisture index ssmi with fixed time scale respectively then the time scale of the spi with the highest correlation is chosen as the drought pt this method is simple and widely used huang et al 2015 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 however the spi and agricultural drought index series contain not only drought information but also the information of wet period the pt identified by the correlation analysis method also includes the common propagation effect of both dry transfer signal less precipitation to less soil moisture and wet transfer signal more precipitation to more soil moisture at the same time lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 j wu et al 2021 thus using this method to calculate pt may bring some bias on the other hand the ad states caused by different levels of md should be different and the pt required to trigger ad should theoretically be different but previous studies have not considered this which would reduce the robustness of the research results besides the time scale of the pt identified by previous studies is usually limited to monthly which cannot accurately describe the response process of soil to md in a real state furthermore the reflected drought propagation processes are mostly on a seasonal or monthly scale making it difficult to describe the drought propagation of a particular crop at a critical stage of water demand the main scientific questions of this study include how to determine the high resolution propagation time from different levels of meteorological drought to agricultural drought how different driving factors affect the drought propagation process in each season what is drought propagation time of different crops in their critical water demand stages the main objective of this study is to develop a novel drought propagation time identification framework with high temporal and spatial resolution and can reflect different levels of md stress by using conditional probability and a series of copula functions based on the proposed method standardized precipitation index spi and standardized soil moisture index ssmi in the minimum ten days cumulative scale were used to represent md and ad respectively in the following a scale of ten days will be noted as td and the propagation process of md to ad in typical rainfed agricultural areas of the loess plateau in china was analyzed compared with previous studies the main contribution of this study is as follows i a high spatiotemporal resolution drought propagation time identification framework was proposed ii the pt from meteorological to agricultural drought at multiple levels was obtained iii the pt of winter wheat and spring maize in the critical water demand periods was identified the rest of paper will be organized as follows section 2 will introduce the general overview of the study area and the data used followed by a detailed description of the rationale and operational procedures of the method in section 3 the results will be presented and discussed in section 4 and finally the main conclusions of the paper will be given in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 a the rain fed agricultural area of the loess plateau rflp is located in the south central part of the loess plateau lp in northwestern china 34 2 39 40 n 102 42 113 52 it spans 19 cities in 4 provinces gansu ningxia shaanxi and shanxi from west to east and covers an area of about 302 000 km2 almost half of the total area of the lp the irrigated area of farmland in the study area is always less than 20 which is a typical rain fed agricultural region li et al 2010 the altitude of rflp decreases significantly from west to east and the terrain consists mainly of hills and gullies zhang et al 2008 see fig 1 b main soil type in the study area is loessal soil which is soft rich in mineral nutrients and has strong water capacity li et al 2021 pei et al 2021 the rflp is located at the junction of sub humid and semi arid regions and also has a temperate continental monsoon climate fang et al 2019 resulting in a highly uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in the region with annual precipitation gradually decreasing from 650 mm in the southeast to 245 mm in the northwest see fig 1 c and the precipitation mainly concentrated in summer and autumn accounting for about 80 of the total annual precipitation liu et al 2011 in addition the interannual variability of precipitation is also very large li et al 2020 and the difference in precipitation between wet and dry years is often 3 5 times in rflp the annual average temperature ranges from 4 3 c to 14 3 c fang et al 2019 annual potential evapotranspiration is between 780 mm and 1470 mm with a decreasing trend from northwest to southeast in addition the evaporation in spring and summer is larger and can account for more than 70 of the annual evaporation peng et al 2017 due to the special water and heat conditions the crop system in rflp is one crop per year as shown in fig 1 d where the crop in the northeast of the region is mainly summer maize and in the south is mainly winter wheat in this study area winter wheat is sown in early october and harvested in early july with a total growth period of about 280 days while spring maize is sown in late april and harvested in mid september with a total growth period of about 150 days detailed information about the crop growth period will be shown in the methods section 2 2 dataset the precipitation and soil moisture data used in this study is from the version2 of the global land data assimilation system gldas2 0 which is developed by nasa through ingesting ground observation and satellite remote sensing data into advanced land surface modeling noah clsm with data assimilation technology to obtain land surface states and fluxes value rodell et al 2004 this dataset has been widely used in the study area and has shown good reliability han et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 in this study the precipitation data 1949 1 01 2014 12 30 from gldas2 0 with 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution were used to drive the spi due to the soil moisture data of gldas has been widely used by many scholars for drought monitoring dillon et al 2016 nayak et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 this study selected the soil data to calculate the agricultural drought index ssmi in order to determine suitable soil moisture data to drive ssmi we selected soil moisture data under clsm and noah model as candidates then the spearman correlation coefficient was used to test the dependence between the two datasets and yield of winter wheat and spring maize respectively the grain production data of each city in the rflp comes from china s provincial statistical yearbook http www stats gov cn tjsj ndsj the test results are shown in fig 2 except for some cities the soil moisture from clsm model is generally better than noah simulated soil moisture therefore this paper uses the soil moisture data under the clsm model to drive the agricultural drought index in addition the depth of the soil layer is 1 m and the temporal and spatial resolution and time span are consistent with precipitation in addition the meteorological data including atmospheric pressure air temperature wind speed long wave radiation short wave radiation surface heat flux and specific humidity 0 25 0 25 and daily spatiotemporal resolution in clsm mode is used to drive potential evapotranspiration using penman monteith equation it is noted that these meteorological data have been widely used in study area and all over the world and proved to have a significant correlation with the observed data du and sun 2012 eltazarov et al 2021 han et al 2021 all the meteorological data precipitation and soil moisture datasets can be accessed via https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets gldas clsm025 d 2 0 3 methods as shown in fig 3 a methodological framework for calculating the pt under multiple md scenarios was proposed in this paper the framework includes three parts part1 introducing the calculation process of spi and ssmi in ten days cumulative time scale part2 the drought pt identification method based on copula function and conditional probability and part3 the penman monteith method for calculating potential evapotranspiration and critical stages of crop water requirement 3 1 meteorological and agriculture drought index 3 1 1 standardized precipitation index in the past decades scientists have developed a number of drought indices among which spi and its derived series of drought indices e g spei ssi ssmi have been widely used for their unique advantages choudhury et al 2021 kalisa et al 2020 stagge et al 2015 peng et al 2020 this index is easy to calculate requires less data the time scale of drought can be flexibly changed as needed and has good temporal and spatial comparability for these reasons spi has been recommended by the world meteorological organization hayes et al 2011 and was widely used for md assessment and monitoring spi was firstly proposed by mckee 1993 which indicates drought by comparing the deviation of current precipitation with the average level of the same period in history the calculation process of spi is as follows daily precipitation is firstly accumulated to the required length e g 1 2 n months to get the precipitation series then two parameters gamma distribution function eq 1 is used to calculate the probability of the corresponding precipitation series finally the probability value is normalized to get the spi index the drought classification based on spi value is listed in table1 1 f x 1 β γ γ γ x r 1 e x β x 0 where f x is the gamma distribution β and γ are the scale and shape parameters respectively x denotes the precipitation data in this study the minimum cumulative length of spi was reduced from one month to ten days to meet the requirement of soil response to precipitation change the spi index at the scale of 4 36 td in the rflp was calculated to further calculate the drought propagation time 3 1 2 standardized soil moisture index ssmi is an agricultural drought index developed following the calculation process of spi index compared with spi the input variable of ssmi is changed from precipitation to soil moisture data and the probability distribution model is also changed to a normal distribution according to the fluctuation of soil moisture eq 2 and table 1 show the ssmi calculation equation and the drought classification scheme respectively 2 s s m i s m s m σ where sm denotes the soil moisture value with a certain time scale s m and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the soil moisture series in this study the root zone soil moisture 1 m depth data from gldas2 0 were used to calculate the ssmi at the scale of 3 5 td moreover it should be noted that ssmi 3 represents the soil water status at the 3td scale i e a month scale and since the durations of the two critical water demand periods of winter wheat and spring maize are 4td and 5td ssmi 4 and ssmi 5 represent the soil moisture conditions during the critical water demand periods for these two crops respectively more information about the critical water demand period of crops were introduced in section 3 3 to facilitate understanding in the next section we will explain the calculation process of pt using the monthly span of ssmi 3 as an example 3 2 methods for estimating the propagation time of droughts 3 2 1 copula theory in general it is difficult to determine the joint distribution of random variables by their marginal distributions with the development of copula theory this problem has been solved in a certain extent copula function was originally proposed by sklar rayens and nelsen 2000 with which the joint distribution of any two correlated random variables can be flexibly composed by their marginal distribution in this study two dimensional copula function was used to construct the joint distribution of the spi and ssmi series see eq 3 3 f s p i i s s m i j s p i s s m i p s p i i s p i s s m i j s s m i c f s p i i s p i f s s m i j s s m i where i and j are the time scale corresponding to spi and ssmi respectively f s p i i s s m i j is the joint distribution f spi i and f ssmi j are marginal distributions of the spi i and ssmi j series respectively c denotes a certain copula function since the spi and ssmi are standard normalized variables the normal distribution is chosen as their marginal distribution five copula functions commonly used in the field of hydrometeorology were selected as candidates fang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 see table 2 and the optimal copula function was selected for each grid by the least squared euclidean distance sed and akaike information criterion aic 3 2 2 identification method of drought pt with high spatiotemporal resolution under different levels of md conditions the joint distribution of spi i and ssmi 3 series with ten days and 0 25 0 25 resolution obtained by copula theory in the previous section is shown in the left side of the part2 in fig 3 in order to determine the pt from md to ad the probability of ad under different levels of md was first calculated by the conditional probability formula then a reasonable probability threshold interval was set and when the calculated probability reaches the threshold the cumulative length of time corresponding to spi is used as the pt from md to ad considering that the probability of ad caused by mild md is low and it is generally unable to trigger severe ad this study mainly considers the drought propagation time under moderate severe and extreme md scenarios the specific calculation process is as follows in the first step the probability of ad ssmi 0 5 caused by moderate 1 5 spi 1 severe 2 0 spi 1 5 and extreme meteorological drought spi 2 0 was calculated by conditional probability formula see eqs 4 6 moderate drought scenarios 4 p m n p s s m i 3 0 5 1 5 s p i i 1 0 p s s m i 3 0 5 1 5 s p i i 1 0 p 1 5 s p i i 1 0 c f s s m i 3 0 5 f s p i i 1 0 c f s s m i 3 0 5 f s p i i 1 5 f s p i i 1 0 f s p i i 1 5 severe

an example to introduce the calculation process of pt as shown in eq 4 and fig 4 n denotes the time length of ad lagging behind md i e the pt which is within the range of 1 33 td p m n is the probability of soil fell into a drought state under the md in the moderate scenarios at the spi cumulative scale of n 3 td according to eq 4 the corresponding conditional probability matrix p m of a certain grid is obtained when n takes 1 33 td using the same method the probability matrices p s p e under severe and extreme md conditions are obtained through eq 5 and eq 6 respectively after obtaining the probability matrix p m the next step is to identify the pt based on whether the probability value exceeds a certain threshold this process is shown in the flowchart of part2 in fig 3 firstly set the initial threshold k to 0 8 and find the maximum value p max of p m then judge whether the p max exceeds 0 7 if so further judge whether p max exceeds the preset threshold k k 0 8 if it exceed again it will be fixed threshold to k 0 8 then assign n in order from 1 to 33 and judge whether p m n is equal to or greater than the fixed threshold if so got the drought propagation time for n but if the p max is less than the initial threshold k decrease the threshold requirement by setting k k 0 1 k 0 79 and judge whether p max exceeds the new preset threshold k if so the fixed threshold is obtained as k 0 79 then judge the p m matrix from n 1 as above to determine pt if p max is still less than the preset threshold k decrease the threshold requirement again k k 0 1 until k 0 7 in addition if p max is smaller than 0 7 at the beginning the p max is directly used as the threshold and the pt is equal to n according to the position order of p max in p m 3 3 penman monteith method and critical stages of crop water requirement 3 3 1 penman monteith method evaporation is not only a reflection of energy balance but also an important part of the hydrological cycle the spatial distribution of potential evapotranspiration is likely to directly affect the propagation process from md to ad manning et al 2018 in order to analyze the spatial distribution of drought propagation time we used the penman monteith method eq 7 to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet in the rflp this method is based on energy balance and aerodynamics and uses water pressure net solar radiation wind speed and other factors to determine pet because it has a clear physical meaning this is the preferred method recommended by fao to calculate pet ficklin et al 2015 and it has been widely used in lp areas with high reliability li et al 2012 yue et al 2019 7 p e t 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net surface radiation g is the soil heat flux t is the average temperature u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m e s is the saturated water pressure e a is the actual water pressure δ is the slope of the saturated water pressure curve and γ is the psychrometer constant 3 3 2 critical stages of crop water requirement as shown in fig 1 d winter wheat is the main grain crop in the south of rflp previous studies in this area have shown that the jointing heading stage is a critical stage for the transformation of winter wheat from vegetative growth to reproductive growth sun et al 2018 at this stage the plants grow rapidly and need a lot of water support sufficient soil moisture has a significant positive effect on the final yield another critical water requirement stage for winter wheat is at the pre sowing stage soil moisture at this stage is not only related to the sowing and pre winter seedling growth but also related to the wheat growth during regreening stage in the next year therefore it also has a significant positive effect on the final yield in addition spring maize is main food crop in the middle and northeast of rflp the jointing tasseling stage and the pustulation milky stage are the key periods of vegetative and reproductive growth of the spring maize respectively guo et al 2021 maize needs a lot of water supply during these two stages which are selected as the critical water demand periods for spring maize after consulting the growth period maps of major crops in china table 3 shows detailed information on the critical water requirements of the two types of crops chen et al 2021 in the next section the pt from january to december was calculated using our proposed method and the drought pt of spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february was obtained by averaging the monthly pt values in addition to investigate the change of drought propagation we divided the entire study period into two equal parts so that each part exceeded 30 years to meet the historical record limit of a minimum time span of 30 years required to calculate the spi part 1 1949 1981 part 2 1982 2014 rad et al 2017 then the pt of crops in the critical water demand stage during these two periods were calculated 4 results and discussion 4 1 reliability analysis of research methods with the help of copula theory and conditional probability framework the proposed drought pt calculation method can not only analyze the drought propagation process under different levels of md conditions but also separate the non drought information in the drought index series when extracting the drought pt from the propagation probability matrix instead of choosing a fixed threshold e g selecting the cumulative time corresponding to the maximum value in the probability matrix a variable threshold interval is chosen to filter the pt because the fixed threshold could not meet the timely warning needs of ad fig 5 shows the propagation probability matrix from january to december calculated from 10 randomly selected grids in the study area under moderate md scenarios as shown in the figure the probability of md propagation to ad increases with the accumulation of md scale if the maximum value in the matrix is selected as a fixed threshold to filter the time of drought propagation the resulting drought pt will be too long but the probability before the maximum value is not low and also prone to trigger agricultural drought this is especially prominent in summer in order to avoid ignoring the shorter drought propagation time and to improve the timely warning of agricultural drought this study used a probability threshold interval of 0 7 0 8 to determine the drought propagation time only when the propagation probability exceeds the value in this interval the corresponding spi cumulative scale is selected as the drought pt so that the time required for md to trigger ad is basically at a high confidence level of not less than 0 7 0 8 there may be a phenomenon that the maximum value of the probability matrix cannot exceed 0 7 in fact this phenomenon is rare in all grids 570 and only occurs under moderate meteorological drought conditions when p max is less than 0 7 we directly use the lag scale corresponding to p max as the drought pt to ensure a high confidence probability in addition it was found that the probability of judging pt increased with the aggravation of md levels for example in spring as the md gradually increases from moderate severe to extreme degree the average probability corresponding to propagation time n for all grids are 0 76 0 83 and 0 87 respectively furthermore as can be seen in fig 5 the conditional probability matrix for each grid varies somewhat regularly and differently throughout the year which will be analyzed and discussed in the next section 4 2 seasonal distribution of drought propagation time under different levels of md conditions the process of pt changes that trigger ad in each season can be summarized as follows as shown in fig 6 the pt is relatively short in summer and autumn and longer in spring and winter which is consistent with previous studies conducted in the study area huang et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 in addition compared with the previous study since we use the drought index calculated with a minimum of 10 days as the cumulative unit to capture drought the obtained drought propagation time also has a finer time resolution with the aggravation of the md the time required to trigger ad is decreasing and the shortening range of pt in spring and summer is most evident in addition it can be seen from the figure that the values of pt in spring are more dispersed while the range of values in autumn and winter are more concentrated furthermore as the drought level increases the pt gradually tends to a fixed interval which is especially evident in summer as shown in fig 7 the spatial distribution of drought pt in each grid of rflp showed that there were significant differences in the spatial distribution of drought pt in different regions seasons and under different drought conditions the moderate md scenario is taken as an example to compare the distribution characteristics of drought pt on various seasonal scales firstly in spring the areas with shorter pt are mainly concentrated in the central and northwestern regions of the rflp with pt between 5 and 10 td while the regions with longer pt are mainly distributed in the northeastern and southwestern fringes and could be as long as 20 28 td entering summer except for a few areas in the northeast and southwest the drought pt is significantly shorter than spring and the drought pt is mainly concentrated in 1 5td then in autumn the distribution of drought pt is more uniform in space and it is slightly longer than that in summer mainly concentrated in 3 10 td finally in winter the distribution characteristics of the pt are similar to that in spring but the spatial discrepancy is not very obvious with relatively short drought pt in the central region concentrated in 7 12 td and longer drought pt in the northeast and southwest concentrated in 15 20 td then the pts under different meteorological drought scenarios were compared longitudinally it was found that the drought propagation process accelerated and spatial heterogeneity decreased with increasing md levels until the spatial distribution of drought pt converged under extreme md scenarios spring 3 15 td summer 1 6 td autumn 1 8 td and winter 4 16 td and the pt decreased the most in spring it should be noted that in rflp the process of md to ad was faster in the central region yulin yan an and qingyang than in other regions both in different seasons and in different drought scenarios and the faster propagation process showed a gradual spread from the central region to the surrounding areas with the change of seasons and the increase of md degree it can be concluded that the central region of rflp is the hotspot of ad where the propagation process from md to ad is the fastest and crops lack sufficient time to buffer the damage caused by drought which is unfavorable to the agricultural production this finding is consistent with the historical record of frequent agricultural droughts in this area fang et al 2019 han et al 2021 in order to further verify the reliability of the results we randomly selected a grid in the study area and extracted all meteorological and agricultural drought events in the grid from 1949 to 2014 by using the run theory method wu et al 2018 the real pt of the two types of droughts is obtained by matching the drought events and compared with the calculated results in this paper the matching method is shown in fig 8 the blue and red shadows in the figure represent meteorological and agricultural drought events respectively the time interval between the peak points of md and ad is selected as the real pt of the two types of drought bevacqua et al 2021 fig 9 shows a total of 36 drought events obtained through matching the green red yellow and gray shaded areas in the figure represent that ad occurred in spring summer autumn and winter respectively the matched pt is classified by season and averaged to obtain the real pt on the seasonal scale and compared with the average result of the pt at each level calculated in this paper as shown in fig 10 the pt in summer autumn and winter is slightly lower than the real pt while the pt in spring is slightly higher than the real pt overall the two propagation times show good agreement in each season which can further validate the reliability of our proposed method 4 3 driving force analysis of drought propagation process rflp is located in the hinterland of the loess plateau and is affected by the temperate continental monsoon climate the region has less precipitation more sunny and windy days leading to intense evaporation activities with annual pet often exceeding 1000 mm and its uneven temporal and spatial distribution li et al 2012 which are the main driving factor for the propagation of md to ad in addition the spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation and soil water content are also important factors influencing drought propagation fang et al 2020 huang et al 2015 figs 11 13 show the seasonal distribution of pet precipitation and soil moisture status in rflp respectively first as shown in figs 11 13 in spring the evaporation capacity of the central and eastern regions of rflp is larger than that in the southwestern region soil moisture in the eastern region is significantly higher than that in the central and northwestern regions with spring precipitation concentrated mainly on the southern edge and difficult to infiltrate into the interior regions evaporation is greater in the central region compared to other regions of the rflp precipitation and soil moisture in this region are relatively low compared to other regions when the md occurs strong evaporation will rapidly reduce the moisture in the soil and rapidly trigger ad due to the lack of additional moisture replenishment which may be the reason for the fastest drought propagation process in the central region in addition although the evaporation capacity of the eastern region is as large as that in the central region the soil moisture in this region is more sufficient so that even if the soil evaporates quickly sufficient soil moisture has a good buffering effect on the md huang et al 2015 wu et al 2021 therefore the process of drought propagation in the eastern region is slower than that in the central region on the contrary in the northwest of rflp although the evaporation was significantly less than that in the central and eastern regions however the soil moisture content in this area is relatively lower and the buffering effect of soil moisture on md is not significant which shortens the drought pt furthermore due to the temperature rise in spring the winter snow gradually melts further replenishing the soil moisture which can alleviate the pressure of md and prolong the propagation process of drought in summer pet reaches its highest level of the year throughout the region due to high temperatures and strong solar radiation summer precipitation is at its highest but the patterns of precipitation is mainly short term and concentrated heavy rain resulting in most of the water flowing away as runoff wu et al 2017 which together with strong evaporation limits the accumulation of soil moisture the combined effect of severe evaporation activity and lower soil moisture storage resulted in the shortest drought pt of rflp in summer in autumn with the gradual decrease of temperature the evaporation capacity also decreases significantly and the soil water dissipation rate decreases due to sufficient precipitation replenishment in autumn making the drought propagation process longer in autumn than in summer finally although there is a lack of precipitation in winter the rate of soil moisture dissipation decreases significantly because temperature and radiation drop to the lowest throughout the year and evaporation also drops to the lowest which makes the propagation process of winter drought very slow and the pt of winter drought is significantly longer than that of other seasons in general potential evapotranspiration is the main driving of drought propagation while adequate precipitation and soil moisture have a buffering effect on the development of drought in terms of the spatial distribution of pt due to the inability of precipitation to go deep into the central region the soil humidity in this region is low and the strong evaporation capacity leads to the shortest pt in this region in terms of the time distribution of pt the rainy season in the study area is mainly in summer and autumn from june to october but the higher temperature in this period leads to a strong evaporation capacity and a faster propagation process from md to ad the dry season is mainly concentrated in winter and spring november to may of the following year although there is not much precipitation during this period the accumulation of soil moisture during the rainy season and the snowmelt in spring combine to cause the propagation of drought to be prolonged during these two seasons due to lower temperatures and weaker evapotranspiration in addition the higher evapotranspiration capacity in spring and summer may be responsible for the greatest decline in pt with increasing md levels in these two seasons although sufficient soil moisture helps to mitigate the adverse effects of rapid evapotranspiration on drought propagation this buffering effect will diminish with increasing md levels under extreme md the pt will be greatly shortened even in the eastern region with sufficient soil water furthermore the spatial distribution of drought pt is also more consistent in autumn and winter than in the other two seasons because the difference in spatial distribution of pet is smaller in autumn and winter than in spring and summer 4 4 drought propagation time in critical stages of crop water demand in different periods 4 4 1 pt of winter wheat in critical stages of water demand and its variation the pt of md to ad in the two periods was calculated by using the proposed method as shown in fig 14 a and b represent the spatial distribution of pt in jointing heading stage and pre sowing stage respectively first on the whole the drought pt during the jointing heading stage is significantly longer than that of the pre sowing stage which is mainly related to the seasonal period in which they are located with the jointing heading mainly in spring and the pre sowing in summer then under the moderate md scenario it can be seen from the figure that during the jointing heading stage the drought in the central eastern region qingyang baiyin lanzhou and pingliang is less than 10 td while in other areas it is between 15 and 24td in the pre sowing stage the pt is relatively uniform concentrated in 3 5td and shortened in both stages as the drought level increased compare with the first study period in the jointing heading stage the drought pt in the second period is significantly shorter in the western region of the winter wheat planting area this may be related to the change of pet in this area it is found that the pet in this area increased obviously at the second period which accelerated the propagation process it implies that ad will be triggered more quickly after the onset of md the accelerated propagation of drought during jointing and heading stage will further worsen the impact of md which is very unfavorable for the crop production and relevant agricultural authorities need to pay great attention to this stage for the pre sowing stage there was no significant change in the spatial distribution of drought pt in the first and second periods fig 15 shows the average pt from md to ad at the city scale in the second period and it can be found that cities such as tongchuan qingyang and pingliang which are located in the middle of rflp had a shorter pt under extreme drought conditions the pt in these cities is less than 2 td and this information has positive implications for early warning of local agricultural drought 4 4 2 pt of spring maize in critical stages of water demand and its variation the calculation results of the pt of spring maize in two periods are shown in fig 16 it can be found that in the jointing tasseling stage with the aggravation of md levels the drought propagation process is accelerating in the northeast of corn planting area but there is no significant change in pustulation milky stage and the pt of both stages is less than 5 td in the extreme md situation in addition during the jointing tasseling stage it can be found that the drought pt of second period in the northern corn planting area is slightly shorter than that in the first period comparing these two periods there is no significant change in pet in the area but there is some decrease in soil moisture in the second period the reduction in the buffering effect of the soil may be one of the reasons for the acceleration of the propagation of drought in this region furthermore there is no obvious change in the spatial distribution of drought pt during the pustulation milky stage the drought pt of each city during the second period of critical water demand stages is also shown in fig 17 it should be noted that yulin and yan an have a shorter drought propagation time compared to other cities with the drought pt shortens to 1td under extreme drought conditions the obtained drought pt during the critical stages of crop water demand in each region is of positive significance for the early warning of local agricultural drought agricultural water managers and water use authorities can prepare in advance for drought pt under different meteorological drought scenarios for example by reducing the water expenditure of crops during the non critical water demand period and reserving sufficient water for crops in critical water demand periods the impact of md on crop growth can be reduced and the scientific and rational use of valuable water resources can be realized and it can promote cleaner production by increasing the amount of carbon sequestered by vegetation during drought in addition if there is no surplus water source available the economic losses can be minimized by timely replanting some drought resistant crops such as groundnut potato 5 conclusions in order to address the current problems and limitations in the field of drought propagation research a new method for calculating pt from md to ad was proposed based on copula function and conditional probability theory the pt under different levels of md was identified and the spatial and temporal resolution of pt was significantly improved the drought propagation process of typical rain fed agricultural area in loess plateau from 1949 to 2014 was studied by using the proposed method and the main conclusions are as follows 1 temporally the pt of drought was shorter in winter and spring and longer in summer and autumn spatially the central part of rflp was the hot spot of drought and its propagation process was faster than the surrounding areas the main reason for the significant difference of drought pt in time and space is the characteristics of water and heat conditions over time and space strong evaporation capacity can promote drought propagation in addition higher soil moisture has a good buffering effect on md and can slow down the propagation process to ad 2 the buffering effect of soil moisture can be weakened with the exacerbation of drought as the aggravation of md levels the process of drought propagation could be accelerated and the shortening of pt was most obvious in spring and summer which may be related to the high evaporation capacity in these two seasons under extreme md conditions the pt in spring summer autumn and winter were 3 15 1 6 1 8 and 4 16 td respectively 3 the whole study period was divided into two equal periods and the drought pt of winter wheat and spring maize in the critical stages of water demand was calculated it can be found that the pt in jointing heading stage of winter wheat and jointing tasseling stage of spring maize in the second period 1982 2014 was shorter than that in the first period 1949 1981 which may be related to the regional water and heat changes the regional averages of each grid were used to obtain the drought pt of each city at the critical stage of crop water demand it was found that yulin yan an tongchuan qingyang and pingliang located in the middle of rflp had a relatively fast propagation process the pt in these cities under extreme drought conditions tended to be less than 2td it should be noted that the drought propagation process was the fastest in the central region of rflp stakeholders often lack sufficient time to respond to the hit of drought which will seriously affect local agricultural production in addition a significant shortening trend of drought pt was detected at the jointing heading stage of winter wheat which will make it difficult to prevent ad and relevant agricultural authorities should pay attention to crop growth at this stage to avoid serious risk of grain yield reduction the identification framework of pt proposed in this study has a high probability credibility and can be used to study the drought propagation process in other rain fed agricultural areas however this framework is based on data statistics and there are still has some limitations for example for a specific md with a certain duration severity intensity and spatial range of impact it is still difficult to accurately identify the duration intensity and spatial range of ad caused by the md in depth research on drought propagation is still needed to address these challenges declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9706,meteorological drought md is the source of agricultural drought ad and in depth understanding of the propagation process from md to ad can help ad early warning however previous studies primarily focused on average state of propagation time pt rather than from the perspective of various drought levels and had coarse spatiotemporal resolutions monthly and basin scales and also ignored the pt during critical stages of crop water demand to fill the knowledge gap this study used the standardized precipitation index spi and standardized soil moisture index ssmi to characterize md and ad then a framework for high resolution pt identification under different drought levels based on copula theory and conditional probability was proposed taking the rain fed agricultural region of loess plateau rflp as an example the pt of the critical stages of water demand for local crops spring maize winter wheat was calculated respectively result showed that 1 pt in summer and autumn is shorter than those in winter and spring and the higher drought level the faster the spreading rate in which the pt in spring summer autumn and winter under extreme md conditions were 3 15 1 6 1 8 and 4 16 ten days respectively 2 it should be noted that the central part of rflp is a hotspot with a shorter pt than any surrounding area 3 pt is mainly related to local water and heat characteristics and high potential evapotranspiration tends to accelerate the propagation process while sufficient soil moisture has a good buffering effect on md and can slow down the propagation 4 it was observed that pt in the jointing heading stage of wheat was significantly shortened which should be of great concern to the local agricultural authorities in general this study sheds new insights into high spatiotemporal resolution drought propagation which is helpful for ad risk management graphical abstract ga1 keywords different drought magnitudes rain fed agricultural systems early warning of drought loess plateau 1 introduction different form other natural disasters drought has an obvious time accumulation effect this means that as water scarcity continues the intensity and impact of drought is rapidly increasing as are the economic environmental and ecological losses allen et al 2010 jha et al 2019 tran et al 2017 generally when the precipitation in a certain area is lower than the normal level for the same period for a long time it will lead to the meteorological drought md with the further development of md if there is a lack of alternative water supply e g irrigation the soil water stored in the early stage will continue to dissipate until it cannot meet the water demand for the normal growth of crops which will trigger an agricultural drought ad das et al 2020 mishra and singh 2010 especially in the context of global warming the impact of drought on agriculture and food production is particularly significant data from ministry of water resources of china shows that since 1950 20 2 million hectares of crops have been affected by drought each year in china and the annual reduction in grain production due to drought exceeds 16 3 billion kilograms compared with irrigated regions soil moisture in the rain fed areas mainly comes from atmospheric precipitation the fluctuation of precipitation caused by meteorological drought will directly affect the growth and development of crops which leads to a closer relationship between md and ad in rain fed areas rost et al 2009 therefore rain fed agriculture systems are at higher risk in face of drought nielsen et al 2011 establishing a comprehensive understanding of drought is essential to its management vogt et al 2021 k zhou et al 2021 z zhou et al 2021 this requires consideration of physical processes and the driving factors behind drought especially their propagation in the hydrological cycle the transmission process of drought signal from one type of drought to another is considered as drought propagation wu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 specifically in terms of propagation from md to ad since the soil system has a long memory characteristic wu et al 2021 a small scale md may fail to trigger ad due to the influence of soil moisture in the early stage in other words there is a threshold for propagation between the two drought types and md can only cause severe ad if it maintains a certain intensity and persists for a long enough period of time the cumulative time required for a md to trigger an ad is referred to the drought propagation time pt the pt is mainly affected by the regional climate and underlying surface characteristics e g precipitation evaporation soil moisture content reflecting the physical connection between the two types of droughts bevacqua et al 2021 hao et al 2018 van loon and laaha 2015 zhang et al 2021 a shorter propagation time means soil water was consumed more quickly to intensify ad after ad develops to a certain extent soil evaporation tends to decrease which may impact the md in turn and aggravate the feedback of the two kinds of droughts overall pt is not only an important element to study the propagation process of both types of droughts but also an important bridge to understand the relationship between atmospheric and soil systems as well as an important auxiliary indicator for ad early warning and disaster control zhang et al 2021 in recent years several studies have investigated the propagation process from md to ad mo 2011 analyzed the occurrence and recovery of ad in the united states and found that ad usually occurred within a few months after md huang et al 2015 studied the process and factors influencing the propagation of md to ad on a seasonal scale in wei river basin china and found that the response time of md to ad was the fastest in summer and longer in winter and spring which was mainly related to the buffering effect of soil moisture on drought xu et al 2021 evaluated the propagation characteristic of md to ad in different climatic regions at seasonal scales in china and found that the pt gradually increased from 1 to 2 months in summer to 2 7 months in spring of the following year zhang et al 2021 used the spearman rank correlation coefficient to investigate the correlation and propagation process from md to ad in yellow river basin and yangtze river basin in china the results indicated there was a strong link between meteorological and agricultural droughts and the pt from md to ad in summer and autumn was shorter in summer and autumn than in winter and spring in both basins although the above studies are helpful to understand the propagation process from md to ad there is still space for improvement on the one hand in terms of the calculation method of the pt most of the previous studies used the correlation analysis method which is to calculate the linear correlation coefficient between standardized precipitation index spi with various cumulative scales and agricultural drought index e g standardized soil moisture index ssmi with fixed time scale respectively then the time scale of the spi with the highest correlation is chosen as the drought pt this method is simple and widely used huang et al 2015 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 however the spi and agricultural drought index series contain not only drought information but also the information of wet period the pt identified by the correlation analysis method also includes the common propagation effect of both dry transfer signal less precipitation to less soil moisture and wet transfer signal more precipitation to more soil moisture at the same time lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 j wu et al 2021 thus using this method to calculate pt may bring some bias on the other hand the ad states caused by different levels of md should be different and the pt required to trigger ad should theoretically be different but previous studies have not considered this which would reduce the robustness of the research results besides the time scale of the pt identified by previous studies is usually limited to monthly which cannot accurately describe the response process of soil to md in a real state furthermore the reflected drought propagation processes are mostly on a seasonal or monthly scale making it difficult to describe the drought propagation of a particular crop at a critical stage of water demand the main scientific questions of this study include how to determine the high resolution propagation time from different levels of meteorological drought to agricultural drought how different driving factors affect the drought propagation process in each season what is drought propagation time of different crops in their critical water demand stages the main objective of this study is to develop a novel drought propagation time identification framework with high temporal and spatial resolution and can reflect different levels of md stress by using conditional probability and a series of copula functions based on the proposed method standardized precipitation index spi and standardized soil moisture index ssmi in the minimum ten days cumulative scale were used to represent md and ad respectively in the following a scale of ten days will be noted as td and the propagation process of md to ad in typical rainfed agricultural areas of the loess plateau in china was analyzed compared with previous studies the main contribution of this study is as follows i a high spatiotemporal resolution drought propagation time identification framework was proposed ii the pt from meteorological to agricultural drought at multiple levels was obtained iii the pt of winter wheat and spring maize in the critical water demand periods was identified the rest of paper will be organized as follows section 2 will introduce the general overview of the study area and the data used followed by a detailed description of the rationale and operational procedures of the method in section 3 the results will be presented and discussed in section 4 and finally the main conclusions of the paper will be given in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 a the rain fed agricultural area of the loess plateau rflp is located in the south central part of the loess plateau lp in northwestern china 34 2 39 40 n 102 42 113 52 it spans 19 cities in 4 provinces gansu ningxia shaanxi and shanxi from west to east and covers an area of about 302 000 km2 almost half of the total area of the lp the irrigated area of farmland in the study area is always less than 20 which is a typical rain fed agricultural region li et al 2010 the altitude of rflp decreases significantly from west to east and the terrain consists mainly of hills and gullies zhang et al 2008 see fig 1 b main soil type in the study area is loessal soil which is soft rich in mineral nutrients and has strong water capacity li et al 2021 pei et al 2021 the rflp is located at the junction of sub humid and semi arid regions and also has a temperate continental monsoon climate fang et al 2019 resulting in a highly uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in the region with annual precipitation gradually decreasing from 650 mm in the southeast to 245 mm in the northwest see fig 1 c and the precipitation mainly concentrated in summer and autumn accounting for about 80 of the total annual precipitation liu et al 2011 in addition the interannual variability of precipitation is also very large li et al 2020 and the difference in precipitation between wet and dry years is often 3 5 times in rflp the annual average temperature ranges from 4 3 c to 14 3 c fang et al 2019 annual potential evapotranspiration is between 780 mm and 1470 mm with a decreasing trend from northwest to southeast in addition the evaporation in spring and summer is larger and can account for more than 70 of the annual evaporation peng et al 2017 due to the special water and heat conditions the crop system in rflp is one crop per year as shown in fig 1 d where the crop in the northeast of the region is mainly summer maize and in the south is mainly winter wheat in this study area winter wheat is sown in early october and harvested in early july with a total growth period of about 280 days while spring maize is sown in late april and harvested in mid september with a total growth period of about 150 days detailed information about the crop growth period will be shown in the methods section 2 2 dataset the precipitation and soil moisture data used in this study is from the version2 of the global land data assimilation system gldas2 0 which is developed by nasa through ingesting ground observation and satellite remote sensing data into advanced land surface modeling noah clsm with data assimilation technology to obtain land surface states and fluxes value rodell et al 2004 this dataset has been widely used in the study area and has shown good reliability han et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 in this study the precipitation data 1949 1 01 2014 12 30 from gldas2 0 with 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution were used to drive the spi due to the soil moisture data of gldas has been widely used by many scholars for drought monitoring dillon et al 2016 nayak et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 this study selected the soil data to calculate the agricultural drought index ssmi in order to determine suitable soil moisture data to drive ssmi we selected soil moisture data under clsm and noah model as candidates then the spearman correlation coefficient was used to test the dependence between the two datasets and yield of winter wheat and spring maize respectively the grain production data of each city in the rflp comes from china s provincial statistical yearbook http www stats gov cn tjsj ndsj the test results are shown in fig 2 except for some cities the soil moisture from clsm model is generally better than noah simulated soil moisture therefore this paper uses the soil moisture data under the clsm model to drive the agricultural drought index in addition the depth of the soil layer is 1 m and the temporal and spatial resolution and time span are consistent with precipitation in addition the meteorological data including atmospheric pressure air temperature wind speed long wave radiation short wave radiation surface heat flux and specific humidity 0 25 0 25 and daily spatiotemporal resolution in clsm mode is used to drive potential evapotranspiration using penman monteith equation it is noted that these meteorological data have been widely used in study area and all over the world and proved to have a significant correlation with the observed data du and sun 2012 eltazarov et al 2021 han et al 2021 all the meteorological data precipitation and soil moisture datasets can be accessed via https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets gldas clsm025 d 2 0 3 methods as shown in fig 3 a methodological framework for calculating the pt under multiple md scenarios was proposed in this paper the framework includes three parts part1 introducing the calculation process of spi and ssmi in ten days cumulative time scale part2 the drought pt identification method based on copula function and conditional probability and part3 the penman monteith method for calculating potential evapotranspiration and critical stages of crop water requirement 3 1 meteorological and agriculture drought index 3 1 1 standardized precipitation index in the past decades scientists have developed a number of drought indices among which spi and its derived series of drought indices e g spei ssi ssmi have been widely used for their unique advantages choudhury et al 2021 kalisa et al 2020 stagge et al 2015 peng et al 2020 this index is easy to calculate requires less data the time scale of drought can be flexibly changed as needed and has good temporal and spatial comparability for these reasons spi has been recommended by the world meteorological organization hayes et al 2011 and was widely used for md assessment and monitoring spi was firstly proposed by mckee 1993 which indicates drought by comparing the deviation of current precipitation with the average level of the same period in history the calculation process of spi is as follows daily precipitation is firstly accumulated to the required length e g 1 2 n months to get the precipitation series then two parameters gamma distribution function eq 1 is used to calculate the probability of the corresponding precipitation series finally the probability value is normalized to get the spi index the drought classification based on spi value is listed in table1 1 f x 1 β γ γ γ x r 1 e x β x 0 where f x is the gamma distribution β and γ are the scale and shape parameters respectively x denotes the precipitation data in this study the minimum cumulative length of spi was reduced from one month to ten days to meet the requirement of soil response to precipitation change the spi index at the scale of 4 36 td in the rflp was calculated to further calculate the drought propagation time 3 1 2 standardized soil moisture index ssmi is an agricultural drought index developed following the calculation process of spi index compared with spi the input variable of ssmi is changed from precipitation to soil moisture data and the probability distribution model is also changed to a normal distribution according to the fluctuation of soil moisture eq 2 and table 1 show the ssmi calculation equation and the drought classification scheme respectively 2 s s m i s m s m σ where sm denotes the soil moisture value with a certain time scale s m and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the soil moisture series in this study the root zone soil moisture 1 m depth data from gldas2 0 were used to calculate the ssmi at the scale of 3 5 td moreover it should be noted that ssmi 3 represents the soil water status at the 3td scale i e a month scale and since the durations of the two critical water demand periods of winter wheat and spring maize are 4td and 5td ssmi 4 and ssmi 5 represent the soil moisture conditions during the critical water demand periods for these two crops respectively more information about the critical water demand period of crops were introduced in section 3 3 to facilitate understanding in the next section we will explain the calculation process of pt using the monthly span of ssmi 3 as an example 3 2 methods for estimating the propagation time of droughts 3 2 1 copula theory in general it is difficult to determine the joint distribution of random variables by their marginal distributions with the development of copula theory this problem has been solved in a certain extent copula function was originally proposed by sklar rayens and nelsen 2000 with which the joint distribution of any two correlated random variables can be flexibly composed by their marginal distribution in this study two dimensional copula function was used to construct the joint distribution of the spi and ssmi series see eq 3 3 f s p i i s s m i j s p i s s m i p s p i i s p i s s m i j s s m i c f s p i i s p i f s s m i j s s m i where i and j are the time scale corresponding to spi and ssmi respectively f s p i i s s m i j is the joint distribution f spi i and f ssmi j are marginal distributions of the spi i and ssmi j series respectively c denotes a certain copula function since the spi and ssmi are standard normalized variables the normal distribution is chosen as their marginal distribution five copula functions commonly used in the field of hydrometeorology were selected as candidates fang et al 2019 xu et al 2021 see table 2 and the optimal copula function was selected for each grid by the least squared euclidean distance sed and akaike information criterion aic 3 2 2 identification method of drought pt with high spatiotemporal resolution under different levels of md conditions the joint distribution of spi i and ssmi 3 series with ten days and 0 25 0 25 resolution obtained by copula theory in the previous section is shown in the left side of the part2 in fig 3 in order to determine the pt from md to ad the probability of ad under different levels of md was first calculated by the conditional probability formula then a reasonable probability threshold interval was set and when the calculated probability reaches the threshold the cumulative length of time corresponding to spi is used as the pt from md to ad considering that the probability of ad caused by mild md is low and it is generally unable to trigger severe ad this study mainly considers the drought propagation time under moderate severe and extreme md scenarios the specific calculation process is as follows in the first step the probability of ad ssmi 0 5 caused by moderate 1 5 spi 1 severe 2 0 spi 1 5 and extreme meteorological drought spi 2 0 was calculated by conditional probability formula see eqs 4 6 moderate drought

an example to introduce the calculation process of pt as shown in eq 4 and fig 4 n denotes the time length of ad lagging behind md i e the pt which is within the range of 1 33 td p m n is the probability of soil fell into a drought state under the md in the moderate scenarios at the spi cumulative scale of n 3 td according to eq 4 the corresponding conditional probability matrix p m of a certain grid is obtained when n takes 1 33 td using the same method the probability matrices p s p e under severe and extreme md conditions are obtained through eq 5 and eq 6 respectively after obtaining the probability matrix p m the next step is to identify the pt based on whether the probability value exceeds a certain threshold this process is shown in the flowchart of part2 in fig 3 firstly set the initial threshold k to 0 8 and find the maximum value p max of p m then judge whether the p max exceeds 0 7 if so further judge whether p max exceeds the preset threshold k k 0 8 if it exceed again it will be fixed threshold to k 0 8 then assign n in order from 1 to 33 and judge whether p m n is equal to or greater than the fixed threshold if so got the drought propagation time for n but if the p max is less than the initial threshold k decrease the threshold requirement by setting k k 0 1 k 0 79 and judge whether p max exceeds the new preset threshold k if so the fixed threshold is obtained as k 0 79 then judge the p m matrix from n 1 as above to determine pt if p max is still less than the preset threshold k decrease the threshold requirement again k k 0 1 until k 0 7 in addition if p max is smaller than 0 7 at the beginning the p max is directly used as the threshold and the pt is equal to n according to the position order of p max in p m 3 3 penman monteith method and critical stages of crop water requirement 3 3 1 penman monteith method evaporation is not only a reflection of energy balance but also an important part of the hydrological cycle the spatial distribution of potential evapotranspiration is likely to directly affect the propagation process from md to ad manning et al 2018 in order to analyze the spatial distribution of drought propagation time we used the penman monteith method eq 7 to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet in the rflp this method is based on energy balance and aerodynamics and uses water pressure net solar radiation wind speed and other factors to determine pet because it has a clear physical meaning this is the preferred method recommended by fao to calculate pet ficklin et al 2015 and it has been widely used in lp areas with high reliability li et al 2012 yue et al 2019 7 p e t 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net surface radiation g is the soil heat flux t is the average temperature u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m e s is the saturated water pressure e a is the actual water pressure δ is the slope of the saturated water pressure curve and γ is the psychrometer constant 3 3 2 critical stages of crop water requirement as shown in fig 1 d winter wheat is the main grain crop in the south of rflp previous studies in this area have shown that the jointing heading stage is a critical stage for the transformation of winter wheat from vegetative growth to reproductive growth sun et al 2018 at this stage the plants grow rapidly and need a lot of water support sufficient soil moisture has a significant positive effect on the final yield another critical water requirement stage for winter wheat is at the pre sowing stage soil moisture at this stage is not only related to the sowing and pre winter seedling growth but also related to the wheat growth during regreening stage in the next year therefore it also has a significant positive effect on the final yield in addition spring maize is main food crop in the middle and northeast of rflp the jointing tasseling stage and the pustulation milky stage are the key periods of vegetative and reproductive growth of the spring maize respectively guo et al 2021 maize needs a lot of water supply during these two stages which are selected as the critical water demand periods for spring maize after consulting the growth period maps of major crops in china table 3 shows detailed information on the critical water requirements of the two types of crops chen et al 2021 in the next section the pt from january to december was calculated using our proposed method and the drought pt of spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february was obtained by averaging the monthly pt values in addition to investigate the change of drought propagation we divided the entire study period into two equal parts so that each part exceeded 30 years to meet the historical record limit of a minimum time span of 30 years required to calculate the spi part 1 1949 1981 part 2 1982 2014 rad et al 2017 then the pt of crops in the critical water demand stage during these two periods were calculated 4 results and discussion 4 1 reliability analysis of research methods with the help of copula theory and conditional probability framework the proposed drought pt calculation method can not only analyze the drought propagation process under different levels of md conditions but also separate the non drought information in the drought index series when extracting the drought pt from the propagation probability matrix instead of choosing a fixed threshold e g selecting the cumulative time corresponding to the maximum value in the probability matrix a variable threshold interval is chosen to filter the pt because the fixed threshold could not meet the timely warning needs of ad fig 5 shows the propagation probability matrix from january to december calculated from 10 randomly selected grids in the study area under moderate md scenarios as shown in the figure the probability of md propagation to ad increases with the accumulation of md scale if the maximum value in the matrix is selected as a fixed threshold to filter the time of drought propagation the resulting drought pt will be too long but the probability before the maximum value is not low and also prone to trigger agricultural drought this is especially prominent in summer in order to avoid ignoring the shorter drought propagation time and to improve the timely warning of agricultural drought this study used a probability threshold interval of 0 7 0 8 to determine the drought propagation time only when the propagation probability exceeds the value in this interval the corresponding spi cumulative scale is selected as the drought pt so that the time required for md to trigger ad is basically at a high confidence level of not less than 0 7 0 8 there may be a phenomenon that the maximum value of the probability matrix cannot exceed 0 7 in fact this phenomenon is rare in all grids 570 and only occurs under moderate meteorological drought conditions when p max is less than 0 7 we directly use the lag scale corresponding to p max as the drought pt to ensure a high confidence probability in addition it was found that the probability of judging pt increased with the aggravation of md levels for example in spring as the md gradually increases from moderate severe to extreme degree the average probability corresponding to propagation time n for all grids are 0 76 0 83 and 0 87 respectively furthermore as can be seen in fig 5 the conditional probability matrix for each grid varies somewhat regularly and differently throughout the year which will be analyzed and discussed in the next section 4 2 seasonal distribution of drought propagation time under different levels of md conditions the process of pt changes that trigger ad in each season can be summarized as follows as shown in fig 6 the pt is relatively short in summer and autumn and longer in spring and winter which is consistent with previous studies conducted in the study area huang et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 in addition compared with the previous study since we use the drought index calculated with a minimum of 10 days as the cumulative unit to capture drought the obtained drought propagation time also has a finer time resolution with the aggravation of the md the time required to trigger ad is decreasing and the shortening range of pt in spring and summer is most evident in addition it can be seen from the figure that the values of pt in spring are more dispersed while the range of values in autumn and winter are more concentrated furthermore as the drought level increases the pt gradually tends to a fixed interval which is especially evident in summer as shown in fig 7 the spatial distribution of drought pt in each grid of rflp showed that there were significant differences in the spatial distribution of drought pt in different regions seasons and under different drought conditions the moderate md scenario is taken as an example to compare the distribution characteristics of drought pt on various seasonal scales firstly in spring the areas with shorter pt are mainly concentrated in the central and northwestern regions of the rflp with pt between 5 and 10 td while the regions with longer pt are mainly distributed in the northeastern and southwestern fringes and could be as long as 20 28 td entering summer except for a few areas in the northeast and southwest the drought pt is significantly shorter than spring and the drought pt is mainly concentrated in 1 5td then in autumn the distribution of drought pt is more uniform in space and it is slightly longer than that in summer mainly concentrated in 3 10 td finally in winter the distribution characteristics of the pt are similar to that in spring but the spatial discrepancy is not very obvious with relatively short drought pt in the central region concentrated in 7 12 td and longer drought pt in the northeast and southwest concentrated in 15 20 td then the pts under different meteorological drought scenarios were compared longitudinally it was found that the drought propagation process accelerated and spatial heterogeneity decreased with increasing md levels until the spatial distribution of drought pt converged under extreme md scenarios spring 3 15 td summer 1 6 td autumn 1 8 td and winter 4 16 td and the pt decreased the most in spring it should be noted that in rflp the process of md to ad was faster in the central region yulin yan an and qingyang than in other regions both in different seasons and in different drought scenarios and the faster propagation process showed a gradual spread from the central region to the surrounding areas with the change of seasons and the increase of md degree it can be concluded that the central region of rflp is the hotspot of ad where the propagation process from md to ad is the fastest and crops lack sufficient time to buffer the damage caused by drought which is unfavorable to the agricultural production this finding is consistent with the historical record of frequent agricultural droughts in this area fang et al 2019 han et al 2021 in order to further verify the reliability of the results we randomly selected a grid in the study area and extracted all meteorological and agricultural drought events in the grid from 1949 to 2014 by using the run theory method wu et al 2018 the real pt of the two types of droughts is obtained by matching the drought events and compared with the calculated results in this paper the matching method is shown in fig 8 the blue and red shadows in the figure represent meteorological and agricultural drought events respectively the time interval between the peak points of md and ad is selected as the real pt of the two types of drought bevacqua et al 2021 fig 9 shows a total of 36 drought events obtained through matching the green red yellow and gray shaded areas in the figure represent that ad occurred in spring summer autumn and winter respectively the matched pt is classified by season and averaged to obtain the real pt on the seasonal scale and compared with the average result of the pt at each level calculated in this paper as shown in fig 10 the pt in summer autumn and winter is slightly lower than the real pt while the pt in spring is slightly higher than the real pt overall the two propagation times show good agreement in each season which can further validate the reliability of our proposed method 4 3 driving force analysis of drought propagation process rflp is located in the hinterland of the loess plateau and is affected by the temperate continental monsoon climate the region has less precipitation more sunny and windy days leading to intense evaporation activities with annual pet often exceeding 1000 mm and its uneven temporal and spatial distribution li et al 2012 which are the main driving factor for the propagation of md to ad in addition the spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation and soil water content are also important factors influencing drought propagation fang et al 2020 huang et al 2015 figs 11 13 show the seasonal distribution of pet precipitation and soil moisture status in rflp respectively first as shown in figs 11 13 in spring the evaporation capacity of the central and eastern regions of rflp is larger than that in the southwestern region soil moisture in the eastern region is significantly higher than that in the central and northwestern regions with spring precipitation concentrated mainly on the southern edge and difficult to infiltrate into the interior regions evaporation is greater in the central region compared to other regions of the rflp precipitation and soil moisture in this region are relatively low compared to other regions when the md occurs strong evaporation will rapidly reduce the moisture in the soil and rapidly trigger ad due to the lack of additional moisture replenishment which may be the reason for the fastest drought propagation process in the central region in addition although the evaporation capacity of the eastern region is as large as that in the central region the soil moisture in this region is more sufficient so that even if the soil evaporates quickly sufficient soil moisture has a good buffering effect on the md huang et al 2015 wu et al 2021 therefore the process of drought propagation in the eastern region is slower than that in the central region on the contrary in the northwest of rflp although the evaporation was significantly less than that in the central and eastern regions however the soil moisture content in this area is relatively lower and the buffering effect of soil moisture on md is not significant which shortens the drought pt furthermore due to the temperature rise in spring the winter snow gradually melts further replenishing the soil moisture which can alleviate the pressure of md and prolong the propagation process of drought in summer pet reaches its highest level of the year throughout the region due to high temperatures and strong solar radiation summer precipitation is at its highest but the patterns of precipitation is mainly short term and concentrated heavy rain resulting in most of the water flowing away as runoff wu et al 2017 which together with strong evaporation limits the accumulation of soil moisture the combined effect of severe evaporation activity and lower soil moisture storage resulted in the shortest drought pt of rflp in summer in autumn with the gradual decrease of temperature the evaporation capacity also decreases significantly and the soil water dissipation rate decreases due to sufficient precipitation replenishment in autumn making the drought propagation process longer in autumn than in summer finally although there is a lack of precipitation in winter the rate of soil moisture dissipation decreases significantly because temperature and radiation drop to the lowest throughout the year and evaporation also drops to the lowest which makes the propagation process of winter drought very slow and the pt of winter drought is significantly longer than that of other seasons in general potential evapotranspiration is the main driving of drought propagation while adequate precipitation and soil moisture have a buffering effect on the development of drought in terms of the spatial distribution of pt due to the inability of precipitation to go deep into the central region the soil humidity in this region is low and the strong evaporation capacity leads to the shortest pt in this region in terms of the time distribution of pt the rainy season in the study area is mainly in summer and autumn from june to october but the higher temperature in this period leads to a strong evaporation capacity and a faster propagation process from md to ad the dry season is mainly concentrated in winter and spring november to may of the following year although there is not much precipitation during this period the accumulation of soil moisture during the rainy season and the snowmelt in spring combine to cause the propagation of drought to be prolonged during these two seasons due to lower temperatures and weaker evapotranspiration in addition the higher evapotranspiration capacity in spring and summer may be responsible for the greatest decline in pt with increasing md levels in these two seasons although sufficient soil moisture helps to mitigate the adverse effects of rapid evapotranspiration on drought propagation this buffering effect will diminish with increasing md levels under extreme md the pt will be greatly shortened even in the eastern region with sufficient soil water furthermore the spatial distribution of drought pt is also more consistent in autumn and winter than in the other two seasons because the difference in spatial distribution of pet is smaller in autumn and winter than in spring and summer 4 4 drought propagation time in critical stages of crop water demand in different periods 4 4 1 pt of winter wheat in critical stages of water demand and its variation the pt of md to ad in the two periods was calculated by using the proposed method as shown in fig 14 a and b represent the spatial distribution of pt in jointing heading stage and pre sowing stage respectively first on the whole the drought pt during the jointing heading stage is significantly longer than that of the pre sowing stage which is mainly related to the seasonal period in which they are located with the jointing heading mainly in spring and the pre sowing in summer then under the moderate md scenario it can be seen from the figure that during the jointing heading stage the drought in the central eastern region qingyang baiyin lanzhou and pingliang is less than 10 td while in other areas it is between 15 and 24td in the pre sowing stage the pt is relatively uniform concentrated in 3 5td and shortened in both stages as the drought level increased compare with the first study period in the jointing heading stage the drought pt in the second period is significantly shorter in the western region of the winter wheat planting area this may be related to the change of pet in this area it is found that the pet in this area increased obviously at the second period which accelerated the propagation process it implies that ad will be triggered more quickly after the onset of md the accelerated propagation of drought during jointing and heading stage will further worsen the impact of md which is very unfavorable for the crop production and relevant agricultural authorities need to pay great attention to this stage for the pre sowing stage there was no significant change in the spatial distribution of drought pt in the first and second periods fig 15 shows the average pt from md to ad at the city scale in the second period and it can be found that cities such as tongchuan qingyang and pingliang which are located in the middle of rflp had a shorter pt under extreme drought conditions the pt in these cities is less than 2 td and this information has positive implications for early warning of local agricultural drought 4 4 2 pt of spring maize in critical stages of water demand and its variation the calculation results of the pt of spring maize in two periods are shown in fig 16 it can be found that in the jointing tasseling stage with the aggravation of md levels the drought propagation process is accelerating in the northeast of corn planting area but there is no significant change in pustulation milky stage and the pt of both stages is less than 5 td in the extreme md situation in addition during the jointing tasseling stage it can be found that the drought pt of second period in the northern corn planting area is slightly shorter than that in the first period comparing these two periods there is no significant change in pet in the area but there is some decrease in soil moisture in the second period the reduction in the buffering effect of the soil may be one of the reasons for the acceleration of the propagation of drought in this region furthermore there is no obvious change in the spatial distribution of drought pt during the pustulation milky stage the drought pt of each city during the second period of critical water demand stages is also shown in fig 17 it should be noted that yulin and yan an have a shorter drought propagation time compared to other cities with the drought pt shortens to 1td under extreme drought conditions the obtained drought pt during the critical stages of crop water demand in each region is of positive significance for the early warning of local agricultural drought agricultural water managers and water use authorities can prepare in advance for drought pt under different meteorological drought scenarios for example by reducing the water expenditure of crops during the non critical water demand period and reserving sufficient water for crops in critical water demand periods the impact of md on crop growth can be reduced and the scientific and rational use of valuable water resources can be realized and it can promote cleaner production by increasing the amount of carbon sequestered by vegetation during drought in addition if there is no surplus water source available the economic losses can be minimized by timely replanting some drought resistant crops such as groundnut potato 5 conclusions in order to address the current problems and limitations in the field of drought propagation research a new method for calculating pt from md to ad was proposed based on copula function and conditional probability theory the pt under different levels of md was identified and the spatial and temporal resolution of pt was significantly improved the drought propagation process of typical rain fed agricultural area in loess plateau from 1949 to 2014 was studied by using the proposed method and the main conclusions are as follows 1 temporally the pt of drought was shorter in winter and spring and longer in summer and autumn spatially the central part of rflp was the hot spot of drought and its propagation process was faster than the surrounding areas the main reason for the significant difference of drought pt in time and space is the characteristics of water and heat conditions over time and space strong evaporation capacity can promote drought propagation in addition higher soil moisture has a good buffering effect on md and can slow down the propagation process to ad 2 the buffering effect of soil moisture can be weakened with the exacerbation of drought as the aggravation of md levels the process of drought propagation could be accelerated and the shortening of pt was most obvious in spring and summer which may be related to the high evaporation capacity in these two seasons under extreme md conditions the pt in spring summer autumn and winter were 3 15 1 6 1 8 and 4 16 td respectively 3 the whole study period was divided into two equal periods and the drought pt of winter wheat and spring maize in the critical stages of water demand was calculated it can be found that the pt in jointing heading stage of winter wheat and jointing tasseling stage of spring maize in the second period 1982 2014 was shorter than that in the first period 1949 1981 which may be related to the regional water and heat changes the regional averages of each grid were used to obtain the drought pt of each city at the critical stage of crop water demand it was found that yulin yan an tongchuan qingyang and pingliang located in the middle of rflp had a relatively fast propagation process the pt in these cities under extreme drought conditions tended to be less than 2td it should be noted that the drought propagation process was the fastest in the central region of rflp stakeholders often lack sufficient time to respond to the hit of drought which will seriously affect local agricultural production in addition a significant shortening trend of drought pt was detected at the jointing heading stage of winter wheat which will make it difficult to prevent ad and relevant agricultural authorities should pay attention to crop growth at this stage to avoid serious risk of grain yield reduction the identification framework of pt proposed in this study has a high probability credibility and can be used to study the drought propagation process in other rain fed agricultural areas however this framework is based on data statistics and there are still has some limitations for example for a specific md with a certain duration severity intensity and spatial range of impact it is still difficult to accurately identify the duration intensity and spatial range of ad caused by the md in depth research on drought propagation is still needed to address these challenges declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9707,crop models allow simulating irrigated plant dynamics at the plot level however in many places irrigation is managed collectively to share water at the network level to study the impact of the irrigation network constraints on plant dynamics we proposed a co simulation approach based on the coupling of the optirrig crop model at the plot level with the watasit agent based model at the network level as a proof of concept applied on a typical gravity network of the south east of france the approach allowed to consider the effects of the network spatial i e water flow gradient and temporal i e network coordination constraints on leaf area index and water stress index dynamics of 16 cereal plots four progressive levels of collective irrigation constraints are simulated no collective constraints space collective constraints time collective constraints and space and time collective constraints retrospective simulation of the 2017 irrigation campaign is consistent with field surveys and simulation results suggest that plant water stress could be underestimated when simulated at the plot level rather than at the network level spatially the most severe water stress was observed for the plants located furthest downstream of the network temporally the absence of network coordination can lead to earlier plant water stress and lower plant growth during the collective irrigation campaign while time slot based coordination tends to delay the impact for future research reinforcing the coupling from the crop model to the agent based model could allow to study the feedback loop of plant dynamics on irrigation practice adaptations it is also a first step towards an optimization approach for irrigation networks keywords co simulation irrigation network crop model agent based model water stress wsi lai 1 introduction crop models simulate plant dynamics according to the climate soil plant interactions therefore they are useful to evaluate the effects of irrigation on plant growth and water stress at the plot level in recent years several simulation platforms e g record harvestchoice maelia have been developed firstly to facilitate the automation of crop models but also to better take into account context dependent constraints at other levels than the plot level harvestchoice 2010 gaudou et al 2013 on the other hand agent based models abms

incorporating disparate entities and for studying their local interactions bousquet and le page 2004 matthews et al 2007 they are well suited to take into consideration key micro level constraints rather than aggregated system representations filatova et al 2013 especially the agriculture environment interactions e g valbuena et al 2010 scholars have explored various ways for associating agent

wofos wolf and van diepen 1995 reidsma et al 2009 supit et al 2012 was reformulated into the modular python crop simulation development programming structure de wit 2015 gaudou et al 2013 have integrated aqyield nolot and debaeke 2003 murgue et al 2014 constantin et al 2015 into the maelia multi agent platform several studies have shown the usefulness of coupling cellular components representing a landscape with an agent based simulator at the household or farmer level with behaviors that alter the landscape parker et al 2003 verburg et al 2004 berger et al 2006 such approaches enable assessing the environmental economic and social impacts of the combined changes in agricultural activities demography dynamics of land cover and climate thanks to these platforms changes in cropping systems access to water irrigation inputs cost and availability have been assessed in terms of their impact on plant dynamics notably through proxies of plant development and production such as the leaf area index lai monteith 1977 and the water stress index wsi jones 1992 however few scholars have proposed to study the potential impacts due to irrigation network constraints on plant dynamics in particular in gravity fed networks merot et al 2008 have shown the importance of water distribution constraints and irrigation inter related practices to ensure irrigation operations in the crau plain france at the level of the irrigated scheme the spatial constraints to operate irrigation include for example the variation of flow rate and water availability along the upstream downstream gradient in the abduction network according to its withdrawals seepage and hydraulic limitations during the irrigation campaign the possibilities for temporal adjustment of irrigators calendar are thus limited by these spatial constraints and depend on the behavior of other irrigators influencing the network flow rate in particular irrigation coordination is a key factor for sharing water resource that must be distributed through a common network in the right place and time to all along the irrigation campaign in this context our simulation approach aims at capturing the potential impacts of spatial i e network flow gradient and temporal i e network coordination constraints due to a gravity irrigation network on plant lai and wsi dynamics integrated simulation approaches that merge models into a unified software package e g matthews 2006 schreinemachers et al 2007 gaudou et al 2013 are useful to capture the complex human environment interactions and shed light on the understanding of the system dynamics with potential entry points for policy design dragan et al 2003 however model simplifications commonly occur when merging modules especially of environmental processes e g schreinemachers et al 2007 2010 altering the model s ability to fully capture interactions a more flexible method called co simulation also used by scholars in farming and environmental modeling e g warner et al 2008 bithell and brasington 2009 bulatewicz et al 2010 consist in coupling simulation software together rather than integrating individual components in a single modeling and simulation software the main advantage is that there is no need for recoding components and consequently the users and developer s community of each model component may be asked to help with the coupled model control code provide and test new modules however it involves conceptual and programming developments to ensure compatibility of many characteristics including basic assumptions spatial and time scales first it requires to make sure that models components and associated software have communication features and manage disruption correctly last but not least it requires a clear conceptual approach to organize scheduling between the models and between the simulation software the objective of this paper is to present a co simulation approach based on the coupling of the optirrig crop model at the plot level with the watasit agent based model at the irrigation network level as a proof of concept we applied the approach for capturing the potential impact of a typical gravity fed network in the south east of france on 16 cereal plots we simulated a dry year irrigation campaign under four levels of collective irrigation constraints i e no collective constraint space collective constraint time collective constraint and space and time collective constraints and we compared lai and wsi dynamics of cereal plots the next sections present the overall co simulation approach section 2 the study area and the specific models developed for the proof of concept section 3 and the simulation results for the four levels of collective irrigation constraints section 4 before discussing the added value limitations and perspectives in section 5 2 singular features of the co simulation approach 2 1 overview the purpose of the co simulation is to capture the potential impacts on crop lai and wsi dynamics induced by the gravity irrigation network when operating irrigation during a collective irrigation campaign the approach consists in linking a crop model at the plot level and an abm at the network level based on the daily coupling of their two simulation software described in table 1 it uses the optirrig crop model for simulating lai and wsi as a proxy for crop development and water stress and the watasit abm at the network level for generating irrigation operations under four progressive levels of collective irrigation constraints see section 3 6 optirrig simulates climate soil plant interactions daily in which irrigation dates i on each plot are forced by watasit through a daily coupling fig 1 watasit is itself nourished by the state of maturity of the crops tt provided by the optirrig model if there is a conflict for the sharing of water in the collective gravity network it is managed by the abm and may induce a delay in irrigation for some of the irrigators who would aim to irrigate at the same time 2 2 technical features co simulation involves the communication of several model components that include their solvers meaning that the components can compute of the effects of external events and time advance these components are viewed as slaves processes and are orchestrated by an external program referred to as a master algorithm the co simulation approach has required then the development of specifics application programming interface apis designed as sets of r functions so that the model components that we used can be driven as slave processes by the master algorithm the first api called rcormas 1 1 rcormas is available at https gitlab irstea fr cormas dev r cormas is based on the http protocol and allows communication between the r software in which the master algorithm is implemented and the cormas platform running the abm we will call the second api the roptirrig that enable the master algorithm to communicate with the optirrig d simulator already coded in r both apis allow piloting the simulations by initializing the model getting and setting values from entities and running simulation steps the master algorithm uses those apis to first initialize both models and then to run two phases of simulation that are organized as follows a in the time period from the beginning of the simulation to the beginning of the irrigation campaign no irrigation is present and the crop related lai wsi and tt variables are calculated by the crop model from the climatic forcing only fig 1 a b during the irrigation campaign the coupling between the crop model at the plot level and the abm at the network level is activated the crop model otpirrig d keeps the history of all necessary state variables from one day to another and calculates the state variables according to the daily update of i transmitted by the abm on each plot fig 1 b each day first the crop model simulates lai wsi and tt for each crop we assume that the crop growth process is slow enough that we do not need to calculate it by the hour the precipitation p and the sum of temperature tt are then transmitted to the abm second the abm generates the irrigation operations made by the agents constrained by the collective network that could modify i for the current day third i is collected and transferred to the crop model for each plot and new lai and wsi are computed this sequence is repeated every day until the end of the simulation period in both a and b if tt exceeds the cereal temperature of maturity tm the irrigation campaign is stopped for the cereal plot i is null in the end the original features of the approach are the consideration of a collective level of spatial and temporal constraints to operate irrigation simulated within the gravity network thanks to the abm and their daily consequences for the dynamics of plants lai and wsi at the plot level 3 study area and specific models developed for the proof of concept 3 1 study area and data collection to illustrate the co simulation approach we selected the aspres sur buëch case study fig 2 in which 83 plots can be irrigated by 10 irrigators sharing the gravity fed network the case study is located in the buëch catchment a sub basin of the durance with a surface area of 1490 km2 in france collective irrigation constitutes by far the use that takes the most from the water resource during the low water period from may to october several irrigator unions are equipped either for gravity fed irrigation or for pressurized irrigation or both fig 2 right side the aspres sur buëch gravity network is fairly representative in terms of location in the upstream part of the basin irrigable area with 75 ha whereas the average is 50 ha in 2017 and crop rotation 23 7 cereals in 2017 for practical reasons of crop model parameterization we focus on 16 plots of cereal fig 2 right side made of 12 plots of winter cereal and 4 plots of springs cereal that belong to 6 of the 10 irrigators sharing the gravity network a description of the crop type plot area and irrigator identifiers of the 16 cereal plots is available in supplementary materials irrigation on the other plots served by the network is thus not driven by tt to be stopped at the end of the simulation period to verify that the co simulation results are trustworthy we conducted field surveys on the study area as direct observation of irrigators practices and semi structured interviews about the irrigation campaign that took place between may and september 2017 the interviews were conducted with four irrigators the technician in charge of the water network regulation and the president of the irrigator union as the information collected covered the entire irrigated command area the coordination of the gravity network through a daily slot calendar has been gradually abandoned during the last 15 years as it was temporally very restrictive according to the interviewees we have captured the latest version in place the one known to all the interviewees the branches of the canal were watered according to four time slots a b c and d fig 2 during a time slot water flows only in the branches designated by the calendar e g the green branch during slot a the blue branch during slot b etc the different daily slots follow one after the other in ten days currently irrigators don t coordinate the water network anymore to trigger irrigation the water flows simultaneously and continuously in all the branches of the canal until the end of the irrigation campaign other information collected is further detailed in supplementary materials 3 2 optirrig d crop dynamics at the plot level the optirrig model is a two layer structure in which the inner layer performs hydro agronomic calculations having rewritten and modified the concepts originally present in the pilote model mailhol et al 1997 2011 khaledian et al 2009 feng et al 2014 and now termed pilote r as coded in the r language the outer layer of optirrig allows the use of multiple runs for various numerical purposes e g exploratory scenarios of irrigation and fertilization and or climatic scenarios uncertainty and sensitivity analysis model fitting or irrigation fig 3 gives an overview of the structure and main variables of the model among which are lai and wsi the water stress index wsi the ratio between actual transpiration and maximal transpiration is calculated by the soil module as a moving average of 10 days the leaf area index lai simulation is performed using the following equation 1 lai j lai max tt j ts tf β exp β α 1 tt j ts tf α 1 wsi λ 2 where tt j k 1 k j t k tb and subscript j corresponds to a given lai date t k the average daily temperature of day k tb the base temperature of the crop laimax the maximum value of the lai and ts the temperature of emergence α and β two shape parameters for lai curves wsi the water stress factor and λ a parameter governing plant sensitivity to water stress complementary description of the soil and crop modules of optirrig are available in supplementary materials practically we involved a recent version of the optirrig model cheviron et al 2016 developed at inrae g eau this optirrig d version specifically developed for the co simulation approach d denotes the specific daily horizon of simulation allows the external forcing of irrigation instructions for certain time steps before the calculation of model state variables which are always passed to the abm at the end of the daily time step whether irrigation takes place or not the optirrig d version developed in this study is thus a daily function derived from the optirrig model which is usually run without interruption from the beginning to the end of the simulation period in this classical use irrigation i in l m 2 d 1 in legal units often given as mm is either scheduled according to decision rules resulting in an irrigation calendar or decided from field data and or model predictions typically when the amount of water available in the root zone reservoirs r 1 r 2 goes under a certain threshold see supplementary materials however as the coupling with the abm requires forcing i according to agent actions it is necessary to be able to modify it during the course of the simulation at each daily time step 3 3 watasit aspres collective irrigation at the gravity network level we use the odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 to describe the model 3 3 1 overview the watasit abm is designed to simulate the irrigation operations of irrigators sharing a common water network during a collective irrigation campaign it explicitly represents the irrigation options left by the network constraints of the irrigators the constraints taken into account in watasit aspres are presented in table 2 an irrigation possibility is generated on the plots where these constraints make irrigation possible at a given hourly time step 3 3 2 entities the model is based on the distinction between the elements that are involved in irrigation operations called operational entities and the areas over which operational entities can operate called spatial entities which are the farm plot the farm and the irrigation scheme area in the model the operational entities are the irrigator agents and the objects which are actionable by an irrigator agent such as the network branch intake junction and release points the floodgate at each farm plot and the crops the third kind of entity is an artifact that makes explicit some abstract things of the real world such as options to irrigate called affordances resulting from the interactions between an irrigator agent and a hydraulic object typically a floodgate description of all entities is available in supplementary materials 3 3 3 process overview and scheduling the model is based on a double time step each day there is first initialization of the current precipitation conditions and also of the number of days since the crops have not been irrigated then every hour the flow is updated in the network according to network junction state i e opened or closed and ended actions irrigation options are then generated on each farm depending on the irrigator s decision making rules fig 4 an option can be chosen to make a flood action or ask for more water in the canal an activity diagram presenting process scheduling is available in supplementary materials as well as detailed descriptions of the affordance generation sub model action execution sub model and simplified hydraulic sub model of the gravity network 3 3 4 design concepts watasit represents the phase of implementation of actions according to the theory of situated action dreyfus 1972 suchman 1987 in the model the behavior of the irrigator agents is determined by their options to irrigate which are re evaluated at each hourly time step each agent chooses none or one option among its set of options and performs it when one agent has performed an option sets of options of all agents need updating irrigator agents interact indirectly with each other by reducing the amount of water available in the network which affects the options of the other agents sharing the same or a downstream branch design concepts of the model are further detailed in supplementary materials 3 3 5 details the model called watasit aspres has been already deployed to represent the aspres sur buëch case study richard et al 2020a 2020b for which the specific parameterization has been detailed spatial entities were initialized using a pre processing that consists of rasterizing the farm plot shapefiles table 3 onto a 54 44 cell grid with a resolution of 75 m the water network was also initialized using shapefiles table 3 at the initialization farm plots served by the network were listed for each canal branch daily precipitation input comes from the french near surface safran reanalysis vidal et al 2010 3 4 coupled model inputs and parameterization as for watasit optirrig d inputs are the climatic forcing precipitation temperature global radiation and reference evapotranspiration and were obtained from the french safran reanalysis vidal et al 2010 from january 1 2017 to december 31 2017 parameters of both models are specified in appendix a table a 1 concerning optirrig typical parameters of winter soft wheat have been considered for all winter cereals parameters for spring cereals are based on typical spring oat parameters for a given crop literature e g cox and joliff 1986 howell et al 1996 can provide some parameters such as the laimax tf and the tm parameter all these parameters are linked to the base temperature tb parameter which is also given in relevant literature see mailhol et al 1997 sowing doy are average dates reported by irrigators during the 2016 2017 crop campaign for the study area available water reserve awr and maximum profile and rooting depth pmax for the study area are from the paca regional soil reference system described in braud et al 2013 moreover awr in the soil of the plots in the study area was calculated from the paca regional soil reference system using a method presented in manus et al 2009 concerning watasit aspres the key parameter is the target plot flood duration d as irrigation continues until reaching 4 h for a plot area of 1 hectare as the flow rate of the floodgate qflood see table a 1 is fixed it is equivalent to inject a fixed irrigation dose of 43 2 mm per day idose see table a 1 other parameters are specific irrigation operations and gravity fed network characteristics mentioned by the irrigators for the study area in particular the reference flow rate at the network intake qref see table b 1 was determined by the irrigators to avoid overflow and comply with the river abstraction rules during the 2017 low flow period also note that no irrigation restrictions came into effect during the 2017 cereal campaign decision making for irrigation consists in irrigating crops after several days without sufficient precipitation inputs to contain as much as possible a maximum of successive non irrigated days fig 4 as water is not always sufficiently available to irrigate a plot irrigator agents have three kinds of options irrigate a plot with a flood option ask for increasing the water flow in the network with an askmorewater option and do something else during this time step finally a plot for which the irrigator has not had an option to irrigate for a certain period of time is abandoned for irrigation see fig 4 3 5 simulations we simulated the 2017 retrospective irrigation campaign under four levels of collective network constraints table 4 the co simulation approach is used for simulating the space collective constraint due to the sharing of water among irrigators through the gravity fig 1 b the time collective constraint is represented by the time slot based coordination described in section 3 1 and fig 2 right side for the study area either in the abm or directly implemented in the crop model we called no collective constraint nocollcons the simulation in which irrigators optimally irrigate at the plot level without nor the spatial collective constraint due to the gravity network neither the time collective constraint due to the time slot based coordination irrigation is simulated at the plot level by the optirrig d model only fig 1 a this simulation thus shortcuts the watasit aspres model during the whole simulation period including the irrigation campaign nocollcons does not consider any possibility of conflict between irrigators for the sharing of water irrigation decisions are then equivalent to a regular plot based calendar we called space collective constraint spacollcons the simulation in which irrigation is simulated at the network level by the coupled models fig 1 b without the time collective constraint due to time slot based coordination the sharing of water for the irrigation operations is spatially driven by the gravity network constraints table 2 that cannot allow distributing water everywhere at the same time as irrigators do not coordinate the network water flows simultaneously in all the branches of the gravity network during the irrigation campaign space and time collective constraints spatimecollcons is the simulation in which irrigation is simulated at the network level by the coupled models fig 1 b driven both by the gravity network constraints table 2 and by the time slot based coordination it depicts flow coordination using a daily slot i e a b c or d for each network branch constraining temporally irrigation operations as described in section 3 1 and presented in fig 2 right side finally time collective constraint timcollcons is the simulation in which irrigators irrigate at the plot level following the time slot based coordination but without the gravity network constraints irrigation is simulated at the plot level by the optirrig d model only fig 1 a with irrigation dates constrained by similar daily slots as in the spatimcollcons simulation but directly generated in the optirrig d model the total simulation period runs from 15 october or day of year 1 doy 1 when the winter cereals are sown to the end of the cereal season on july 31 doy 289 the co simulation starts at the beginning of the irrigation campaign on may 1st doy 198 when irrigators of aspres sur buëch water their network each year 2017 is taken as a reference for the climatic forcing simulation output i e dates of irrigation lai tt and wsi on each farm plot are collected from the two models by recording attributes of watasit aspres entities i e irrigated state of farm plot entities and optirrig d variables i e cereal lai tt and wsi in the r software during the irrigation campaign in sections 4 3 and 4 4 we also indicate an output from an extreme simulation run called noirri without any irrigation input during the irrigation campaign as a benchmark wsi equals 1 is corresponding to low plant water stress blue yellow orange and red colors denote low wsi 0 75 medium 0 5 wsi 0 75 high 0 25 wsi 0 5 and very high wsi 0 25 water stress respectively 4 simulation results 4 1 irrigation dates for the four levels of gravity collective network constraints this section presents the irrigation dates of the 16 cereal plots simulated for the four levels of collective irrigation network constraints table 4 the two top lines nocollcons and spacollcons of fig 5 correspond to irrigation dates when the network is not coordinated in the nocollcons simulation the plots are irrigated simultaneously on a regular 12 days basis until maturity temperature is reached materialized by the green lines this is not the case in the spacollcons simulation in which we observed significant delays between the series of irrigation and no irrigation for the most downstream plots 10 14 and 4 for instance 28 days separate the series of irrigation between doy 207 and doy 235 taking into account the spatial network constraint thus leads to both the abandonment of the most downstream plots i e plots 4 10 and 14 and significant delays in series of irrigation as a consequence of irrigation delays maturity of the crops is reached later for some of the crops e g 3 and 4 days for plots 15 and 16 respectively in the spacollcons simulation than in the nocollcons the two bottom lines timcollcons and spatimcollcons of fig 5 correspond to irrigation dates when the network is coordinated irrigation operations simulated in the timcollcons are distributed differently over time from one plot to another and form a pattern driven by the four a b c and d slots that irregularly repeats until the maturity temperature is reached in the spatimcollcons simulation the pattern is not exactly repeated as irrigation operations are constrained both by daily slots and the gravity network constraints notably the precipitation of the day table 2 however reaching plant maturity is not necessarily penalized and happens even earlier on some plots 2 5 6 10 and 16 comparing the spacollcons and the spatimcollcons simulations the plots are almost always irrigated at the same time when irrigation is not coordinated spacollcons but the absence of network coordination leads to significant delays from a series of irrigation to another and a lack of irrigation in most downstream plots which is prevented by the coordination of the network spatimcollcons 4 2 elements of model validation results of the spacollcons retrospective simulation are consistent with the elements identified during the field survey for the 2017 real irrigation campaign that took place as in the spacollcons simulation in the absence of time slot based coordination of the network branches namely the plots located downstream of the gravity fed network cereal plots 10 14 and 4 were not irrigated at all during the 2017 irrigation campaign the interviewees mentioned 4 irrigation dates by plot for the middle plots i e plots 2 8 9 and 11 and 5 for the upstream plots i e the other plots during the cereal campaign which is in line with the spacollcons simulation results in addition harvest dates for the 2017 cereal campaign on the study area range from july 15th doy 273 to july 30th doy 288 which is very close to the simulation window for cereal maturity dates ranging from july 14th doy 272 to july 26th doy 284 4 3 potential impacts of the collective irrigation constraints on average lai and wsi dynamics this section focuses on the average lai and wsi time series integrated over the irrigation campaign fig 6 in the spacollcons simulation the absence of network coordination fig 6 wsi green line leads to earlier medium water stress on average i e 10 days earlier than when the network is also coordinated in the spatimcollcons simulation orange line the absence of coordination induces an impact on cereal growth maximum of average lai fig 6 lai green line is reached 12 days earlier and about 1 point lower than when the network is coordinated green line irrigation operations are less frequent and less distributed over time in the absence of coordination fig 6 irrigation number the network specific constraints therefore significantly impact average crop water stress when the network is not coordinated while network coordination tends to delay the impact over the irrigation campaign 4 4 spatial distribution of water stress severity at the irrigation network level in this section we measure the water stress severity of a cereal plot as the greatest stress level undergone by this cereal over a simulation in optirrig d the time evolution of wsi values is the consequence of both precipitation and irrigation events from the 10 past days and wsi is the main control over lai values since severe water stress has an exponential impact on biomass growth it makes sense to locate it during the irrigation campaign fig 7 shows the cereal number for each water stress severity level and fig 8 locates maximum stress severity within the 16 cereal plots in the nocollcons simulation cereal maximum stress is low blue plots for all spring cereals and is high orange plots for all winter cereals this difference is due to the optirrig d parameters that differentiate these two cereal types especially the sowing period see appendix a in the timcollcons simulation the coordination of the irrigation network induced fewer differences in cereal stress severity than in the nocollcons simulation three plots move from high to medium stress fig 7 yellow plots daily slot coordination has thus a slight beneficial impact when irrigation is simulated without the specific gravity network constraints in the absence of irrigation noirri winter cereals have dropped one class of maximum stress from high to very high fig 8 the red plots and spring cereals have dropped two classes with high stress fig 8 the orange plots in the spacollcons simulation a spatial dichotomy appears between the upstream part of the network where stress severity is medium to high and the downstream part where all three cereal plots have very high maximum stress figs 7 and 8 this dichotomy is not observed in the timcollcons simulation and is less obvious in the spatimcollcons simulation when irrigation is simulated at the network level with daily slot coordination in addition maximum water stress globally occurs earlier when the network is not coordinated fig 8 spacollcons 5 discussion in this section we first discuss the proof of concept and the added value of the co simulation approach for the study area we also provide a sensitivity analysis to the key parameters then we consider the limitations of using coupled models and co simulation before presenting the key perspectives for future research 5 1 proof of concept and added value of the co simulation approach applied on a typical gravity network in south est of france the co simulation approach allowed to capture the potential impacts of the space and time constraints due to a gravity network on plant lai and wsi dynamics in the study area compared to the first approach developed in richard et al 2020a with the abm alone the co simulation makes it possible to tackle the impact on some crop variables i e lai wsi widely used in agricultural system studies the key point was the derivation of the crop model into a daily function which made possible to run it as a slave model of the abm during the course of the simulation and thus to give daily irrigation orders at the plot level according to the collective sharing of water in the abm the proof of concept also lies in comparing progressive levels of irrigation collective constraints on irrigation dates section 4 1 lai and wsi dynamics section 4 3 and provides access to a tactical assessment of the spatial variability of plant water stress occurring at the network level during a collective irrigation campaign section 4 4 simulation results highlight that network coordination tends to limit the impact of the gravity network constraint by delaying average plant water stress and increasing maximum average plant growth in comparison with simulation at the plot level this is because the time slot based coordination reduces the effect of network flow along its upstream downstream gradient limiting missed irrigation for the most downstream plots and thus reducing severe stresses on them most approaches in the literature are merging crop models into a unique integrated simulation platform e g belcher et al 2004 raes et al 2009 garcı a vila and fereres 2012 as experienced by marohn et al 2013 coupling individual models in a co simulation approach prevented simplifying many dynamics that are exogenous to the coupled model for example the precocity of plant water stress when the network is not coordinated i e spacollcons simulation as a result of irrigation delays caused by the network gravity constraint could not have been represented by either model individually the approach therefore enables the development of individual models simultaneously and independently with people yet familiar with them 5 2 sensitivity analysis to key parameters we performed a one at a time exploration to assess the influence of key parameters i e the maximum flow at the gravity network intake qmax the flood duration for irrigating 1 ha of plot and the time slot period for the gravity network coordination on the percentage of days with low medium high and very high plant water stress during the irrigation campaign we changed parameter values one at a time by letting the other parameters to their nominal values network intake flow is 0 09 m3 s 1 the river flow is considered as non limiting the flood duration is 4 h per hectare and the daily slot period is 10 days we repeated each exploration run for the two spacollcons and spatimcollcons simulations that rely on the coupled models and co simulation results are plotted in the graphic available in supplementary materials the percentage of days with plant water stress during the irrigation campaign is not sensitive to the qmax and flood duration parameter when the gravity network is coordinated spatimcollcons in the absence of network coordination spacollcons higher qmax parameter value reduces plant water stress the percentage of days with low plant water stress increases from 83 to 87 when qmax exceeds 0 3 m3 s 1 the optimum of 87 days is reached when qmax equals 0 35 0 3 m3 s 1 in addition the percentage of days with medium high and very high plant water stress is null when the flood duration parameter is 4 h per hectare that corresponds to the value mentioned by the irrigators for the study area concerning the effect of the modalities of network coordination through daily slots i e the time slot period parameter a period of 8 consecutive days the two first days for slot a the next two days for slot b day 5 for slot c and the last 3 days for slot c seems to be slightly more advantageous than the other modalities for increasing the percentage of days with low plant water stress during the irrigation campaign 5 3 limitations of the co simulation approach as described by letcher et al 2013 the coupling of individual models is only possible under certain conditions first individual model components do not necessarily work on the same space and time scale but disaggregation or aggregation must often be applied to link models in our approach the water network results from aggregation in the abm of the elementary spatial entities the plots in addition the abm has also a double time scale hourly and daily these double space and time scales make it possible to link daily irrigation at the plot level in the crop model with the constrained operations at the network scale specific protocols and associated computer software and api exist to develop and merge models components in integrated development environment a famous example is the functional of such standard mock up interface specification fmi and the fide environment cremona et al 2016 bulatewicz et al 2010 who used similar standards for model linking called openmi raised several benefits of using such standard specifications methods in our case as a proof of concept of a specific coupling we did not develop such generic components but our work is a first step for doing this since the model components that we developed provide almost the same api that the one that bulatewicz et al 2010 developed for the model components they developed namely get values set values and advance simulation in time the level of detail should also be appropriate for a specific purpose otherwise the coupled model could be overly complex with difficulty to identify feedback drivers and over parameterization in our approach the chosen parameters have been kept as simple as possible it distinguishes only two classes of crops summer and winter cereals whereas it could be specific to each cereal variety barley wheat etc in addition the inter related operations between hay mowing garden watering and irrigation has not been considered but could have a significant impact on gravity fed irrigation merot et al 2008 this could be achieved by adding an explicit representation of garden watering and mowing operations in the watasit aspres model or using a crop model representing such operations 5 4 perspectives for future research 5 4 1 complementary elements for model validation and genericity for future research validating further the coupled model to site specific data can be addressed by comparing simulated lai with lai retrieved from optical or remote sensing techniques e g zheng and moskal 2009 deploying the co simulation approach to another case study means that detailed information is required to set up the model parameters potentially limiting the spatial scale the conceptual structure of the abm designed to be as generic as possible allows changing the major structural constraints however the use of different irrigation decision rules may require specific crop indicators to be coupled for instance in systems where irrigation is finely controlled evapotranspiration or awr are often used to pilot irrigation such variables could be easily retrieved from the crop model coupling further specialized models to the system as the sic hydraulic model baume et al 2005 could also be useful for the modeling in the study area where the representation of flow in the network is a key issue 5 4 2 using the co simulation approach to study the feedback loop of plant dynamics on irrigation practices the proposed coupling is bi directional but the coupling from the crop model to the agent based model is probably less impacting than the coupling from the agent based model to the crop model indeed we dictated crop dynamics by forcing irrigation from the agents but only precipitation p and sum of temperature tt come from the crop model to drive the agent s behaviors see fig 1 b reinforcing the coupling from the crop model to the agent based model could allow studying the feedback loop of plant dynamics on irrigation practice adaptation it could be achieved by integrating for example the wsi variable in the irrigation decision rules as a proxy for crop water stress however rather than looking at wsi which is an elaborated variable and which corresponds to a conceptual representation we could also reason in the percentage of the available water reverse awr which is a phenomenological variable and concretely observable sensors in the ground this would avoid the wsi threshold phenomenon when wsi decreases from 1 to x no effect then the effect is exponential when wsi decreases from x to 0 especially if we reason on wsi averaged over time and even more so over long periods this is why we used wsi classes in sections 4 3 and 4 4 rather than comparing values directly 5 4 3 requirements to be addressed for achieving an operational approach the co simulation approach entails the optimization of gravity irrigation networks in terms of retrospective analysis a follow up of this work could be to assess variants of the daily slots coordination to determine optimal coordination modalities for maximizing plant growth or minimizing crop water stress during an irrigation campaign the impact of such irrigation network optimization could be evaluated in terms of criteria such as water productivity crop yield or water saving per season as agricultural yield can be simulated by the crop model with extra parameters e g plot density it would be possible to establish the link between the maximum plant water stress that has occurred during an irrigation campaign and the final yield obtained this could be of interest to make a cost benefit analysis of different irrigation solutions overall to be performed in an operational mode for optimizing an irrigation network in real time conditions the approach should integrate climatic forcing forecasts and be further validated to site specific data 6 conclusions in this study we proposed a co simulation approach to tackle the potential impacts on crop growth and water stress of four progressive levels of spatial and temporal constraints due to a gravity irrigation the approach relies on the coupling of a crop model at the plot level with an abm at the network level as a proof of concept we applied it on a typical gravity network in south east of france four progressive levels of collective irrigation constraints were simulated i e no collective constraints space collective constraints time collective constraints and space and time collective constraints retrospective simulation of the 2017 irrigation campaign is consistent with field surveys and simulation results suggest that plant water stress could be underestimated when simulated at the plot level rather than at the network level the co simulation approach provides access to a tactical assessment of the spatial variability of plant water stress occurring during a collective irrigation campaign spatially the most severe water stress was observed for the plants located furthest downstream of the network temporally the absence of network coordination can lead to earlier plant water stress and lower plant growth during the collective irrigation campaign while time slot based coordination tends to delay the impact for future research reinforcing the coupling from the crop model to the agent based model could allow to study the feedback loop of plant dynamics on irrigation practice

9707,crop models allow simulating irrigated plant dynamics at the plot level however in many places irrigation is managed collectively to share water at the network level to study the impact of the irrigation network constraints on plant dynamics we proposed a co simulation approach based on the coupling of the optirrig crop model at the plot level with the watasit agent based model at the network level as a proof of concept applied on a typical gravity network of the south east of france the approach allowed to consider the effects of the network spatial i e water flow gradient and

representing a landscape with an agent based simulator at the household or farmer level with behaviors that alter the landscape parker et al 2003 verburg et al 2004 berger et al 2006 such approaches enable assessing the environmental economic and social impacts of the combined changes in agricultural activities demography dynamics of land cover and climate thanks to these platforms changes in cropping systems access to water irrigation inputs cost and availability have been assessed in terms of their impact on plant dynamics notably through proxies of plant development and production such as the leaf area index lai monteith 1977 and the water stress index wsi jones 1992 however few scholars have proposed to study the potential impacts due to irrigation network constraints on plant dynamics in particular in gravity fed networks merot et al 2008 have shown the importance of water distribution constraints and irrigation inter related practices to ensure irrigation operations in the crau plain france at the level of the irrigated scheme the spatial constraints to operate irrigation include for example the variation of flow rate and water availability along the upstream downstream gradient in the abduction network according to its withdrawals seepage and hydraulic limitations during the irrigation campaign the possibilities for temporal adjustment of irrigators calendar are thus limited by these spatial constraints and depend on the behavior of other irrigators influencing the network flow rate in particular irrigation coordination is a key factor for sharing water resource that must be distributed through a common network in the right place and time to all along the irrigation campaign in this context our simulation approach aims at capturing the potential impacts of spatial i e network flow gradient and temporal i e network coordination constraints due to a gravity irrigation network on plant lai and wsi dynamics integrated simulation

environmental modeling e g warner et al 2008 bithell and brasington 2009 bulatewicz et al 2010 consist in coupling simulation software together rather than integrating individual components in a single modeling and simulation software the main advantage is that there is no need for recoding components and consequently the users and developer s community of each model component may be asked to help with the coupled model control code provide and test new modules however it involves conceptual and programming developments to ensure compatibility of many characteristics including basic assumptions spatial and time scales first it requires to make sure that models components and associated software have communication features and manage disruption correctly last but not least it requires a clear conceptual approach to organize scheduling between the models and between the simulation software the objective of this paper is to present a co simulation approach based on the coupling of the optirrig crop model at the plot level with the watasit agent based model at the irrigation network level as a proof of concept we applied the approach for capturing the potential impact of a typical gravity fed network in the south east of france on 16 cereal plots we simulated a dry year irrigation campaign under four levels of collective irrigation constraints i e no collective constraint space collective constraint time collective constraint and space and time collective constraints and we compared lai and wsi dynamics of cereal plots the next sections present the overall co simulation approach section 2 the study area and the specific models developed for the proof of concept section 3 and the simulation results for the four levels of collective irrigation constraints section 4 before discussing the added value limitations and perspectives in section 5 2 singular features of the co simulation approach 2 1 overview the purpose of the co simulation is to capture the potential impacts on crop lai and wsi dynamics induced by the gravity irrigation network when operating irrigation during a collective irrigation campaign the approach consists in linking a crop model at the plot level and an abm at the network level based on the daily coupling of their two simulation software described in table 1 it uses the optirrig crop model for simulating lai and wsi as a proxy for crop development and water stress and the watasit abm at the network level for generating irrigation operations under four progressive levels of collective irrigation constraints see section 3 6 optirrig simulates climate soil plant interactions daily in which irrigation dates i on each plot are forced by watasit through a daily coupling fig 1 watasit is itself nourished by the state of maturity of the crops tt provided by the optirrig model if there is a conflict for the sharing of water in the collective gravity network it is managed by the abm and may induce a delay in irrigation for some of the irrigators who would aim to irrigate at the same time 2 2 technical features co simulation involves the communication of several model components that include their solvers meaning that the components can compute of the effects of external events and time advance these components are viewed as slaves processes and are orchestrated by an external program referred to as a master algorithm the co simulation approach has required then the development of specifics application programming interface apis designed as sets of r functions so that the model components that we used can be driven as slave processes by the master algorithm the first api called rcormas 1 1 rcormas is available at https gitlab irstea fr cormas dev r cormas is based on the http protocol and allows communication between the r software in which the master algorithm is implemented and the cormas platform running the abm we will call the second api the roptirrig that enable the master algorithm to communicate with the optirrig d simulator already coded in r both apis allow piloting the simulations by initializing the model getting and setting values from entities and running simulation steps the master algorithm uses those apis to first initialize both models and then to run two phases of simulation that are organized as follows a in the time period from the beginning of the simulation to the beginning of the irrigation campaign no irrigation is present and the crop related lai wsi and tt variables are calculated by the crop model from the climatic forcing only fig 1 a b during the irrigation campaign the coupling between the crop model at the plot level and the abm at the network level is activated the crop model otpirrig d keeps the history of all necessary state variables from one day to another and calculates the state variables according to the daily update of i transmitted by the abm on each plot fig 1 b each day first the crop model simulates lai wsi and tt for each crop we assume that the crop growth process is slow enough that we do not need to calculate it by the hour the precipitation p and the sum of temperature tt are then transmitted to the abm second the abm generates the irrigation operations made by the agents constrained by the collective network that could modify i for the current day third i is collected and transferred to the crop model for each plot and new lai and wsi are computed this sequence is repeated every day until the end of the simulation period in both a and b if tt exceeds the cereal temperature of maturity tm the irrigation campaign is stopped for the cereal plot i is null in the end the original features of the approach are the consideration of a collective level of spatial and temporal constraints to operate irrigation simulated within the gravity network thanks to the abm and their daily consequences for the dynamics of plants lai and wsi at the plot level 3 study area and specific models developed for the proof of concept 3 1 study area and data collection to illustrate the co simulation approach we selected the aspres sur buëch case study fig 2 in which 83 plots can be irrigated by 10 irrigators sharing the gravity fed network the case study is located in the buëch catchment a sub basin of the durance with a surface area of 1490 km2 in france collective irrigation constitutes by far the use that takes the most from the water resource during the low water period from may to october several irrigator unions are equipped either for gravity fed irrigation or for pressurized irrigation or both fig 2 right side the aspres sur buëch gravity network is fairly representative in terms of location in the upstream part of the basin irrigable area with 75 ha whereas the average is 50 ha in 2017 and crop rotation 23 7 cereals in 2017 for practical reasons of crop model parameterization we focus on 16 plots of cereal fig 2 right side made of 12 plots of winter cereal and 4 plots of springs cereal that belong to 6 of the 10 irrigators sharing the gravity network a description of the crop type plot area and irrigator identifiers of the 16 cereal plots is available in supplementary materials irrigation on the other plots served by the network is thus not driven by tt to be stopped at the end of the simulation period to verify that the co simulation results are trustworthy we conducted field surveys on the study area as direct observation of irrigators practices and semi structured interviews about the irrigation campaign that took place between may and september 2017 the interviews were conducted with four irrigators the technician in charge of the water network regulation and the president of the irrigator union as the information collected covered the entire irrigated command area the coordination of the gravity network through a daily slot calendar has been gradually abandoned during the last 15 years as it was temporally very restrictive according to the interviewees we have captured the latest version in place the one known to all the interviewees the branches of the canal were watered according to four time slots a b c and d fig 2 during a time slot water flows only in the branches designated by the calendar e g the green branch during slot a the blue branch during slot b etc the different daily slots follow one after the other in ten days currently irrigators don t coordinate the water network anymore to trigger irrigation the water flows simultaneously and continuously in all the branches of the canal until the end of the irrigation campaign other information collected is further detailed in supplementary materials 3 2 optirrig d crop dynamics at the plot level the optirrig model is a two layer structure in which the inner layer performs hydro agronomic calculations having rewritten and modified the concepts originally present in the pilote model mailhol et al 1997 2011 khaledian et al 2009 feng et al 2014 and now termed pilote r as coded in the r language the outer layer of optirrig allows the use of multiple runs for various numerical purposes e g exploratory scenarios of irrigation and fertilization and or climatic scenarios uncertainty and sensitivity analysis model fitting or irrigation fig 3 gives an overview of the structure and main variables of the model among which are lai and wsi the water stress index wsi the ratio between actual transpiration and maximal transpiration is calculated by the soil module as a moving average of 10 days the leaf area index lai simulation is performed using the following equation 1 lai j lai max tt j ts tf β exp β α 1 tt j ts tf α 1 wsi λ 2 where tt j k 1 k j t k tb and subscript j corresponds to a given lai date t k the average daily temperature of day k tb the base temperature of the crop laimax the maximum value of the lai and ts the temperature of emergence α and β two shape parameters for lai curves wsi the water stress factor and λ a parameter governing plant sensitivity to water stress complementary description of the soil and crop modules of optirrig are available in supplementary materials practically we involved a recent version of the optirrig model cheviron et al 2016 developed at inrae g eau this optirrig d version specifically developed for the co simulation approach d denotes the specific daily horizon of simulation allows the external forcing of irrigation instructions for certain time steps before the calculation of model state variables which are always passed to the abm at the end of the daily time step whether irrigation takes place or not the optirrig d version developed in this study is thus a daily function derived from the optirrig model which is usually run without interruption from the beginning to the end of the simulation period in this classical use irrigation i in l m 2 d 1 in legal units often given as mm is either scheduled according to decision rules resulting in an irrigation calendar or decided from field data and or model predictions typically when the amount of water available in the root zone reservoirs r 1 r 2 goes under a certain threshold see supplementary materials however as the coupling with the abm requires forcing i according to agent actions it is necessary to be able to modify it during the course of the simulation at each daily time step 3 3 watasit aspres collective irrigation at the gravity network level we use the odd protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 to describe the model 3 3 1 overview the watasit abm is designed to simulate the irrigation operations of irrigators sharing a common water network during a collective irrigation campaign it explicitly represents the irrigation options left by the network constraints of the irrigators the constraints taken into account in watasit aspres are presented in table 2 an irrigation possibility is generated on the plots where these constraints make irrigation possible at a given hourly time step 3 3 2 entities the model is based on the distinction between the elements that are involved in irrigation operations called operational entities and the areas over which operational entities can operate called spatial entities which are the farm plot the farm and the irrigation scheme area in the model the operational entities are the irrigator agents and the objects which are actionable by an irrigator agent such as the network branch intake junction and release points the floodgate at each farm plot and the crops the third kind of entity is an artifact that makes explicit some abstract things of the real world such as options to irrigate called affordances resulting from the interactions between an irrigator agent and a hydraulic object typically a floodgate description of all entities is available in supplementary materials 3 3 3 process overview and scheduling the model is based on a double time step each day there is first initialization of the current precipitation conditions and also of the number of days since the crops have not been irrigated then every hour the flow is updated in the network according to network junction state i e opened or closed and ended actions irrigation options are then generated on each farm depending on the irrigator s decision making rules fig 4 an option can be chosen to make a flood action or ask for more water in the canal an activity diagram presenting process scheduling is available in supplementary materials as well as detailed descriptions of the affordance generation sub model action execution sub model and simplified hydraulic sub model of the gravity network 3 3 4 design concepts watasit represents the phase of implementation of actions according to the theory of situated action dreyfus 1972 suchman 1987 in the model the behavior of the irrigator agents is determined by their options to irrigate which are re evaluated at each hourly time step each agent chooses none or one option among its set of options and performs it when one agent has performed an option sets of options of all agents need updating irrigator agents interact indirectly with each other by reducing the amount of water available in the network which affects the options of the other agents sharing the same or a downstream branch design concepts of the model are further detailed in supplementary materials 3 3 5 details the model called watasit aspres has been already deployed to represent the aspres sur buëch case study richard et al 2020a 2020b for which the specific parameterization has been detailed spatial entities were initialized using a pre processing that consists of rasterizing the farm plot shapefiles table 3 onto a 54 44 cell grid with a resolution of 75 m the water network was also initialized using shapefiles table 3 at the initialization farm plots served by the network were listed for each canal branch daily precipitation input comes from the french near surface safran reanalysis vidal et al 2010 3 4 coupled model inputs and parameterization as for watasit optirrig d inputs are the climatic forcing precipitation temperature global radiation and reference evapotranspiration and were obtained from the french safran reanalysis vidal et al 2010 from january 1 2017 to december 31 2017 parameters of both models are specified in appendix a table a 1 concerning optirrig typical parameters of winter soft wheat have been considered for all winter cereals parameters for spring cereals are based on typical spring oat parameters for a given crop literature e g cox and joliff 1986 howell et al 1996 can provide some parameters such as the laimax tf and the tm parameter all these parameters are linked to the base temperature tb parameter which is also given in relevant literature see mailhol et al 1997 sowing doy are average dates reported by irrigators during the 2016 2017 crop campaign for the study area available water reserve awr and maximum profile and rooting depth pmax for the study area are from the paca regional soil reference system described in braud et al 2013 moreover awr in the soil of the plots in the study area was calculated from the paca regional soil reference system using a method presented in manus et al 2009 concerning watasit aspres the key parameter is the target plot flood duration d as irrigation continues until reaching 4 h for a plot area of 1 hectare as the flow rate of the floodgate qflood see table a 1 is fixed it is equivalent to inject a fixed irrigation dose of 43 2 mm per day idose see table a 1 other parameters are specific irrigation operations and gravity fed network characteristics mentioned by the irrigators for the study area in particular the reference flow rate at the network intake qref see table b 1 was determined by the irrigators to avoid overflow and comply with the river abstraction rules during the 2017 low flow period also note that no irrigation restrictions came into effect during the 2017 cereal campaign decision making for irrigation consists in irrigating crops after several days without sufficient precipitation inputs to contain as much as possible a maximum of successive non irrigated days fig 4 as water is not always sufficiently available to irrigate a plot irrigator agents have three kinds of options irrigate a plot with a flood option ask for increasing the water flow in the network with an askmorewater option and do something else during this time step finally a plot for which the irrigator has not had an option to irrigate for a certain period of time is abandoned for irrigation see fig 4 3 5 simulations we simulated the 2017 retrospective irrigation campaign under four levels of collective network constraints table 4 the co simulation approach is used for simulating the space collective constraint due to the sharing of water among irrigators through the gravity fig 1 b the time collective constraint is represented by the time slot based coordination described in section 3 1 and fig 2 right side for the study area either in the abm or directly implemented in the crop model we called no collective constraint nocollcons the simulation in which irrigators optimally irrigate at the plot level without nor the spatial collective constraint due to the gravity network neither the time collective constraint due to the time slot based coordination irrigation is simulated at the plot level by the optirrig d model only fig 1 a this simulation thus shortcuts the watasit aspres model during the whole simulation period including the irrigation campaign nocollcons does not consider any possibility of conflict between irrigators for the sharing of water irrigation decisions are then equivalent to a regular plot based calendar we called space collective constraint spacollcons the simulation in which irrigation is simulated at the network level by the coupled models fig 1 b without the time collective constraint due to time slot based coordination the sharing of water for the irrigation operations is spatially driven by the gravity network constraints table 2 that cannot allow distributing water everywhere at the same time as irrigators do not coordinate the network water flows simultaneously in all the branches of the gravity network during the irrigation campaign space and time collective constraints spatimecollcons is the simulation in which irrigation is simulated at the network level by the coupled models fig 1 b driven both by the gravity network constraints table 2 and by the time slot based coordination it depicts flow coordination using a daily slot i e a b c or d for each network branch constraining temporally irrigation operations as described in section 3 1 and presented in fig 2 right side finally time collective constraint timcollcons is the simulation in which irrigators irrigate at the plot level following the time slot based coordination but without the gravity network constraints irrigation is simulated at the plot level by the optirrig d model only fig 1 a with irrigation dates constrained by similar daily slots as in the spatimcollcons simulation but directly generated in the optirrig d model the total simulation period runs from 15 october or day of year 1 doy 1 when the winter cereals are sown to the end of the cereal season on july 31 doy 289 the co simulation starts at the beginning of the irrigation campaign on may 1st doy 198 when irrigators of aspres sur buëch water their network each year 2017 is taken as a reference for the climatic forcing simulation output i e dates of irrigation lai tt and wsi on each farm plot are collected from the two models by recording attributes of watasit aspres entities i e irrigated state of farm plot entities and optirrig d variables i e cereal lai tt and wsi in the r software during the irrigation campaign in sections 4 3 and 4 4 we also indicate an output from an extreme simulation run called noirri without any irrigation input during the irrigation campaign as a benchmark wsi equals 1 is corresponding to low plant water stress blue yellow orange and red colors denote low wsi 0 75 medium 0 5 wsi 0 75 high 0 25 wsi 0 5 and very high wsi 0 25 water stress respectively 4 simulation results 4 1 irrigation dates for the four levels of gravity collective network constraints this section presents the irrigation dates of the 16 cereal plots simulated for the four levels of collective irrigation network constraints table 4 the two top lines nocollcons and spacollcons of fig 5 correspond to irrigation dates when the network is not coordinated in the nocollcons simulation the plots are irrigated simultaneously on a regular 12 days basis until maturity temperature is reached materialized by the green lines this is not the case in the spacollcons simulation in which we observed significant delays between the series of irrigation and no irrigation for the most downstream plots 10 14 and 4 for instance 28 days separate the series of irrigation between doy 207 and doy 235 taking into account the spatial network constraint thus leads to both the abandonment of the most downstream plots i e plots 4 10 and 14 and significant delays in series of irrigation as a consequence of irrigation delays maturity of the crops is reached later for some of the crops e g 3 and 4 days for plots 15 and 16 respectively in the spacollcons simulation than in the nocollcons the two bottom lines timcollcons and spatimcollcons of fig 5 correspond to irrigation dates when the network is coordinated irrigation operations simulated in the timcollcons are distributed differently over time from one plot to another and form a pattern driven by the four a b c and d slots that irregularly repeats until the maturity temperature is reached in the spatimcollcons simulation the pattern is not exactly repeated as irrigation operations are constrained both by daily slots and the gravity network constraints notably the precipitation of the day table 2 however reaching plant maturity is not necessarily penalized and happens even earlier on some plots 2 5 6 10 and 16 comparing the spacollcons and the spatimcollcons simulations the plots are almost always irrigated at the same time when irrigation is not coordinated spacollcons but the absence of network coordination leads to significant delays from a series of irrigation to another and a lack of irrigation in most downstream plots which is prevented by the coordination of the network spatimcollcons 4 2 elements of model validation results of the spacollcons retrospective simulation are consistent with the elements identified during the field survey for the 2017 real irrigation campaign that took place as in the spacollcons simulation in the absence of time slot based coordination of the network branches namely the plots located downstream of the gravity fed network cereal plots 10 14 and 4 were not irrigated at all during the 2017 irrigation campaign the interviewees mentioned 4 irrigation dates by plot for the middle plots i e plots 2 8 9 and 11 and 5 for the upstream plots i e the other plots during the cereal campaign which is in line with the spacollcons simulation results in addition harvest dates for the 2017 cereal campaign on the study area range from july 15th doy 273 to july 30th doy 288 which is very close to the simulation window for cereal maturity dates ranging from july 14th doy 272 to july 26th doy 284 4 3 potential impacts of the collective irrigation constraints on average lai and wsi dynamics this section focuses on the average lai and wsi time series integrated over the irrigation campaign fig 6 in the spacollcons simulation the absence of network coordination fig 6 wsi green line leads to earlier medium water stress on average i e 10 days earlier than when the network is also coordinated in the spatimcollcons simulation orange line the absence of coordination induces an impact on cereal growth maximum of average lai fig 6 lai green line is reached 12 days earlier and about 1 point lower than when the network is coordinated green line irrigation operations are less frequent and less distributed over time in the absence of coordination fig 6 irrigation number the network specific constraints therefore significantly impact average crop water stress when the network is not coordinated while network coordination tends to delay the impact over the irrigation campaign 4 4 spatial distribution of water stress severity at the irrigation network level in this section we measure the water stress severity of a cereal plot as the greatest stress level undergone by this cereal over a simulation in optirrig d the time evolution of wsi values is the consequence of both precipitation and irrigation events from the 10 past days and wsi is the main control over lai values since severe water stress has an exponential impact on biomass growth it makes sense to locate it during the irrigation campaign fig 7 shows the cereal number for each water stress severity level and fig 8 locates maximum stress severity within the 16 cereal plots in the nocollcons simulation cereal maximum stress is low blue plots for all spring cereals and is high orange plots for all winter cereals this difference is due to the optirrig d parameters that differentiate these two cereal types especially the sowing period see appendix a in the timcollcons simulation the coordination of the irrigation network induced fewer differences in cereal stress severity than in the nocollcons simulation three plots move from high to medium stress fig 7 yellow plots daily slot coordination has thus a slight beneficial impact when irrigation is simulated without the specific gravity network constraints in the absence of irrigation noirri winter cereals have dropped one class of maximum stress from high to very high fig 8 the red plots and spring cereals have dropped two classes with high stress fig 8 the orange plots in the spacollcons simulation a spatial dichotomy appears between the upstream part of the network where stress severity is medium to high and the downstream part where all three cereal plots have very high maximum stress figs 7 and 8 this dichotomy is not observed in the timcollcons simulation and is less obvious in the spatimcollcons simulation when irrigation is simulated at the network level with daily slot coordination in addition maximum water stress globally occurs earlier when the network is not coordinated fig 8 spacollcons 5 discussion in this section we first discuss the proof of concept and the added value of the co simulation approach for the study area we also provide a sensitivity analysis to the key parameters then we consider the limitations of using coupled models and co simulation before presenting the key perspectives for future research 5 1 proof of concept and added value of the co simulation approach applied on a typical gravity network in south est of france the co simulation approach allowed to capture the potential impacts of the space and time constraints due to a gravity network on plant lai and wsi dynamics in the study area compared to the first approach developed in richard et al 2020a with the abm alone the co simulation makes it possible to tackle the impact on some crop variables i e lai wsi widely used in agricultural system studies the key point was the derivation of the crop model into a daily function which made possible to run it as a slave model of the abm during the course of the simulation and thus to give daily irrigation orders at the plot level according to the collective sharing of water in the abm the proof of concept also lies in comparing progressive levels of irrigation collective constraints on irrigation dates section 4 1 lai and wsi dynamics section 4 3 and provides access to a tactical assessment of the spatial variability of plant water stress occurring at the network level during a collective irrigation campaign section 4 4 simulation results highlight that network coordination tends to limit the impact of the gravity network constraint by delaying average plant water stress and increasing maximum average plant growth in comparison with simulation at the plot level this is because the time slot based coordination reduces the effect of network flow along its upstream downstream gradient limiting missed irrigation for the most downstream plots and thus reducing severe stresses on them most approaches in the literature are merging crop models into a unique integrated simulation platform e g belcher et al 2004 raes et al 2009 garcı a vila and fereres 2012 as experienced by marohn et al 2013 coupling individual models in a co simulation approach prevented simplifying many dynamics that are exogenous to the coupled model for example the precocity of plant water stress when the network is not coordinated i e spacollcons simulation as a result of irrigation delays caused by the network gravity constraint could not have been represented by either model individually the approach therefore enables the development of individual models simultaneously and independently with people yet familiar with them 5 2 sensitivity analysis to key parameters we performed a one at a time exploration to assess the influence of key parameters i e the maximum flow at the gravity network intake qmax the flood duration for irrigating 1 ha of plot and the time slot period for the gravity network coordination on the percentage of days with low medium high and very high plant water stress during the irrigation campaign we changed parameter values one at a time by letting the other parameters to their nominal values network intake flow is 0 09 m3 s 1 the river flow is considered as non limiting the flood duration is 4 h per hectare and the daily slot period is 10 days we repeated each exploration run for the two spacollcons and spatimcollcons simulations that rely on the coupled models and co simulation results are plotted in the graphic available in supplementary materials the percentage of days with plant water stress during the irrigation campaign is not sensitive to the qmax and flood duration parameter when the gravity network is coordinated spatimcollcons in the absence of network coordination spacollcons higher qmax parameter value reduces plant water stress the percentage of days with low plant water stress increases from 83 to 87 when qmax exceeds 0 3 m3 s 1 the optimum of 87 days is reached when qmax equals 0 35 0 3 m3 s 1 in addition the percentage of days with medium high and very high plant water stress is null when the flood duration parameter is 4 h per hectare that corresponds to the value mentioned by the irrigators for the study area concerning the effect of the modalities of network coordination through daily slots i e the time slot period parameter a period of 8 consecutive days the two first days for slot a the next two days for slot b day 5 for slot c and the last 3 days for slot c seems to be slightly more advantageous than the other modalities for increasing the percentage of days with low plant water stress during the irrigation campaign 5 3 limitations of the co simulation approach as described by letcher et al 2013 the coupling of individual models is only possible under certain conditions first individual model components do not necessarily work on the same space and time scale but disaggregation or aggregation must often be applied to link models in our approach the water network results from aggregation in the abm of the elementary spatial entities the plots in addition the abm has also a double time scale hourly and daily these double space and time scales make it possible to link daily irrigation at the plot level in the crop model with the constrained operations at the network scale specific protocols and associated computer software and api exist to develop and merge models components in integrated development environment a famous example is the functional of such standard mock up interface specification fmi and the fide environment cremona et al 2016 bulatewicz et al 2010 who used similar standards for model linking called openmi raised several benefits of using such standard specifications methods in our case as a proof of concept of a specific coupling we did not develop such generic components but our work is a first step for doing this since the model components that we developed provide almost the same api that the one that bulatewicz et al 2010 developed for the model components they developed namely get values set values and advance simulation in time the level of detail should also be appropriate for a specific purpose otherwise the coupled model could be overly complex with difficulty to identify feedback drivers and over parameterization in our approach the chosen parameters have been kept as simple as possible it distinguishes only two classes of crops summer and winter cereals whereas it could be specific to each cereal variety barley wheat etc in addition the inter related operations between hay mowing garden watering and irrigation has not been considered but could have a significant impact on gravity fed irrigation merot et al 2008 this could be achieved by adding an explicit representation of garden watering and mowing operations in the watasit aspres model or using a crop model representing such operations 5 4 perspectives for future research 5 4 1 complementary elements for model validation and genericity for future research validating further the coupled model to site specific data can be addressed by comparing simulated lai with lai retrieved from optical or remote sensing techniques e g zheng and moskal 2009 deploying the co simulation approach to another case study means that detailed information is required to set up the model parameters potentially limiting the spatial scale the conceptual structure of the abm designed to be as generic as possible allows changing the major structural constraints however the use of different irrigation decision rules may require specific crop indicators to be coupled for instance in systems where irrigation is finely controlled evapotranspiration or awr are often used to pilot irrigation such variables could be easily retrieved from the crop model coupling further specialized models to the system as the sic hydraulic model baume et al 2005 could also be useful for the modeling in the study area where the representation of flow in the network is a key issue 5 4 2 using the co simulation approach to study the feedback loop of plant dynamics on irrigation practices the proposed coupling is bi directional but the coupling from the crop model to the agent based model is probably less impacting than the coupling from the agent based model to the crop model indeed we dictated crop dynamics by forcing irrigation from the agents but only precipitation p and sum of temperature tt come from the crop model to drive the agent s behaviors see fig 1 b reinforcing the coupling from the crop model to the agent based model could allow studying the feedback loop of plant dynamics on irrigation practice adaptation it could be achieved by integrating for example the wsi variable in the irrigation decision rules as a proxy for crop water stress however rather than looking at wsi which is an elaborated variable and which corresponds to a conceptual representation we could also reason in the percentage of the available water reverse awr which is a phenomenological variable and concretely observable sensors in the ground this would avoid the wsi threshold phenomenon when wsi decreases from 1 to x no effect then the effect is exponential when wsi decreases from x to 0 especially if we reason on wsi averaged over time and even more so over long periods this is why we used wsi classes in sections 4 3 and 4 4 rather than comparing values directly 5 4 3 requirements to be addressed for achieving an operational approach the co simulation approach entails the optimization of gravity irrigation networks in terms of retrospective analysis a follow up of this work could be to assess variants of the daily slots coordination to determine optimal coordination modalities for maximizing plant growth or minimizing crop water stress during an irrigation campaign the impact of such irrigation network optimization could be evaluated in terms of criteria such as water productivity crop yield or water saving per season as agricultural yield can be simulated by the crop model with extra parameters e g plot density it would be possible to establish the link between the maximum plant water stress that has occurred during an irrigation campaign and the final yield obtained this could be of interest to make a cost benefit analysis of different irrigation solutions overall to be performed in an operational mode for optimizing an irrigation network in real time conditions the approach should integrate climatic forcing forecasts and be further validated to site specific data 6 conclusions in this study we proposed a co simulation approach to tackle the potential impacts on crop growth and water stress of four progressive levels of spatial and temporal constraints due to a gravity irrigation the approach relies on the coupling of a crop model at the plot level with an abm at the network level as a proof of concept we applied it on a typical gravity network in south east of france four progressive levels of collective irrigation constraints were simulated i e no collective constraints space collective constraints time collective constraints and space and time collective constraints retrospective simulation of the 2017 irrigation campaign is consistent with field surveys and simulation results suggest that plant water stress could be underestimated when simulated at the plot level rather than at the network level the co simulation approach provides access to a tactical assessment of the spatial variability of plant water stress occurring during a collective irrigation campaign spatially the most severe water stress was observed for the plants located furthest downstream of the network temporally the absence of network coordination can lead to earlier plant water stress and lower plant growth during the collective irrigation campaign while time slot based coordination tends to delay the impact for future research reinforcing the coupling from the crop model to the agent based model could allow to study the feedback loop of plant dynamics on irrigation practice

9708,irrigation is a prerequisite for the sustainable development of agricultural production with the existing of water resources shortage and climate change it is of great importance to explore the variation of crop irrigation water requirement iwr in the yellow river basin yrb based on 1974 2017 meteorological dataset from 96 stations we analyzed the spatio temporal variation characteristics of meteorological factors and crop iwr during the growing seasons of four main crops including spring wheat winter wheat spring maize and summer maize respectively furthermore we explored the dominant meteorological factors of the crop iwr variation the results indicated that daily mean temperature t had a significant upward trend while the effective precipitation p eff did not change significantly during the growing season of each crop in the past 44 years crop iwr had increasing trend with 9 9 mm decade 4 3 mm decade 6 4 mm decade for spring wheat winter wheat spring maize respectively while a slight decreasing trend with 1 7 mm decade for summer maize it is noted that extremely significant increase in crop iwr were mostly located in ningxia southern gansu and eastern qinghai moreover p eff net radiation r n and relative humidity rh were identified as the dominant meteorological factors influencing variations of iwr for all crops in the context of significant increase in t and uncertain future precipitation patterns iwr for spring wheat winter wheat and spring maize in the yrb has shown an upward trend which is not favorable to the sustainable development of water resources it is urgent to take effective water saving measures to hedge the adverse impact of climate change on agriculture these findings can provide scientific basis for rational allocation of agricultural water resources in the yrb keywords climate change crop growing season irrigation water requirement dominant meteorological factors agricultural water management 1 introduction irrigated areas as an important basis of food production produce 40 of the world s grain siebert et al 2005 agricultural irrigation water accounts for 70 of the total water consumption of the world siebert et al 2010 therefore water resource is the foremost prerequisite for global food security according to the sixth assessment report 2021 released by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc https www ipcc ch report sixth assessment report cycle temperature during the first two decades of the 21st century 2001 2020 was 0 99 c higher than the value during the period of 1850 1900 and the global warming trend will continue the warming climate environment can definitely change the hydrological cycle processes as well as the precipitation pattern soil moisture distribution and river runoff piao et al 2010 zhang et al 2014 meanwhile the changing environment will affect the physiological characteristics of crops thus changing the crop water requirement in order to ensure that crops grow under optimal moisture conditions their irrigation water requirement iwr will inevitably change chen et al 2019 farooq and gheewala 2020 rajagopalan et al 2018 iwr refers to the amount of irrigation water required to achieve the optimal growth and yield of crops döll and siebert 2002 it is an important indicator of irrigation water resources management current studies on iwr mainly focus on 1 the spatial and temporal variation patterns of historical iwr jia et al 2019 shen et al 2013 wriedt et al 2009 2 the impact of climate change on crop iwr rodríguez díaz et al 2007 zhou et al 2017 and 3 the interrelationships among regional iwr available water resources and agricultural production akoko et al 2020 masia et al 2018 de silva et al 2007 studies at the regional scale are often more critical for decision making since agricultural production and water resources significantly affected by climate change are usually the case in many agricultural regions relevant studies have been carried out in some regions of the world nie et al 2021 quantified the sensitivity of iwr to temperature and precipitation in the united states by using multi source dataset rajagopalan et al 2018 developed a coupled crop hydrology model to figure out the direct impacts of climate change on crop iwr in the columbia river basin acharjee et al 2017 combined the global circulation models and cropwat to estimate the changes of iwr for rice in north west bangladesh under future climate scenarios the yellow river is the fifth largest river in the world and the second longest river in china the spatio temporal distribution of precipitation in the basin is seriously uneven with more precipitation in the south and less in the north besides rainfall basically happens in summer june to september within a year accounting for about 70 of its annual value irrigation is an important way to maintain optimal crop growth and production in the yellow river basin yrb since the water requirement of crop growth cannot be met by rainfall in time and quantity the irrigation water accounts for more than 80 of total water use in the yrb xu et al 2010 zhang et al 2021a furthermore problems exist including low water use efficiency shortage of water resources serious soil erosion and soil salinization which were caused by some unreasonable local irrigation methods zhang et al 2018 2021b zhao et al 2013 at the same time with the local quality of life improvement the contradiction of competing water use in the yrb is exacerbated by the increasing domestic and ecological water requirement in the global water risk map released by the world resources institute most of areas within the yrb are marked as extremely high risk level water resources management of the yrb faces huge challenges and the irrigation water management is the most important part to keep sustainable development of the yrb previously nakayama 2011 developed a hydrological model to estimate evapotranspiration and iwr for major crops in the yrb and the effects of irrigation on crop yields and the basin water cycle were analyzed mu et al 2013 integrated the water assessment model and multiple global circulation models to analyze iwr and water pressure in the yrb and the results indicated iwr would increase under future scenario conditions liu et al 2019 used the pepic model to calculate iwr of four crops in the yrb and this study mainly focused on the interrelationship among irrigation yield and energy in all these relevant studies iwr was usually considered as an intermediate variable and the contribution of its amount to the study system was not concerned however when it comes to agricultural water management and allocation at the regional scale it is necessary to know the water consumption of each crop therefore more detailed research should be undertaken to quantitatively evaluate specific crop iwr in the yrb additionally most of the studies of local climate change focused on an annual or seasonal scale ma et al 2018 xu et al 2018 however it is the meteorological conditions during the crop growing season not the non growing season that really affect crop growth hence in this study we will focus on investigating the climate change during the crop growing seasons and figuring out its impact on crop iwr for individual crop the objectives of this paper were to 1 clarify the spatio temporal variation of iwr for wheat and maize from 1974 to 2007 which are the main crops in the yrb 2 analyze the climate change characteristics during each crop growing season in a long term time series 3 investigate the relationship between crop iwr and meteorological factors and identify the dominant meteorological factors of crop iwr variation this study aims to provide insight into the impact of climate change on crop iwr in the yrb over the past few decades it will also provide scientific basis to different stakeholders for decision making in agricultural production and water resources management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the geographical location of the yrb are shown in fig 1 there are 13 million hectares of arable land in the yrb with a rich variety of crops wheat and maize as the top two crops planted in the basin were included in this study for crop iwr evaluation the planting areas of wheat and maize are 3 73 and 4 86 million hectares respectively accounting for about 29 and 37 of the total arable land area since the heterogeneity of climate and terrain the sowing time of wheat and maize are different in the yrb they can be divided into four planting growing zone including winter wheat spring wheat spring maize and summer maize as shown in fig 2 spring wheat is planted in qinghai sichuan ningxia gansu and inner mongolia in the upper and middle reaches of the yrb while winter wheat is planted in shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong in the midstream and downstream areas spring maize is planted in gansu ningxia inner mongolia northern shaanxi and northern shanxi summer maize is planted in central shaanxi southern shaanxi northern shanxi henan and shandong 2 2 data collection daily meteorological data during 1974 2017 were collected from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn including daily air pressure maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration according to the boundary of the yrb 96 meteorological stations were selected fig 1 for the calculation and analysis planting area phenological phase and crop parameters of wheat and maize were collected from relevant literatures over the yrb zhang 2019 hou et al 2016 su et al 2020 sun et al 2002 zhao et al 2010a zuo et al 2009 zhao 2010b zhang et al 2020 detailed information is shown in table 1 2 3 irrigation water requirement the penman monteith formula eq 1 recommended by the fao is the most accurate and most widely used method for quantitative calculation of et 0 which has been verified and applied in many studies dingre and gorantiwar 2020 pereira et al 2015 ventura et al 1999 it is an energy balance equation and only affected by local geographical and climatic conditions in this study the penman monteith formula was used to calculate the et 0 of each meteorological station in the yrb 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n mj m2 day is the crop surface net radiation g is the soil heat flux mj m2 day γ kpa c is the psychrometric constant t c is mean temperature u 2 m s is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height e s kpa is the saturation vapor pressure e a kpa is the actual vapor pressure δ kpa c is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve crop water requirements et c can be estimated based on crop coefficient k c and et 0 as follows allen et al 1998 2 et c k c et 0 where k c table 1 is the crop coefficient that converts potential crop evapotranspiration into actual evapotranspiration et c is crop water requirements precipitation is an important source of crop water requirements however not all of the precipitation can be used by crops due to canopy interception evaporation and runoff therefore we use the part of precipitation that are available for crop use effective precipitation for calculation generally iwr can be considered as the difference between daily et c and effective precipitation p eff the calculation of iwr during the crop growing period was expressed as 3 iwr n 1 n et c p eff where n day is the length of the crop growing period p eff mm is the effective precipitation it can be estimated using the empirical formula given by the soil conservation bureau of the united states department of agriculture as follows 4 p eff p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 p 8 34 4 17 0 1 p p 8 34 where p mm day is the daily precipitation 2 4 trend analysis and correlation analysis 2 4 1 mann kendall trend test mann kendall mk trend test is a non parametric trend statistical test method which is widely used to test the time series of hydrological and meteorological elements the test statistic s is calculated as 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where n is the number of data points x i and x j are the data values in time series i and j j i respectively and sgn x j x i is the sign function as 5 sgn x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 0 if x j x i 0 1 if x j x i 0 if the

statistic z s is computed as follow 7 z s s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 in eq 7 positive z s value indicates an increasing trend while negative z s value represents a decreasing trend significance trend is performed at a specific α significance level when z s z 1 α 2 there is a significant trend in the time series in this study the significance level α 0 1 z1 α 2 1 65 and α 0 05 z1 α 2 1 96 were used to test significant trend of t p eff et 0 and iwr in the past 44 years there was a significant trend if passing the test of α 0 1 and an extremely significant trend passes the test of α 0 05 2 4 2 cumulative anomaly curve the variation of cumulative anomaly curve can represent the trend of a certain element in the long term series and it could roughly estimate the abrupt change points the cumulative anomaly can be calculated according to the following formula 8 x ˆ i 1 t x i x where x is multi year average x i is the date value at time i and t is the number of years 2 4 3 pearson correlation analysis pearson correlation coefficient was used to characterize the degree of correlation between meteorological factors and iwr the calculation formula is 9 r x y i 1 n x i x y

respectively r x y is the pearson correlation coefficient according to the single correlation coefficient the most influential factor of the crop iwr can be determined 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal variation characteristics of t peff and et0 3 1 1 spatial distribution as shown in fig 3 the spatial difference of mean air temperature t influenced by the topography and crop growing season was the largest in the spring wheat planting areas with the lowest value being 2 8 c and the highest value being 18 4 c the relatively low values were observed in qinghai located at the upper reaches of the yellow river and the high values prevailingly appeared in northern ningxia and inner mongolia fig 3a the winter wheat planting areas t ranged from 1 2 10 1 c with the high value appeared in southern shaanxi and the low value in northern shanxi fig 3b in the spring maize planting areas t varied from 12 4 to 21 3 c with the low values exhibited in southwest gansu and the high values in western inner mongolia and ningxia fig 3c as for summer maize planting areas t showed a relatively even distribution ranging from 16 2 to 25 8 c fig 3d overall t had a significant increasing trend in almost all stations for the period of 1974 2017 this result is consistent with the research of huang et al 2020 that is the yrb has a significant warming trend in all four seasons in recent decades and the warming phenomenon is most significant in spring in fig 4 p eff varied a lot in the planting area of spring wheat with the lowest value as only 43 5 mm and the highest value as 245 6 mm fig 4a the lowest value of p eff in the winter wheat planting areas was 65 mm and the highest value was 168 9 mm fig 4b p eff in the planting area of spring maize was in a range of 58 5 208 1 mm fig 4c as for the summer maize planting areas the lowest and the highest values of p eff were 105 8 mm and 189 3 mm respectively fig 4d the spatial distribution of p eff in each crop planting area was almost the opposite of that of t that is areas with high t tend to have less p eff and vice versa in the past 44 years there was no significant trend in most stations while a few stations located in spring wheat spring maize and summer maize planting areas showed a significant decreasing trend in contrast a significant upward trend was found in north of winter wheat planting area the results are similar to the study detected by ma et al 2018 and zhang et al 2014 that spring summer and autumn precipitation declined while winter precipitation increased in the past few decades over the yrb in fig 5 et 0 in the planting area of spring wheat was between 460 6 mm and 809 3 mm most of the stations showed a significant upward trend while a few stations located in northern inner mongolia and xining station in qinghai showed an extremely significant downtrend fig 5a et 0 in the planting area of winter wheat was between 555 3 mm and 817 2 mm et 0 from stations with a significant increasing trend were mainly distributed in shaanxi while et 0 from a few stations in shanxi decreased significantly fig 5b et 0 in the planting area of spring maize was between 533 6 and 827 2 mm et 0 from most stations in gansu and ningxia showed an extremely significant increasing trend fig 5c et 0 in the planting area of summer maize was between 360 6 mm and 536 6 mm et 0 from most of the stations in shanxi and shandong presented a significant decreasing trend while et 0 from the other stations had no significant trend fig 5d 3 1 2 inner annual variation as shown in fig 6a p eff in the planting area of spring wheat had a slightly downward trend over the years with less p eff in 1982 2000 and 2001 t had a clearly upward trend with a linear rate of 0 47 c decade the linearly increasing rate of et 0 was 0 8 mm year p eff in the planting area of winter wheat did not change significantly during the past 44 years and it had the lowest value in 1981 and 1995 while t and et 0 increased at a rate of 0 4 c decade and 0 45 mm year respectively fig 6b p eff in the planting area of spring maize showed a gently downward trend and the minimum value appeared in 1997 with less than 100 mm t presented an obviously upward trend with a linear trend of 0 39 c decade the linearly increasing rate of et 0 was 0 63 mm year fig 6c during the growing season of summer maize p eff had a gently downward trend with a linearly decreasing rate of 0 2 mm year a low outlier appeared in 1997 conversely high outliers occur in t and et 0 in the same year the increase rate of t was 0 24 c decade different from the other crops et 0 of summer maize showed a downward trend with a decreasing rate of 0 41 mm year fig 6d 3 2 spatial variation of crop iwr the spatial distribution of spring wheat iwr was demonstrated in fig 7a within a range of 379 4 951 1 mm high values of iwr were mainly located in inner mongolia and northern ningxia the upper reaches of the yellow river had lower iwr most of the stations in ningxia gansu and eastern qinghai showed extremely significant increasing trends iwr of winter wheat ranged from 491 1 to 756 mm the areas with low iwr values appeared in southern shaanxi while the areas with high value were located in northern shaanxi and central shandong the variation trend of iwr for each station was similar to that of et 0 fig 7b iwr of spring maize was in a range of 325 6 620 3 mm low values were observed in the southern yrb and high values appeared in hetao irrigation area of inner mongolia and ningxia in addition no significant trend of iwr was found in the eastern region fig 7c iwr of summer maize showed a relatively homogenous spatial distribution with ranging from 234 2 to 387 mm there were few stations showed a significant downward trend and the other stations had no significant trend fig 7d obviously crop water requirement of each crop is far from being met by precipitation the areas with high crop iwr are mostly due to high t less p eff and high et 0 vice versa 3 3 inner annual variation of crop iwr in fig 8a and table 2 iwr of spring wheat was 684 06 mm with an increasing rate of 0 99 mm year combined with the cumulative anomaly curve and the 5 year moving average curve there were two abrupt change points in the past 44 years which happened in 1982 and 1999 iwr of winter wheat was 599 24 mm and the increasing rate from 1974 to 2017 was 0 43 mm year abrupt changes were observed in 1982 and 2003 there was an obviously upward trend 6 65 mm year higher than the overall rise before 1982 iwr of spring maize showed an increasing trend in the past 44 years with a rate of 0 64 mm year and a mean value of 486 34 mm there was only an abrupt change point in 1996 iwr of summer maize had a slightly downward trend with a linearly decreasing rate of 0 17 mm year and a mean value of 316 94 mm an abrupt change point was detected in 2002 it is worth noting that the trend of iwr during some period for both spring and summer maize was opposite to the trend during the past 44 years which may attribute from an extremely abnormal value in 1997 according to the description above 3 1 2 p eff of spring and summer maize in 1997 growing seasons was the lowest and t was relatively high which may lead to the excessive iwr in that year and affecting the 44 year trend 3 4 the dominant factors of iwr variation p eff and et 0 during the crop growing season are the most direct factors affecting iwr while et 0 depends on meteorological factors including t relative humidity rh wind speed w and net radiation r n in order to explore how crop iwr responds to various meteorological factors correlation coefficients of t rh w r n p eff and iwr were calculated respectively to determine the dominant meteorological factors as shown in fig 9a the main meteorological factors affecting spring wheat iwr were p eff and rh specifically qinghai and part of inner mongolia were mainly affected by p eff and southern ningxia and southeastern gansu were mainly affected by rh as the main planting area of winter wheat northern shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong were mainly affected by p eff and rh while central shaanxi were mainly affected by r n fig 9b as for spring maize p eff and rh were the dominant factors in gansu southern ningxia inner mongolia shanxi and northern shaanxi fig 9c different from the other crops the main factors affecting iwr of summer maize were r n and p eff in detail p eff was the main driven factor affecting iwr in southern shanxi and northern henan and r n was the key factor of varying iwr in most other areas fig 9d the dominant meteorological factors of the iwr variation for each crop are spatially dependent overall p eff and rh were the most influential factors to the iwr of spring wheat winter wheat and spring maize in most areas in fact humidity is closely related to precipitation and both of them have negative correlation to crop iwr thus precipitation is mainly responsible for the variation in crop iwr 4 discussion there have been plenty of studies on et 0 in the yrb overall our results showed that et 0 of spring wheat winter wheat and spring maize planting areas had an increasing trend and the largest growth rate appeared in spring wheat planting areas this seemed to be inconsistent with the existing opinions that pan evaporation paradox exists in the yrb liu et al 2012 xu et al 2018 however wang et al 2012 made a detailed analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of et 0 in the yrb indicating that the middle and lower reaches of the basin mainly showed a significant decreasing trend while the upper and central regions showed a significant increasing trend moreover according to zhang et al 2011 et 0 of the yrb had an upward trend in spring autumn and winter while the increase of et 0 in summer was mainly in the upper and middle reaches of the yrb which supported the results of this study over the past 44 years there were one or two abrupt change points in the long term time series iwr for each crop which mainly happened in the early 1980 s late 1990 s and early 2000 s the time of abrupt change point was closely related to the local climate change and human activities in the 1980 s and 1990 s under the influences of intensified human activities and climate change the flow of the yellow river was cut off zhang et al 2009 moreover the basin hydrologic cycle was affected seriously li et al 2017 resulting in the less precipitation and the warmer temperature that could be the reason of multiple variation periods for crop iwr based on our findings iwr of spring wheat winter wheat and spring maize will continue to increase under current climate change trends apparently it will intensify the water stress across the basin moreover many researchers have reported that the water resources of the yrb and runoff of the yellow river will reduce under future change scenarios wang et al 2017 mu et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 in order to cope with negative effects of climate change strategies can be formulated in terms of planting structure adjustment water efficiency improvement and water saving irrigation technologies promotion ju et al 2013 since the late 1970 s the wheat sown area in china has gradually decreased year by year while the maize sown area has increased significantly national bureau of statistics of china 2020 because the economic benefits of wheat are not as good as maize the sown area of wheat and maize in provinces along the yrb also has the same trend from the perspective of crop water consumption iwr of maize is obviously less than that of wheat the trends above are beneficial to reduce regional agricultural water demand in areas with high iwr of wheat such as hetao irrigation area of inner mongolia and northern ningxia reducing the planting area of spring wheat and increasing the planting area of maize can alleviate the local agricultural water crisis appropriately in the yrb precipitation has obvious seasonal characteristics the growing seasons of spring wheat spring maize and summer maize include the rainy season while the precipitation is less during the growing season of winter wheat therefore it is not appropriate to use change of annual precipitation when discussing the impact of precipitation on crop iwr this study focuses on the change of precipitation during crop growing season which can better analyze the relationship between precipitation and crop iwr the majority of scholars agreed that precipitation in the yrb will increase in the future mu et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 which seems to alleviate water pressure for irrigation however the specific seasonal variation and spatial pattern of precipitation are still not clear it is difficult to determine whether there will be a positive effect on crop iwr due to the seasonal behavior of crop growth the precipitation during the crop growing season directly affects the iwr of crop adjusting planting dates appropriately according to precipitation patterns can improve rainwater utilization and reduce water pressure for irrigation luo et al 2022 cao et al 2020 the growing season of summer maize in the yrb is in the rainy season of the year the planting date of summer maize can be optimized based on the precipitation forecast to improve the adaptability between crop critical periods of water demand and precipitation this is a low cost water saving measure for crops with less precipitation during the growing season the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system can be used which not only improves the utilization rate of rainwater but also benefits the growth of crops chen et al 2022 currently full irrigation is used to ensure crop yield in the yrb and flood irrigation is the main irrigation method iwr calculated in this study is the theoretical irrigation water demand when these crops reach the optimal growth condition iwr of the whole crop growing season was obtained by accumulative daily iwr however in actual applications wheat is usually irrigated 2 4 times and maize is irrigated 1 3 times during the crop growing season the amount of irrigation at each time is sufficient to ensure that the crops will not be subjected to serious water deficit before the next irrigation therefore iwr is not suitable for strict verification and comparison with the consumption of irrigation water in actual applications recently water saving irrigation has been greatly promoted and replacing flood irrigation with drip irrigation is an effective way to save more water drip irrigation allows for more precise irrigation the theoretical iwr calculated in this study is more suitable as a reference for full irrigation of crops under drip irrigation in general the effects of climate warming on crop iwr is complex it will change the physiological characteristics of the crop such as changes in phenological period liu et al 2020 zhao and yang 2018 and will also affect the suitable planting area of the crop franke et al 2022 liu et al 2015 in the future research a more comprehensive consideration of the effects of various factors on iwr will improve the accuracy and applicability of the research results the contradiction between agricultural and non agricultural water is increasingly prominent in the yrb it is necessary to understand thoroughly the impact of climate change on crop iwr for rational allocation of agricultural water resources 5 conclusions the amount of iwr is related to the development distribution and management of regional water resources quantifying the variation of meteorological factors and crop iwr is of great significance to cope with ongoing climate change and regional water shortage in this study spatial distribution and temporal variation of t p eff et 0 and iwr were characterized during the crop growing seasons for spring wheat winter wheat spring maize and summer maize besides the dominant meteorological factors of crop iwr variation were investigated the results showed that t of each crop increased significantly while the trends of p eff were not obvious in the past 44 years except for summer maize et 0 and iwr of other crops showed increasing trends the changing rates of iwr for spring wheat winter wheat spring maize and summer maize were 9 9 4 3 6 4 and 1 7 mm decade respectively notably both meteorological factors and crop iwr have largely spatial heterogeneity in general p eff rh and r n were the dominant factors of crop iwr variation according to the trends of crop iwr and future climate conditions the water resources and food security of the basin will be threatened if appropriate measures are not taken our research can provide scientific basis for the allocation of agricultural water resources under climate change in the yrb moreover it can provide water saving recommendations for areas with large amount of irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

requirement of crop growth cannot be met by rainfall in time and quantity the irrigation water accounts for more than 80 of total water use in the yrb xu et al 2010 zhang et al 2021a furthermore problems exist including low water use efficiency shortage of water resources serious soil erosion and soil salinization which were caused by some unreasonable local irrigation methods zhang et al 2018 2021b zhao et al 2013 at the same time with the local quality of life improvement the contradiction of competing water use in the yrb is exacerbated by the increasing domestic and ecological water requirement in the global water risk map released by the world resources institute most of areas within the yrb are marked as extremely high risk level water resources management of the yrb faces huge challenges and the irrigation water management is the most important part to keep sustainable development of the yrb previously nakayama 2011 developed a hydrological model to estimate evapotranspiration and iwr for major crops in the yrb and the effects of irrigation on crop yields and the basin water cycle were analyzed mu et al 2013 integrated the water assessment model and multiple global circulation models to analyze iwr and water pressure in the yrb and the results indicated iwr would increase under future scenario conditions liu et al 2019 used the pepic model to calculate iwr of four crops in the yrb and this study mainly focused on the interrelationship among irrigation yield and energy in all these relevant studies iwr was usually considered as an intermediate variable and the contribution of its amount to the study system was not concerned however when it comes to agricultural water management and allocation at the regional scale it is necessary to know the water consumption of each crop therefore more detailed research should be undertaken to quantitatively evaluate specific crop iwr in the yrb additionally most of the studies of local climate change focused on an annual or seasonal scale ma et al 2018 xu et al 2018 however it is the meteorological conditions during the crop growing season not the non growing season that really affect crop growth hence in this study we will focus on investigating the climate change during the crop growing seasons and figuring out its impact on crop iwr for individual crop the objectives of this paper were to 1 clarify the spatio temporal variation of iwr for wheat and maize from 1974 to 2007 which are the main crops in the yrb 2 analyze the climate change characteristics during each crop growing season in a long term time series 3 investigate the relationship between crop iwr and meteorological factors and identify the dominant meteorological factors of crop iwr variation this study aims to provide insight into the impact of climate change on crop iwr in the yrb over the past few decades it will also provide scientific basis to different stakeholders for decision making in agricultural production and water resources management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the geographical location of the yrb are shown in fig 1 there are 13 million hectares of arable land in the yrb with a rich variety of crops wheat and maize as the top two crops planted in the basin were included in this study for crop iwr evaluation the planting areas of wheat and maize are 3 73 and 4 86 million hectares respectively accounting for about 29 and 37 of the total arable land area since the heterogeneity of climate and terrain the sowing time of wheat and maize are different in the yrb they can be divided into four planting growing zone including winter wheat spring wheat spring maize and summer maize as shown in fig 2 spring wheat is planted in qinghai sichuan ningxia gansu and inner mongolia in the upper and middle reaches of the yrb while winter wheat is planted in shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong in the midstream and downstream areas spring maize is planted in gansu ningxia inner mongolia northern shaanxi and northern shanxi summer maize is planted in central shaanxi southern shaanxi northern shanxi henan and shandong 2 2 data collection daily meteorological data during 1974 2017 were collected from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn including daily air pressure maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration according to the boundary of the yrb 96 meteorological stations were selected fig 1 for the calculation and analysis planting area phenological phase and crop parameters of wheat and maize were collected from relevant literatures over the yrb zhang 2019 hou et al 2016 su et al 2020 sun et al 2002 zhao et al 2010a zuo et al 2009 zhao 2010b zhang et al 2020 detailed information is shown in table 1 2 3 irrigation water requirement the penman monteith formula eq 1 recommended by the fao is the most accurate and most widely used method for quantitative calculation of et 0 which has been verified and applied in many studies dingre and gorantiwar 2020 pereira et al 2015 ventura et al 1999 it is an energy balance equation and only affected by local geographical and climatic conditions in this study the penman monteith formula was used to calculate the et 0 of each meteorological station in the yrb 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n mj m2 day is the crop surface net radiation g is the soil heat flux mj m2 day γ kpa c is the psychrometric constant t c is mean temperature u 2 m s is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height e s kpa is the saturation vapor pressure e a kpa is the actual vapor pressure δ kpa c is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve crop water requirements et c can be estimated based on crop coefficient k c and et 0 as follows allen et al 1998 2 et c k c et 0 where k c table 1 is the crop coefficient that converts potential crop evapotranspiration into actual evapotranspiration et c is crop water requirements precipitation is an important source of crop water requirements however not all of the precipitation can be used by crops due to canopy interception evaporation and runoff therefore we use the part of precipitation that are available for crop use effective precipitation for calculation generally iwr can be considered as the difference between daily et c and effective precipitation p eff the calculation of iwr during the crop growing period was expressed as 3 iwr n 1 n et c p eff where n day is the length of the crop growing period p eff mm is the effective precipitation it can be estimated using the empirical formula given by the soil conservation bureau of the united states department of agriculture as follows 4 p eff p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 p 8 34 4 17 0 1 p p 8 34 where p mm day is the daily precipitation 2 4 trend analysis and correlation analysis 2 4 1 mann kendall trend test mann kendall mk trend test is a non parametric trend statistical test method which is widely used to test the time series of hydrological and meteorological elements the test statistic s is calculated as 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where n is the number of data points x i and x j are the data values in time series i and j j i respectively and sgn x j x i is the sign function as 5 sgn x j x i 1 if x j x i 0 0 if x j x i 0 1 if x j x i 0 if the

statistic z s is computed as follow 7 z s s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 in eq 7 positive z s value indicates an increasing trend while negative z s value represents a decreasing trend significance trend is performed at a specific α significance level when z s z 1 α 2 there is a significant trend in the time series in this study the significance level α 0 1 z1 α 2 1 65 and α 0 05 z1 α 2 1 96 were used to test significant trend of t p eff et 0 and iwr in the past 44 years there was a significant trend if passing the test of α 0 1 and an extremely significant trend passes the test of α 0 05 2 4 2 cumulative anomaly curve the variation of cumulative anomaly curve can represent the trend of a certain element in the long term series and it could roughly estimate the abrupt change points the cumulative anomaly can be calculated according to the following formula 8 x ˆ i 1 t x i x where x is multi year average x i is the date value at time i and t is the number of years 2 4 3 pearson correlation analysis pearson correlation coefficient was used to characterize the degree of correlation between meteorological factors and iwr the calculation formula is 9 r x y i 1 n x i x y

respectively r x y is the pearson correlation coefficient according to the single correlation coefficient the most influential factor of the crop iwr can be determined 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal variation characteristics of t peff and et0 3 1 1 spatial distribution as shown in fig 3 the spatial difference of mean air temperature t influenced by the topography and crop growing season was the largest in the spring wheat planting areas with the lowest value being 2 8 c and the highest value being 18 4 c the relatively low values were observed in qinghai located at the upper reaches of the yellow river and the high values prevailingly appeared in northern ningxia and inner mongolia fig 3a the winter wheat planting areas t ranged from 1 2 10 1 c with the high value appeared in southern shaanxi and the low value in northern shanxi fig 3b in the spring maize planting areas t varied from 12 4 to 21 3 c with the low values exhibited in southwest gansu and the high values in western inner mongolia and ningxia fig 3c as for summer maize planting areas t showed a relatively even distribution ranging from 16 2 to 25 8 c fig 3d overall t had a significant increasing trend in almost all stations for the period of 1974 2017 this result is consistent with the research of huang et al 2020 that is the yrb has a significant warming trend in all four seasons in recent decades and the warming phenomenon is most significant in spring in fig 4 p eff varied a lot in the planting area of spring wheat with the lowest value as only 43 5 mm and the highest value as 245 6 mm fig 4a the lowest value of p eff in the winter wheat planting areas was 65 mm and the highest value was 168 9 mm fig 4b p eff in the planting area of spring maize was in a range of 58 5 208 1 mm fig 4c as for the summer maize planting areas the lowest and the highest values of p eff were 105 8 mm and 189 3 mm respectively fig 4d the spatial distribution of p eff in each crop planting area was almost the opposite of that of t that is areas with high t tend to have less p eff and vice versa in the past 44 years there was no significant trend in most stations while a few stations located in spring wheat spring maize and summer maize planting areas showed a significant decreasing trend in contrast a significant upward trend was found in north of winter wheat planting area the results are similar to the study detected by ma et al 2018 and zhang et al 2014 that spring summer and autumn precipitation declined while winter precipitation increased in the past few decades over the yrb in fig 5 et 0 in the planting area of spring wheat was between 460 6 mm and 809 3 mm most of the stations showed a significant upward trend while a few stations located in northern inner mongolia and xining station in qinghai showed an extremely significant downtrend fig 5a et 0 in the planting area of winter wheat was between 555 3 mm and 817 2 mm et 0 from stations with a significant increasing trend were mainly distributed in shaanxi while et 0 from a few stations in shanxi decreased significantly fig 5b et 0 in the planting area of spring maize was between 533 6 and 827 2 mm et 0 from most stations in gansu and ningxia showed an extremely significant increasing trend fig 5c et 0 in the planting area of summer maize was between 360 6 mm and 536 6 mm et 0 from most of the stations in shanxi and shandong presented a significant decreasing trend while et 0 from the other stations had no significant trend fig 5d 3 1 2 inner annual variation as shown in fig 6a p eff in the planting area of spring wheat had a slightly downward trend over the years with less p eff in 1982 2000 and 2001 t had a clearly upward trend with a linear rate of 0 47 c decade the linearly increasing rate of et 0 was 0 8 mm year p eff in the planting area of winter wheat did not change significantly during the past 44 years and it had the lowest value in 1981 and 1995 while t and et 0 increased at a rate of 0 4 c decade and 0 45 mm year respectively fig 6b p eff in the planting area of spring maize showed a gently downward trend and the minimum value appeared in 1997 with less than 100 mm t presented an obviously upward trend with a linear trend of 0 39 c decade the linearly increasing rate of et 0 was 0 63 mm year fig 6c during the growing season of summer maize p eff had a gently downward trend with a linearly decreasing rate of 0 2 mm year a low outlier appeared in 1997 conversely high outliers occur in t and et 0 in the same year the increase rate of t was 0 24 c decade different from the other crops et 0 of summer maize showed a downward trend with a decreasing rate of 0 41 mm year fig 6d 3 2 spatial variation of crop iwr the spatial distribution of spring wheat iwr was demonstrated in fig 7a within a range of 379 4 951 1 mm high values of iwr were mainly located in inner mongolia and northern ningxia the upper reaches of the yellow river had lower iwr most of the stations in ningxia gansu and eastern qinghai showed extremely significant increasing trends iwr of winter wheat ranged from 491 1 to 756 mm the areas with low iwr values appeared in southern shaanxi while the areas with high value were located in northern shaanxi and central shandong the variation trend of iwr for each station was similar to that of et 0 fig 7b iwr of spring maize was in a range of 325 6 620 3 mm low values were observed in the southern yrb and high values appeared in hetao irrigation area of inner mongolia and ningxia in addition no significant trend of iwr was found in the eastern region fig 7c iwr of summer maize showed a relatively homogenous spatial distribution with ranging from 234 2 to 387 mm there were few stations showed a significant downward trend and the other stations had no significant trend fig 7d obviously crop water requirement of each crop is far from being met by precipitation the areas with high crop iwr are mostly due to high t less p eff and high et 0 vice versa 3 3 inner annual variation of crop iwr in fig 8a and table 2 iwr of spring wheat was 684 06 mm with an increasing rate of 0 99 mm year combined with the cumulative anomaly curve and the 5 year moving average curve there were two abrupt change points in the past 44 years which happened in 1982 and 1999 iwr of winter wheat was 599 24 mm and the increasing rate from 1974 to 2017 was 0 43 mm year abrupt changes were observed in 1982 and 2003 there was an obviously upward trend 6 65 mm year higher than the overall rise before 1982 iwr of spring maize showed an increasing trend in the past 44 years with a rate of 0 64 mm year and a mean value of 486 34 mm there was only an abrupt change point in 1996 iwr of summer maize had a slightly downward trend with a linearly decreasing rate of 0 17 mm year and a mean value of 316 94 mm an abrupt change point was detected in 2002 it is worth noting that the trend of iwr during some period for both spring and summer maize was opposite to the trend during the past 44 years which may attribute from an extremely abnormal value in 1997 according to the description above 3 1 2 p eff of spring and summer maize in 1997 growing seasons was the lowest and t was relatively high which may lead to the excessive iwr in that year and affecting the 44 year trend 3 4 the dominant factors of iwr variation p eff and et 0 during the crop growing season are the most direct factors affecting iwr while et 0 depends on meteorological factors including t relative humidity rh wind speed w and net radiation r n in order to explore how crop iwr responds to various meteorological factors correlation coefficients of t rh w r n p eff and iwr were calculated respectively to determine the dominant meteorological factors as shown in fig 9a the main meteorological factors affecting spring wheat iwr were p eff and rh specifically qinghai and part of inner mongolia were mainly affected by p eff and southern ningxia and southeastern gansu were mainly affected by rh as the main planting area of winter wheat northern shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong were mainly affected by p eff and rh while central shaanxi were mainly affected by r n fig 9b as for spring maize p eff and rh were the dominant factors in gansu southern ningxia inner mongolia shanxi and northern shaanxi fig 9c different from the other crops the main factors affecting iwr of summer maize were r n and p eff in detail p eff was the main driven factor affecting iwr in southern shanxi and northern henan and r n was the key factor of varying iwr in most other areas fig 9d the dominant meteorological factors of the iwr variation for each crop are spatially dependent overall p eff and rh were the most influential factors to the iwr of spring wheat winter wheat and spring maize in most areas in fact humidity is closely related to precipitation and both of them have negative correlation to crop iwr thus precipitation is mainly responsible for the variation in crop iwr 4 discussion there have been plenty of studies on et 0 in the yrb overall our results showed that et 0 of spring wheat winter wheat and spring maize planting areas had an increasing trend and the largest growth rate appeared in spring wheat planting areas this seemed to be inconsistent with the existing opinions that pan evaporation paradox exists in the yrb liu et al 2012 xu et al 2018 however wang et al 2012 made a detailed analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of et 0 in the yrb indicating that the middle and lower reaches of the basin mainly showed a significant decreasing trend while the upper and central regions showed a significant increasing trend moreover according to zhang et al 2011 et 0 of the yrb had an upward trend in spring autumn and winter while the increase of et 0 in summer was mainly in the upper and middle reaches of the yrb which supported the results of this study over the past 44 years there were one or two abrupt change points in the long term time series iwr for each crop which mainly happened in the early 1980 s late 1990 s and early 2000 s the time of abrupt change point was closely related to the local climate change and human activities in the 1980 s and 1990 s under the influences of intensified human activities and climate change the flow of the yellow river was cut off zhang et al 2009 moreover the basin hydrologic cycle was affected seriously li et al 2017 resulting in the less precipitation and the warmer temperature that could be the reason of multiple variation periods for crop iwr based on our findings iwr of spring wheat winter wheat and spring maize will continue to increase under current climate change trends apparently it will intensify the water stress across the basin moreover many researchers have reported that the water resources of the yrb and runoff of the yellow river will reduce under future change scenarios wang et al 2017 mu et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 in order to cope with negative effects of climate change strategies can be formulated in terms of planting structure adjustment water efficiency improvement and water saving irrigation technologies promotion ju et al 2013 since the late 1970 s the wheat sown area in china has gradually decreased year by year while the maize sown area has increased significantly national bureau of statistics of china 2020 because the economic benefits of wheat are not as good as maize the sown area of wheat and maize in provinces along the yrb also has the same trend from the perspective of crop water consumption iwr of maize is obviously less than that of wheat the trends above are beneficial to reduce regional agricultural water demand in areas with high iwr of wheat such as hetao irrigation area of inner mongolia and northern ningxia reducing the planting area of spring wheat and increasing the planting area of maize can alleviate the local agricultural water crisis appropriately in the yrb precipitation has obvious seasonal characteristics the growing seasons of spring wheat spring maize and summer maize include the rainy season while the precipitation is less during the growing season of winter wheat therefore it is not appropriate to use change of annual precipitation when discussing the impact of precipitation on crop iwr this study focuses on the change of precipitation during crop growing season which can better analyze the relationship between precipitation and crop iwr the majority of scholars agreed that precipitation in the yrb will increase in the future mu et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 which seems to alleviate water pressure for irrigation however the specific seasonal variation and spatial pattern of precipitation are still not clear it is difficult to determine whether there will be a positive effect on crop iwr due to the seasonal behavior of crop growth the precipitation during the crop growing season directly affects the iwr of crop adjusting planting dates appropriately according to precipitation patterns can improve rainwater utilization and reduce water pressure for irrigation luo et al 2022 cao et al 2020 the growing season of summer maize in the yrb is in the rainy season of the year the planting date of summer maize can be optimized based on the precipitation forecast to improve the adaptability between crop critical periods of water demand and precipitation this is a low cost water saving measure for crops with less precipitation during the growing season the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system can be used which not only improves the utilization rate of rainwater but also benefits the growth of crops chen et al 2022 currently full irrigation is used to ensure crop yield in the yrb and flood irrigation is the main irrigation method iwr calculated in this study is the theoretical irrigation water demand when these crops reach the optimal growth condition iwr of the whole crop growing season was obtained by accumulative daily iwr however in actual applications wheat is usually irrigated 2 4 times and maize is irrigated 1 3 times during the crop growing season the amount of irrigation at each time is sufficient to ensure that the crops will not be subjected to serious water deficit before the next irrigation therefore iwr is not suitable for strict verification and comparison with the consumption of irrigation water in actual applications recently water saving irrigation has been greatly promoted and replacing flood irrigation with drip irrigation is an effective way to save more water drip irrigation allows for more precise irrigation the theoretical iwr calculated in this study is more suitable as a reference for full irrigation of crops under drip irrigation in general the effects of climate warming on crop iwr is complex it will change the physiological characteristics of the crop such as changes in phenological period liu et al 2020 zhao and yang 2018 and will also affect the suitable planting area of the crop franke et al 2022 liu et al 2015 in the future research a more comprehensive consideration of the effects of various factors on iwr will improve the accuracy and applicability of the research results the contradiction between agricultural and non agricultural water is increasingly prominent in the yrb it is necessary to understand thoroughly the impact of climate change on crop iwr for rational allocation of agricultural water resources 5 conclusions the amount of iwr is related to the development distribution and management of regional water resources quantifying the variation of meteorological factors and crop iwr is of great significance to cope with ongoing climate change and regional water shortage in this study spatial distribution and temporal variation of t p eff et 0 and iwr were characterized during the crop growing seasons for spring wheat winter wheat spring maize and summer maize besides the dominant meteorological factors of crop iwr variation were investigated the results showed that t of each crop increased significantly while the trends of p eff were not obvious in the past 44 years except for summer maize et 0 and iwr of other crops showed increasing trends the changing rates of iwr for spring wheat winter wheat spring maize and summer maize were 9 9 4 3 6 4 and 1 7 mm decade respectively notably both meteorological factors and crop iwr have largely spatial heterogeneity in general p eff rh and r n were the dominant factors of crop iwr variation according to the trends of crop iwr and future climate conditions the water resources and food security of the basin will be threatened if appropriate measures are not taken our research can provide scientific basis for the allocation of agricultural water resources under climate change in the yrb moreover it can provide water saving recommendations for areas with large amount of irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this research was financially supported by the national natural science

farming or rain fed farming system dfs three row spacings such as 90 cm 100 cm and 110 cm were considered sub treatments to find optimal plant density in the region for the highest yield under these two main treatments split plots in entirely randomized blocks design with three replications and six plant rows in each replication were used rainwater harvesting polyethylene covered ridge widths were 100 120 and 140 cm in the area the polyethylene cover was resistant to ultraviolet radiation and had 0 1 mm thickness furrow sizes among the ridges were 80 cm in width and 10 m long to grow the red pepper and infiltrate the rainwater hence the covered ridge ratio crr by polyethylene was 0 556 for rwhs1 0 600 for rwhs2 and 0 636 for rwhs3 the harvested water cannot flow out of the furrows due to the ridges on the counter lines fig 1 shows all the treatments each furrow in rwhs had double red pepper rows so mean row space for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 were 90 100 and 110 cm as were in their counterparts in dfs respectively the red pepper seedlings were transplanted on the rows with 0 40 cm space on 16 may 2017 and 11 may 2018 therefore plant densities were 27 780 plants ha 1 for rwhs1 and dfs1 were 25 000 plants ha 1 for rwhs2 and dfs2 and were 22 727 plants ha 1 for rwhs3 and dfs3 soil water contents swc to 120 cm soil depth for each 30 cm soil layer were monitored at the center of the covered ridges and 10 cm apart from plant rows on the furrows by 503 dr hydroprobe neutron moisture meters neutron moisture meter measurements were transformed to volumetric water contents by calibration equations obtained according to the method described by evett 2002 soil moisture measurement dates during the experimental years were presented table 4 an automated weather station at the experimental area recorded rainfalls minimum and maximum temperatures relative humidity wind speeds and sunshine duration rainwater collectors like the rwhs treatments shape and widths and 2 m long measured surface runoff to determine how much water was harvested from the covered ridges during rainfall events and threshold rainfall amounts for 100 120 and 140 cm covered ridge widths surface runoff depth srd was calculated by dividing collected water volume liter to the collectors areas covered ridge ratios crr and rainfall amounts as independent parameters and surface runoff depth as dependent parameters were used to develop a surface runoff model plant water consumptions for the dfs were determined by eq 1 based on the soil water budget approach james 1988 wang et al 2009 and for rwhs by eq 2 1 et p s d p 2 et sr d s d p in where et is red pepper evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm srd is surface runoff depth from the rainwater collector mm δs is the change in soil water storage mm and dp is deep percolation below the root zone mm rainwater amounts over the root zone field capacity were considered as deep percolation rain amounts higher than threshold values only produce runoff from the covered ridge li et al 2000 according to the rainwater collector measurements in this experiment 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 mm threshold values for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 were considered for computing crop evapotranspiration runoff coefficients for plastic covered ridge were determined as 0 911 0 943 by wang et al 2008 0 8 mm by li et al 2000 and 0 87 by li et al 2001 runoff water amounts for the treatments in this study were directly determined by the rainwater collectors crop water stress index cwsi was determined along the growing season idso et al 1981 köksal

difference of the upper limit was determined as 2 86 c for the red pepper by artık et al 2013 in the blacksea region of turkey plant height was measured with a ruler during the red pepper growing season approximately at 20 day intervals in 2017 plant height was measured five times 21 july 08 and 29 august 20 september and 13 october in 2017 and 4 times 25 june 07 august 04 september and 2 october in 2018 the leaf area by the nondestructive method cemek et al 2011 and leaf area index lai of red pepper was determined as a plant growth parameter four times 27 july 25 august 03 september 10 october in 2017 and 3 times 17july 29 august 20 september in 2018 to obtain leaf size and leaf area relationships randomly collected fresh leaf samples at the harvest were laid on a white base and photographed the photoshop program determined the sizes of the leaf samples and areas after validating the leaf size and leaf area relationship total plant leaf areas belonging to the treatments were estimated using leaf size measurements in the field after that leaf area indexes of the treatment were determined by dividing the leaf areas into their plant areas aydoğdu et al 2019 the red pepper fruits were harvested five times 22 august 07 september 26 september 01 november and 27 november in 2017 and 4 times 14 august 06 september 14 september and 24 october in 2018 the last harvests were performed on 27 november 2017 and on 24 october 2018 fruit quality parameters such as total soluble solids were analyzed in the black sea agricultural research institute s laboratory total soluble solids in red pepper fruit juice were determined by hand reflectometer crop water productivity wpc net income nic and financial efficiency fe for red pepper grown under the treatments were also determined wpc was calculated by dividing red pepper yields by the total plant water consumption kijne et al 2003 fernandez et al 2020 et determined fe m 3 by nic generated per unit of water use which was calculated the difference between total income and cost garcia garcia et al 2012 2004 köksal et al 2017 total income values were calculated based on the average fruit quality of red pepper per treatment using prices per kg which was taken from local market records during harvesting seasons in 2017 and 2018 the red pepper market prices for the rwhs treatments were 0 38 kg 1 and 0 24 kg 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively on the other hand the red pepper prices for the conventional rainfed treatments were 0 27 kg 1 in 2017 and 0 15 kg 1 in 2018 due to their smaller sizes statistical analyses were carried out by using spss 11 5 software spss 2002 the general linear model was used for variance analysis and duncan multiple range test to assess the differences in the means at 0 01 and 0 05 levels 3 results 3 1 precipitation and surface runoff the red pepper seedlings were transplanted on 136 days of 2017 and 131 days of 2018 the last harvests were performed on 331 days of 2017 and 297 days of 2018 therefore the red pepper growing season lasted 195 days in the first year and 166 days in the second year tables 2 and 4 shows total precipitation in the years of the experiment total monthly and individual precipitations during the growing seasons totally 621 4 mm and 589 7 mm of rain fell in the experiment s first and second years therefore total precipitations were higher by 19 5 and 13 4 according to the long term annual rainfall tables 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation between 2017 and 2018 indicates a considerable variation for monthly precipitation table 5 respective 163 9 mm and 149 8 mm of rain fell in the red pepper s first and second growing season these amounts of rainfalls corresponded to 26 3 and 25 4 of both annual precipitations respectively according to the long term rainfall pattern 51 of annual rainfall had fallen in the red pepper growing season under bafra conditions no precipitation occurred for 60 days between 21 june and 21 august in 2017 temperature and precipitation along 2017 and 2018 were depicted in fig 2 to show dry and wet periods for the experimental area as seen in the graph the dry period appears during the summer months that had higher temperatures the dry period in 2017 proceeded from mid may to mid october but the precipitation in august relieved the hardness of the dry period the amount of precipitation in 2018 was lower than in 2017 and a continuous dry period appeared from april to september in 2018 runoff from the different plastic covered ridge widths was measured in both years through runoff collectors then a multiple regression model was developed to estimate the runoff depth in mm srd by the plastic covered ridges ratios crr and rainfall p as independent parameters as presented in fig 3 the statistically significant p 0 01 surface runoff model sr 3 667 7 587 crr 0 985 p gave the highest r2 0 97 the lowest root mean squared error rmse 0 758 and mean absolute error mae 0 571 values 3 2 soil moisture and plant water consumption table 6 presents water consumption of the red pepper rainfall soil moisture difference and reference evapotranspiration eto totally 163 2 mm and 149 8 mm rainwater fell in the first and the second year of the red pepper growing season fig 4 depicts rainfall amounts and soil water content fluctuations for 0 90 cm depth along the growing seasons for the whole treatment red and green lines in these graphs indicate the field capacity and the wilting point moisture levels of the area growing season 2017 on the 97th day 36 4 mm precipitation occurred and soil water content rose noticeably in rainwater harvesting treatments according to control treatments soil water content in experimental treatments declined as precipitation decreased along the growing season averaged initial soil water content for 0 9 m soil depth was about 313 mm in for rwhs and by average 299 mm control treatments in 2017 in the 2018 growing season initial soil water content averaged 300 mm for rwhs and 288 mm for control treatments averaged soil moisture at the harvest was about 320 mm 325 mm and 317 mm for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 treatment respectively and about 301 mm 308 mm 299 mm for control treatments dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 in two experiment year due to the autumn rainfall water consumptions of rwhs1 rwhs2 rwhs3 dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 treatments were determined respectively as 166 165 166 174 170 and 168 mm in 2017 and as 135 121 118 147 141 and 138 mm in 2018 differences in water consumption or actual evapotranspiration eta were found significant p 0 01 only in the second year table 6 maximum eta was observed for dfs1 and minimum values for rwhs2 and rwhs3 atmospheric evaporation demand or reference evapotranspiration eto was 561 1 mm and 674 5 mm during the red pepper growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 6 lower rainfall and higher eto did get harder in 2018 for the red pepper 3 3 plant growth parameters plant height and leaf area index findings as plant growth parameters were presented in fig 5 plant height was measured five times in 2017 and four times in 2018 along the growing season of the red pepper the plant height varied between 45 7 and 61 6 cm in 2017 and 38 4 56 2 cm in 2018 according to the results of variance analysis for plant height parameters differences between experimental treatments were significant in both years the plant heights are separated into two groups the highest in rwhs and the lowest in dfs rwhs1 and rwhs2 were in the first highest plant height group and rwhs3 in the second group while the plant under dfs was in the third group in 2017 in the second year all treatments in rwhs were in the highest plant height group while all treatments in dfs were in the lowest plant height group only in the first year did plant height decrease as the width of the covered ridge increased as a result rwhs increased plant height leaf area indexes that were found by dividing total plant leaf area to individual plant area varied between 0 38 and 1 12 m2m 2 in 2017 and between 0 28 and 1 04 m2m 2 in 2018 the differences in leaf area indexes were found significant in the consecutive experimental years fig 5 in the first year the maximum lai 1 12 was determined in rwhs1 while the minimum lai in the whole dfs treatments rwhs2 and rwhs3 treatments were in the second highest lai group in the second year lai results were similar to the first year fig 5 therefore rwhs improved both the leaf area of the red pepper and leaf area index 3 4 yield parameters fig 6 shows fruit yield per plant for the treatments plant fruit yield varied 0 70 1 20 kg in the first year and 0 39 0 98 kg in the second year each plant produced 1 20 kg 1 02 kg and 1 01 kg mean respective fruit yield for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 in the first year while each plant produced 0 71 kg 0 70 kg 0 81 kg for dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 respectively in the second year 0 98 kg 0 77 kg and 0 65 kg fruit yield per plant obtained from rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 while 0 44 kg 0 39 kg and 0 39 kg from dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 respectively fig 6 fruit yield differences per plant were found significant p 0 05 in 2017 and 2018 rwhs1 gave the maximum while conventional dry farming treatments gave the minimum rwhs2 and rwhs3 were in the second and third orders as the highest producing treatments during the 2017 and 2018 experiment years fig 7 shows total red pepper yield results the first harvest was on 99th and 91st days after transplanting in 2017 and 2018 5 and 4 time fruit harvests were carried out during the first and the second years growing seasons fresh fruit yield values ranged from 17 42 to 33 20 t ha 1 in 2017 and 8 98 27 18 t ha 1 in 2018 these differences in red pepper yield among the treatments were significant p 0 01 for both years fruit yield results separated six groups rwhs1 rwhs2 rwhs3 dfs1 dfs2 dfs3 in 2017 and four groups rwhs1 rwhs2 rwhs3 dfs1 dfs2 dfs3 in 2018 according to duncan range test rwhs1 treatment which had 100 cm plastic covered ridge and 80 cm furrow widths produced maximum red pepper yields 33 2 and 27 19 t ha 1 in both years as plastic covered ridge width increased red pepper yield decreased because of decreasing plant density as seen in fig 7 plant row distance had no apparent effect on red pepper fruit yield for dfs the conventional dry farming treatments were in the same yield group dfs2 and dfs3 produced the minimum red pepper yields 17 4 t ha 1 and 18 3 t ha 1 in 2017 and the dfs treatments 10 92 9 81 and 8 98 t ha 1 in 2018 rwhs1 increased red pepper fruit yield by 68 in 2017 and by 149 in 2018 3 5 yield quality parameters fig 8 shows fruit length fruit diameter skin thickness and soluble solids as fruit quality parameters as seen in fig 8a red pepper fruit length percent of fruits longer and shorter than 125 mm showed significant differences in both experimental years although higher fruit yield in 2017 fruit percent less than 125 mm was also higher for all the treatments as seen in fig 8a longer fruit percent was higher in 2018 except for dfs1 and dfs2 treatments longer red pepper fruit percent was maximum for rwhs2 and minimum for dfs2 in 2017 in the second year longer fruit percent was considerably lower for dfs1 and dfs2 while that percentage was higher for all rainwater harvesting treatments and dfs3 it can be concluded that the rainwater harvesting treatments had positively affected the longer red pepper fruit ratio it should be in mind that a longer red pepper fruit ratio is essential for marketing red pepper fruit diameter varied between 40 2 and 62 0 mm in 2017 and 50 0 71 7 mm in 2018 these differences in fruit diameter were found significant for both years rwhs1 produced the maximum fruit diameter and dfs3 the minimum ones in 2017 although fruit diameters were greater in rainwater harvesting treatments than in rain fed or dry farming treatments fruit diameter decreased with increasing plant row distance for rainwater harvesting and conventional rain fed farming treatments in 2018 fruit diameters for all the treatments were higher than those in 2017 as seen in fig 8b red pepper fruit diameter separates into two distinctive statistical groups fruits with greater diameter in the rainwater harvesting treatments and fruits with a smaller diameter in the dry farming treatments it can be concluded that rainwater harvesting improved red pepper fruit diameter fruit skin thickness and soluble solids content of peppers harvested from rwhs and dfs treatments are presented in fig 8c and d respectively the maximum fruit skin thickness was 4 68 mm in 2017 and 6 10 mm in 2018 for rwhs maximum solids content ratios were obtained from dfs for both years while minimum ones were obtained from rwhs treatments the differences in fruit skin thickness and soluble solids content were significant p 0 01 for both years 3 6 crop water productivity net income and financial efficiency crop water productivity ranged from 10 45 to 20 20 kg m 3 in 2017 and from 6 50 to 20 21 kg m 3 in 2018 table 7 the differences in wpc were found significant p 0 01 for both years maximum wpc ratios 20 20 kg m 3 and 20 21 kg m 3 were obtained from rwhs1 for both years while minimum ones 10 45 11 65 kg m 3 and 6 50 7 50 kg m 3 were obtained from dfs treatments input costs net income nic and financial efficiency results were also presented in tables 7 and 8 rwhs had higher input costs because of ridge construction polyethylene cover and covering costs all the treatments in 2017 were earned income due to red pepper farming in rainfed conditions while only rwhs1 and rwhs2 supplied income in 2018 the red pepper yield and the income were negatively affected by low rainfall and higher eto in 2018 the income could not compensate for production costs in the second year under the dry farming system and rwhs3 financial efficiency fe values were changed between 2 11 m 3 and 0 10 m 3 in 2017 and between 1 40 m 3 and 0 59 m 3 in 2018 maximum fe values were obtained from rwhs1 because of red pepper yield reductions in 2018 fe was below zero except rwhs1 and rwhs2 4 discussion 4 1 precipitation and surface runoff although higher rainfall amounts occurred in the experimental years the rainfall amounts in the red pepper growing season were lower the rainfall pattern in the red pepper growing seasons was another noticeable difference between the two years the significant rain amounts fell around the beginning of the red pepper growth season in 2017 but the late of the growth period in 2018 all these differences in rainfall are very crucial for both red pepper growth and yield as seen in fig 2 the dry period generally occurred at the mid season of the red pepper contrary to long term precipitation records nearly 60 days of no rainless term was observed in 2017 which indicated the strength of the red pepper to dry spells therefore pre season and after season precipitations which replenish soil moisture storage have played an essential role in coping with dry spells in the region besides rainfall amount the rainfall pattern along the red pepper growth period is also essential for plant growth and yield the pepper is more susceptible to water stress in flowering and fruit settings dagdelen et al 2004 the threshold rainfall amount is the minimum amount that generates runoff from the water harvesting area yazar et al 2014 according to the model in fig 3 sr 3 667 7 587 crr 0 985 p the rainfall amount that makes the runoff zero is the threshold for different cover ratios therefore precipitation amounts lower than 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 mm did not cause runoff for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 respectively the model can estimate threshold values for other plastic covered ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting techniques for regions with similar rainfall and climatic characteristics in 2017 a total of 31 rainfall events occurred along the red pepper growing season table 4 in the first year 7 12 and 13 precipitation events below these threshold values did not produce runoff for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 treatments in 2018 29 rainfall events occurred and rainfall events below the threshold were 10 for rwhs1 and 15 for both rwhs2 and rwhs3 total rainfall amounts below the threshold values were 1 8 5 2 and 6 8 mm in 2017 and 2 6 6 2 and 6 2 mm in 2018 for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 respectively this runoff model can estimate the amount of harvested water from rwhs treatments when it rains above that threshold the runoff model should be run for individual rainfall events separately and not to be applied to total monthly or annual precipitation li et al 2000 used rainfall mm as an input to find runoff from a 60 cm covered ridge and offered a linear regression equation r 0 98 p 0 8 0 2 as rainfall amounts increased the runoff efficiency increased due to reducing the ratios of the thresholds mean runoff efficiencies of the rainfall in the red pepper growing season for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 were 0 90 0 88 and 0 85 in 2017 and were 0 91 0 90 and 0 88 in 2018 respectively it can be concluded that increasing polyethylene covered ridge width enhanced the threshold rainwater amount and declined the runoff efficiency from the covered ridge li et al 2000 found 0 8 0 2 mm threshold rainwater value for 60 cm covered ridge width and found runoff efficiency as 0 87 for plastic covered ridge and 0 07 for the uncovered ridge runoff efficiency of ridges covered by the plastic film was reported between 0 911 and 0 943 and the threshold between 0 23 and 0 47 mm by wang et al 2008 for 30 60 ridge widths the difference in threshold rainfall amounts and runoff coefficients may result from cover material ridge shape width and slope and rainfall characters 4 2 soil moisture and plant water consumption soil moisture of the rwhs s treatments differed from dfs treatments soil moisture fig 4 soil moisture along the growing season in 2017 for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 was higher by 6 20 3 84 and 4 26 than dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 compared to dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 treatments 6 45 4 76 and 6 58 higher soil moisture for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 were determined in 2018 the plastic covered ridge inhibited soil moisture evaporation and contributed to higher soil moisture conditions for the rainwater harvesting treatments when the soil has moisture content below critical moisture which defined moisture level that plants begin to experience water stress between field capacity and wilting point plants extract soil water more easily from higher soil moisture conditions james 1988 doorenbos and kassam 1986 allen et al 1998 therefore the plant under higher soil moisture conditions would experience lower water stress and grow better this study s moisture findings agree with fan et al 2019 and li et al 2019 who reported that soil water content was highest for ridge furrow water harvesting zhao et al 2014 found higher soil water content at 20 cm depth in the plastic mulch ridge planting than conventional ridge planting saleh and ayed 2009 indicated that soil water contents were higher in the terrace and semi circular micro catchment treatments than in control yıldırım et al 2017 also reported slightly higher soil moisture for melon and watermelon grown in the plastic covered ridge treatments than ones in the conventional rainfed farming under semiarid vezirköprü conditions in turkey li et al 2006 stated that soil moisture was lower for the trench saucer bare ridge and bare furrow and control treatments than the plastic covered ridge furrow rainwater harvesting treatments for tamarix ramosissima plant from 2002 to 2004 the rainfed farming treatments showed lower soil moisture than the plastic covered ridge furrow rainwater harvesting because of excessive evaporation from the bare soil surface under semiarid conditions in turkey for chickpea ünlükara and katırcı 2018 mean water consumptions of rwhs and conventional dry farming treatments were 166 mm and 171 mm in 2017 and 125 mm and 142 mm in 2018 respectively although quantitatively fewer eta values were determined in rwhs treatments for two experimental years due to runoff efficiency and threshold rainfall of polyethylene cover the difference in eta between rwhs and dfs was not significant in the same region red pepper consumed 294 mm with 377 mm rainfall and 163 mm with 177 mm rainfall under rain fed conditions for two consecutive years by köksal et al 2017 red pepper water consumption increased by applying irrigation water and reached 472 and 508 mm under full irrigation conditions for those years in bafra plain köksal et al 2017 under full irrigation conditions red pepper consumes 420 mm water for bafra plain in turkey s plant water consumption guide anonymous 2016b however considerably higher red pepper water consumption under complete irrigation conditions occurred in the other regions of turkey for example dagdelen et al 2004 reported 700 818 mm sezen et al 2019 reported 809 824 mm şen 2015 reported 1189 1240 mm kuşçu et al 2016 reported 645 792 mm sezen et al 2015 reported 928 980 mm for furrow irrigation and 809 824 mm for drip irrigation and demirel et al 2012 reported 736 855 mm production potential under rain fed conditions and relatively lower water consumption of red pepper under the blacksea region make it one of the favorite plants for ridge furrow rainwater harvesting techniques fig 9 presents crop water stress indexes of the treatment along the growing seasons of the red pepper mean cwsi along the growing season of the red pepper for rwhs1 rwhs2 rwhs3 dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 were determined as 0 73 0 74 0 71 0 96 0 97 and 0 97 in 2017 in 2018 cwsi were found as 0 47 0 48 0 50 0 82 0 74 and 0 77 for the same order of the treatments mean cwsi s for rwhs were 24 5 and 38 2 lower than for dfs in the first and second year of the experiment respectively as seen in fig 9 rwhs treatments cwsi lines lined below the cwsi lines of rainfed treatments during both the experimental years sezen et al 2014 reported that increased water stress caused increases in cwsi values of the red pepper therefore lower cwsi indicated that the red pepper under rwhs treatments exposed less water stress than the rainfed treatments because of higher soil moisture and lower evaporation losts the pepper plants under rwhs used much water than dfs by transpiration sezen et al 2014 found threshold cwsi as 0 26 for drip irrigated red pepper and 0 38 for furrow irrigated red pepper in the mediterranean region of turkey the threshold cwsi value for the fruit ripening period of the red pepper was between 0 5 and 0 7 in the black sea region of turkey artık et al 2013 4 3 plant growth parameters based on the red pepper plant height and the total leaf area findings it can be concluded that the red pepper grew more vigor under rwhs higher soil moisture and lower cwsi in rwhs treatments had favored plant growth similarly ünlükara et al 2021 reported that polyethylene covered ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting techniques increased leaf area for pumpkin under a semiarid region sezen et al 2014 reported negative relationships between cwsi and lai for red pepper irrigated by drip and furrow irrigation systems consequently the plant with higher lai would have higher photosynthesis possibility and production capacity 4 4 yield parameters rwhs1 increased red pepper fruit yield by 68 in 2017 and by 149 in 2018 rwhs2 caused increases by 46 in 2017 and by 96 in 2018 and rwhs3 by 25 in 2017 and by 64 in 2018 therefore the plastic mulched ridge and furrow micro catchment water harvesting system greatly enhanced red pepper yield under rain fed areas of the black sea region of turkey sezen et al 2014 found negative relationships between red pepper yield and cwsi lower cwsi in rwhs improved both the red pepper growth and yield rwhs1 produced maximum fruit yield because of the most excellent fruit yield per plant and maximum plant density per hectare as plant density decreased under rwhs fruit yield per plant and fruit yield per hectare declined while plant density did not affect fruit yield in control treatments mean fruit yield 22 84 t ha 1 in 2017 was higher than the one obtained 15 14 t ha 1 in 2018 lower rainfall in 2018 and higher atmospheric evaporative demand eto reduced the overall fruit yield of the experiment table 6 and fig 7 mean fruit yields of rwhs were 27 2 t ha 1 in 2017 and 20 4 t ha 1 in 2018 while mean fruit yields of dfs were 18 49 t ha 1 and 9 91 t ha 1 respectively hardened atmospheric conditions in the second year caused 25 yield loss under rwhs and 46 under dfs according to mean fruit yields in the first year red pepper yields such as 32 61 t ha 1 and 42 43 t ha 1 köksal et al 2017 31 01 t ha 1 dagdelen et al 2004 and 46 t ha 1 sezen et al 2015 were reported from different regions of turkey for full irrigation conditions köksal et al 2017 reported 16 43 t ha 1 red pepper yield with 294 mm water consumption and 19 32 t ha 1 red pepper yield with 163 mm water consumption under rain fed conditions bafra plain where our experiment was conducted our experiment s mean red pepper water consumption in 2017 168 mm was around the second year s value reported by köksal et al 2017 this situation allowed us more convenient comparisons along with the results mean red pepper fruit yield was 18 50 t ha 1 for dfs treatments nearly similar to the second year s yield results 19 32 t ha 1 of köksal et al 2017 in bafra plain however the mean fruit yield of the red pepper under the rwhs technique 27 2 t ha 1 was higher than that fruit yield obtained by köksal et al 2017 under rain fed treatment conventionally 4 5 yield quality parameters fruit quality was observed an increase with the falling precipitation during flowering and fruit formation in 2018 therefore longer fruit percent fruit skin thickness fruit diameter were obtained higher than in 2017 similar to our results köksal et al 2017 sezen et al 2015 and sezen et al 2014 reported that water stress significantly affects red pepper fruit quality a study conducted by sung et al 2005 using three hot pepper populations in taiwan showed that the plants under water stress had small fruits and köksal et al 2017 demirel et al 2012 and cosic et al 2015 reported similar results for water stressed red peppers fruit skin thickness was the lowest for the conventional planting control treatments in 2017 and 2018 when significant differences in all treatments the relationship between red pepper fruit diameter fruit skin thickness and different soil water content by adel et al 2014 was examined and reported a maximum fruit diameter of 3 32 cm for complete irrigation fruit diameter decreased with the limited irrigation similar results were obtained by köksal et al 2017 for the bafra plain of turkey who reported different irrigation strategies for red pepper and a minimum fruit diameter and fruit skin thickness determined for no irrigation treatment these parameters improved with the increasing amount of irrigation water orhangazi 2017 obtained higher soluble solids 7 due to lower water application and lowered soluble solids due to higher water application 4 6 crop water productivity net income and financial efficiency rwhs1 improved wpc by 74 in 2017 and by 169 in 2018 although the red peppers in 2018 experienced lower rainfall and higher atmospheric evaporative demand wpc ratios of rwhs treatments did not decrease but wpc ratios of dfs treatments considerably decreased table 7 similar wpc ratios for conventional rainfed treatments such as 5 6 kg m 3 and 11 9 kg m 3 were reported in the same plain by köksal et al 2017 maximum wpc ratios for red pepper varied from the region to region of turkey for example dagdelen et al 2004 reported 5 12 kg m 3 köksal et al 2017 reported 11 9 kg m 3 sezen et al 2019 reported 7 5 kg m 3 şen 2015 reported 4 35 kg m 3 kuşçu et al 2016 reported 8 08 kg m 3 sezen et al 2015 reported 7 5 kg m 3 and demirel et al 2012 reported 8 65 kg m 3 therefore the highest wpc ratios of turkey were attained with rwhs for red pepper in this study wang et al 2008 reported 1 50 and 1 62 times higher potato water productivity for ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting depending on the ridge furrow ratios and cover material than conventional rainfed treatments in a dry semiarid region of china rwhs also improved water productivity of maize sweet sorghum watermelon foxtail millet and wheat li et al 2001 mo et al 2016 wang et al 2009 2011 zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2018 higher fruit yield and quality in rwhs compensated for the higher input cost because of polyethylene material and its covering rwhs1 and rwhs2 supplied sufficient net income for both years and they had higher financial efficiencies than the other treatments therefore this result means that sustainable red pepper farming under a rainfed area in the region would not be possible unless using a suitable plastic covered ridge and furrow micro catchment rainwater harvesting system such as rwhs1 rwhs1 brought 3488 3 and 1888 7 incomes per hectare in both years like our results köksal et al 2017 found nic 3928 8 and 3447 4 ha 1 for red pepper under rainfed conditions in bafra plain they reported 4143 0 and 8236 5 ha 1 net incomes under full irrigation conditions in a two year study köksal et al 2017 exposed the red pepper to different irrigation water ratios and found fe values between 1 3 0 9 m 3 in 2010 and between 2 1 1 6 m 3 in 2011 the red pepper with 472 mm and 508 mm water consumptions under full irrigation maximized net income per m3 water in bafra plain köksal et al 2017 higher fe values 2 11 and 140 m 3 under rwhs1 resulted from higher crop water productivity ratios 20 20 and 20 21 kg m 3 5 conclusions this two year field study compared plastic covered ridge and furrow micro catchment rainwater harvesting system rwhs to conventional rainfed system dfs for red pepper cultivation under semi humid bafra plain conditions black sea region of turkey the differences in soil moisture plant water consumption plant growth yield and yield quality water use efficiency net income and financial efficiency terms were compared for rwhs and dfs rainwater harvesting properties such as runoff efficiencies and threshold rainfall amounts of rwhs treatments were investigated a relationship was developed considering rainfall amount and covered ridge ratio as independent parameters as increased plastic covered ridge width threshold rainfall amount which was the minimum limit for runoff increased from 0 6 mm for 1 0 m covered ridge width to 1 2 mm for 1 4 m covered ridge width however runoff efficiency decreased from 0 90 to 0 85 maximum red pepper yields 33 2 and 27 19 t ha 1 were derived from the rwhs1 treatment with 100 cm plastic covered ridge and 80 cm furrow widths in both years therefore the plastic mulched ridge and furrow micro catchment water harvesting system greatly enhanced red pepper yield under rain fed areas of the black sea region of turkey as increasing covered ridge width the fruit yield increment ratio decreases because of lower plant density fruit yield in 2017 was higher because of higher rainfall and lower atmospheric evaporative demand the mean fruit yield decreased by 25 for the rainwater harvesting system and by 46 for the conventional dry farming system in 2018 due to lower rainfall and higher atmospheric evaporative demand therefore it can be concluded that the red pepper grown under the plastic mulched ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system presented higher strength to drought than ones grown under conventional rain fed farming lower cwsi was observed under the rainwater harvesting system although nearly similar water consumptions occurred under rwhs and dfs the plastic covered ridges reduced evaporation from the soil surface and improved transpiration compared to the conventional rainfed higher transpiration ratio and lower crop water stress enhanced plant growth and yield 1 0 m plastic covered ridge supplied adequate net incomes for red pepper in both years of the experiment in contrast net income was negative or lower under the rainfed farming system therefore sustainable red pepper farming would not be possible under a rainfed farming system in the region unless using a suitable plastic covered ridge furrow micro catchment rainwater harvesting system turkey s highest crop water productivity for red pepper was obtained under the rainwater harvesting consisting of a 1 0 m plastic covered ridge and a 0 8 m furrow width the improved crop water productivity and higher net income under this rainwater harvesting technique enhanced financial efficiency per consumed cubic meter of water the remarkable yield increases under the mulched ridge and furrow micro catchment rainwater harvesting system could only be explained by preventing evaporation losses from stored soil moisture and enhancing plant transpiration satisfactory net income and higher water productivity of red pepper under plastic covered ridge and furrow micro catchment rainwater harvesting system make it one of the favorite plants for rainfed farming in the semi humid blacksea region of turkey declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9709,for two decades promising results have been obtained by ridge furrow rainwater harvesting systems rwhs to feed the increasing world population and cope with water scarcity and drought in semiarid and arid areas a two year study in turkey s semi humid black sea region was conducted to examine rwhs s effects on harvested water soil water content red pepper growth yield quality attributes water consumption and crop water productivity wpc crop water stress index cwsi the profitability of the system was examined by economic analysis for these purposes three different polyethylene covered ridge widths rwhs1 100 cm rwhs2 120 cm and rwhs3 140 cm were considered to allow the harvested water infiltration root zone and grow red pepper 80 cm width furrow areas with double plant rows were left between the covered ridges on contours to compare the rwhs treatments three conventional rainfed farming or dry farming treatments dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 with 90 cm 100 cm and 110 cm plant row distances were considered each treatment was replicated three times in the randomized block design experiment besides a multiple regression model was developed to estimate the runoff from the plastic covered ridges by using independent parameters such as covered ridge ratios and rainfall amounts r2 0 97 the red pepper consumed between 165 and 174 mm water in 2017 and 118 147 mm in 2018 maximum red pepper yields which increased by 68 in 2017 and 149 in 2018 were derived from rwhs1 as 33 2 and 27 19 t ha 1 respectively as plastic covered ridge width increased red pepper yield decreased because of lowering plant density rwhs improved red pepper yield and significantly increased leaf area plant height fruit length and diameter rwhs produced turkey s highest red pepper wpc ratios and rwhs1 improved wpc by 74 in 2017 and 169 in 2018 although the red pepper consumed nearly the same amount of water under whole treatments cwsi was lower under rwhs treatments it was determined that sustainable red pepper farming according to the net income values under rainfed farmland in the region would not be possible without using rainwater harvesting systems such as rwhs1 keywords ridge

facts gan et al 2013 presented ridge furrow mulching systems as innovative approaches for improving soil productivity increasing water availability and enhancing food security for semiarid and arid rain fed areas the basic principle of agricultural water harvesting is capturing precipitation from one part of the land and addressing it to another part oweis et al 2012 water harvesting methods have several classifications and are commonly used based on the size of the catchment micro catchment techniques are those in which the surface runoff is collected from a small catchment area collected runoff water in agricultural areas is stored in the plant root zone and used directly by the plant oweis et al 2012 by using different ridge and furrow micro catchment water harvesting

kg ha 1 phosphorus p2o5 and 100 kg ha 1 n just before planting were applied to plant rows and mixed into the soil by hoeing 2 2 experimental treatments the experiment consisted of two main treatments and three sub treatments the main treatments of the experiment were the cultivation of the red pepper under covered ridge furrow micro catchment rainwater harvesting system rwhs and conventional dry farming or rain fed farming system dfs three row spacings such as 90 cm 100 cm and 110 cm were considered sub treatments to find optimal plant density in the region for the highest yield under these two main treatments split plots in entirely randomized blocks design with three replications and six plant rows in each replication were used rainwater harvesting polyethylene covered ridge widths were 100 120 and 140 cm in the area the polyethylene cover was resistant to ultraviolet radiation and had 0 1 mm thickness furrow sizes among the ridges were 80 cm in width and 10 m long to grow the red pepper and infiltrate the rainwater hence the covered ridge ratio crr by polyethylene was 0 556 for rwhs1 0 600 for rwhs2 and 0 636 for rwhs3 the harvested water cannot flow out of the furrows due to the ridges on the counter lines fig 1 shows all the treatments each furrow in rwhs had double red pepper rows so mean row space for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 were 90 100 and 110 cm as were in their counterparts in dfs respectively the red pepper seedlings were transplanted on the rows with 0 40 cm space on 16 may 2017 and 11 may 2018 therefore plant densities were 27 780 plants ha 1 for rwhs1 and dfs1 were 25 000 plants ha 1 for rwhs2 and dfs2 and were 22 727 plants ha 1 for rwhs3 and dfs3 soil water contents swc to 120 cm soil depth for each 30 cm soil layer were monitored at the center of the covered ridges and 10 cm apart from plant rows on the furrows by 503 dr hydroprobe neutron moisture meters neutron moisture meter measurements were transformed to volumetric water contents by calibration equations obtained according to the method described by evett 2002 soil moisture measurement dates during the experimental years were presented table 4 an automated weather station at the experimental area recorded rainfalls minimum and maximum temperatures relative humidity wind speeds and sunshine duration rainwater collectors like the rwhs treatments shape and widths and 2 m long

season approximately at 20 day intervals in 2017 plant height was measured five times 21 july 08 and 29 august 20 september and 13 october in 2017 and 4 times 25 june 07 august 04 september and 2 october in 2018 the leaf area by the nondestructive method cemek et al 2011 and leaf area index lai of red pepper was determined as a plant growth parameter four times 27 july 25 august 03 september 10 october in 2017 and 3 times 17july 29 august 20 september in 2018 to obtain leaf size and leaf area relationships randomly collected fresh leaf samples at the harvest were laid on a white base and photographed the photoshop program determined the sizes of the leaf samples and areas after validating the leaf size and leaf area relationship total plant leaf areas belonging to the treatments were estimated using leaf size measurements in the field after that leaf area indexes of the treatment were determined by dividing the leaf areas into their plant areas aydoğdu et al 2019 the red pepper

treatment using prices per kg which was taken from local market records during harvesting seasons in 2017 and 2018 the red pepper market prices for the rwhs treatments were 0 38 kg 1 and 0 24 kg 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively on the other hand the red pepper prices for the conventional rainfed treatments were 0 27 kg 1 in 2017 and 0 15 kg 1 in 2018 due to their smaller sizes statistical analyses were carried out by using spss 11 5 software spss 2002 the general linear model was used for variance analysis and duncan multiple range test to assess the differences in the means at 0 01 and 0 05 levels 3 results 3 1 precipitation and surface runoff the red pepper seedlings were transplanted on 136 days of 2017 and 131 days of 2018 the last harvests were performed on 331 days of 2017 and 297 days of 2018 therefore the red pepper growing season lasted 195 days in the first year and 166 days in the second year tables 2 and 4 shows total precipitation in the years of the experiment total monthly and individual precipitations during the growing seasons totally 621 4 mm and 589 7 mm of rain fell in the experiment s first and second years therefore total precipitations were higher by 19 5 and 13 4 according to the long term annual rainfall tables 1 and 2 the coefficient of variation between 2017 and 2018 indicates a considerable variation for monthly precipitation table 5 respective 163 9 mm and 149 8 mm of rain fell in the red pepper s first and second growing season these amounts of rainfalls corresponded to 26 3 and 25 4 of both annual precipitations respectively according to the long term rainfall pattern 51 of annual rainfall had fallen in the red pepper growing season under bafra conditions no precipitation occurred for 60 days between 21 june and 21 august in 2017 temperature and precipitation along 2017 and 2018 were depicted in fig 2 to show dry and wet periods for the experimental area as seen in the graph the dry period appears during the summer months that had higher temperatures the dry period in 2017 proceeded from mid may to mid october but the precipitation in august relieved the hardness of the dry period the amount of precipitation in 2018 was lower than in 2017 and a continuous dry period appeared from april to september in 2018 runoff from the different plastic covered ridge widths was measured in both years through runoff collectors then a multiple regression model was developed to estimate the runoff depth in mm srd by the plastic covered ridges ratios crr and rainfall p as independent parameters as presented in fig 3 the

soil water content rose noticeably in rainwater harvesting treatments according to control treatments soil water content in experimental treatments declined as precipitation decreased along the growing season averaged initial soil water content for 0 9 m soil depth was about 313 mm in for rwhs and by average 299 mm control treatments in 2017 in the 2018 growing season initial soil water content averaged 300 mm for rwhs and 288 mm for control treatments averaged soil moisture at the harvest was about 320 mm 325 mm and 317 mm for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 treatment respectively and about 301 mm 308 mm 299 mm for control treatments dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 in two experiment year due to the autumn rainfall water consumptions of rwhs1 rwhs2 rwhs3 dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 treatments were determined respectively as 166 165 166 174 170 and 168 mm in 2017 and as 135 121 118 147 141 and 138 mm in 2018 differences in water consumption or actual evapotranspiration eta were found significant p 0 01 only in the second year table 6 maximum eta was observed for dfs1 and minimum values for rwhs2 and rwhs3 atmospheric evaporation demand or reference evapotranspiration eto was 561 1 mm and 674 5 mm during the red pepper growing season in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 6 lower rainfall and higher eto did get harder in 2018 for the red pepper 3 3 plant growth parameters plant height and leaf area index findings as plant growth parameters were presented in fig 5 plant height was measured five times in 2017 and four times in 2018 along the growing season of the red pepper the plant height varied between 45 7 and 61 6 cm in 2017 and 38 4 56 2 cm in 2018 according to the results of variance analysis for plant height parameters differences between experimental treatments were significant in both years the plant heights are separated into two groups the highest in rwhs and the lowest in dfs rwhs1 and rwhs2 were in the first highest plant height group and rwhs3 in the second group while the plant under dfs was in the third group in 2017 in the second year all treatments in rwhs were in the highest plant height group while all treatments in dfs were in the lowest plant height group only in the first year did plant height decrease as the width of the covered ridge increased as a result rwhs increased plant height leaf area indexes that were found by dividing total plant leaf area to individual plant area varied between 0 38 and 1 12 m2m 2 in 2017 and between 0 28 and 1 04 m2m 2 in 2018 the differences in leaf area indexes were found significant in the consecutive experimental years fig 5 in the first year the maximum lai 1 12 was determined in rwhs1 while the minimum lai in the whole dfs treatments rwhs2 and rwhs3 treatments were in the second highest lai group in the second year lai results were similar to the first year fig 5 therefore rwhs improved both the leaf area of the red pepper and leaf area index 3 4 yield parameters fig 6 shows fruit yield per plant for the treatments plant fruit yield varied 0 70 1 20 kg in the first year and 0 39 0 98 kg in the second year each plant produced 1 20 kg 1 02 kg and 1 01 kg mean respective fruit yield for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 in the first year while each plant produced 0 71 kg 0 70 kg 0 81 kg for dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 respectively in the second year 0 98 kg 0 77 kg and 0 65 kg fruit yield per plant obtained from rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 while 0 44 kg 0 39 kg and 0 39 kg from dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 respectively fig 6 fruit yield differences per plant were found significant p 0 05 in 2017 and 2018 rwhs1 gave the maximum while conventional dry farming treatments gave the minimum rwhs2 and rwhs3 were in the second and third orders as the highest producing treatments during the 2017 and 2018 experiment years fig 7 shows total red pepper yield results the first harvest was on 99th and 91st days after transplanting in 2017 and 2018 5 and 4 time fruit harvests were carried out during the first and the second years growing seasons fresh fruit yield values ranged from 17 42 to 33 20 t ha 1 in 2017 and 8 98 27 18 t ha 1 in 2018 these differences in red pepper yield among the treatments were significant p 0 01 for both years fruit yield results separated six groups rwhs1 rwhs2 rwhs3 dfs1 dfs2 dfs3 in 2017 and four groups rwhs1 rwhs2 rwhs3 dfs1 dfs2 dfs3 in 2018 according to duncan range test rwhs1 treatment which had 100 cm plastic covered ridge and 80 cm furrow widths produced maximum red pepper yields 33 2 and 27 19 t ha 1 in both years as plastic covered ridge width increased red pepper yield decreased because of decreasing plant density as seen in fig 7 plant row distance had no apparent effect on red pepper fruit yield for dfs the conventional dry farming treatments were in the same yield group dfs2 and dfs3 produced the minimum red pepper yields 17 4 t ha 1 and 18 3 t ha 1 in 2017 and the dfs treatments 10 92 9 81 and 8 98 t ha 1 in 2018 rwhs1 increased red pepper fruit yield by 68 in 2017 and by 149 in 2018 3 5 yield quality parameters fig 8 shows fruit length fruit diameter skin thickness and soluble solids as fruit quality parameters as seen in fig 8a red pepper fruit length percent of fruits longer and shorter than 125 mm showed significant differences in both experimental years although higher fruit yield in 2017 fruit percent less than 125 mm was also higher for all the treatments as seen in fig 8a longer fruit percent was higher in 2018 except for dfs1 and dfs2 treatments longer red pepper fruit percent was maximum for rwhs2 and minimum for dfs2 in 2017 in the second year longer fruit percent was considerably lower for dfs1 and dfs2 while that percentage was higher for all rainwater harvesting treatments and dfs3 it can be concluded that the rainwater harvesting treatments had positively affected the longer red pepper fruit ratio it should be in mind that a longer red pepper fruit ratio is essential for marketing red pepper fruit diameter varied between 40 2 and 62 0 mm in 2017 and 50 0 71 7 mm in 2018 these differences in fruit diameter were found significant for both years rwhs1 produced the maximum fruit diameter and dfs3 the minimum ones in 2017 although fruit diameters were greater in rainwater harvesting treatments than in rain fed or dry farming treatments fruit diameter decreased with increasing plant row distance for rainwater harvesting and conventional rain fed farming treatments in 2018 fruit diameters for all the treatments were higher than those in 2017 as seen in fig 8b red pepper fruit diameter separates into two distinctive statistical groups fruits with greater diameter in the rainwater harvesting treatments and fruits with a smaller diameter in the dry farming treatments it can be concluded that rainwater harvesting improved red pepper fruit diameter fruit skin thickness and soluble solids content of peppers harvested from rwhs and dfs treatments are presented in fig 8c and d respectively the maximum fruit skin thickness was 4 68 mm in 2017 and 6 10 mm in 2018 for rwhs maximum solids content ratios were obtained from dfs for both years while minimum ones were obtained from rwhs treatments the differences in fruit skin thickness and soluble solids content were significant p 0 01 for both years 3 6 crop water productivity net income and financial efficiency crop water productivity ranged from 10 45 to 20 20 kg m 3 in 2017 and from 6 50 to 20 21 kg m 3 in 2018 table 7 the differences in wpc were found significant p 0 01 for both years maximum wpc ratios 20 20 kg m 3 and 20 21 kg m 3 were obtained from rwhs1 for both years while minimum ones 10 45 11 65 kg m 3 and 6 50 7 50 kg m 3 were obtained from dfs treatments input costs net income nic and financial efficiency results were also presented in tables 7 and 8 rwhs had higher input costs because of ridge construction polyethylene cover and covering costs all the treatments in 2017 were earned income due to red pepper farming in rainfed conditions while only rwhs1 and rwhs2 supplied income in 2018 the red pepper yield and the income were negatively affected by low rainfall and higher eto in 2018 the income could not compensate for production costs in the second year under the dry farming system and rwhs3 financial efficiency fe values were changed between 2 11 m 3 and 0 10 m 3 in 2017 and between 1 40 m 3 and 0 59 m 3 in 2018 maximum fe values were obtained from rwhs1 because of red pepper yield reductions in 2018 fe was below zero except rwhs1 and rwhs2 4 discussion 4 1 precipitation and surface runoff although higher rainfall amounts occurred in the experimental years the rainfall amounts in the red pepper growing season were lower the rainfall pattern in the red pepper growing seasons was another noticeable difference between the two years the significant rain amounts fell around the beginning of the red pepper growth season in 2017 but the late of the growth period in 2018 all these differences in rainfall are very crucial for both red pepper growth and yield as seen in fig 2 the dry period generally occurred at the mid season of the red pepper contrary to long term precipitation records nearly 60 days of no rainless term was observed in 2017 which indicated the strength of the red pepper to dry spells therefore pre season and after season precipitations which replenish soil moisture storage have played an essential role in coping with dry spells in the region besides rainfall amount the rainfall pattern along the red pepper growth period is also essential for plant growth and yield the pepper is more susceptible to water stress in flowering and fruit settings dagdelen et al 2004 the threshold rainfall amount is the minimum amount that generates runoff from the water harvesting area yazar et al 2014 according to the model in fig 3 sr 3 667 7 587 crr 0 985 p the rainfall amount that makes the runoff zero is the threshold for different cover ratios therefore precipitation amounts lower than 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 mm did not cause runoff for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 respectively the model can estimate threshold values for other plastic covered ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting techniques for regions with similar rainfall and climatic characteristics in 2017 a total of 31 rainfall events occurred along the red pepper growing season table 4 in the first year 7 12 and 13 precipitation events below these threshold values did not produce runoff for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 treatments in 2018 29 rainfall events occurred and rainfall events below the threshold were 10 for rwhs1 and 15 for both rwhs2 and rwhs3 total rainfall amounts below the threshold values were 1 8 5 2 and 6 8 mm in 2017 and 2 6 6 2 and 6 2 mm in 2018 for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 respectively this runoff model can estimate the amount of harvested water from rwhs treatments when it rains above that threshold the runoff model should be run for individual rainfall events separately and not to be applied to total monthly or annual precipitation li et al 2000 used rainfall mm as an input to find runoff from a 60 cm covered ridge and offered a linear regression equation r 0 98 p 0 8 0 2 as rainfall amounts increased the runoff efficiency increased due to reducing the ratios of the thresholds mean runoff efficiencies of the rainfall in the red pepper growing season for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 were 0 90 0 88 and 0 85 in 2017 and were 0 91 0 90 and 0 88 in 2018 respectively it can be concluded that increasing polyethylene covered ridge width enhanced the threshold rainwater amount and declined the runoff efficiency from the covered ridge li et al 2000 found 0 8 0 2 mm threshold rainwater value for 60 cm covered ridge width and found runoff efficiency as 0 87 for plastic covered ridge and 0 07 for the uncovered ridge runoff efficiency of ridges covered by the plastic film was reported between 0 911 and 0 943 and the threshold between 0 23 and 0 47 mm by wang et al 2008 for 30 60 ridge widths the difference in threshold rainfall amounts and runoff coefficients may result from cover material ridge shape width and slope and rainfall characters 4 2 soil moisture and plant water consumption soil moisture of the rwhs s treatments differed from dfs treatments soil moisture fig 4 soil moisture along the growing season in 2017 for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 was higher by 6 20 3 84 and 4 26 than dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 compared to dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 treatments 6 45 4 76 and 6 58 higher soil moisture for rwhs1 rwhs2 and rwhs3 were determined in 2018 the plastic covered ridge inhibited soil moisture evaporation and contributed to higher soil moisture conditions for the rainwater harvesting treatments when the soil has moisture content below critical moisture which defined moisture level that plants begin to experience water stress between field capacity and wilting point plants extract soil water more easily from higher soil moisture conditions james 1988 doorenbos and kassam 1986 allen et al 1998 therefore the plant under higher soil moisture conditions would experience lower water stress and grow better this study s moisture findings agree with fan et al 2019 and li et al 2019 who reported that soil water content was highest for ridge furrow water harvesting zhao et al 2014 found higher soil water content at 20 cm depth in the plastic mulch ridge planting than conventional ridge planting saleh and ayed 2009 indicated that soil water contents were higher in the terrace and semi circular micro catchment treatments than in control yıldırım et al 2017 also reported slightly higher soil moisture for melon and watermelon grown in the plastic covered ridge treatments than ones in the conventional rainfed farming under semiarid vezirköprü conditions in turkey li et al 2006 stated that soil moisture was lower for the trench saucer bare ridge and bare furrow and control treatments than the plastic covered ridge furrow rainwater harvesting treatments for tamarix ramosissima plant from 2002 to 2004 the rainfed farming treatments showed lower soil moisture than the plastic covered ridge furrow rainwater harvesting because of excessive evaporation from the bare soil surface under semiarid conditions in turkey for chickpea ünlükara and katırcı 2018 mean water consumptions of rwhs and conventional dry farming treatments were 166 mm and 171 mm in 2017 and 125 mm and 142 mm in 2018 respectively although quantitatively fewer eta values were determined in rwhs treatments for two experimental years due to runoff efficiency and threshold rainfall of polyethylene cover the difference in eta between rwhs and dfs was not significant in the same region red pepper consumed 294 mm with 377 mm rainfall and 163 mm with 177 mm rainfall under rain fed conditions for two consecutive years by köksal et al 2017 red pepper water consumption increased by applying irrigation water and reached 472 and 508 mm under full irrigation conditions for those years in bafra plain köksal et al 2017 under full irrigation conditions red pepper consumes 420 mm water for bafra plain in turkey s plant water consumption guide anonymous 2016b however considerably higher red pepper water consumption under complete irrigation conditions occurred in the other regions of turkey for example dagdelen et al 2004 reported 700 818 mm sezen et al 2019 reported 809 824 mm şen 2015 reported 1189 1240 mm kuşçu et al 2016 reported 645 792 mm sezen et al 2015 reported 928 980 mm for furrow irrigation and 809 824 mm for drip irrigation and demirel et al 2012 reported 736 855 mm production potential under rain fed conditions and relatively lower water consumption of red pepper under the blacksea region make it one of the favorite plants for ridge furrow rainwater harvesting techniques fig 9 presents crop water stress indexes of the treatment along the growing seasons of the red pepper mean cwsi along the growing season of the red pepper for rwhs1 rwhs2 rwhs3 dfs1 dfs2 and dfs3 were determined as 0 73 0 74 0 71 0 96 0 97 and 0 97 in 2017 in 2018 cwsi were found as 0 47 0 48 0 50 0 82 0 74 and 0 77 for the same order of the treatments mean cwsi s for rwhs were 24 5 and 38 2 lower than for dfs in the first and second year of the experiment respectively as seen in fig 9 rwhs treatments cwsi lines lined below the cwsi lines of rainfed treatments during both the experimental years sezen et al 2014 reported that increased water stress caused increases in cwsi values of the red pepper therefore lower cwsi indicated that the red pepper under rwhs treatments exposed less water stress than the rainfed treatments because of higher soil moisture and lower evaporation losts the pepper plants under rwhs used much water than dfs by transpiration sezen et al 2014 found threshold cwsi as 0 26 for drip irrigated red pepper and 0 38 for furrow irrigated red pepper in the mediterranean region of turkey the threshold cwsi value for the fruit ripening period of the red pepper was between 0 5 and 0 7 in the black sea region of turkey artık et al 2013 4 3 plant growth parameters based on the red pepper plant height and the total leaf area findings it can be concluded that the red pepper grew more vigor under rwhs higher soil moisture and lower cwsi in rwhs treatments had favored plant growth similarly ünlükara et al 2021 reported that polyethylene covered ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting techniques increased leaf area for pumpkin under a semiarid region sezen et al 2014 reported negative relationships between cwsi and lai for red pepper irrigated by drip and furrow irrigation systems consequently the plant with higher lai would have higher photosynthesis possibility and production capacity 4 4 yield parameters rwhs1 increased red pepper fruit yield by 68 in 2017 and by 149 in 2018 rwhs2 caused increases by 46 in 2017 and by 96 in 2018 and rwhs3 by 25 in 2017 and by 64 in 2018 therefore the plastic mulched ridge and furrow micro catchment water harvesting system greatly enhanced red pepper yield under rain fed areas of the black sea region of turkey sezen et al 2014 found negative relationships between red pepper yield and cwsi lower cwsi in rwhs improved both the red pepper growth and yield rwhs1 produced maximum fruit yield because of the most excellent fruit yield per plant and maximum plant density per hectare as plant density decreased under rwhs fruit yield per plant and fruit yield per hectare declined while plant density did not affect fruit yield in control treatments mean fruit yield 22 84 t ha 1 in 2017 was higher than the one obtained 15 14 t ha 1 in 2018 lower rainfall in 2018 and higher atmospheric evaporative demand eto reduced the overall fruit yield of the experiment table 6 and fig 7 mean fruit yields of rwhs were 27 2 t ha 1 in 2017 and 20 4 t ha 1 in 2018 while mean fruit yields of dfs were 18 49 t ha 1 and 9 91 t ha 1 respectively hardened atmospheric conditions in the second year caused 25 yield loss under rwhs and 46 under dfs according to mean fruit yields in the first year red pepper yields such as 32 61 t ha 1 and 42 43 t ha 1 köksal et al 2017 31 01 t ha 1 dagdelen et al 2004 and 46 t ha 1 sezen et al 2015 were reported from different regions of turkey for full irrigation conditions köksal et al 2017 reported 16 43 t ha 1 red pepper yield with 294 mm water consumption and 19 32 t ha 1 red pepper yield with 163 mm water consumption under rain fed conditions bafra plain where our experiment was conducted our experiment s mean red pepper water consumption in 2017 168 mm was around the second year s value reported by köksal et al 2017 this situation allowed us more convenient comparisons along with the results mean red pepper fruit yield was 18 50 t ha 1 for dfs treatments nearly similar to the second year s yield results 19 32 t ha 1 of köksal et al 2017 in bafra plain however the mean fruit yield of the red pepper under the rwhs technique 27 2 t ha 1 was higher than that fruit yield obtained by köksal et al 2017 under rain fed treatment conventionally 4 5 yield quality parameters fruit quality was observed an increase with the falling precipitation during flowering and fruit formation in 2018 therefore longer fruit percent fruit skin thickness fruit diameter were obtained higher than in 2017 similar to our results köksal et al 2017 sezen et al 2015 and sezen et al 2014 reported that water stress significantly affects red pepper fruit quality a study conducted by sung et al 2005 using three hot pepper populations in taiwan showed that the plants under water stress had small fruits and köksal et al 2017 demirel et al 2012 and cosic et al 2015 reported similar results for water stressed red peppers fruit skin thickness was the lowest for the conventional planting control treatments in 2017 and 2018 when significant differences in all treatments the relationship between red pepper fruit diameter fruit skin thickness and different soil water content by adel et al 2014 was examined and reported a maximum fruit diameter of 3 32 cm for complete irrigation fruit diameter decreased with the limited irrigation similar results were obtained by köksal et al 2017 for the bafra plain of turkey who reported different irrigation strategies for red pepper and a minimum fruit diameter and fruit skin thickness determined for no irrigation treatment these parameters improved with the increasing amount of irrigation water orhangazi 2017 obtained higher soluble solids 7 due to lower water application and lowered soluble solids due to higher water application 4 6 crop water productivity net income and financial efficiency rwhs1 improved wpc by 74 in 2017 and by 169 in 2018 although the red peppers in 2018 experienced lower rainfall and higher atmospheric evaporative demand wpc ratios of rwhs treatments did not decrease but wpc ratios of dfs treatments considerably decreased table 7 similar wpc ratios for conventional rainfed treatments such as 5 6 kg m 3 and 11 9 kg m 3 were reported in the same plain by köksal et al 2017 maximum wpc ratios for red pepper varied from the region to region of turkey for example dagdelen et al 2004 reported 5 12 kg m 3 köksal et al 2017 reported 11 9 kg m 3 sezen et al 2019 reported 7 5 kg m 3 şen 2015 reported 4 35 kg m 3 kuşçu et al 2016 reported 8 08 kg m 3 sezen et al 2015 reported 7 5 kg m 3 and demirel et al 2012 reported 8 65 kg m 3 therefore the highest wpc ratios of turkey were attained with rwhs for red pepper in this study wang et al 2008 reported 1 50 and 1 62 times higher potato water productivity for ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting depending on the ridge furrow ratios and cover material than conventional rainfed treatments in a dry semiarid region of china rwhs also improved water productivity of maize sweet sorghum watermelon foxtail millet and wheat li et al 2001 mo et al 2016 wang et al 2009 2011 zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2018 higher fruit yield and quality in rwhs compensated for the higher input cost because of polyethylene material and its covering rwhs1 and rwhs2 supplied sufficient net income for both years and they had higher financial efficiencies than the other treatments therefore this result means that sustainable red pepper farming under a rainfed area in the region would not be possible unless using a suitable plastic covered ridge and furrow micro catchment rainwater harvesting system such as rwhs1 rwhs1 brought 3488 3 and 1888 7 incomes per hectare in both years like our results köksal et al 2017 found nic 3928 8 and 3447 4 ha 1 for red pepper under rainfed conditions in bafra plain they reported 4143 0 and 8236 5 ha 1 net incomes under full irrigation conditions in a two year study köksal et al 2017 exposed the red pepper to different irrigation water ratios and found fe values between 1 3 0 9 m 3 in 2010 and between 2 1 1 6 m 3 in 2011 the red pepper with 472 mm and 508 mm water consumptions under full irrigation maximized net income per m3 water in bafra plain köksal et al 2017 higher fe values 2 11 and 140 m 3 under rwhs1 resulted from higher crop water productivity ratios 20 20 and 20 21 kg m 3 5 conclusions this two year field study compared plastic covered ridge and furrow micro catchment rainwater harvesting system rwhs to conventional rainfed system dfs for red pepper cultivation under semi humid bafra plain conditions black sea region of turkey the differences in soil moisture plant water consumption plant growth yield and yield quality water use efficiency net income and financial efficiency terms were compared for rwhs and dfs rainwater harvesting properties such as runoff efficiencies and threshold rainfall amounts of rwhs treatments were investigated a relationship was developed considering rainfall amount and covered ridge ratio as independent parameters as increased plastic covered ridge width threshold rainfall amount which was the minimum limit for runoff increased from 0 6 mm for 1 0 m covered ridge width to 1 2 mm for 1 4 m covered ridge width however runoff efficiency decreased from 0 90 to 0 85 maximum red pepper yields 33 2 and 27 19 t ha 1 were derived from the rwhs1 treatment with 100 cm plastic covered ridge and 80 cm furrow widths in both years therefore the plastic mulched ridge and furrow micro catchment water harvesting system greatly enhanced red pepper yield under rain fed areas of the black sea region of turkey as increasing covered ridge width the fruit yield increment ratio decreases because of lower plant density fruit yield in 2017 was higher because of higher rainfall and lower atmospheric evaporative demand the mean fruit yield decreased by 25 for the rainwater harvesting system and by 46 for the conventional dry farming system in 2018 due to lower rainfall and higher atmospheric evaporative demand therefore it can be concluded that the red pepper grown under the plastic mulched ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system presented higher strength to drought than ones grown under conventional rain fed farming lower cwsi was observed under the rainwater harvesting system although nearly similar water consumptions occurred under rwhs and dfs the plastic covered ridges reduced evaporation from the soil surface and improved transpiration compared to the conventional rainfed higher transpiration ratio and lower crop water stress enhanced plant growth and yield 1 0 m plastic covered ridge supplied adequate net incomes for red pepper in both years of the experiment in contrast net income was negative or lower under the rainfed farming system therefore sustainable red pepper farming would not be possible under a rainfed farming system in the region unless using a suitable plastic covered ridge furrow micro catchment rainwater harvesting system turkey s highest crop water productivity for red pepper was obtained under the rainwater harvesting consisting of a 1 0 m plastic covered ridge and a 0 8 m furrow width the improved crop water productivity and higher net income under this rainwater harvesting technique enhanced financial efficiency per consumed cubic meter of water the remarkable yield increases under the mulched ridge and furrow micro catchment rainwater harvesting system could only be explained by preventing evaporation losses from stored soil moisture and enhancing plant transpiration satisfactory net income and higher water productivity of red pepper under plastic covered ridge and furrow micro catchment rainwater harvesting system make it one of the favorite plants for rainfed farming in the semi humid blacksea region of turkey declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
