24585,the ecohydraulic modeling framework in ecological systems includes hydro morphodynamic habitat and population models in this paper we proposed an ecohydraulic modeling framework that combines numerical methods and ecological theories to explore the dynamics and interplay between fluvial processes in rivers and the quality of physical habitat and density distribution for fish the practicality of applying the developed system to ecohydraulics modeling was explored through three case studies and compared with as well as validated using observed data on the basis of the calculated results the model system was proven to be efficient in describing population dynamics of the european grayling thymallus thymallus l in the aare river in switzerland satisfactory predictions of the long term population evolution of the rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss brown trout salmo trutta and flannelmouth sucker catostomus latipinnis in the colorado river in the united states us were obtained furthermore the effects of da wei power plant construction on the jiao mu river in china on the schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma fish species were investigated the efficiency of fish stocking strategies was evaluated and optimal fish stocking numbers were proposed the resulting ecohydraulic modeling framework provided very promising results which highlighted the fundamental role of the temporal variability of hydro morphological parameters in structuring populations of fish species using the ecohydraulic modeling framework to simulate

symposium at the international congress on the biology of fish in 2010 katopodis 2012 in the us and canada ecohydraulics issues about fish habitat connectivity and suitability are attracting significant attention and are particularly popular with the us geological survey usgs the institute of ecology the institute of ecosystem and fish management authorities conway et al 2010 palmer et al 2010 silva et al 2011 the goal of this paper is to propose an ecohydraulic modeling framework to assess hydro morphodynamic processes the quality of fish habitat and fish population status the proposed framework aims to dynamically assess fish habitat quality population numbers and density fluctuations it was applied along with six fish species to the aare river switzerland the colorado river usa and the jiao mu river china 2 study areas and methods 2 1 study areas and aquatic fauna in this study three different scale study areas are presented which cover three rivers and six selected fish species fig 1 in case i the aare river in switzerland was chosen as a study river and european grayling thymallus thymallus l was selected as the target fish species the aare is a 1 35 km long river stretch located downstream of lake thun n46 45 e7 38 the width ranges from 70 to 200 m with a 45 meter wide tributary downstream of the computational domain the fish population numbers were surveyed from 1970 to 2000 which showed that the european grayling has among the largest populations the european grayling was divided into nine life stages in the aare river ingram et al 2000 in case ii the colorado river in the us n 35 30 to n 37 0 w 111 30 to w114 00 was chosen and three fish species were selected as target species rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss brown trout salmo trutta and flannelmouth sucker catostomus latipinnis the life stages of the three fish species were divided into 14 based on fish length the colorado river is an important fish management area conservationists have set up long term fish monitoring in the river recording fish numbers as well as fish length data from 2000 to 2009 makinster et al 2010 2011 in case iii the jiao mu river in china n32 00 e102 02 was chosen as the study river and schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma were selected as the target fish species the life stages of these two fish species are eight and six respectively the computational domain in case iii is a 20 km stretch of river that is 90 to 300 m wide with a relatively fragile ecological status the schizothorax schizothorax is the species with the largest population and the schizothorax racoma is the species that is most endangered li et al 2012 2 2 model frameworks in this study following the ecohydraulic modeling concepts an ecohydraulic modeling framework was proposed and applied to hydraulic engineering problems the modeling framework comprised three models 1 the hydro morphodynamic model 2 the selected target fish species habitat evaluation model based on suitability index curves si curves and variables calculated from the hydro morphodynamic model and 3 the population model which was used to simulate and predict population density and fluctuation in the number of fish species this modeling framework enabled hydraulic process study habitat quality assessment and population status evaluation the main frameworks used to establish the ecohydraulic modeling framework are presented in fig 2 and the methodology is presented as follows the continuity equation is written as 1 h t u h x v h y 0 and the two horizontal momentum equations for the x and y component respectively 2 u t u u x v u y g η x 1 h h τ x x x h τ x y y τ b x ρ h f c o r v 3 v t u v x v v y g η y 1 h h τ y x x h τ y y y τ b y ρ h f

transport processes the hydrodynamic process is based on shallow water equations the sediment transport process is based on transporting sediment particles bed load and suspended load the sediment transport depends on the size of the bed material particles and the flow conditions van rijn 1984 riadh et al 2014 the hydro morphodynamic model is mainly focused on calculating velocity water depth shear stress bed load suspended load riverbed deformation and riverbed grain size distribution such as main grain size diameters and grain size fractions a multiple layer based hydro morphodynamic

habitat approach is particularly useful for dam construction analyzing ecological impacts caused by long term river management determining the suitable ecological discharge range evaluating the influence on surrounding environments and analyzing how dam construction changes the status of fish habitat huang et al 2010 ligon et al 1995 zhang et al 2016 yao 2016 habitat models have been regarded as the reliable method at present and are used to predict hsi habitat distribution map wua osi hsp msp and lsp yao 2016 habitat models based on si curves are presented as follows 12 h s i i 3

i 1 m h s i a i 0 7 i 1 m a i 100 where the lsp is the low suitability percentage msp is the middle suitability percentage and hsp is the high suitability percentage the population model was designed to allow a better understanding of how complex processes are responsible for growth or decay when populations interact modeling dynamic interactions in nature can provide a manageable way for understanding how population numbers change over time ecological population modeling is concerned with the population number size aquatic age distribution and density variations the modeling framework included two types of population models logistic and matrix the scope of these models is different the logistic population model can only be used to predict the fluctuation of the total population number and density distribution in the matrix population model it is also possible to predict the changes to population numbers at each stage of life the population model can also be used to evaluate the dam construction effects and aquatic fauna stocking effects on the river the logistic population model 18 p t δ t β w u a t δ t p t e α o s i t δ t o s i t β w u a t δ t p t e α o s i t δ t o s i

modeling framework setup and applications the ecohydraulic modeling framework setup needs to define the hydro morphodynamic habitat and population modeling options based on the case study requirements the hydro morphodynamic model encompasses three modules a hydrodynamic module a sediment transport module and a morphological evolution module the population model is made up of a logistic population model and a matrix population model after the ecohydraulic modeling framework was setup the boundary condition and mesh independence analysis were also completed fig 3 shows the flowchart for the three case studies in case i three modules in the hydro morphodynamic model were applied in the aare river the si curves habitat suitability model was also applied for habitat computation both the logistic and matrix population models were used to predict the european grayling number and density distribution the simulation time in case i ranged from 1970 to 2000 in case ii five subareas in the colorado river were chosen to represent the entire stretch of the river and three modules in the hydro morphodynamic model were used to simulate the hydrodynamic parameters the si curves habitat model and two types of population models were chosen to predict rainbow trout brown trout and flannelmouth sucker habitat as well as the population status from 2000 to 2009 the fish monitoring data in those five subareas was also used to verify the fish number fluctuation case iii used scenarios of natural flow dam construction and optimal fish stocking the first and second scenarios were simulated using the hydro morphodynamic model and habitat model all three scenarios were predicted by the population model the schizothorax schizothorax and schizothorax racoma population number age structure and density distribution were also predicted by the population model in the natural flow scenario only the hydrodynamic module in the hydro morphodynamic model si curves habitat model and matrix population model were applied in the scenarios with dam construction and optimal fish stocking the three modules in the hydro morphodynamic model si curves and matrix population model were applied the simulation time in case iii was 10 years 3 results 3 1 case i ecohydraulic modeling framework application in the aare river fig 4 shows the simulated velocities water depths and riverbed substrates distribution map from 1970 to 2000 significant differences were noted near the middle stream and outlet areas for velocity in 1980 the maximum velocity near the outlet of the aare river was 1 8 m s the water depth substrate and european grayling habitat distributions remained largely unchanged the most unsuitable hsi values were those in the tributary of the aare river the outlet and the mid length of the river stretch the hsi values for the rest of the domain resulted in a value of approximately 0 5 fig 5 shows the simulated european grayling fish numbers based on logistic and matrix population models for the simulation result based on the logistic population model the european grayling number was highly consistent with the caught fish numbers with only a few data from the survey was not in the prediction range even when the time step was increased significantly the simulated fish number was consistent with the caught fish number for the simulation result based on matrix population model there was only a slight difference between the simulated and surveyed fish numbers for all nine life stages a consistently decreasing trend was observed from the first to ninth life stages as shown in fig 5 d the fish numbers in the first life stage constituted a large proportion of the entire european grayling population the european grayling density distribution map was calculated based on both the logistic and matrix population models fig 6 1 as shown in the figure based on the logistic population model high fish density values were observed in a large area of the computational domain except in the areas near the inlet tributary and mid length of the river the maximum fish density for the european grayling was 55 fish per mesh cell in 1970 decreasing to 25 fish per mesh cell in 1980 to 15 fish per mesh cell in 1990 and finally dropping to 10 fish per mesh cell in 2000 2 by applying the matrix population model maps were drawn showing the density during all nine life stages for the european grayling the total number of fish distribution maps is similar to the results based on the logistic population model except for a small region near the middle length of the river the maximum fish density value was 85 fish per mesh cell in 1970 with the highest density along the river bank region the density distribution trend in 1980 was similar to that in 1970 but the maximum population density declined to 35 fish per mesh cell in 1980 the maximum fish density further decreased to 10 fish per mesh cell in 1990 and seven fish per mesh cell in 2000 trends were similar for the first and second life stage of fish density distribution only the maximum fish densities were different 3 2 case ii ecohydraulic modeling framework application in the colorado river in case ii based on the logistic population model the rainbow trout brown trout and flannelmouth sucker simulated fish numbers in the entire colorado river were consistent with the surveyed fish numbers established by the united states geological survey usgs fig 7 1 the highest number of rainbow trout in a survey was reported in 2009 with a value of 62 the number of rainbow trout surveyed declined from 2000 to 2006 and increased thereafter from 2008 to 2009 the number increased dramatically the population numbers for the stimulated rainbow trout showed exactly the same trend as for the surveyed trout 2 in contrast to the rainbow trout numbers which fluctuated from 2000 to 2009 both the surveyed and simulated brown trout numbers decreased during the simulation 3 in contrast to the brown trout the number for both the surveyed and simulated flannelmouth suckers increased from 2000 to 2009 using the matrix population model numbers were obtained for the populations at each life stage the total fish population numbers for the three selected fish species are shown in figs 7 b d f the population numbers for the rainbow trout brown trout and flannelmouth sucker are consistent with the numbers for the three surveyed variations of fish number for each life stage comparison based on the matrix population model the agreement between the simulation and the surveyed fish data is not high fig 8 this may have occured because the empirical parameter settings in the matrix population model were not particularly suitable for these three fish species another possible explanation is that the surveyed fish data could not correctly represent the real fish age structure overall despite the differences between the simulated and surveyed results the ecohydraulic modeling framework has proven to be quite valuable in case studies 3 3 case iii ecohydraulic modeling framework application in the jiao mu river fig 9 shows that the habitat quality for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti is better than the habitat quality for schizothorax racoma in the natural flow and dam construction scenarios meanwhile the hsp values also show that the schizothorax schizothorax prenanti are better than schizothorax racoma for schizothorax racoma the hsp values are scattered along the river stretch the main reason that the habitat suitability conditions for schizothorax racoma were so poor appears to be the water depth which overrode the role of velocity and substrates the detailed schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma habitat qualities have been carried out as per the hsp msp and lsp in the scenario without dam construction the mean values of hsp msp and lsp for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti were kept at levels of 0 60 0 03 and 0 37 respectively meanwhile the corresponding values for schizothorax racoma were kept at levels of 0 46 0 17 and 0 37 respectively in the scenario with the dam construction effects the hsp decreased from 0 6 to 0 14 for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and the hsp decreased from 0 46 to 0 03 for schizothorax racoma however the lsp increased from 0 37 to 0 82 for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and the lsp increased from 0 37 to 0 91 for schizothorax racoma fig 10 the matrix population model was applied to predict all eight life stages of schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and six life stages of schizothorax racoma population numbers and the population density distribution map in a scenario of natural flow the total schizothorax schizothorax prenanti number remained stable at a level of 7 1 105 and the number distribution for all eight life stages also remained unchanged at all simulation times meanwhile the schizothorax racoma had a stable total population level with a value of 2 5 104 and the first year fish numbers were also much higher than other fish life stage numbers with a value of 2 37 104 the distribution for a six life stage numbers was also associated with a consistently stable value during the simulation in the construction scenario schizothorax schizothorax prenanti total fish numbers showed a decreasing trend with the number 7 3 105 in the first year decreasing to 7 105 in the 10th year the schizothorax racoma population showed a significant downward trend with the number decreasing from 2 6 104 in the first year to 5 4 102 in the 10th year the early life stages schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma numbers decreased faster than the number for the other life stages when the fish stocking strategy based on the ecohyraulic modeling framework was applied the most suitable fish stocking number for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma were 1 0 105 and 2 0 104 with the fish stocking number both target fish could be recovered to the natural level fig 11 fig 12 shows the schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma population density distribution in scenarios natural flow with dam construction effects and with fish stocking the schizothorax schizothorax prenanti density values were higher than the schizothorax racoma density values in all three scenarios both fish species densities were constant in the natural flow scenario and showed a decreasing trend in the dam construction scenario during the simulation in the scenario with the fish stocking both fish species density values could be recovered to a stable level the schizothorax schizothorax prenanti density values even showed a slight increase the maximum density for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma was 450 and 50 fish per mesh cell respectively the optimal fish stocking numbers were 1 0 105 per year and 2 0 104 per year for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma respectively 4 discussion 4 1 modeling framework analysis in the aare river case i both the logistic and matrix population models can accurately simulate changes in european grayling numbers and trends in fish population distribution in addition when comparing simulated results and caught fish numbers the correlation coefficients between predicted and observed results are in reasonable agreement for both the logistic and the matrix population models more specifically the european grayling numbers for all age classes and the fish density distributions can be simulated at each month for the logistic and each year for the matrix population models the matrix population model provided fish age structure status the fish age structure data is extremely important for the case study with dam construction effects and fish stocking effects zhang et al 2016 arlinghaus et al 2016 in case i there are several options for restoring the european grayling population one option is fish stocking which has been considered a useful population restoration strategy in many rivers forbes et al 2016 yao 2016 in addition it is important to identify the european grayling spawning site and use the ecohydraullic modeling framework to assess the most possible successful river management in order to effectively enhance the fish habitat and recover the fish population fu et al 2007 both the fish stocking strategy and the post effects of it can be identified and quantified by the ecohydraulic modeling framework yao 2016 4 2 modeling framework analysis in the colorado river case ii in case ii both the logistic and matrix population models have reasonable simulation accuracy both models indicate that the rainbow trout population numbers decreased from 2000 to 2007 and that the population numbers increased from 2000 to 2009 the brown trout population numbers decreased steadily while the flannelmouth sucker population number increased slightly in this case study the logistic population model performed better than the matrix population model case ii shows that the ecohydraulic modeling framework provides valuable information for river and fish population management however a considerable amount of work is needed to collect data validate the ecohydraulic modeling framework this is because precise and tested empirical parameters are critical for the successful performance of the ecohydraulic modeling framework 4 3 modeling framework analysis in the jiao mu river case iii in case iii the ecohydraulic modeling framework was shown to be essential to protect and maintain the jiao mu river ecosystem as well as to evaluate the effects of the da wei dam construction the modeling framework was used to simulate the qualities of habitat for both schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma along with variations in fish density and changes to pupulation numbers and the structure if the age if the fish based on the framework the optimal fish stocking number with the matrix population model for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma were respectively 1 105 and 2 104 per year however if the logistic population model was applied in case iii the fish stocking number would have been different yao 2016 this is because the scope of these two models is different the logistic population model can only be used to predict the fluctuation of the total population number in the matrix population model it is possible to predict the population number changes at each life stage the stocking sensitivity analyses were considered in case iii but it s not considered in the case i and case ii there was no surveyed data to calibrate the case iii this is because the dam construction was expected to be completed in 2022 the long term fish monitoring program was intended to monitor the fish abundance it was expected that the modeling framework could be validated using these monitoring data li et al 2012 this ecohydraulic modeling framework provides a basis for further research in case iii and for comparison with monitoring data to assess the success of the river ecosystem management for aquatic fauna 4 4 ecohydraulic modeling framework advantages and limitations the ecohydraulic modeling framework has also been recognized as an increasingly useful tool for successful river management the authors proposed and highlighted the robustness and the importance of the framework in hydro morphodynamic habitat and population status studies of river systems yi et al 2013 applied the hydro morphodynamic and habitat models to the yangtze river to assess the chinese sturgeon spawning sites there by considering the population model in the framework the high hsi values do not mean significant fish abundance in that particular stretch of the river the model application in case i shows that the habitat is stable does not mean the population is stable the biggest advantage of the ecohydraulic modeling framework is that it can simultaneously predict the river s hydro morphodynamic status fish habitat and fish abundance status the framework can also quantify and qualify the ecological influence of dam construction optimal fish stocking strategies and reservoir management moreover the framework is accurate and provides extremely robust multiple options for model applications several aspects of the modeling framework can be improved including the accuracy in the hydro morphodynamic model methods such as a support vector machine svm could be applied the si curves and the combination of si could also be more precise the empirical parameter in the population model could be more accurate however the accumulation of long term monitoring data means that these drawbacks can be reduced or even disappeared meanwhile the significant testing and the agreement between the surveyed data and prediction mean that the robustness and accuracy of the modeling framework predictions can be accept with confidence 5 conclusions this study proposed a robust ecohydraulic modeling framework and investigated the feasibility of using it to quantify hydro morphodynamic habitat and population status in sections of three different rivers to ensure that it was adequately tested the ecohydraulic modeling framework was used in case studies in switzerland usa and china involving six fish species european grayling thymallus thymallus l rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss brown trout salmo trutta flannelmouth sucker catostomus latipinnis schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma the results are of significant interest for application to other stretches of rivers where there are natural habitat and hydraulic construction this research provides an approach to managing the river ecosystem it can be used as an optimal tool for planning and better operation of water resources without damaging the freshwater aquatic fauna ecosystem credit authorship contribution statement weiwei

24585,the ecohydraulic modeling framework in ecological systems includes hydro morphodynamic habitat and population models in this paper we proposed an ecohydraulic modeling framework that combines numerical methods and ecological theories to explore the dynamics and interplay between fluvial processes in rivers and the quality of physical habitat and density distribution for fish the practicality of applying the developed system to ecohydraulics modeling was explored through three case studies and compared with as well as validated using observed data on the basis of the calculated results the model system was proven to be efficient in describing population dynamics of the european grayling thymallus thymallus l in the aare river in switzerland satisfactory predictions of the long term population evolution of the rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss brown trout salmo trutta and flannelmouth sucker catostomus latipinnis in the colorado river in the united states us were obtained furthermore the effects of da wei power plant construction on the jiao mu river in china on the schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma fish species were investigated the efficiency of fish stocking strategies was evaluated and optimal fish stocking numbers were proposed the resulting ecohydraulic modeling framework provided very promising results which highlighted the fundamental role of the temporal variability of hydro morphological parameters in structuring populations of fish species using the ecohydraulic modeling framework to simulate

of application and have been recommended as an effective tool to predict and protect fish populations harvey et al 2009 ecohydraulic approaches have been accepted by many relevant organizations and

symposium at the international congress on the biology of fish in 2010 katopodis 2012 in the us and canada ecohydraulics issues about fish habitat connectivity and suitability are attracting significant attention and are particularly popular with the us geological survey usgs the institute of ecology the institute of ecosystem and fish management authorities conway et al 2010 palmer et al 2010 silva et al 2011 the goal of this paper is to propose an ecohydraulic modeling framework to assess hydro morphodynamic processes the quality of fish habitat and fish population status the proposed framework aims to dynamically assess fish habitat quality population numbers and density fluctuations it was applied along with six fish species to the aare river switzerland the colorado river usa and the jiao mu river china 2 study areas and methods 2 1 study areas and aquatic fauna in this study three different scale study areas are presented which cover three rivers and six selected fish species fig 1 in case i the aare river in switzerland was chosen as a study river and european grayling thymallus thymallus l was selected as the target fish species the aare is a 1 35 km long river stretch located downstream of lake thun n46 45 e7 38 the width ranges from 70 to 200 m with a 45 meter wide tributary downstream of the computational domain the fish population numbers were surveyed from 1970 to 2000 which showed that the european grayling has among the largest populations the european grayling was divided into nine life stages in the aare river ingram et al 2000 in case ii the colorado river in the us n 35 30 to n 37 0 w 111 30 to w114 00 was chosen and three fish species were selected as target species rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss brown trout salmo trutta and flannelmouth sucker catostomus latipinnis the life stages of the three fish species were divided into 14 based on fish length the colorado river is an important fish management area conservationists have set up long term fish monitoring in the river recording fish numbers as well as fish length data from 2000 to 2009 makinster et al 2010 2011 in case iii the jiao mu river in china n32 00 e102 02 was chosen as the study river and schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma were selected as the target fish species the life stages of these two fish species are eight and six respectively the computational domain in case iii is a 20 km stretch of river that is 90 to 300 m wide with a relatively fragile ecological status the schizothorax schizothorax is the species with the largest population and the schizothorax racoma is the species that is most endangered li et al 2012 2 2 model frameworks in this study following the ecohydraulic modeling concepts an ecohydraulic modeling framework was proposed and applied to hydraulic engineering problems the modeling framework comprised three models 1 the hydro morphodynamic model 2 the selected target fish species habitat evaluation model based on suitability index curves si curves and variables calculated from the hydro morphodynamic model and 3 the population model which was used to simulate and predict population density and fluctuation in the number of fish species this modeling framework enabled hydraulic process study habitat quality assessment and population status evaluation the main frameworks used to establish the ecohydraulic modeling framework are presented in fig 2 and the methodology is presented as follows the continuity equation is written as 1 h t u h x v h y 0 and the two horizontal momentum equations for the x and y component respectively 2 u t u u x v u y g η x 1 h h τ x x x h τ x y y τ b x ρ h f c o r v 3 v t u v x v v y g η y 1 h h τ y x x h τ y y y τ b y ρ h f

transport processes the hydrodynamic process is based on shallow water equations the sediment transport process is based on transporting sediment particles bed load and suspended load the sediment transport depends on the size of the bed material particles and the flow conditions van rijn 1984 riadh et al 2014 the hydro morphodynamic model is mainly focused on calculating velocity water depth shear stress bed load suspended load riverbed deformation and riverbed grain size distribution such as main grain size diameters and grain size fractions a multiple layer based hydro morphodynamic

habitat approach is particularly useful for dam construction analyzing ecological impacts caused by long term river management determining the suitable ecological discharge range evaluating the influence on surrounding environments and analyzing how dam construction changes the status of fish habitat huang et al 2010 ligon et al 1995 zhang et al 2016 yao 2016 habitat models have been regarded as the reliable method at present and are used to predict hsi habitat distribution map wua osi hsp msp and lsp yao 2016 habitat models based on si curves are presented as follows 12 h s i i 3

i 1 m h s i a i 0 7 i 1 m a i 100 where the lsp is the low suitability percentage msp is the middle suitability percentage and hsp is the high suitability percentage the population model was designed to allow a better understanding of how complex processes are responsible for growth or decay when populations interact modeling dynamic interactions in nature can provide a manageable way for understanding how population numbers change over time ecological population modeling is concerned with the population number size aquatic age distribution and density variations the modeling framework included two types of population models logistic and matrix the scope of these models is different the logistic population model can only be used to predict the fluctuation of the total population number and density distribution in the matrix population model it is also possible to predict the changes to population numbers at each stage of life the population model can also be used to evaluate the dam construction effects and aquatic fauna stocking effects on the river the logistic population model 18 p t δ t β w u a t δ t p t e α o s i t δ t o s i t β w u a t δ t p t e α o s i t δ t o s i

modeling framework setup and applications the ecohydraulic modeling framework setup needs to define the hydro morphodynamic habitat and population modeling options based on the case study requirements the hydro morphodynamic model encompasses three modules a hydrodynamic module a sediment transport module and a morphological evolution module the population model is made up of a logistic population model and a matrix population model after the ecohydraulic modeling framework was setup the boundary condition and mesh independence analysis were also completed fig 3 shows the flowchart for the three case studies in case i three modules in the hydro morphodynamic model were applied in the aare river the si curves habitat suitability model was also applied for habitat computation both the logistic and matrix population models were used to predict the european grayling number and density distribution the simulation time in case i ranged from 1970 to 2000 in case ii five subareas in the colorado river were chosen to represent the entire stretch of the river and three modules in the hydro morphodynamic model were used to simulate the hydrodynamic parameters the si curves habitat model and two types of population models were chosen to predict rainbow trout brown trout and flannelmouth sucker habitat as well as the population status from 2000 to 2009 the fish monitoring data in those five subareas was also used to verify the fish number fluctuation case iii used scenarios of natural flow dam construction and optimal fish stocking the first and second scenarios were simulated using the hydro morphodynamic model and habitat model all three scenarios were predicted by the population model the schizothorax schizothorax and schizothorax racoma population number age structure and density distribution were also predicted by the population model in the natural flow scenario only the hydrodynamic module in the hydro morphodynamic model si curves habitat model and matrix population model were applied in the scenarios with dam construction and optimal fish stocking the three modules in the hydro morphodynamic model si curves and matrix population model were applied the simulation time in case iii was 10 years 3 results 3 1 case i ecohydraulic modeling framework application in the aare river fig 4 shows the simulated velocities water depths and riverbed substrates distribution map from 1970 to 2000 significant differences were noted near the middle stream and outlet areas for velocity in 1980 the maximum velocity near the outlet of the aare river was 1 8 m s the water depth substrate and european grayling habitat distributions remained largely unchanged the most unsuitable hsi values were those in the tributary of the aare river the outlet and the mid length of the river stretch the hsi values for the rest of the domain resulted in a value of approximately 0 5 fig 5 shows the simulated european grayling fish numbers based on logistic and matrix population models for the simulation result based on the logistic population model the european grayling number was highly consistent with the caught fish numbers with only a few data from the survey was not in the prediction range even when the time step was increased significantly the simulated fish number was consistent with the caught fish number for the simulation result based on matrix population model there was only a slight difference between the simulated and surveyed fish numbers for all nine life stages a consistently decreasing trend was observed from the first to ninth life stages as shown in fig 5 d the fish numbers in the first life stage constituted a large proportion of the entire european grayling population the european grayling density distribution map was calculated based on both the logistic and matrix population models fig 6 1 as shown in the figure based on the logistic population model high fish density values were observed in a large area of the computational domain except in the areas near the inlet tributary and mid length of the river the maximum fish density for the european grayling was 55 fish per mesh cell in 1970 decreasing to 25 fish per mesh cell in 1980 to 15 fish per mesh cell in 1990 and finally dropping to 10 fish per mesh cell in 2000 2 by applying the matrix population model maps were drawn showing the density during all nine life stages for the european grayling the total number of fish distribution maps is similar to the results based on the logistic population model except for a small region near the middle length of the river the maximum fish density value was 85 fish per mesh cell in 1970 with the highest density along the river bank region the density distribution trend in 1980 was similar to that in 1970 but the maximum population density declined to 35 fish per mesh cell in 1980 the maximum fish density further decreased to 10 fish per mesh cell in 1990 and seven fish per mesh cell in 2000 trends were similar for the first and second life stage of fish density distribution only the maximum fish densities were different 3 2 case ii ecohydraulic modeling framework application in the colorado river in case ii based on the logistic population model the rainbow trout brown trout and flannelmouth sucker simulated fish numbers in the entire colorado river were consistent with the surveyed fish numbers established by the united states geological survey usgs fig 7 1 the highest number of rainbow trout in a survey was reported in 2009 with a value of 62 the number of rainbow trout surveyed declined from 2000 to 2006 and increased thereafter from 2008 to 2009 the number increased dramatically the population numbers for the stimulated rainbow trout showed exactly the same trend as for the surveyed trout 2 in contrast to the rainbow trout numbers which fluctuated from 2000 to 2009 both the surveyed and simulated brown trout numbers decreased during the simulation 3 in contrast to the brown trout the number for both the surveyed and simulated flannelmouth suckers increased from 2000 to 2009 using the matrix population model numbers were obtained for the populations at each life stage the total fish population numbers for the three selected fish species are shown in figs 7 b d f the population numbers for the rainbow trout brown trout and flannelmouth sucker are consistent with the numbers for the three surveyed variations of fish number for each life stage comparison based on the matrix population model the agreement between the simulation and the surveyed fish data is not high fig 8 this may have occured because the empirical parameter settings in the matrix population model were not particularly suitable for these three fish species another possible explanation is that the surveyed fish data could not correctly represent the real fish age structure overall despite the differences between the simulated and surveyed results the ecohydraulic modeling framework has proven to be quite valuable in case studies 3 3 case iii ecohydraulic modeling framework application in the jiao mu river fig 9 shows that the habitat quality for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti is better than the habitat quality for schizothorax racoma in the natural flow and dam construction scenarios meanwhile the hsp values also show that the schizothorax schizothorax prenanti are better than schizothorax racoma for schizothorax racoma the hsp values are scattered along the river stretch the main reason that the habitat suitability conditions for schizothorax racoma were so poor appears to be the water depth which overrode the role of velocity and substrates the detailed schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma habitat qualities have been carried out as per the hsp msp and lsp in the scenario without dam construction the mean values of hsp msp and lsp for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti were kept at levels of 0 60 0 03 and 0 37 respectively meanwhile the corresponding values for schizothorax racoma were kept at levels of 0 46 0 17 and 0 37 respectively in the scenario with the dam construction effects the hsp decreased from 0 6 to 0 14 for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and the hsp decreased from 0 46 to 0 03 for schizothorax racoma however the lsp increased from 0 37 to 0 82 for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and the lsp increased from 0 37 to 0 91 for schizothorax racoma fig 10 the matrix population model was applied to predict all eight life stages of schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and six life stages of schizothorax racoma population numbers and the population density distribution map in a scenario of natural flow the total schizothorax schizothorax prenanti number remained stable at a level of 7 1 105 and the number distribution for all eight life stages also remained unchanged at all simulation times meanwhile the schizothorax racoma had a stable total population level with a value of 2 5 104 and the first year fish numbers were also much higher than other fish life stage numbers with a value of 2 37 104 the distribution for a six life stage numbers was also associated with a consistently stable value during the simulation in the construction scenario schizothorax schizothorax prenanti total fish numbers showed a decreasing trend with the number 7 3 105 in the first year decreasing to 7 105 in the 10th year the schizothorax racoma population showed a significant downward trend with the number decreasing from 2 6 104 in the first year to 5 4 102 in the 10th year the early life stages schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma numbers decreased faster than the number for the other life stages when the fish stocking strategy based on the ecohyraulic modeling framework was applied the most suitable fish stocking number for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma were 1 0 105 and 2 0 104 with the fish stocking number both target fish could be recovered to the natural level fig 11 fig 12 shows the schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma population density distribution in scenarios natural flow with dam construction effects and with fish stocking the schizothorax schizothorax prenanti density values were higher than the schizothorax racoma density values in all three scenarios both fish species densities were constant in the natural flow scenario and showed a decreasing trend in the dam construction scenario during the simulation in the scenario with the fish stocking both fish species density values could be recovered to a stable level the schizothorax schizothorax prenanti density values even showed a slight increase the maximum density for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma was 450 and 50 fish per mesh cell respectively the optimal fish stocking numbers were 1 0 105 per year and 2 0 104 per year for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma respectively 4 discussion 4 1 modeling framework analysis in the aare river case i both the logistic and matrix population models can accurately simulate changes in european grayling numbers and trends in fish population distribution in addition when comparing simulated results and caught fish numbers the correlation coefficients between predicted and observed results are in reasonable agreement for both the logistic and the matrix population models more specifically the european grayling numbers for all age classes and the fish density distributions can be simulated at each month for the logistic and each year for the matrix population models the matrix population model provided fish age structure status the fish age structure data is extremely important for the case study with dam construction effects and fish stocking effects zhang et al 2016 arlinghaus et al 2016 in case i there are several options for restoring the european grayling population one option is fish stocking which has been considered a useful population restoration strategy in many rivers forbes et al 2016 yao 2016 in addition it is important to identify the european grayling spawning site and use the ecohydraullic modeling framework to assess the most possible successful river management in order to effectively enhance the fish habitat and recover the fish population fu et al 2007 both the fish stocking strategy and the post effects of it can be identified and quantified by the ecohydraulic modeling framework yao 2016 4 2 modeling framework analysis in the colorado river case ii in case ii both the logistic and matrix population models have reasonable simulation accuracy both models indicate that the rainbow trout population numbers decreased from 2000 to 2007 and that the population numbers increased from 2000 to 2009 the brown trout population numbers decreased steadily while the flannelmouth sucker population number increased slightly in this case study the logistic population model performed better than the matrix population model case ii shows that the ecohydraulic modeling framework provides valuable information for river and fish population management however a considerable amount of work is needed to collect data validate the ecohydraulic modeling framework this is because precise and tested empirical parameters are critical for the successful performance of the ecohydraulic modeling framework 4 3 modeling framework analysis in the jiao mu river case iii in case iii the ecohydraulic modeling framework was shown to be essential to protect and maintain the jiao mu river ecosystem as well as to evaluate the effects of the da wei dam construction the modeling framework was used to simulate the qualities of habitat for both schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma along with variations in fish density and changes to pupulation numbers and the structure if the age if the fish based on the framework the optimal fish stocking number with the matrix population model for schizothorax schizothorax prenanti and schizothorax racoma were respectively 1 105 and 2 104 per year however if the logistic population model was applied in case iii the fish stocking number would have been different yao 2016 this is because the scope of these two models is different the logistic population model can only be used to predict the fluctuation of the total population number in the matrix population model it is possible to predict the population number changes at each life stage the stocking sensitivity analyses were considered in case iii but it s not considered in the case i and case ii there was no surveyed data to calibrate the case iii this is because the dam construction was expected to be completed in 2022 the long term fish monitoring program was intended to monitor the fish abundance it was expected that the modeling framework could be validated using these monitoring data li et al 2012 this ecohydraulic modeling framework provides a basis for further research in case iii and for comparison with monitoring data to assess the success of the river ecosystem management for aquatic fauna 4 4 ecohydraulic modeling framework advantages and limitations the ecohydraulic modeling framework has also been recognized as an increasingly useful tool for successful river management the authors proposed and highlighted the robustness and the importance of the framework in hydro morphodynamic habitat and population status studies of river systems yi et al 2013 applied the hydro morphodynamic and habitat models to the yangtze river to assess the chinese sturgeon spawning sites there by considering the population model in the framework the high hsi values do not mean significant fish abundance in that particular stretch of the river the model application in case i shows that the habitat is stable does not mean the population is stable the biggest advantage of the ecohydraulic modeling framework is that it can simultaneously predict the river s hydro morphodynamic status fish habitat and fish abundance status the framework can also quantify and qualify the ecological influence of dam construction optimal fish stocking strategies and reservoir management moreover the framework is accurate and provides extremely robust multiple options for model applications several aspects of the modeling framework can be improved including the accuracy in the hydro morphodynamic model methods such as a support vector machine svm could be applied the si curves and the combination of si could also be more precise the empirical parameter in the population model could be more accurate however the accumulation of long term monitoring data means that these drawbacks can be reduced or even disappeared meanwhile the significant testing and the agreement between the surveyed data and prediction mean that the robustness and accuracy of the modeling framework predictions can be accept with confidence 5 conclusions this study proposed a robust ecohydraulic modeling framework and investigated the feasibility of using it to quantify hydro morphodynamic habitat and population status in sections of three different rivers to ensure that it was adequately tested the ecohydraulic modeling framework was used in case studies in switzerland usa and china involving six fish species european

24586,in forests of the amazon biome sustainable forest management plans are based on technical guidelines such legislation provides for a cutting cycle that can vary from 25 to 35 years and a minimum cutting diameter of 50 cm in view of the above the present research aimed to evaluate the accuracy of regression models for the projection of growth in diameter and to calculate the t by diametric class for trees of the species c guianensis and t altíssima four models with fixed effects were tested and best model was selected as the base model for the incorporation of random effects the best fixed effect model was pienaar and schiver thus structures of variance and autocorrelation were added to this model to correct heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation finally the time of passage for each species studied was calculated the average annual increment in diameter estimated with the pienaar and schiver model with fixed effect was 0 38 cm year 1 for c guianensis and 0 46 cm year 1 for t altissima using the pienaar and schiver model with a random effect the average annual diameter increase varied from 0 31 to 0 58 cm year 1 for c guianensis and from 0 37 to 0 65 mm year 1 for t altissima results showed that the estimated cutting cycle varied from 24 to 45 years for the species c guianensis and from 21 to 38 years for the species t altissima thus using the cutting time of 25 to 35 years and a minimum cutting diameter of 50 cm for these species can lead to incorrect decisions about the intensity of logging or the appropriate length of the cutting cycle the growth and production models depict a synthesis of the growth dynamics of the forest allowing to providing fundamental information for the definition of planning strategies such as the establishment of a cutting cycle and an exploration intensity more compatible with the growth rate of the forest and for each species graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tropical forest regression models forest management sustainability 1 introduction the amazon forest consists of approximately 16 000 tree species ter steege et al 2013 of these species few are of commercial interest to the timber industry and therefore a silvicultural management system utilizing species specific control is essential alder and silva 2000 cunha et al 2016 in addition the use of cut rates that reflect different growth rates can provide greater guarantee of the sustainability of the ecosystem braz et al 2012 in forests of the amazon biome the sustainable forest management plans sfmp are based on technical guidelines that allows the use of machines to drag logs with a maximum cutting intensity of 30 m3 ha 1 a cutting cycle that can vary from 25 to 35 years and a minimum cutting diameter mcd the mcd can be changed according to the results of technical studies that prove the sustainability of the management of the species to adopt a value greater or less than the established mcd of 50 cm brasil 2009 the sustainable forest management sfm model applied to native forests in the amazon region does not consider the different species growth rates for example it includes species with high wood densities that tend to take more time to reach the mcd 50 cm while species with low wood densities may reach it before the expected time differences in species growth rates show that polycyclic systems must be studied to achieve the greatest possible sustainability of the exploitation system schöngart 2008 these systems are widely used because they modify very little the natural structure where the arboreal individuals grow creating a uneven aged forest and composed predominantly of species of commercial value louman 2001 knowledge regarding growth supports decision making and natural forest management as it has a direct relationship with cutting intensity future stock and post harvest silvicultural treatments jardim et al 2007 growth and production models have become essential for validating these parameters in native forests as they make it possible to portray a synthesis of the forest dynamics and make projections at different levels of detail e g total population models diameter class models and individual tree models vanclay 1994 by estimating the growth of timber species it is possible to obtain fundamental information regarding planning strategies which facilitates the determination of cutting cycles and improves the compatibility of resource exploitation with the growth of various tree species and in various forest typologies adame et al 2008 reis et al 2016 given this perspective studying the growth and production parameters of these native forests is important for sustainable forest management which is based on the knowledge of the species self ecology several studies have aimed to develop models that better promote growth of populations and forest species adame et al 2008 colpini et al 2010 cunha et al 2016 martins et al 2014 stepka et al 2012 however information regarding the growth of many amazonian forest species of economic interest for timber production is still scarce among these commercial timber species present in the amazon region are carapa guianensis aubl and tetragastris altissima aubl swart popularly known as andiroba and breu vermelho respectively t altissima stands out in several floristic studies as a species with the highest importance value index almeida et al 2012 araujo 2006 malheiros et al 2009 has a high wood density 0 74 g cm³ and is mainly used in civil construction or charcoal production the exudate of its bark is used in essences and medicinal applications ribeiro et al 2013 t altissima is of great relevance to the ecology of forest habitats presenting a good trend of established young trees mews et al 2012 in addition to having potential for commercial use c guianensis is a multiple use species with great potential for logging and non logging and is one of the most valuable species in the amazon forest castro et al 2021 costa and morais 2013 ferraz et al 2002 an alternative for acquiring the knowledge of growth and subsidizing the management of these species is the fit and use of individual tree models itm for the fit of itm models data from periodic measurements of the same individual over time of dendrometric variables such as height and diameter are required xu et al 2014 these data sets have a hierarchical structure as they are repeated measures of the same individual over time and are combined with different sampling units pinheiro and bates 2000 this can cause temporal or even spatial correlation which results in the assumptions required by classical regression models not being met fox et al 2001 schabenberger and gregoire 1995 west et al 1984 utilizing mixed models may be suitable for avoiding such problems fang et al 2001 sharma and parton 2009 2007 mixed models include fixed and random effects in addition to considering experimental error subedi and sharma 2011 random effects are useful for modeling variability that cannot be explained by fixed variables in the regression model calama et al 2005 thus they allow for generalizing spatiotemporal correlation structures and non constant variance carvalho et al 2014 these can also better extract the relationships of independent variables with grouped data when compared to traditional regression models thus allowing for growth and forest production estimation calegario et al 2004 gouveia et al 2015 in view of these considerations the present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of regression models for projecting forest growth by diameter and to calculate the time of passage by diameter class for trees of the species c guianensis and t altissima in order to subsidize information for the sfm of species in the amazon 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of the study area the study area is located in the experimental field of the brazilian agricultural research corporation of acre embrapa acre in the municipality of rio branco acre brazil between 10 01 22 and 10 04 14 south latitude and 67 40 3 and 67 42 43 west longitude rodrigues et al 2001 fig 1 the forest area of embrapa acre has approximately 800 ha and borders two properties with pastures oliveira and braz 1998 the vegetation cover of the area is characterized by a predominantly open forest with the presence of bamboo guadua sp in general it presents structural characteristics and composition similar to other terra firme forests in the state of acre oliveira and braz 1998 the soils of the plots are red and red yellow argisols with medium clayey texture with low natural fertility the surface is characterized by areas in which the topography varies from flat to smooth wavy and wavy relief rodrigues et al 2001 the region belongs to the hot and humid equatorial climate which is characterized by high temperatures high levels of rainfall and high relative humidity the annual average temperature is 24 5 c while the maximum is around 32 c temperatures remain approximately uniform throughout the state acre 2006 and the annual precipitation is between 2200 mm and 2500 mm silva et al 2021 2 2 characterization and processing of data the data used were taken from a continuous forest inventory cfi of four permanent plots of 10 000 m2 each these plots were divided into subplots with an area of 100 m2 which were installed and measured in 1992 and remedied in 1995 1999 2005 2009 2012 and 2016 in the inventories tree diameters at 1 30m meters above ground dbh greater than or equal to 20 cm in the plots and greater than or equal to 5 cm in 20 subplots were randomly selected within each plot and measured of the species inventoried the commercial species c guianensis and t altissima were selected due to their economic relevance in the wood trade fig 2 shows the dbh distribution in selected 10 cm diameter classes in the years when the cfi was performed the descriptive statistics of the diameter variable for each species studied are shown in table 1 2 3 organization and division of database for model fit and validation for model fit the database was organized with information paired in measurement intervals from the first year of the forest inventory to the second year that is cfi 1 cfi 2 cfi 2 cfi 3 and so on until the last measurement subsequently the database already organized was randomly divided into two sets fit 70 and validation 30 of the models the projections of the tree diameters were made using the fitted equations in the validation database the data from the first inventory occasion 1992 were used as an independent variable to predict the dbh on the next occasion 1995 the estimated value for 1995 was used to predict the 1999 dbh and successively applied for the other inventoried occasions i e 2005 2009 2012 and 2016 2 4 fit of fixed effect nonlinear models four classic models were evaluated to project the diameter of c guianensis and t altissima table 2 to fit the fixed effect models the software r r core team 2015 was used with the use of the gauss newton algorithm using the nls function 2 5 fit of mixed effect nonlinear models after analyzing the four non linear fixed effect models table 2 and evaluating the criteria presented in section 2 6 the model with the best performance was selected for this model the mixed model theory with the insertion of random effects was applied as dbh data for c guianensis and t altissima came from plots with repeated measurements over time for each tree and had a hierarchical structure tree within sampled plots plots were used as a random effect since trees on the same plot are more likely to be similar before the mixed modeling adopted in this study an investigation was carried out on the occurrence of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the fixed effect model heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation can be observed using the residual graph for this the nlstools package was used which provides tools for diagnosing nonlinear regression models and was designed to work with the nls function r core team in case of confirmed heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation obtained by graphical analysis variance functions and autocorrelation structures were tested in this case the functions varpower power of a covariate and varident constant variance by group were tested to model heteroscedasticity in addition to model a possible autocorrelation between the observed data from repeated measures over time in the same individual two autocorrelation structures were tested first order autoregressive ar1 and first order continuous time autoregressive car1 pinheiro and bates 2000 to fit the mixed nonlinear models the restricted maximum likelihood algorithm was used which is available in the nlme package pinheiro and bates 2000 the general shape of a mixed nonlinear model with the plot as a random effect can be described as follows 5 d b h i j k f ϕ i j x i j k ε i j k i 1 m j 1 m i k 1 n i j where m is the number of plots mi is the number of trees within the i th plot nij is the number of observations dbh dbhijk is the dbh in the k th age of the j th tree obtained from the i th plot xijk is the predictor variable ϕ i j is the parameter vector r 1 where r is the number of parameters in the model f is non linear function of the predictor variables and parameter vector and εijk is the error in mixed models it is assumed that the error is random eq 6 normally distributed with zero mean and a variance covariance structure defined by a rij matrix eq 7 usually expressed as a function of the parameter vector δ the rij matrix can depend on random and fixed effects and is responsible for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation within the plot 6 ε i j k n 0 r i j 7 r i j σ 2 g i j 0 5

analyzed in the diameter projection the estimates were compared based on the values observed over 1995 1999 2005 2009 2012 and 2016 the accuracy of the fitted models was assessed by the following statistical indicators akaike information criterion aic eq 8 bayesean information criterion bic eq 9 correlation coefficient r eq 10 relative root mean square error rrmse eq 11 and relative bias rb eq 10 to assess the accuracy of the dbh projection for the validation set the statistical indicators used were r rrmse and rb 8 a i c 2 log m v 2 n p a r 9 b i c 2 log m v 2 n p a r log n 10 r y y i 1 n

the mean of the observed dependent variable n is the number of observations and and p is the number of model parameters in addition to these statistics a visual analysis of the observed values was also performed versus estimated values and a visual analysis of the percentage residuals was conducted eq 13 13 e r r o r 100 y i y i y i 2 7 obtaining transit time one way to describe the dynamics of diameter growth of forest species is to estimate the duration of the growth phases obtained from the calculation of the time of passage tp souza et al 1993 tp is defined as the average time required for all trees in one diameter class to move to the next class scolforo et al 1996 this method allows to estimate the rate of movement of the trees between the diameter classes vanclay 1994 to calculate the time of passage in this study a model was selected with and without the random effect for better performance in estimating the future diameter for each species from the chosen equation dbh was estimated annually adopting an initial diameter of 10 cm the diameter classes were defined with an amplitude of 10 cm the last class being that which covered the maximum diameter observed for each species in the cfi from the 10 cm dbh and its respective increment for the following year the relative age was obtained using eq 14 caballero and malleux orjeda 1976 santos et al 2016 14 a g e d b h i i p a i where age is the relative age in dbhi years dbhi is the initial dbh value cm and ipai is the annual periodic increase in dbhi cm year 1 then the projected dbh was replaced in the model as an independent variable and later the diameter for the subsequent year was calculated this was performed successively until it covered the entire breadth of each diameter class defined for each species subsequent relative ages were obtained by adding one year for each resulting occasion starting from the first relative age that was estimated eq 14 the time of passage was calculated by taking the difference between the relative ages corresponding to the lower limits of two successive diameter classes as an example the first class of diameter goes from 10 to 20 cm and the second from 20 to 30 cm in this case the upper limits of the classes are open intervals and do not belong to the class considering the best model among those evaluated in table 2 dbh2 is estimated based on the lower limit of the first class that is 10 cm the ipai will be in the case of this example the difference between the dbh2 calculated by the selected model table 2 minus the dbh of 10 cm lower limit of the first class the first relative age will be calculated based on the expression 14 the next step is to consider the calculated dbh2 equal to dbh1 estimate a new dbh2 and add one more to the initially calculated relative age this operation is repeated until the diameter class is changed for this example until the dbh2 value is equal to or greater than 20 cm further details on this methodology can be found in the work of caballero and malleux orjeda 1976 and santos et al 2016 3 results 3 1 species diameter projection by fixed effect nonlinear model table 3 shows parameter estimates as well as the aic and bic of the fitted diameter projection models they were called models 1 to 4 as follows model 1 logístico oliveira et al model 2 pienaar and schiver model 3 chapman richards and model 4 mitscherlich all estimated coefficients for models 2 3 and 4 were significant p 0 05 for the projection of dbh of c guianensis regarding the fit of the models for t altissima it is possible to verify with the exception of b2 all the indicated parameters of model 1 were relevant p 0 05 models 2 and 3 obtained the lowest values of aic and bic for the projection of dbh of the trees of the studied species fig 3 presents graphical analyzes and statistics to dbh fit and validation for the studied species based on the fit statistics it appears that the models showed similar r with values above 99 and absence of bias rb 0 3 for the two species studied for the validation statistics of the models an increase in the rrmse and rb values and reduction in the r value were observed although the rb values were lower in models 1 and 4 when comparing the rb of the models fit and validation sets there is a proportionally greater increase for these models compared to the other statistics for example the rb value of model 4 for the validation data was 25 times greater than the fit data for t altissima fig 3 these findings indicate that model 2 exhibits better stability due to smaller increases presented for this statistic 4 and 5 times for c guianensis and t altissima respectively the graphs of the relationship between observed and estimated dbh showed estimates for fit and validation data with values close to the 1 1 trend line fig 3 when analyzing the distribution of errors fig 3 models 2 and 3 had similar behavior for the projection of dbh for both species with greater dispersion of data in the smaller classes of dbh models 1 and 4 also exhibited similar behavior across the entire dbh variation range of the trees with a tendency to overestimate the smallest diameters all models presented higher frequency of errors in the classes of 5 and 5 with an average of approximately 74 of the errors grouped in these classes models 2 and 3 presented the best residual distribution corroborating the values of the statistical indicators found according to the analyzed criteria model 2 was chosen as the base model for the insertion of the random parcel effect in mixed modeling fig 4 shows the occurrence of autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in the projection of the future diameter by model 2 for the two species studied the graph of standardized residues versus the fitted values fig 4 c d indicates heterogeneity of variance that is their variances generally vary systematically over time exhibiting uneven dispersion in the range of fitted values the graph of each absolute residue residual i versus the previous absolute residuals residual i 1 fig 4 a b did not show random dispersion around the x axis showing that the term of observation error residual i is influenced by the error term of any other observation residual i 1 in addition to the visual assessment of the model s assumptions the autocorrelation in the residuals assessed using the running test was significant p 0 0001 which proves that there is autocorrelation therefore for mixed modeling it is necessary to add the variance and autocorrelation structures to the selected model 3 2 species diameter projection by mixed effect nonlinear models table 4 shows the values of aic and bic for fit the diameter projection models using mixed models mem 1 to 4 mem1 and mem2 showed similar values with the lowest values of aic and bic for the projection of dbh considering the species c guianensis for t altissima mem1 had the lowest values of aic and bic moreover the varident variance function in general was better independent of the species and the autocorrelation function used the models that used the corar1 mem1 autocorrelation structure had the lowest aic and bic values compared to the corcar1 mem2 function considering only the varident variance structure and the t altissima species the use of these structures depends on the regularity of the measurements singer and willett 2003 report that corcar1 allows using variable data with unevenly spaced time observations while the corar1 function requires observations with equally spaced time intervals where delta aic and delta bic are the differences between the values of aic and bic from the mod 2 table 3 and the values of aic and bic from the structures of autocorrelation and variance table 4 considering the species c guianensis and t altissima fig 5 presents the graphic analysis and statistics for the fit and validation data of the mixed models analyzed for dbh projection based on the fit statistics of these models it is noted that they had similar r with values above 99 and absence of bias rb 0 2 for the two species studied these values are lower when compared to the values of the models with fixed effect fig 3 the graphs of the relationship between observed and estimated dbh showed good estimates for the fit and validation of the dbh of the trees of the studied species with values close to the 1 1 line fig 5 when assessing the distribution of errors the models considered had a similar behavior for the projection of dbh of c guianensis trees with greater dispersion of data in the lower dbh classes underestimating the future diameter in these classes models 1 and 2 also showed similar behavior over the entire range without showing a trend it was also found that all models presented higher frequencies in the classes of 5 and 5 with an average of approximately 84 of the errors grouped in these classes models 2 and 3 exhibited the best residual distribution corroborating the values of the statistics it is also worth mentioning that although the mem1 and mem2 models present similar statistical indicators mem1 was the one with the lowest aic and bic values for the projection of dbh of the trees of the two species studied in this work hence it is considered the most suitable for the dbh projection of the studied species for comparison purposes regarding the performance of the tested models fixed and mixed effect fig 6 shows the current annual increments aci for some plots chosen at random considering the observed values of mean aci cm year 1 per plot and those estimated by the fixed model mod2 and the mixed model mem1 it is noted that mem1 presented the values closest to the observed values of mean aci 3 3 species time of passage in fig 7 estimates of the time of passage and average annual periodic increment by diameter class of the species c guianensis and t altissima are presented it is noticed that c guianensis and t altissima have the highest time of passage values in the first diametric class fig 7a and b which tends to decrease at higher diameter classes moreover tree growth increased as individual size increased fig 7c and d the mem1 estimates reveal that there is greater variability in the first diameter classes which decrease as the diameter classes increase using the pienaar and schiver model with fixed effect mod2 the time required to move from the class of 10 20 to the class of 50 60 is 132 and 108 years for c guianensis and t altissima respectively fig 7a and b the average annual increment in diameter was 0 38 cm year 1 for c guianensis and 0 46 cm year 1 for t altissima fig 7c and d the growth of t altíssima exhibited strong acceleration considering the use of pienaar and mixed schiver mem1 model the time required to move from the class of 10 20 to that of 50 60 varies from 86 to 160 years and from 77 to 135 years for c guianensis and t altissima respectively the average increment of the annual diameter varied from 0 31 to 0 58 cm year 1 for c guianensis and from 0 37 to 0 65 mm year 1 for t altissima 4 discussion 4 1 species diameter projection by fixed and mixed effect nonlinear models information on tree growth is essential for understanding the time that forests need to replenish the stock of wood close to the originals before exploitation david et al 2019 this highlights the relevance of this study in which the use of regression models for projecting the diameter of two economically important species native to the amazon was analyzed in general the fixed models studied in this work demonstrated excellent performance for the set of fit data it is worth mentioning that the accuracy of the models for the validation set decreases in relation to the results of model fit for the two analyzed species this reduction in model accuracy was expected because the error of the previous measurement is propagated to the next measurement in projection models causing error accumulation the results for the fit and validation of the fixed models table 2 and fig 3 indicate that the models have greater accuracy for projecting the diameter of the trees of the species t altissima the model 2 piennar and shiver provided the most accurate estimates for the projection of the future diameters of c guianensis and t altissima trees despite the excellent results presented by the fixed models the hierarchical structure in the forest inventory data that is trees within plots generally results in dependence between measurements because observations from the same sampling unit may have spatial dependence on another plot in addition as this study focused on growth in diameter measurements were taken on the same individuals over time resulting in serial correlation to address this the use of mixed models and the modeling of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation was proposed considering the results presented in fig 4 after defining a common functional fixed structure for all plots as well as an individual random effect for each plot the mixed models estimate fixed and random parameters simultaneously and allow modeling the variability detected for specific phenomena in different locations lindstrom and bates 1990 when considering the plot as a random effect straight lines with distinct intercepts and slopes were assigned to each plot thus reducing the error made by the plot in the projection of the future diameter this is considered the main factor that explains the reduction in the rrmse value when comparing the fixed model fig 3 to the mixed model fig 5 analyzing the residuals demonstrated that the projections based on the analyzed mixed model fig 5 showed a more homogeneous residual variation than in the fixed models fig 3 without the inclusion of the parcel random effect in model 2 the residues showed a tendency to increase in value with increasing diameters which characterizes the heterogeneity of variance after the inclusion of random effects and the structures of variance and autocorrelation residual autocorrelation and heterogeneity of variance were almost completely removed the analysis of mixed models allows for a wide variety of correlation patterns or structures of variance and covariance to be explicitly modeled another important point is that mixed models deal with uneven spacing of repeated measurements that is measurements that were made at different intervals through the autocorrelation functions such as the one used in this study corcar singer and willett 2003 the biggest errors were concentrated in the lower dbh values showing greater difficulty in generating more accurate estimates for trees with smaller diameters fig 5 this can be attributed to the greater heterogeneity observed in the growth rates of the smallest trees because they suffer most from competition within forests in addition tree growth rates are influenced by their genetic characteristics and interactions with environmental factors such as climate soil characteristics and topography prodan et al 1997 thicker trees which have been established for a longer period exhibit less variability in diametric increments rozendaal et al 2015 schaaf et al 2005 the growth rates among the studied species as well as among individuals belonging to the same species are highly variable fig 7 one approach for improving the accuracy of these estimates is including categorical variables in the model that influence the growth of trees such as canopy lighting liana infestation and clearing sizes reis et al 2018 4 2 species time of passage the results demonstrate that the two species studied exhibited slow initial growth fig 7a and b resulting in a longer time of passage decreasing over the larger diameter classes in a study by ferreira et al 2020 slower initial growth was also observed this slower initial growth may be associated with the greater number of individuals present in the first diameter classes which indicates greater competition for light water and nutrients when trees with the largest diameters were analyzed the fastest growth was seen to be a function of lowered competition as they are larger individuals with more developed root structure that receive more light in the canopy however these growth rates decrease again once the trees reach the senescence phase scolforo 2006 the same slower initial growth behavior was observed by santos et al 2016 for individuals of eremanthus incanus the authors found a longer time of passage for the smaller diameter classes and a more accelerated diameter growth with the increase of classes oliveira 2014 studying the growth pattern of commercial species in a primary amazonian forest in mato grosso observed a decreasing behavior for qualea albiflora in the initial classes for the species goupia glabra and a decline in growth from the class of 65 cm in the study area there was no point of decline in growth in diameter of the trees of c guianensis and t altissima this can be explained by the fact that the largest inventoried individuals may be in the maturation period with no decrease in the growth rate using mod2 and considering the minimum and maximum cut cycles established by law 25 to 35 years a tree of the species c guianensis with dbh of 30 cm reaches 50 cm of dbh in a period of 38 years and the species t altissima would need 30 years to reach that same mcd schöngart 2008 found that it took between 17 and 82 years to reach 50 cm for several species that grow in lowland areas in the amazon although these results indicate that the species are within the legal range the results with the use of mem1 demonstrate that using this cut time and a 50 cm mcd for these species can lead to incorrect decisions regarding the intensity of wood extraction or cutting cycle length this is because in mem1 the estimated cutting cycle varied from 24 to 45 years for c guianensis and from 21 to 38 years for t altissima this information serves as a basis for indicating the recovery potential of wood production for these species individuals from plots whose diameter did not reach the mcd over the 35 year cutting cycle require longer periods to reach this value thus the volume from species regeneration may not be sufficient to replenish the wood stock groenendijk et al 2017 this corroborates the studies that analyzed variables such as the mcd and the intensity of exploitation and concluded that with the parameters indicated in the legislation they are not enough to guarantee that the forest management is sustainable putz et al 2012 sist et al 2003 sist and brown 2004 sist and ferreira 2007 this problem can be reduced through silvicultural treatments such as thinning and cutting lianas de avila et al 2017 peña claros et al 2008 by providing faster diameter growth these silvicultural treatments shorten the cutting cycle david et al 2019 making wood production sustainable in the future if the establishment and maintenance of younger trees is guaranteed schöngart 2008 for occasions in which the forest grows without intervention the difference in the growth rate between individuals of the same species is explained by differences between individual growth sites tree growth is influenced by various factors such as competition sociological position exposure to receiving sunlight and availability of water and nutrients paredes villanueva et al 2016 schwartz et al 2017 2013 these conditions were not studied or implemented into the model as covariates however when incorporating the random effect it becomes an analogous process and the model can capture the difference in the growth rate of individuals of the same species that grow under different environmental conditions according to their location in the forest it is important to emphasize that when discussing sfm in the amazon the applied cutting intensity the minimum viable cutting diameter for use in sawmills and the exploration techniques must be carefully selected to at the same time reduce environmental impacts and guarantee the economic viability research with the theme addressed in this work is necessary to support the volumetric projection and to estimate the time in which the trees will reach a certain diameter of interest and with this to determine with greater accuracy the cutting cycle of the forest or of a species however the determination of the mdc and the cutting cycle is not based only on the techniques researched in this work therefore other factors must be taken into account despite not being the scope of this research such as availability of viable seeds entry or recruitment mortality population structure and density of individuals of the species klimas et al 2017 klimas et al 2012 5 conclusions the piennar and shiver model mod2 demonstrated the best accuracy in the projection of the diameter of c guianensis trees for t altissima the chapman richards model also presented accurate estimates the base model piennar and shiver mod2 effectively presented heterogeneity of variance and correlated residues which were important for the addition of structures of variance and autocorrelation in the mixed modeling approach mem1 varident variance structure and corar1 autocorrelation exhibited greater accuracy in estimates of annual periodic increment in diameter for both species when compared to the other models the time of passage decreased with the increase in diameter classes and the increase in diameter increased at higher diameters for both species the location where the trees are grown influences individual growth

24586,in forests of the amazon biome sustainable forest management plans are based on technical guidelines such legislation provides for a cutting cycle that can vary from 25 to 35 years and a minimum cutting diameter of 50 cm in view of the above the present research aimed to evaluate the accuracy of regression models for the projection of growth in diameter and to calculate the t by diametric class for trees of the species c guianensis and t altíssima four models with fixed effects were tested and best model was selected as the base model for the incorporation of random effects the best fixed effect model was pienaar and schiver thus structures of variance and autocorrelation were added to this model to correct heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation finally the time of passage for each species studied was calculated the average annual increment in diameter estimated with the pienaar and schiver model with fixed effect was 0 38 cm year 1 for c guianensis and 0 46 cm year 1 for t altissima using the pienaar and schiver model with a random effect the average annual diameter increase varied from 0 31 to 0 58 cm year 1 for c guianensis and from 0 37 to 0 65 mm year 1 for t altissima results showed that the estimated cutting cycle varied from 24 to 45 years for the species c guianensis and from 21 to 38 years for the species t altissima thus using the cutting time of 25 to 35 years and a minimum cutting diameter of 50 cm for these species can lead to incorrect decisions about the intensity of logging or the appropriate length of the cutting cycle the growth and production models depict a synthesis of the growth dynamics of the forest allowing to providing fundamental information for the definition of planning strategies such as the establishment of a cutting cycle and an exploration intensity more compatible with the growth rate of the forest and for each species graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords tropical forest regression models forest management sustainability 1 introduction the amazon forest consists of approximately 16 000 tree species ter steege et al 2013 of these species few are of commercial interest to the timber industry and therefore a silvicultural management system utilizing species specific control is essential alder and silva 2000 cunha et al 2016 in addition the use of cut rates that reflect different growth rates can provide greater guarantee of the sustainability of the ecosystem braz et al 2012 in forests of the amazon biome the sustainable forest management plans sfmp are based on technical guidelines that allows the use of machines to drag logs with a maximum cutting intensity of 30 m3 ha 1 a cutting cycle that can vary from 25 to 35 years and a minimum cutting diameter mcd the mcd can be changed according to the results of technical studies that prove the sustainability of the management of the species to adopt a value greater or less than the established mcd of 50 cm brasil 2009 the sustainable forest management sfm model applied to native forests in the amazon region does not consider the different species growth rates for example it includes species with high wood densities that tend to take more time to reach the mcd 50 cm while species with low wood densities may reach it before the expected time differences in species growth rates show that polycyclic systems must be studied to achieve the greatest possible sustainability of the exploitation system schöngart 2008 these systems are widely used because they modify very little the natural structure where the arboreal individuals grow creating a uneven aged forest and composed predominantly of species of commercial value louman 2001 knowledge regarding growth supports decision making and natural forest management as it has a direct relationship with cutting intensity future stock and post harvest silvicultural treatments jardim et al 2007 growth and production models have become essential for validating these parameters in native forests as they make it possible to portray a synthesis of the forest dynamics and make projections at different levels of detail e g total population models diameter class models and individual tree models vanclay 1994 by estimating the growth of timber species it is possible to obtain fundamental information regarding planning strategies which facilitates the determination of cutting cycles and improves the compatibility of resource exploitation with the growth of various tree species and in various forest typologies adame et al 2008 reis et al 2016 given this perspective studying the growth and production parameters of these native forests is important for sustainable forest management which is based on the knowledge of the species self ecology several studies have aimed to develop models that better promote growth of populations and forest species adame et al 2008 colpini et al 2010 cunha et al 2016 martins et al 2014 stepka et al 2012 however information regarding the growth of many amazonian forest species of economic interest for timber production is still scarce among these commercial timber species present in the amazon region are carapa guianensis aubl and tetragastris altissima aubl swart popularly known as andiroba and breu vermelho respectively t altissima stands out in several floristic studies as a species with the highest importance value index almeida et al 2012 araujo 2006 malheiros et al 2009 has a high wood density 0 74 g cm³ and is mainly used in civil construction or charcoal production the exudate of its bark is used in essences and medicinal applications ribeiro et al 2013 t altissima is of great relevance to the ecology of forest habitats presenting a good trend of established young trees mews et al 2012 in addition to having potential for commercial use c guianensis is a multiple use species with great potential for logging and non logging and is one of the most valuable species in the amazon forest castro et al 2021 costa and morais 2013 ferraz et al 2002 an alternative for acquiring the knowledge of growth and subsidizing the management of these species is the fit and use of individual tree models itm for the fit of itm models data from periodic measurements of the same individual over time of dendrometric variables such as height and diameter are required xu et al 2014 these data sets have a hierarchical structure as they are repeated measures of the same individual over time and are combined with different sampling units pinheiro and bates 2000 this can cause temporal or even spatial correlation which results in the assumptions required by classical regression models not being met fox et al 2001 schabenberger and gregoire 1995 west et al 1984 utilizing mixed models may be suitable for avoiding such problems fang et al 2001 sharma and parton 2009 2007 mixed models include fixed and random effects in addition to considering experimental error subedi and sharma 2011 random effects are useful for modeling variability that cannot be explained by fixed variables in the regression model calama et al 2005 thus they allow for generalizing spatiotemporal correlation structures and non constant variance carvalho et al 2014 these can also better extract the relationships of independent variables with grouped data when compared to traditional regression models thus allowing for growth and forest production estimation calegario et al 2004 gouveia et al 2015 in view of these considerations the present study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of regression models for projecting forest growth by diameter and to calculate the time of passage by diameter class for trees of the species c guianensis and t altissima in order to subsidize information for the sfm of species in the amazon 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of the study area the study area is located in the experimental field of the brazilian agricultural research corporation of acre embrapa acre in the municipality of rio branco acre brazil between 10 01 22 and 10 04 14 south latitude and 67 40 3 and 67 42 43 west longitude rodrigues et al 2001 fig 1 the forest area of embrapa acre has approximately 800 ha and borders two properties with pastures oliveira and braz 1998 the vegetation cover of the area is characterized by a predominantly open forest with the presence of bamboo guadua sp in general it presents structural characteristics and composition similar to other terra firme forests in the state of acre oliveira and braz 1998 the soils of the plots are red and red yellow argisols with medium clayey texture with low natural fertility the surface is characterized by areas in which the topography varies from flat to smooth wavy and wavy relief rodrigues et al 2001 the region belongs to the hot and humid equatorial climate which is characterized by high temperatures high levels of rainfall and high relative humidity the annual average temperature is 24 5 c while the maximum is around 32 c temperatures remain approximately uniform throughout the state acre 2006 and the annual precipitation is between 2200 mm and 2500 mm silva et al 2021 2 2 characterization and processing of data the data used were taken from a continuous forest inventory cfi of four permanent plots of 10 000 m2 each these plots were divided into subplots with an area of 100 m2 which were installed and measured in 1992 and remedied in 1995 1999 2005 2009 2012 and 2016 in the inventories tree diameters at 1 30m meters above ground dbh greater than or equal to 20 cm in the plots and greater than or equal to 5 cm in 20 subplots were randomly selected within each plot and measured of the species inventoried the commercial species c guianensis and t altissima were selected due to their economic relevance in the wood trade fig 2 shows the dbh distribution in selected 10 cm diameter classes in the years when the cfi was performed the descriptive statistics of the diameter variable for each species studied are shown in table 1 2 3 organization and division of database for model fit and validation for model fit the database was organized with information paired in measurement intervals from the first year of the forest inventory to the second year that is cfi 1 cfi 2 cfi 2 cfi 3 and so on until the last measurement subsequently the database already organized was randomly divided into two sets fit 70 and validation 30 of the models the projections of the tree diameters were made using the fitted equations in the validation database the data from the first inventory occasion 1992 were used as an independent variable to predict the dbh on the next occasion 1995 the estimated value for 1995 was used to predict the 1999 dbh and successively applied for the other inventoried occasions i e 2005 2009 2012 and 2016 2 4 fit of fixed effect nonlinear models four classic models were evaluated to project the diameter of c guianensis and t altissima table 2 to fit the fixed effect models the software r r core team 2015 was used with the use of the gauss newton algorithm using the nls function 2 5 fit of mixed effect nonlinear models after analyzing the four non linear fixed effect models table 2 and evaluating the criteria presented in section 2 6 the model with the best performance was selected for this model the mixed model theory with the insertion of random effects was applied as dbh data for c guianensis and t altissima came from plots with repeated measurements over time for each tree and had a hierarchical structure tree within sampled plots plots were used as a random effect since trees on the same plot are more likely to be similar before the mixed modeling adopted in this study an investigation was carried out on the occurrence of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the fixed effect model heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation can be observed using the residual graph for this the nlstools package was used which provides tools for diagnosing nonlinear regression models and was designed to work with the nls function r core team in case of confirmed heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation obtained by graphical analysis variance functions and autocorrelation structures were tested in this case the functions varpower power of a covariate and varident constant variance by group were tested to model heteroscedasticity in addition to model a possible autocorrelation between the observed data from repeated measures over time in the same individual two autocorrelation structures were tested first order autoregressive ar1 and first order continuous time autoregressive car1 pinheiro and bates 2000 to fit the mixed nonlinear models the restricted maximum likelihood algorithm was used which is available in the nlme package pinheiro and bates 2000 the general shape of a mixed nonlinear model with the plot as a random effect can be described as follows 5 d b h i j k f ϕ i j x i j k ε i j k i 1 m j 1 m i k 1 n i j where m is the number of plots mi is the number of trees within the i th plot nij is the number of observations dbh dbhijk is the dbh in the k th age of the j th tree obtained from the i th plot xijk is the predictor variable ϕ i j is the parameter vector r 1 where r is the number of parameters in the model f is non linear function of the predictor variables and parameter vector and εijk is the error in mixed models it is assumed that the error is random eq 6 normally distributed with zero mean and a variance covariance structure defined by a rij matrix eq 7 usually expressed as a function of the parameter vector δ the rij matrix can depend on random and fixed effects and is responsible for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation within the plot 6 ε i j k n 0 r i j 7 r i j σ 2 g i j 0 5

analyzed in the diameter projection the estimates were compared based on the values observed over 1995 1999 2005 2009 2012 and 2016 the accuracy of the fitted models was assessed by the following statistical indicators akaike information criterion aic eq 8 bayesean information criterion bic eq 9 correlation coefficient r eq 10 relative root mean square error rrmse eq 11 and relative bias rb eq 10 to assess the accuracy of the dbh projection for the validation set the statistical indicators used were r rrmse and rb 8 a i c 2 log m v 2 n p a r 9 b i c 2 log m v 2 n p a r log n 10 r y y i 1 n

the mean of the observed dependent variable n is the number of observations and and p is the number of model parameters in addition to these statistics a visual analysis of the observed values was also performed versus estimated values and a visual analysis of the percentage residuals was conducted eq 13 13 e r r o r 100 y i y i y i 2 7 obtaining transit time one way to describe the dynamics of diameter growth of forest species is to estimate the duration of the growth phases obtained from the calculation of the time of passage tp souza et al 1993 tp is defined as the average time required for all trees in one diameter class to move to the next class scolforo et al 1996 this method allows to estimate the rate of movement of the trees between the diameter classes vanclay 1994 to calculate the time of passage in this study a model was selected with and without the random effect for better performance in estimating the future diameter for each species from the chosen equation dbh was estimated annually adopting an initial diameter of 10 cm the diameter classes were defined with an amplitude of 10 cm the last class being that which covered the maximum diameter observed for each species in the cfi from the 10 cm dbh and its respective increment for the following year the relative age was obtained using eq 14 caballero and malleux orjeda 1976 santos et al 2016 14 a g e d b h i i p a i where age is the relative age in dbhi years dbhi is the initial dbh value cm and ipai is the annual periodic increase in dbhi cm year 1 then the projected dbh was replaced in the model as an independent variable and later the diameter for the subsequent year was calculated this was performed successively until it covered the entire breadth of each diameter class defined for each species subsequent relative ages were obtained by adding one year for each resulting occasion starting from the first relative age that was estimated eq 14 the time of passage was calculated by taking the difference between the relative ages corresponding to the lower limits of two successive diameter classes as an example the first class of diameter goes from 10 to 20 cm and the second from 20 to 30 cm in this case the upper limits of the classes are open intervals and do not belong to the class considering the best model among those evaluated in table 2 dbh2 is estimated based on the lower limit of the first class that is 10 cm the ipai will be in the case of this example the difference between the dbh2 calculated by the selected model table 2 minus the dbh of 10 cm lower limit of the first class the first relative age will be calculated based on the expression 14 the next step is to consider the calculated dbh2 equal to dbh1 estimate a new dbh2 and add one more to the initially calculated relative age this operation is repeated until the diameter class is changed for this example until the dbh2 value is equal to or greater than 20 cm further details on this methodology can be found in the work of caballero and malleux orjeda 1976 and santos et al 2016 3 results 3 1 species diameter projection by fixed effect nonlinear model table 3 shows parameter estimates as well as the aic and bic of the fitted diameter projection models they were called models 1 to 4 as follows model 1 logístico oliveira et al model 2 pienaar and schiver model 3 chapman richards and model 4 mitscherlich all estimated coefficients for models 2 3 and 4 were significant p 0 05 for the projection of dbh of c guianensis regarding the fit of the models for t altissima it is possible to verify with the exception of b2 all the indicated parameters of model 1 were relevant p 0 05 models 2 and 3 obtained the lowest values of aic and bic for the projection of dbh of the trees of the studied species fig 3 presents graphical analyzes and statistics to dbh fit and validation for the studied species based on the fit statistics it appears that the models showed similar r with values above 99 and absence of bias rb 0 3 for the two species studied for the validation statistics of the models an increase in the rrmse and rb values and reduction in the r value were observed although the rb values were lower in models 1 and 4 when comparing the rb of the models fit and validation sets there is a proportionally greater increase for these models compared to the other statistics for example the rb value of model 4 for the validation data was 25 times greater than the fit data for t altissima fig 3 these findings indicate that model 2 exhibits better stability due to smaller increases presented for this statistic 4 and 5 times for c guianensis and t altissima respectively the graphs of the relationship between observed and estimated dbh showed estimates for fit and validation data with values close to the 1 1 trend line fig 3 when analyzing the distribution of errors fig 3 models 2 and 3 had similar behavior for the projection of dbh for both species with greater dispersion of data in the smaller classes of dbh models 1 and 4 also exhibited similar behavior across the entire dbh variation range of the trees with a tendency to overestimate the smallest diameters all models presented higher frequency of errors in the classes of 5 and 5 with an average of approximately 74 of the errors grouped in these classes models 2 and 3 presented the best residual distribution corroborating the values of the statistical indicators found according to the analyzed criteria model 2 was chosen as the base model for the insertion of the random parcel effect in mixed modeling fig 4 shows the occurrence of autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in the projection of the future diameter by model 2 for the two species studied the graph of standardized residues versus the fitted values fig 4 c d indicates heterogeneity of variance that is their variances generally vary systematically over time exhibiting uneven dispersion in the range of fitted values the graph of each absolute residue residual i versus the previous absolute residuals residual i 1 fig 4 a b did not show random dispersion around the x axis showing that the term of observation error residual i is influenced by the error term of any other observation residual i 1 in addition to the visual assessment of the model s assumptions the autocorrelation in the residuals assessed using the running test was significant p 0 0001 which proves that there is autocorrelation therefore for mixed modeling it is necessary to add the variance and autocorrelation structures to the selected model 3 2 species diameter projection by mixed effect nonlinear models table 4 shows the values of aic and bic for fit the diameter projection models using mixed models mem 1 to 4 mem1 and mem2 showed similar values with the lowest values of aic and bic for the projection of dbh considering the species c guianensis for t altissima mem1 had the lowest values of aic and bic moreover the varident variance function in general was better independent of the species and the autocorrelation function used the models that used the corar1 mem1 autocorrelation structure had the lowest aic and bic values compared to the corcar1 mem2 function considering only the varident variance structure and the t altissima species the use of these structures depends on the regularity of the measurements singer and willett 2003 report that corcar1 allows using variable data with unevenly spaced time observations while the corar1 function requires observations with equally spaced time intervals where delta aic and delta bic are the differences between the values of aic and bic from the mod 2 table 3 and the values of aic and bic from the structures of autocorrelation and variance table 4 considering the species c guianensis and t altissima fig 5 presents the graphic analysis and statistics for the fit and validation data of the mixed models analyzed for dbh projection based on the fit statistics of these models it is noted that they had similar r with values above 99 and absence of bias rb 0 2 for the two species studied these values are lower when compared to the values of the models with fixed effect fig 3 the graphs of the relationship between observed and estimated dbh showed good estimates for the fit and validation of the dbh of the trees of the studied species with values close to the 1 1 line fig 5 when assessing the distribution of errors the models considered had a similar behavior for the projection of dbh of c guianensis trees with greater dispersion of data in the lower dbh classes underestimating the future diameter in these classes models 1 and 2 also showed similar behavior over the entire range without showing a trend it was also found that all models presented higher frequencies in the classes of 5 and 5 with an average of approximately 84 of the errors grouped in these classes models 2 and 3 exhibited the best residual distribution corroborating the values of the statistics it is also worth mentioning that although the mem1 and mem2 models present similar statistical indicators mem1 was the one with the lowest aic and bic values for the projection of dbh of the trees of the two species studied in this work hence it is considered the most suitable for the dbh projection of the studied species for comparison purposes regarding the performance of the tested models fixed and mixed effect fig 6 shows the current annual increments aci for some plots chosen at random considering the observed values of mean aci cm year 1 per plot and those estimated by the fixed model mod2 and the mixed model mem1 it is noted that mem1 presented the values closest to the observed values of mean aci 3 3 species time of passage in fig 7 estimates of the time of passage and average annual periodic increment by diameter class of the species c guianensis and t altissima are presented it is noticed that c guianensis and t altissima have the highest time of passage values in the first diametric class fig 7a and b which tends to decrease at higher diameter classes moreover tree growth increased as individual size increased fig 7c and d the mem1 estimates reveal that there is greater variability in the first diameter classes which decrease as the diameter classes increase using the pienaar and schiver model with fixed effect mod2 the time required to move from the class of 10 20 to the class of 50 60 is 132 and 108 years for c guianensis and t altissima respectively fig 7a and b the average annual increment in diameter was 0 38 cm year 1 for c guianensis and 0 46 cm year 1 for t altissima fig 7c and d the growth of t altíssima exhibited strong acceleration considering the use of pienaar and mixed schiver mem1 model the time required to move from the class of 10 20 to that of 50 60 varies from 86 to 160 years and from 77 to 135 years for c guianensis and t altissima respectively the average increment of the annual diameter varied from 0 31 to 0 58 cm year 1 for c guianensis and from 0 37 to 0 65 mm year 1 for t altissima 4 discussion 4 1 species diameter projection by fixed and mixed effect nonlinear models information on tree growth is essential for understanding the time that forests need to replenish the stock of wood close to the originals before exploitation david et al 2019 this highlights the relevance of this study in which the use of regression models for projecting the diameter of two economically important species native to the amazon was analyzed in general the fixed models studied in this work demonstrated excellent performance for the set of fit data it is worth mentioning that the accuracy of the models for the validation set decreases in relation to the results of model fit for the two analyzed species this reduction in model accuracy was expected because the error of the previous measurement is propagated to the next measurement in projection models causing error accumulation the results for the fit and validation of the fixed models table 2 and fig 3 indicate that the models have greater accuracy for projecting the diameter of the trees of the species t altissima the model 2 piennar and shiver provided the most accurate estimates for the projection of the future diameters of c guianensis and t altissima trees despite the excellent results presented by the fixed models the hierarchical structure in the forest inventory data that is trees within plots generally results in dependence between measurements because observations from the same sampling unit may have spatial dependence on another plot in addition as this study focused on growth in diameter measurements were taken on the same individuals over time resulting in serial correlation to address this the use of mixed models and the modeling of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation was proposed considering the results presented in fig 4 after defining a common functional fixed structure for all plots as well as an individual random effect for each plot the mixed models estimate fixed and random parameters simultaneously and allow modeling the variability detected for specific phenomena in different locations lindstrom and bates 1990 when considering the plot as a random effect straight lines with distinct intercepts and slopes were assigned to each plot thus reducing the error made by the plot in the projection of the future diameter this is considered the main factor that explains the reduction in the rrmse value when comparing the fixed model fig 3 to the mixed model fig 5 analyzing the residuals demonstrated that the projections based on the analyzed mixed model fig 5 showed a more homogeneous residual variation than in the fixed models fig 3 without the inclusion of the parcel random effect in model 2 the residues showed a tendency to increase in value with increasing diameters which characterizes the heterogeneity of variance after the inclusion of random effects and the structures of variance and autocorrelation residual autocorrelation and heterogeneity of variance were almost completely removed the analysis of mixed models allows for a wide variety of correlation patterns or structures of variance and covariance to be explicitly modeled another important point is that mixed models deal with uneven spacing of repeated measurements that is measurements that were made at different intervals through the autocorrelation functions such as the one used in this study corcar singer and willett 2003 the biggest errors were concentrated in the lower dbh values showing greater difficulty in generating more accurate estimates for trees with smaller diameters fig 5 this can be attributed to the greater heterogeneity observed in the growth rates of the smallest trees because they suffer most from competition within forests in addition tree growth rates are influenced by their genetic characteristics and interactions with environmental factors such as climate soil characteristics and topography prodan et al 1997 thicker trees which have been established for a longer period exhibit less variability in diametric increments rozendaal et al 2015 schaaf et al 2005 the growth rates among the studied species as well as among individuals belonging to the same species are highly variable fig 7 one approach for improving the accuracy of these estimates is including categorical variables in the model that influence the growth of trees such as canopy lighting liana infestation and clearing sizes reis et al 2018 4 2 species time of passage the results demonstrate that the two species studied exhibited slow initial growth fig 7a and b resulting in a longer time of passage decreasing over the larger diameter classes in a study by ferreira et al 2020 slower initial growth was also observed this slower initial growth may be associated with the greater number of individuals present in the first diameter classes which indicates greater competition for light water and nutrients when trees with the largest diameters were analyzed the fastest growth was seen to be a function of lowered competition as they are larger individuals with more developed root structure that receive more light in the canopy however these growth rates decrease again once the trees reach the senescence phase scolforo 2006 the same slower initial growth behavior was observed by santos et al 2016 for individuals of eremanthus incanus the authors found a longer time of passage for the smaller diameter classes and a more accelerated diameter growth with the increase of classes oliveira 2014 studying the growth pattern of commercial species in a primary amazonian forest in mato grosso observed a decreasing behavior for qualea albiflora in the initial classes for the species goupia glabra and a decline in growth from the class of 65 cm in the study area there was no point of decline in growth in diameter of the trees of c guianensis and t altissima this can be explained by the fact that the largest inventoried individuals may be in the maturation period with no decrease in the growth rate using mod2 and considering the minimum and maximum cut cycles established by law 25 to 35 years a tree of the species c guianensis with dbh of 30 cm reaches 50 cm of dbh in a period of 38 years and the species t altissima would need 30 years to reach that same mcd schöngart 2008 found that it took between 17 and 82 years to reach 50 cm for several species that grow in lowland areas in the amazon although these results indicate that the species are within the legal range the results with the use of mem1 demonstrate that using this cut time and a 50 cm mcd for these species can lead to incorrect decisions regarding the intensity of wood extraction or cutting cycle length this is because in mem1 the estimated cutting cycle varied from 24 to 45 years for c guianensis and from 21 to 38 years for t altissima this information serves as a basis for indicating the recovery potential of wood production for these species individuals from plots whose diameter did not reach the mcd over the 35 year cutting cycle require longer periods to reach this value thus the volume from species regeneration may not be sufficient to replenish the wood stock groenendijk et al 2017 this corroborates the studies that analyzed variables such as the mcd and the intensity of exploitation and concluded that with the parameters indicated in the legislation they are not enough to guarantee that the forest management is sustainable putz et al 2012 sist et al 2003 sist and brown 2004 sist and ferreira 2007 this problem can be reduced through silvicultural treatments such as thinning and cutting lianas de avila et al 2017 peña claros et al 2008 by providing faster diameter growth these silvicultural treatments shorten the cutting cycle david et al 2019 making wood production sustainable in the future if the establishment and maintenance of younger trees is guaranteed schöngart 2008 for occasions in which the forest grows without intervention the difference in the growth rate between individuals of the same species is explained by differences between individual growth sites tree growth is influenced by various factors such as competition sociological position exposure to receiving sunlight and availability of water and nutrients paredes villanueva et al 2016 schwartz et al 2017 2013 these conditions were not studied or implemented into the model as covariates however when incorporating the random effect it becomes an analogous process and the model can capture the difference in the growth rate of individuals of the same species that grow under different environmental conditions according to their location in the forest it is important to emphasize that when discussing sfm in the amazon the applied cutting intensity the minimum viable cutting diameter for use in sawmills and the exploration techniques must be carefully selected to at the same time reduce environmental impacts and guarantee the economic viability research with the theme addressed in this work is necessary to support the volumetric projection and to estimate the time in which the trees will reach a certain diameter of interest and with this to determine with greater accuracy the cutting cycle of the forest or of a species however the determination of the mdc and the cutting cycle is not based only on the techniques researched in this work therefore other factors must be taken into account despite not being the scope of this research such as availability of viable seeds entry or recruitment mortality population structure and density of individuals of the species klimas et al 2017 klimas et al 2012 5 conclusions the piennar and shiver model mod2 demonstrated the best accuracy in the projection of the diameter of c guianensis trees for t altissima the chapman richards model also presented accurate estimates the base model piennar and shiver mod2 effectively presented heterogeneity of variance and correlated residues which were important for the addition of structures of variance and autocorrelation in the mixed modeling approach mem1 varident variance structure and corar1 autocorrelation exhibited greater accuracy in estimates of annual periodic increment in diameter for both species when compared to the other models the time of

24587,a three dimensional coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model was applied to simulate and investigate causes of eutrophication in two stormwater ponds in the city of edmonton alberta canada the ponds differ in shape surface area depth and trophic state strong spatial gradients in water column thermal structure and water quality state variables were observed e g 10 c 0 1 mg l 1 po4 0 5 mg l 1 total p and 50 μg l 1 chlorophyll a over 3m showing the ponds were incompletely mixed systems using a single set of calibration parameters which differed from calibrations to larger systems the model accurately simulated these gradients with errors being highest for no3 and total chlorophyll a rmse 64 3 μg l 1 and nrmse 0 94 simulation of total chlorophyll a was at times visually inaccurate particularly in the more eutrophic pond but the normalized metrics e g nrmse were consistent between ponds and with literature values the model accurately predicted the trophic state in more than 60 of the observations and the distribution of phytoplankton community structure was simulated with marginal error average 7 chlorophyll a alone was not a suitable index to define trophic state in the ponds suspended algae and macro algae reduced pond aesthetics while competing with phytoplankton for nutrients and was coincident with lower phytoplankton biomass and increased water clarity simulated remediation strategies involving reduction of influent phosphorus and nitrogen fractions showed that the trophic state of each pond could be improved from mesotrophic eutrophic to oligotrophic mesotrophic states by reducing nutrient loads at least 50 keywords stormwater ponds biogeochemical modeling water quality algae nutrients caedym 1 introduction water bodies suffer from algal blooms because of excessive nutrient loads causing eutrophication where both suspended algae growth and rooted vegetation increase in response to nutrient enrichment diaz and rosenberg 2008 both natural e g lakes and constructed e g ponds water bodies undergo these anthropogenic effects often requiring water quality management to ensure public and ecosystem health stormwater ponds are used to control runoff mostly in urban areas by detaining peak flow and releasing it at a decreased rate with time stormwater ponds are also used to improve water quality reducing nutrient and pollutant levels from urban and suburban runoff removal of pollutants occurs from sedimentation adsorption and biological uptake which are dependent on the residence time in the pond hvitved jacobsen and yousef 1988 mallin et al 2002 however large nutrient loads to ponds associated with road yards and parks run off can lead to high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen resulting in eutrophication and algal blooms comings et al 2000 which are the main reasons for poor water quality in stormwater ponds e g wakelin et al 2003 enviromak 2005 lewitus et al 2008 liu et al 2008 siegel et al 2011 d aoust et al 2017 the present study investigated the water quality of two of the 185 stormwater ponds wetlands within the city of edmonton these ponds were considered because of complaints from nearby residents about odours and the presence of unsightly scum resulting from eutrophication a variety of methods have been utilized by the city of edmonton to attempt to improve water quality including aerators and using mechanical mixers lime alum babin et al 1989 aquatic herbicides e g reward barley straw the use of dyes e g aquashade and most recently applying a lanthanum la modified bentonite clay known as phoslock haghseresht et al 2009 liu et al 2009 the aerators herbicides and dyes produced discernible improvements in pond water quality i e reduced algae growth however installation and operation of aerators and mixers is expensive application of aquatic herbicides can be environmentally hazardous calderbank 1972 and aquashade boyd et al 1982 is no longer licensed for use in canada existing design equations for pond management have been developed according to reactor models such as a completely stirred tank reactor cstr or a plug flow reactor critically these models neglect spatial variability in hydrodynamics e g marchand 1997 brissaud et al 2003 sah et al 2012 including density stratification mcenroe et al 2013 rey et al 2017 this leads to poor characterization of in pond variability in residence time waste dispersion and removal efficiency e g nameche and vasel 1998 ukpong and agunwamba 2012 despite these shortcomings cstr and plug flow models are still used for pond design because of the significant time and cost requirements associated with constructing experimental or prototype ponds making them impractical for design purposes or even characterization of pond hydrodynamics e g nameche and vasel 1998 three dimensional 3d computational hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models are able to capture the impact of processes such as vertical circulation recirculation dead zones and short circuiting on water quality sah et al 2012 however application and validation of such models remains limited sah et al 2012 sah et al 2011 applied delft3d waq to simulate nutrient and e coli removal through a wastewater stabilization pond but because there was no observed data for model validation and specification of initial and boundary conditions parameterization of model coefficients was done based on published values thus preventing rigorous model validation more recently delft3d waq was applied to evaluate pond hydraulic retention time rey et al 2018 and they suggested that the plug flow assumption was not valid in all cases and that regular operational guidelines may not fully account for in pond mixing processes delft3d waq was able to reproduce observed seasonal dynamics and the treatment efficiency of a stabilization pond mahyari et al 2018 mahyari 2018 in the present study the computational aquatic ecosystem dynamics model caedym which is a water quality model coupled to the 3d hydrodynamic estuary and lake computer model elcom was used to simulate the biogeochemistry in the two edmonton stormwater ponds elcom caedym have been widely applied to simulate algae nutrient oxygen processes in freshwater systems trolle et al 2012 with scales ranging from the laurentian great lakes e g leon et al 2011 to shallow inland waters e g missaghi and hondzo 2010 importantly the model must be independently calibrated for each application and the ability of the model to reproduce the seasonal succession of phytoplankton and hence development of eutrophication and harmful algae blooms however the model has not been well validated against observational data missaghi and hondzo 2010 leon et al 2011 unlike 1d models most 3d numerical biogeochemical models e g caedym aed2 etc are process based and if they can be calibrated validated thoroughly a set of universal calibrated parameters for use in the model would facilitate the investigation of remediation strategies the response to stressors e g climate change the design of new ponds and they can be used as an initial set of parameters for calibrating other similar systems thus given the time and cost associated with application of these 3d models baracchini et al 2020 missaghi et al 2013 hipsey et al 2012 trolle et al 2008 it is desirable to have a universal set of parameters the objectives of the present study are to apply elcom caedym to the two edmonton stormwater ponds to 1 develop a common caedym parameter calibration set for stormwater ponds 2 simulate the seasonal succession of phytoplankton groups in comparison to observed data and 3 evaluate the ability of nutrient load controls to manage pond eutrophication and potential algal blooms 1 1 study sites and field measurements the mactaggart 2 mt2 and terwillegar towne 2 tt2 ponds table 1 investigated in this study were selected in consultation with the city of edmonton according to two important criteria a they are representative of stormwater ponds in edmonton in terms of their physical characteristics and b they have different algal growth conditions i e trophic state fig 1 shows bathymetric maps of the two ponds with the locations of inlets outlets and measurement stations labelled there were biweekly to monthly water quality sampling campaigns in 2014 doy day of year 148 to 230 and 2015 doy 133 to 231 sample analysis included total phosphorus tp soluble reactive phosphate po4 total nitrogen tn nitrate and nitrite no2 no3 ammonia nh4 total dissolved phosphorus tdp total particulate phosphorus tpp and chlorophyll a chla in 2014 there were surface samples at 0 5 1 0 m depths and in 2015 the samples were both from the surface 0 5 m and or 1 0 m deep and the bottom waters 1 5 m and or 2 0 m deep along with these measurements phytoplankton samples were collected together with chla biweekly to monthly from a depth integrated sample of the water column mainly in 2015 phytoplankton taxonomic groups were identified following the classification in freshwater algae in north america wehr et al 2015 and their relative abundance was recorded for each sample using chla used as a measure of the overall phytoplankton concentration details of the taxonomic analysis are provided in nakhaei 2017 in 2015 rbr duo loggers with temperature and dissolved oxygen do sensors accuracy of 0 002 c and 0 4 saturation respectively sampled every 10 min and ysi exo2 chla loggers accuracy of 0 01 μg l 1 calibrated using rhodamine dye sampled every 5 min in both ponds fig

sampled with periods of 10 7 and 10 minutes respectively to measure the water column temperature which were used for the boundary condition of the hydrodynamic model and model calibration meteorological data was acquired from a station at each pond hobo u30 located on a 7 3 m pole that sampled every 10 minutes solar radiation wind speed and direction air temperature relative humidity

description the 3d estuary and lake computer model elcom was dynamically coupled with the computational aquatic ecosystem dynamics model caedym to simulate pond biogeochemistry overviews of elcom and caedym are provided by hodges and dallimore 2012 and hipsey et al 2012 respectively elcom caedym has been shown to accurately model the hydrodynamics and water quality processes of stratified water bodies e g hodges et al 2000 laval et al 2003 of different scale from the laurentian great lakes e g huang et al 2010 paturi et al 2012 leon et al 2005 to smaller reservoirs e g lee et al 2013 chung et al 2009 hipsey et al 2004 xing et al 2014 elcom and caedym are presently distributed under the name aem3d by hydronumerics www hydronumerics com au elcom is a numerical tool to simulate the temporal and spatial variation of scalars i e temperature and salinity in stratified water bodies with environmental stress it solves the unsteady 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans mass conservation and scalar transport equations for incompressible flow using the hydrostatic assumption for pressure as divided into a rectangular z coordinate finite difference grid hodges and dallimore 2012 caedym is a general biogeochemical model that can simulate nutrient plankton and oxygen cycles plankton communities grow and can cause blooms at different rates according to seasonal changes in weather and nutrient conditions that sometimes favor species that produce toxins such as cyanobacteria zhang et al 2009 singh and singh 2015 the ability to reproduce these seasonal changes has been shown with elcom caedym but has not been extensively validated e g leon et al 2011 in the current study phytoplankton are represented as five groups cyanobacteria chlorophyte charophytes euglenozoan dinoflagellates cryptophytes diatom to capture functional diversity toxic cyanobacteria blue green algae are common in eutrophic water bodies and can have adverse effects on wildlife and humans vasconcelos and pereira 2001 thus there has been particular attention to modelling cyanobacteria e g fadel et al 2011 elliott 2012 ostfeld et al 2014 in this study charophytes and euglenozoan have been placed in the chlorophyte and dinoflagellates groups respectively due to their similarities lukes et al 2009 karol et al 2001 and to aid caedym calibration there are four mandatory phosphorus state variables that should be given in the model a soluble reactive phosphorus srp or po4 b labile dissolved organic phosphorus dopl c labile particulate organic phosphorus popl d algal internal phosphorus aip there are four mandatory variables for nitrogen in the model a nitrate no3 b ammonium nh4 c labile dissolved organic nitrogen donl d labile particulate organic nitrogen ponl there are other optional state variables for phosphorus and nitrogen e g particulate inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus pin and pip hipsey et al 2012 which have been considered in this research a schematic of the nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton group processes in caedym is shown in fig 2 some of the mandatory nutrients have been measured directly from water samples i e po4 no3 nh4 but others have been estimated from the measured forms following previous caedym applications i e león et al 2005 bolkhari 2014 in caedym there are two options to account for sediment diagenetic processes static and dynamic here we adopt the static model where sediment oxygen demand is a function of near bed do and water temperature hipsey et al 2012 caedym is the most widely applied and cited freshwater aquatic ecosystem model trolle et al 2012 it has been reported that the performance of coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical models is better for physical components than for to biological ones when simulating dynamics of planktonic systems arhonditsis and brett 2004 this was attributed to the scarce availability of biogeochemical data for initial conditions and calibration complexity of biogeochemical processes and insufficient calibration effort given that these models require significant time and effort for calibration there is a need to apply biogeochemical models to different systems to test the generality of the models and also to investigate needed improvements to the authors knowledge elcom caedym has not been applied to a constructed vegetated stormwater pond or a wetland as in the present application unlike caedym elcom remains relatively calibration free hodges 2000 nakhaei et al 2019 2 2 model calibration setup and initial and boundary conditions details of the model setup and runs are given in table 2 the model bathymetry file was prepared from survey data collected in 2014 by real time kinematic gps coupled to a depth sounder measurements of water levels in the ponds and the outlet structures combined with mass balance calculations using the epa storm water management model were used to estimate inflow outflow time series temperature profiles from each station were spatially interpolated to initialize the temperature field while initial velocities were set to zero due to the inability to sample water quality within the inlet structures limited access and h2s concerns measurements of the inflow boundary conditions for water quality and temperature were obtained from in situ observations directly adjacent to each inlet structure fig 1 since all of the inlets are submerged these inflow boundary conditions were the deep measurements in 2015 and due to lack of deep water samples the surface samples in 2014 caedym requires calibration of a large number of biogeochemical parameters hipsey et al 2012 with runtimes for a single 6 month elcom caedym simulation ranging from 8 days present study to 3 weeks leon et al 2011 it is preferable to begin calibration with a pre existing calibration set due to their availability and similar focus on simulation of phytoplankton succession we initially evaluated the use of caedym parameter sets obtained during calibrations for lake erie leon et al 2011 their appendix c and lake minnetonka missaghi and hondzo 2010 starting with these parameter sets we systematically changed model parameters table 3 guided by literature values and reported sensitivity analysis e g missaghi et al 2013 leon et al 2011 the root mean square error rmse between the model and observations converged to within acceptable ranges reported in the literature this process involved more than 125 runs each taking 8 days on a 3 6 ghz xeon server rmse and normalized rmse nrmse derived by dividing rmse by the observed mean were used to define the error between measured and modeled values the parameters for different phytoplankton groups were tuned through comparison to the measured and observed chla rather than the group specific observations due to time constraints and to simplify the calibration procedure published applications of caedym have quantified model performance using metrics such as rmse and nrmse e g mcbride et al 2014 trolle et al 2008 trolle et al 2014 allan 2016 missaghi and hondzo 2010 silva et al 2014 the range of error for different modeled water quality components varied significantly e g 0 17 nrmse 1 52 indicating the difficulty of calibrating complex models such as caedym however model accuracy has been improving over the past several decades e g historically an order of magnitude error was acceptable boegman 1999 and it has been shown that spatial dynamic water quality models help to better understand the ecological functioning of lakes mooij et al 2010 therefore we adopt rmse and nrmse as metrics to assess model performance within the pre existing literature ultimately a single set of calibration parameters for both ponds was obtained table 3 nrmse is an indicator of error that avoids scale dependency unlike rmse shcherbakov et al 2013 however in cases when the rmse is small e g lower than or close to the observed detection limit nrmse can give a misleading definition of model capability prior elcom calibration suggested that special attention was required to eliminate light inhibition and nutrient related migration of phytoplankton to account for shading from macrophytes nakhaei et al 2019 a vertical gradient in temperature of 10 c over a height of 2 m was both observed and modeled in three edmonton ponds mt2 tt2 and sb4 nakhaei et al 20198 a similar density gradient in an ontario pond rey et al 2021b was found to regulate the vertical distribution of biogeochemical parameters mahyari 2018 in the present study we extend limited field observations by simulating the 3d spatial biogeochemical gradients in the pond 2 3 trophic state and remediation strategies the reduction of phytoplankton biomass has been reported to be dependent on the magnitude of the reduction in external phosphorus loading mardsen 1989 carpenter et al 1998 schindler 2006 to investigate the effectiveness of nutrient reductions to control algae growth in the edmonton stormwater ponds several remediation scenarios were modeled previous studies have investigated both phosphorus and nitrogen reduction e g trolle et al 2008 zhang and rao 2012 bocaniov et al 2016 in this study 25 50 and 75 reduction in nutrients were applied po4 dopl popl pip nh4 no3 donl ponl pin to investigate the impact on simulated chla meteorology inflows outflows and initial conditions remained unchanged a trophic index carlson 1977 based on chla was used to define the state of the ponds during each of the reduction scenarios 3 results 3 1 model calibration visual comparisons between the calibrated model and observed nutrient concentrations po4 tp no3 nh4 and tn do chla and temperature are given in figs 3 and 4 associated rmse and nrmse are presented in table 4 details on the hydrodynamic calibration of elcom are given in a corresponding paper nakhaei et al 2019 3 1 1 nutrients the modeled tp and po4 were visually consistent with observations at station ne near the dominant inlet in tt2 fig 3 in general the prediction of near surface po4 was better in 2015 compared with 2014 by a factor of 10 table 4 however nrmse was marginally higher in 2015 0 25 which can be misleading as it is correlated with the much lower rmse simulation of surface tp was slightly less accurate in both years than that of the bottom rmse 0 016 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 18 table 4 trends of increasing or decreasing tp and po4 over monthly timescales were predicted by the model fig 3 doy 200 to 220 in 2015 for tp and doy 150 to 200 in 2014 for po4 in general nrmse for po4 and tp showed that the model predicted tp with more accuracy than po4 with the average nrmse being almost three times lower table 4 tt2 has been shown to have a thermally stratified 3m water column due to a 10 c difference between the surface and bottom temperature fig 3 this is sufficient 0 1 cm 1 to inhibit mixing in the water column boegman et al 2008 similar thermal stratification has been observed in other ponds at temperate latitudes 5 c over 1 m rey et al 2017 confirming that fully mixed modelling approaches e g cstr fail to capture pond dynamics to first order the combined effects of submerged inlets and inhibited mixing explain higher nutrient concentrations tp tn nh4 no3 po4 near the bottom than at the surface e g doy 160 to 230 of 2015 in tp fig 3 modeled po4 and tp were visually consistent at most times with the measured data fig 4 at station nw in mt2 similar to the station ne in tt2 as an example the model predicted sudden increases in po4 concentration close to the bed e g doy 172 of 2015 fig 4 but missed the increase in tp close to the bed e g doy 145 of 2015 fig 4 at the surface the modeled po4 nrmse ranged from 0 3 to 0 8 which was roughly half the nrmse near the bed table 4 overall the average rmse for tp was 3 times lower in mt2 than tt2 table 4 but the average nrmse was roughly the same for both ponds nrmse 0 3 table 4 simulated nitrogen concentrations were generally in good visual agreement with the measured data except for some underestimations at mt2 in 2015 e g doy 160 figs 3 and 4 lower model predicted values of nh4 tn and no3 near the surface and higher ones near the bottom were consistent with the measurements e g doy 200 and doy 218 in 2015 for nh4 and tn fig 3 of the modeled nitrogen fractions no3 had the largest error in both years and for both ponds average rmse 0 1 mg l 1 for tt2 and 0 35 for mt2 mg l 1 nrmse 2 87 for tt2 and 2 91 for mt2 fig 3 table 4 the model predicted elevated tn and nh4 concentrations e g doy 172 doy 202 and doy 218 in 2015 fig 3 but with a time lag of 2 days the modeled nh4 and tn in tt2 also agreed well visually with the surface and bottom measurements fig 3 table 4 the rmse at stations nw and ce was 1 mg l 1 table 4 but the average nrmse 0 43 was consistent with the visual examination of the fitness the modeled nh4 no3 and tn in mt2 had higher error 40 higher rmse in comparison with tt2 fig 4 table 4 but the average nrmse was within the same range as in tt2 table 4 for example the simulated near bottom nh4 concentration underestimated the measurements e g on doy 230 of 2015 at station nw fig 4 by 0 2 mg l 1 table 4 and this resulted in higher rmse 0 16 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 06 table 4 similarly the modeled tn and no3 near the bottom also underestimated the measurements at station nw 2015 resulting in the highest rmse in mt2 2 mg l 1 for no3 and tn fig 4 table 4 a tukey comparison test tukey 1949 shows that the nrmse of tp q s 0 29 and tn q s 0 23 between the two ponds are not significantly different and consequently the model had similar accuracy prediction of nutrients in both ponds 3 1 2 dissolved oxygen the simulated do concentrations were well confirmed with the measured time series for both ponds average rmse 2 26 mg l 1 average nrmse 0 58 for tt2 and average rmse 1 88 mg l 1 average nrmse 0 53 for mt2 fig 3 table 4 the model underestimated the do near the surface of tt2 rmse 3 87 mg l 1 nrmse 0 5 but captured the general trend over time e g doy 135 to 155 in 2015 doy 200 to 205 in 2015 fig 3 the over production of do likely resulted from macrophyte photosynthesis caedym is unable to model rooted vegetation as the model correctly simulates do at saturation 8 1 9 8 mg l 1 for water temperature ranges between 17 27 c but the observed do approaches 15 mg l 1 fig 3 doy 155 175 and doy 185 225 the modeled do for mt2 was more accurate than for tt2 with simulated bottom concentrations agreeing better with the measurements rmse 1 44 mg l 1 nrmse 0 54 than near surface ones rmse 2 32 mg l 1 nrmse 0 52 fig 4 for deeper tt2 the do depleted as chla increased and the water column became anoxic by doy 224 station ne doy 134 in 2015 fig 4 shows that the water column at station nw of mt2 was modelled and observed to be hypoxic for most of the simulation and became anoxic from doy 220 to 235 in 2015 thereafter increasing as a result of photosynthetic production 3 1 3 chlorophyll a chla the model predictions of chla were in closer agreement with measurements from the chla logger than with the water sample data in tt2 average rmse 25 8 μg l 1 and 62 4 μg l 1 respectively and nrmse 0 45 and 0 92 respectively the chla logger data was only available near the surface at station ne tt2 in 2015 figs 1 3 and 5 whereas the modeled chla was compared to chla samples for deeper layers in 2015 there are inaccuracies in the modeled chla compared with the 2014 water sample data in tt2 fig 3 rmse 34 76 μg l 1 and nrmse 1 6 especially for doy 197 when the model predicted the correct chla concentration but at 1 5 m deeper than the sample depth fig 3 similar spatial inaccuracy occurred near the surface in tt2 at station ne in 2015 compared to chla samples fig 3 e g doy 160 205 and 218 due to this underestimation of surface chla the rmse of chla near the surface ranged from 34 76 to 102 1 μg l 1 0 84 nrmse 1 6 the predicted bottom chla values were better in comparison to the observations than at the surface 2 16 rmse 63 1 μg l 1 and 0 02 nrmse 0 83 the model was able to predict the lower bound of the logger observed chla time series in tt2 in 2015 fig 5a and was able to follow the trend of the observed chla water sample data in mt2 in 2015 fig 5b decreasing to a minimum at doy 202 3 μg l 1 and then increasing toward the end of the modeling period doy 240 the chla rmse was lower for mt2 than for tt2 particularly near the surface table 4 2 18 rmse 7 76 μg l 1 this was likely because there was less overall chla in mt2 than in tt2 by a factor of 5 in both the measurements and model the higher concentrations led to some visual inaccuracies in simulating chla in tt2 near the surface e g station ne on doy 193 in 2014 and doy 160 in 2014 fig 3 however using the same set of calibration parameters did give similar normalized error nrmse 0 94 in both ponds near the surface at station nw in mt2 the model underestimated the observations but could still predict peaks in chla fig 4 doy 230 2015 and 165 2014 the near bed chla rmse and nrmse varied more than at the surface in mt2 a tukey multiple comparison test revealed that the difference between the near surface and near bed chla nrmse was significant q s 5 43 this supports the more accurate prediction of chla near the bed compared to the surface fig 3 fig 4 and table 4 the tukey test also revealed that the differences in chla nrmse between the stations within each pond were also significant q s 2 14 for tt2 and q s 4 03 for mt2 table 4 however the chla nrmse between the two ponds was not significantly different q s 0 24 confirming that while model accuracy varies within each pond there was similar overall accuracy in predicting the chla concentration between ponds these results show that while it was more accurate to predict lower chla concentrations lower rmse in mt2 and lower rmse near the bed the relative error as given by the nrmse remained consistent 3 1 4 phytoplankton groups the community dynamics of 5 different types of phytoplankton groups cyanobacteria chlorophyte charophytes euglenozoan dinoflagellates cryptophytes diatom were modeled table 5 figs 5 and 6 cyanobacteria chlorophytes charophytes and euglenozoan dinoflagellates were the dominant species in that order observed in both ponds at station ne in tt2 predicted cyanobacteria biomass peaked around doy 220 90 fig 5a which may be related to increasing nutrient concentrations from doy 205 to doy 225 e g tp and tn fig 3 during this period the measured chla increased and modeled chla remained steady fig 5a with nutrients in the water column benefiting chlorophytes charophytes over other groups except cyanobacteria e g doy 170 to 190 and doy 200 to 220 figs 3 and 5 the sum of cryptophytes and diatoms were less than 2 at station ne in tt2 and less than 5 at station ce in tt2 both in the model and in the measurements which indicates that the model could simulate the distribution of these groups with reasonable accuracy at station ne in tt2 the model predicted the distribution of cyanobacteria euglenozoan dinoflagellates and chlorophytes charophytes with less than 10 error except for doy 160 where there was up to 27 error fig 5 table 5 on this day doy 160 the model underestimated the cyanobacteria and as a result overestimated the other two dominant groups fig 5 overall the model predicted the contribution of the dominant groups cyanobacteria euglenozoan dinoflagellates and chlorophyte charophytes with less than 30 error except for some measurements at station ce doy 189 and 203 table 5 at station nw of mt2 the measured and modeled chla dropped from 25 μg l 1 on doy 134 to 2 μg l 1 on doy 202 which may be related to phosphorus limitation figs 4 and 5b during this period the predominance of cyanobacteria increased to 80 of the total chla on doy 202 but in absolute terms was low because of low total of chla starting from doy 200 po4 increased up to 0 01 mg l 1 with chla until doy 240 6 μg l 1 in the model fig 5b with excess po4 the chlorophytes charophytes increased to 50 of total chla observed on doy 230 and modelled on doy 240 which suppressed cyanobacteria 35 on doy 240 fig 5b this was likely driven by the increase in the water temperature from 10 c to 30 c doy 175 until doy 240 fig 4 as chlorophytes charophytes were set to have optimal growth at 25 c which is higher than other groups except cyanobacteria that is also 25 c e g euglenozoan dinoflagellate optimum temperature 22 c as in tt2 the model agreed well with the measurements of diatoms and cryptophytes 1 error at stations nw and se in mt2 table 5 fig 5b although the model reproduced the general trend at nw and se in mt2 there were inaccuracies in predicting the contribution of cyanobacteria and euglenozoan dinoflagellates in the total chla up to 40 table 5 fig 5b fig 6 in general the model was able to predict the distribution of total chla in the algae groups consistently in both ponds with more than 70 accuracy 65 of sample and less than 10 error 55 of samples fig 6 excluding diatoms and cryptophytes non dominant groups with 5 of total chla in both ponds which the model predicted with good accuracy 1 difference the model predicted the majority of other groups with lower than 30 40 error fig 6 there were some overestimations which mostly occurred when the observed algae group was less than 20 of total chla fig 6 this was likely attributed to one or two of the dominant groups cyanobacteria euglenozoan dinoflagellates and chlorophyte charophytes being low causing it to be more difficult for the model to capture the balance between the groups and to predict the groups with lower than 20 of the total chla accurately fig 6 3 2 trophic state and nutrient reduction scenarios tt2 and mt2 ranged from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic in the model with better water quality in mt2 during 2014 and 2015 fig 7 was generated by averaging through the water column to estimate the general trophic state of the ponds based on the chla concentration in the different scenarios comparing the observed chla at different depths with the modeled depth averaged chla showed that they were in agreement in terms of the trophic state in more than 60 of the observations 46 for tt2 and 77 for mt2 figs 7 the model showed that at the start of the season tt2 was oligotrophic in 2014 and remained in that state for 30 of the modeling period until doy 180 fig 7a which is consistent with the near surface observations fig 3 tt2 was predicted to be eutrophic and mesotrophic in 30 and 40 of the modeling period of 2014 respectively fig 7a a near surface measurement showed that tt2 became hypereutrophic on doy 200 in 2014 and the model predicted a change from eutrophic to mesotrophic at approximately the same figs 3 and 7a unlike 2014 in 2015 tt2 was predicted to be eutrophic and mesotrophic over 70 and 25 of the time respectively fig 7b the near bed and surface observations agreed well with the model as they started in a hypereutrophic state and then as in the model became eutrophic on doy 145 figs 3 and 7b afterwards the modelled chla increased and tt2 became eutrophic doy 180 to 230 despite inaccuracies in the modeled chla a similar increasing trend was evident in the measurements at both depths as they showed a change to eutrophic e g near surface doy 190 and hypereutrophic e g near bed and surface doy 202 states figs 3 and 7b in 2014 the model predicted that mt2 was mostly mesotrophic 90 of the modeling period but was briefly oligotrophic as well doy 148 152 and doy 210 220 fig 7c the measurements near the surface had the same trophic state as the model for mt2 in 2014 oligotrophic from doy 177 to doy 219 and mesotrophic on doy 230 with the exception of doy 163 which showed a eutrophic state when the model was mesotrophic figs 4 and 7c in 2015 the model began as eutrophic in mt2 same as the measurements and then changed to mesotrophic until doy 165 the measurements indicated a mesotrophic state on doy 160 and then as the model changes from oligotrophic to mesotrophic doy 215 240 the measurements showed the same trophic state as the model doys 216 and 229 figs 4 and 7d in general similar to 2014 the model predicted mt2 to be mostly mesotrophic 60 and oligotrophic for the rest of the modelling period doy 170 215 fig 7d the 0 and 25 reduction scenarios in tt2 showed eutrophication during summer e g doy 205 220 in 2014 and doy 190 220 in 2015 fig 7a and 7b however for the 50 and 75 reduction scenarios the chla concentration never exceeded 20 μg l 1 mesotrophic except for doy 134 to 150 in 2015 and doy 240 to 245 in 2014 none of the scenarios changed the trophic condition to oligotrophic excluding the first 35 days of 2014 when tt2 was oligotrophic for all scenarios fig 7a the modeled chla concentrations 0 reduction scenario in mt2 were less 3 times and 6 times in 2014 and 2015 respectively than in tt2 causing mt2 to be mesotrophic oligotrophic in 2014 15 fig 7c and 7d in 2015 all scenarios resulted in similar chla concentrations from doy 133 to doy 210 1 5 μg l 1 difference and a slight increase thereafter until doy 240 by the end of the simulation only the 75 nutrient reduction scenario caused an oligotrophic state fig 7d it was also oligotrophic in 2014 for the whole modeling period at station nw in mt2 the 50 and 25 nutrient reduction resulted in an oligotrophic state by the end of the simulation doy 180 to 234 however from doy 155 to doy 180 the chla was above 2 6 μg l 1 mesotrophic for both the 50 and 25 nutrient reduction scenarios overall at least 75 reduction of nutrients in tt2 and 50 reduction of nutrients in mt2 were required to change the trophic state to mesotrophic oligotrophic the initial chla concentrations which were based on measurements were much higher in the spring of 2015 doy 134 than of 2014 doy 148 fig 7 the subsequent decrease of chla in 2015 by doy 160 in both ponds showed the concentrations to approach the lower 2014 levels fig 7b and 5d 4 discussion given the effort required to calibrate a multi parameter 3d biogeochemical model one of the ultimate goals of our process based water quality simulation is to determine a single set of calibration parameters that can be universally applied to systems with different characteristics it has been shown that thermal stratification can occur in ponds and fully mixed modelling approaches e g cstr are not able to fully capture the pond hydrodynamics e g losordo and piedrahita 1991 song et al 2013 rey et al 2017 in this study we found that caedym parameter sets for lake erie leon et al 2011 and lake minnetonka missaghi and hondzo 2010 required significant tuning for calibration 125 runs a single calibration set was ultimately achieved for the two ponds considered in this study and it was within the ranges suggested in the literature e g gal et al 2009 missaghi and hondzo 2010 leon et al 2011 mcbride et al 2014 allan 2016 table 3 for both ponds using the single set of calibration parameters the calculated average rmse and nrmse for do n and p fractions table 4 were comparable with error ranges reported in the literature with the exception of modeled no3 which had a higher error in both ponds trolle et al 2008 used dyresm caedym to model lake ravn denmark and calculated that for po4 tp and do the rmse was 0 061 mg l 1 0 074 mg l 1 and 2 64 mg l 1 respectively they also reported nrmse of 0 27 for tp 0 13 for tn and 0 32 for do elcom caedym has also been used to model lake benmore new zealand trolle et al 2014 and the nrmse was 0 28 1 52 and 0 17 for tn tp and do respectively this demonstrates that while a universal calibration set may not be attainable i e for lake erie lake minnetonka and edmonton storm water ponds calibration sets with acceptable accuracy are achievable for systems with common physical characteristics and different trophic states e g mt2 and tt2 when rmse was low nrmse was a misleading metric to judge model performance for example the model predicted nh4 and no3 at station se tt2 in 2015 had rmse lower than the detection limit indicating a good accuracy however the nrmse were high 0 4 and 0 7 respectively table 4 generally no3 has been reported to be harder to model with caedym as an example mcbride et al 2014 modeled lake tikitapu new zealand using dyresm caedym and no3 had an rmse 0 015 mg l 1 and nrmse 3 6 they simulated nh4 rmse 0 014 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 3 tn rmse 0 08 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 35 po4 rmse 0 002 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 1 tp rmse 0 008 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 1 and do rmse 2 5 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 47 with smaller uncertainties than no3 similarly in another application of dyresm caedym to a small shallow lake lake ohinewai new zealnd no3 was modeled with a higher uncertainty rmse 0 25 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 2 compared to nh4 rmse 0 23 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 23 tn rmse 0 73 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 36 po4 rmse 0 02 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 15 and tp rmse 0 06 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 3 allan 2016 despite of the high rmse and nrmse for no3 in the current study the rmse and nrmse for different parameters including no3 lay within the corresponding values in the literature table 4 although there were some visual inaccuracies in simulating chla and differences in chla rmse between ponds the metrics used to quantify model error chla rmse were comparable to those from an application of caedym by trolle et al 2008 who reported rmse of 10 4 and 12 8 μg l 1 and nrmse of 0 88 and trolle et al 2014 who reported 0 2 nrmse 1 37 in mt2 the chla rmse was between 2 18 and 7 76 μg l 1 which is more accurate than trolle et al 2008 and the nrmse 0 94 which is within the range of their work other studies also reported inaccuracy in modeling systems with high chla for example elcom caedym applications to lake minnetonka missaghi and hondzo 2010 and rio de la plata silva et al 2014 resulted in predictions of chla that were 110 μg l 1 lower than observations other water quality models also underestimated observed chla by 100 μg l 1 e g wasp6 chao et al 2005 arhonditsis and brett 2005 this underestimation as in the present study for tt2 may be related to the difficulty in modeling the inherent patchiness in algae which is typically below the model horizontal grid resolution despite these underestimations the model was successfully able to predict the trophic state of the ponds based on chla in more than 60 of the measurements as the modeled chla was less accurate for tt2 compared to mt2 table 4 the model trophic state prediction was also more accurate for mt2 77 compared to tt2 46 biogeochemical models are still under development hipsey et al 2012 reynolds 2006 and more accurate understanding of the vertical distribution of algae from migration related to nutrient limitation or light inhabitation may result in more accurate simulation of chla while increasing model complexity the simulation of seasonal phytoplankton succession and direct comparisons with observational data e g fig 5 compared to leon et al 2011 their fig 6 and missaghi and hondzo 2010 their fig 5 will serve to improve model performance this was achieved by allowing for different functional groups to respond individually to availability of light nutrients and temperature e g to capture both spring diatom bloom and summer cyanobacteria bloom to our knowledge there are only a few reports of direct comparisons between measured and modelled algae community structure e g trolle et al 2008 bolkhari 2014 and these have been limited to the 1d dyresm caedym version of the model mt2 was ranked as having poorer water quality than tt2 table 1 because of resident complaints driven by cladophora blooms however based on quantitative measures i e water sample analysis and model predictions mt2 is classified as a mesotrophic system whereas tt2 is eutrophic table 1 and fig 7 these conflicting classifications are likely due to the extensive rooted aquatic vegetation macrophytes present in all areas of the pond except the small deepest areas located at the inlets and outlet in mt2 tt2 was more turbid with suspended algae and has rooted macrophytes only at the perimeter in shallow regions near the shore 1 m fig 8 tt2 has a greater mean depth than mt2 suggesting rooted vegetation is shaded by suspended algae and suspended sediment shallower ponds therefore may favor growth of rooted aquatic vegetation which limits nutrient availability to suspended algae and improves water quality as measured by the trophic index fig 7 but the trophic state does not necessarily correlate with public perceptions of a pond s water quality these results suggest that the chla alone is not a suitable index to define trophic state in shallow stormwater ponds bayley and prather 2003 investigated 148 wetland lakes in alberta and classified them based on the predominance of phytoplankton or submerged aquatic vegetation they reported that the phytoplankton dominated systems have higher chla more than 10 times and higher nutrient concentration more than 2 times tp and roughly similar po4 and tn than vegetation dominated systems this agrees well with the results from tt2 phytoplankton dominated and mt2 vegetation dominated it has also been reported that aquatic vegetation macrophytes can significantly decrease phytoplankton biomass and can increase water clarity in shallow lakes mcqueen 1990 demelo et al 1992 where macrophytes apparently suppress phytoplankton growth szczepański 1977 wium andersen et al 1982 therefore chla concentrations in vegetation dominated systems e g mt2 are lower than in phytoplankton dominated systems e g tt2 generally shallow ponds e g mt2 are more efficient in maintaining do at all depths but rooted vegetation can cause problems porges and mackenthun 1963 unlike deeper ponds that can have lower light penetration and higher chla throughout the water column the more oxic water column in shallower ponds can result in less internal nutrient loading from the sediments compared to deeper ponds søndergaard et al 2003 similar to this study modeled nutrient reduction scenarios has been considered in previous studies as possible remediation strategies to control algae growth for example trolle et al 2008 reported a minimum of 40 50 reduction in nutrients are needed for chla concentrations to meet the eu water framework directive for lake ravn in this study the modeled scenarios showed that at least a 50 reduction of nutrients is required to change the trophic state zhang and rao 2012 used wasp to model the effect of up to a 20 reduction of phosphorus and 20 reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus to lake winnipeg canada they reported that in some parts of the lake the maximum reduction of chla by annual average of 2 3 μg l 1 was achieved with 20 reduction of phosphorus alone 5 conclusion strong vertical spatial gradients in water column thermal structure and water quality state variables were observed in the edmonton ponds e g 10 c 0 1 mg l 1 po4 0 5 mg l 1 total p and 50 μg l 1 chlorophyll a over 3m in agreement with other observations showing ponds in temperate regions to be incompletely mixed systems to capture these gradients and to model their response to management scenarios 3d models are required in this study we attempted to simulate two different edmonton stormwater ponds with the 3d elcom caedym water quality model using a single set of calibration coefficients despite differences in their trophic state and phytoplankton community structure the calibration parameter set differed from those used for larger lakes lake erie and lake minnetonka the calibration metrics rmse were comparable in both ponds with the exception of chla rmse which was higher in the hypereutrophic eutrophic system tt2 relative to the oligotrophic mesotrophic mt2 pond which was consistent with the poor visual comparisons to chla extractions in tt2 despite this inaccuracy the normalized metrics chla nrmse were not significantly different between systems and in comparison to values in the literature demonstrating that complex multi parameter biogeochemical models may be generally calibrated with similar normalized error for systems of comparable size in the same local region caedym predicted nitrogen tn no3 and nh4 phosphorus po4 and tp and do concentrations with rmse and nrmse of 0 76 mg l 1 and 0 44 tn 0 35 mg l 1 and 2 91 no3 0 06 mg l 1 and 0 95 nh4 0 014 mg l 1 and 0 9 po4 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 31 tp and 2 26 mg l 1 and 0 53 do respectively caedym simulated chla more accurately when the system was not phytoplankton dominated and was oligotrophic mesotrophic mt2 in comparison to the hypereutrophic eutrophic system tt2 we speculate that patchiness of algae which is difficult to model in caedym and can be affected by the grid size may increase as the chla increases resulting in error in the simulated results despite inaccuracies in predicting chla and some nutrient components the model was successful in forecasting the trophic state over 60 of the time as well as trends in chla in order to control algae blooms and reduce chla the model predictions showed that at least a 50 nutrient reduction was likely needed it was also found that chla alone was not a suitable index to define the pond trophic state prolific macrophyte growth also significantly reduced pond aesthetics while being coincident with lower phytoplankton biomass and increased water clarity therefore future work should focus on the development of the models that can consider nutrient uptake by aquatic vegetation relative to phytoplankton

24587,a three dimensional coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model was applied to simulate and investigate causes of eutrophication in two stormwater ponds in the city of edmonton alberta canada the ponds differ in shape surface area depth and trophic state strong spatial gradients in water column thermal structure and water quality state variables were observed e g 10 c 0 1 mg l 1 po4 0 5 mg l 1 total p and 50 μg l 1 chlorophyll a over 3m showing the ponds were incompletely mixed systems using a single set of calibration parameters which differed from calibrations to larger systems the model

particularly in the more eutrophic pond but the normalized metrics e g nrmse were consistent between ponds and with literature values the model accurately predicted the trophic state in more than 60 of the observations and the distribution of phytoplankton community structure was simulated with marginal error average 7 chlorophyll a alone was not a suitable index to define trophic state in the ponds suspended algae and macro algae reduced pond aesthetics while competing with phytoplankton for nutrients and was coincident with lower phytoplankton biomass and increased water clarity simulated remediation strategies involving reduction of influent phosphorus and nitrogen fractions showed that the trophic state of each pond could be improved from mesotrophic eutrophic to oligotrophic mesotrophic states by reducing nutrient loads at least 50 keywords stormwater ponds biogeochemical modeling water quality algae nutrients caedym 1 introduction water bodies suffer from algal blooms because of excessive nutrient loads causing eutrophication where both suspended algae growth and rooted vegetation increase in response to nutrient enrichment diaz and rosenberg 2008 both natural e g lakes and constructed e g ponds water bodies undergo these anthropogenic effects often requiring water quality management to ensure public and ecosystem health stormwater ponds are used to control runoff mostly in urban areas by detaining peak flow and releasing it at a decreased rate with time stormwater ponds are also used to improve water quality reducing nutrient and pollutant levels from urban and suburban runoff removal of pollutants occurs from sedimentation adsorption and biological uptake which are dependent on the residence time in the pond hvitved jacobsen and yousef 1988 mallin et al 2002 however large nutrient loads to ponds associated with road yards and parks run off can lead to high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen resulting in eutrophication and algal blooms comings et al 2000 which are the main reasons for poor water quality in stormwater ponds e g wakelin et al 2003 enviromak 2005 lewitus et al 2008 liu et al 2008 siegel et al 2011 d aoust et al 2017 the present study investigated the water quality of two of the 185 stormwater ponds wetlands within the city of edmonton these ponds were considered because of complaints from nearby residents about odours and the presence of unsightly scum resulting from eutrophication a variety of methods have been utilized by the city of edmonton to attempt to improve water quality including aerators and using mechanical mixers lime alum babin et al 1989 aquatic herbicides e g reward barley straw the use of dyes e g aquashade and most recently applying a lanthanum la modified bentonite clay known as phoslock haghseresht et al 2009 liu et al 2009 the aerators herbicides and dyes produced discernible improvements in pond water quality i e reduced algae growth however installation and operation of aerators and mixers is expensive application of aquatic herbicides can be environmentally hazardous calderbank 1972 and aquashade boyd et al 1982 is no longer licensed for use in canada existing design equations for pond management have been developed according to reactor models such as a completely stirred tank reactor cstr or a plug flow reactor critically these models neglect spatial variability in hydrodynamics e g marchand 1997 brissaud et al 2003 sah et al 2012 including density stratification mcenroe et al 2013 rey et al 2017 this leads to poor characterization of in pond variability in residence time waste dispersion and removal efficiency e g nameche and vasel 1998 ukpong and agunwamba 2012 despite these shortcomings cstr and plug flow models are still used for pond design because of the significant time and cost requirements associated with constructing experimental or prototype ponds making them impractical for design purposes or even characterization of pond hydrodynamics e g nameche and vasel 1998 three dimensional 3d computational hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models are able to capture the impact of processes such as vertical circulation recirculation dead zones and short circuiting on water quality sah et al 2012 however application and validation of such models remains limited sah et al 2012 sah et al 2011 applied delft3d waq to simulate nutrient and e coli removal through a wastewater stabilization pond but because there was no observed data for model validation and specification of initial and boundary conditions parameterization of model coefficients was done based on published values thus preventing rigorous model validation more recently delft3d waq was applied to evaluate pond hydraulic retention time rey et al 2018 and they suggested that the plug flow assumption was not valid in all cases and that regular operational guidelines may not fully account for in pond mixing processes delft3d waq was able to reproduce observed seasonal dynamics and the treatment efficiency of a stabilization pond mahyari et al 2018 mahyari 2018 in the present study the computational aquatic ecosystem dynamics model caedym which is a water quality model coupled to the 3d hydrodynamic estuary and lake computer model elcom was used to simulate the biogeochemistry in the two edmonton stormwater ponds elcom caedym have been widely applied to simulate algae nutrient oxygen processes in freshwater systems trolle et al 2012 with scales ranging from the laurentian great lakes e g leon et al 2011 to shallow inland waters e g missaghi and hondzo 2010 importantly the model must be independently calibrated for each application and the ability of the model to reproduce the seasonal succession of phytoplankton and hence development of eutrophication and harmful algae blooms however the model has not been well validated against observational data missaghi and hondzo 2010 leon et al 2011 unlike 1d models most 3d numerical biogeochemical models e g caedym aed2 etc are process based and if they can be calibrated validated thoroughly a set of universal calibrated parameters for use in the model would facilitate the investigation of remediation strategies the response to stressors e g climate change the design of new ponds and they can be used as an initial set of parameters for calibrating other similar systems thus given the time and cost associated with application of these 3d models baracchini et al 2020 missaghi et al 2013 hipsey et al 2012 trolle et al 2008 it is desirable to have a universal set of parameters the objectives of the present study are to apply elcom caedym to the two edmonton stormwater ponds to 1 develop a common caedym parameter calibration set for stormwater ponds 2 simulate the seasonal succession of phytoplankton groups in comparison to observed data and 3 evaluate the ability of nutrient load controls to manage pond eutrophication and potential algal blooms 1 1 study sites and field measurements the mactaggart 2 mt2 and terwillegar towne 2 tt2 ponds table 1 investigated in this study were selected in consultation with the city of edmonton according to two important criteria a they are representative of stormwater ponds in edmonton in terms of their physical characteristics and b they have different algal growth conditions i e trophic state fig 1 shows bathymetric maps of the two ponds with the locations of inlets outlets and measurement stations labelled there were biweekly to monthly water quality sampling campaigns in 2014 doy day of year 148 to

particulate phosphorus tpp and chlorophyll a chla in 2014 there were surface samples at 0 5 1 0 m depths and in 2015 the samples were both from the surface 0 5 m and or 1 0 m deep and the bottom waters 1 5 m and or 2 0 m deep along with these measurements phytoplankton samples were collected together with chla biweekly to monthly from a depth integrated sample of the water column mainly in 2015 phytoplankton taxonomic groups were identified following the classification in freshwater algae in north america wehr et al 2015 and their relative abundance was recorded for each sample using chla used as a measure of the overall phytoplankton concentration details of the taxonomic analysis are provided in nakhaei 2017 in 2015 rbr duo loggers with temperature and dissolved oxygen do

caedym are provided by hodges and dallimore 2012 and hipsey et al 2012 respectively elcom caedym has been shown to accurately model the hydrodynamics and water quality processes of stratified water

et al 2009 hipsey et al 2004 xing et al 2014 elcom and caedym are presently distributed under the name aem3d by hydronumerics www hydronumerics com au elcom is a numerical tool to simulate the temporal and spatial variation of scalars i e temperature and salinity in stratified water bodies with environmental stress it solves the unsteady 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans mass conservation and scalar transport equations for incompressible flow using the hydrostatic assumption for pressure as divided into a rectangular z coordinate finite difference grid hodges and dallimore 2012 caedym is a general biogeochemical model that can simulate nutrient plankton and oxygen cycles plankton communities grow and can cause blooms at different rates according to seasonal changes in weather and nutrient conditions that sometimes favor species that produce toxins such as cyanobacteria zhang et al 2009 singh and singh 2015 the ability to reproduce these seasonal changes has been shown with elcom caedym but has not been extensively validated e g leon et al 2011 in the current study phytoplankton are represented as five groups cyanobacteria chlorophyte charophytes euglenozoan dinoflagellates cryptophytes diatom to capture functional diversity toxic cyanobacteria blue green algae are common in eutrophic water bodies and can have adverse effects on wildlife and humans vasconcelos and pereira 2001 thus there has been particular attention to modelling cyanobacteria e g fadel et al 2011 elliott 2012 ostfeld et al 2014 in this study charophytes and euglenozoan have been placed in the chlorophyte and dinoflagellates groups respectively due to their similarities lukes et al 2009 karol et al 2001 and to aid caedym calibration there are four mandatory phosphorus state variables that should be given in the model a soluble reactive phosphorus srp or po4 b labile dissolved organic phosphorus dopl c labile particulate organic phosphorus popl d algal internal phosphorus aip there are four mandatory variables for nitrogen in the model a nitrate no3 b ammonium nh4 c labile dissolved organic nitrogen donl d labile particulate organic nitrogen ponl there are other optional state variables for phosphorus and nitrogen e g particulate inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus pin and pip hipsey et al 2012 which have been considered in this research a schematic of the nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton group processes in caedym is shown in fig 2 some of the mandatory nutrients have been measured directly from water samples i e po4 no3 nh4 but others have been estimated from the measured forms following previous caedym applications i e león et al 2005 bolkhari 2014 in caedym there are two options to account for sediment diagenetic processes static and dynamic here we adopt the static model where sediment oxygen demand is a function of near bed do and water temperature hipsey et al 2012 caedym is the most widely applied and cited freshwater aquatic ecosystem model trolle et al 2012 it has been reported that the performance of coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical models is better for physical components than for to biological ones when simulating dynamics of planktonic systems arhonditsis and brett 2004 this was attributed to the scarce availability of biogeochemical data for initial conditions and calibration complexity of biogeochemical processes and insufficient calibration effort given that these models require significant time and effort for calibration there is a need to apply biogeochemical models to different systems to test the generality of the models and also to investigate needed improvements to the authors knowledge elcom caedym has not been applied to a constructed vegetated stormwater pond or a wetland as in the present application unlike caedym elcom remains relatively calibration free hodges 2000 nakhaei et al 2019 2 2 model calibration setup and initial and boundary conditions details of the model setup and runs are given in table 2 the model bathymetry file was prepared from survey data collected in 2014 by real time kinematic gps coupled to a depth sounder measurements of water levels in the ponds and the outlet structures combined with mass balance calculations using the epa storm water management model were used to estimate inflow outflow time series temperature profiles from each station were spatially interpolated to initialize the temperature field while initial velocities were set to zero due to the inability to sample water quality within the inlet structures limited access and h2s concerns measurements of the inflow boundary conditions for water quality and temperature were obtained from in situ observations directly adjacent to each inlet structure fig 1 since all of the inlets are submerged these inflow boundary conditions were the deep measurements in 2015 and due to lack of deep water samples the surface samples in 2014 caedym requires calibration of a large number of biogeochemical parameters hipsey et al 2012 with runtimes for a single 6 month elcom caedym simulation ranging from 8 days present study to 3 weeks leon et al 2011 it is preferable to begin calibration with a pre existing calibration set due to their availability and similar focus on simulation of phytoplankton succession we initially evaluated the use of caedym parameter sets obtained during calibrations for lake erie leon et al 2011 their appendix c and lake minnetonka missaghi and hondzo 2010 starting with these parameter sets we systematically changed model parameters table 3 guided by literature values and reported sensitivity analysis e g missaghi et al 2013 leon et al 2011 the root mean square error rmse between the model and observations converged to within acceptable ranges reported in the literature this process involved more than 125 runs each taking 8 days on a 3 6 ghz xeon server rmse and normalized rmse nrmse derived by dividing rmse by the observed mean were used to define the error between measured and modeled values the parameters for different phytoplankton groups were tuned through comparison to the measured and observed chla rather than the group specific observations due to time constraints and to simplify the calibration procedure published applications of caedym have quantified model performance using metrics such as rmse and nrmse e g mcbride et al 2014 trolle et al 2008 trolle et al 2014 allan 2016 missaghi and hondzo 2010 silva et al 2014 the range of error for different modeled water quality components varied significantly e g 0 17 nrmse 1 52 indicating the difficulty of calibrating complex models such as caedym however model accuracy has been improving over the past several decades e g historically an order of magnitude error was acceptable boegman 1999 and it has been shown that spatial dynamic water quality models help to better understand the ecological functioning of lakes mooij et al 2010 therefore we adopt rmse and nrmse as metrics to assess model performance within the pre existing literature ultimately a single set of calibration parameters for both ponds was obtained table 3 nrmse is an indicator of error that avoids scale dependency unlike rmse shcherbakov et al 2013 however in cases when the rmse is small e g lower than or close to the observed detection limit nrmse can give a misleading definition of model capability prior elcom calibration suggested that special attention was required to eliminate light inhibition and nutrient related migration of phytoplankton to account for shading from macrophytes nakhaei et al 2019 a vertical gradient in temperature of 10 c over a height of 2 m was both observed and modeled in three edmonton ponds mt2 tt2 and sb4 nakhaei et al 20198 a similar density gradient in an ontario pond rey et al 2021b was found to regulate the vertical distribution of biogeochemical parameters mahyari 2018 in the present study we extend limited field observations by simulating the 3d spatial biogeochemical gradients in the pond 2 3 trophic state and remediation strategies the reduction of phytoplankton biomass has been reported to be dependent on the magnitude of the reduction in external phosphorus loading mardsen 1989 carpenter et al 1998 schindler 2006 to investigate the effectiveness of nutrient reductions to control algae growth in the edmonton stormwater ponds several remediation scenarios were modeled previous studies have investigated both phosphorus and nitrogen reduction e g trolle et al 2008 zhang and rao 2012

details on the hydrodynamic calibration of elcom are given in a corresponding paper nakhaei et al 2019 3 1 1 nutrients the modeled tp and po4 were visually consistent with observations at station ne near the dominant inlet in tt2 fig 3 in general the prediction of near surface po4 was better in 2015 compared with 2014 by a factor of 10 table 4 however nrmse was marginally higher in 2015 0 25 which can be misleading as it is correlated with the much lower rmse simulation of surface tp was slightly less accurate in both years than that of the bottom rmse 0 016 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 18 table 4 trends of increasing or decreasing tp and po4 over monthly timescales were predicted by the model fig 3 doy 200 to 220 in 2015 for tp and doy 150 to 200 in 2014 for po4 in general nrmse for po4 and tp showed that the model predicted tp with more accuracy than po4 with the average nrmse being almost three times lower table 4 tt2 has been shown to have a thermally stratified 3m water column due to a 10 c difference between the surface and bottom temperature fig 3 this is sufficient 0 1 cm 1 to inhibit mixing in the water column boegman et al 2008 similar thermal stratification has been observed in other ponds at temperate latitudes 5 c over 1 m rey et al 2017 confirming that fully mixed modelling approaches e g cstr fail to capture pond dynamics to first order the combined effects of submerged inlets and inhibited mixing explain higher nutrient concentrations tp tn nh4 no3 po4 near the bottom than at the surface e g doy 160 to 230 of 2015 in tp fig 3 modeled po4 and tp were visually consistent at most times with the measured data fig 4 at station nw in mt2 similar to the station ne in tt2 as an example the model predicted sudden increases in po4 concentration close to the bed e g doy 172 of 2015 fig 4 but missed the increase in tp close to the bed e g doy 145 of 2015 fig 4 at the surface the modeled po4 nrmse ranged from 0 3 to 0 8 which was roughly half the nrmse near the bed table 4 overall the average rmse for tp was 3 times lower in mt2 than tt2 table 4 but the average nrmse was roughly the same for both ponds nrmse 0 3 table 4 simulated nitrogen concentrations were generally in good visual agreement with the measured data except for some underestimations at mt2 in 2015 e g doy 160 figs 3 and 4 lower model predicted values of nh4 tn and no3 near the surface and higher ones near the bottom were consistent with the measurements e g doy 200 and doy 218 in 2015 for nh4 and tn fig 3 of the modeled nitrogen fractions no3 had the largest error in both years and for both ponds average rmse 0 1 mg l 1 for tt2 and 0 35 for mt2 mg l 1 nrmse 2 87 for tt2 and 2 91 for mt2 fig 3 table 4 the model predicted elevated tn and nh4 concentrations e g doy 172 doy 202 and doy 218 in 2015 fig 3 but with a time lag of 2 days the modeled nh4 and tn in tt2 also agreed well visually with the surface and bottom measurements fig 3 table 4 the rmse at stations nw and ce was 1 mg l 1 table 4 but the average nrmse 0 43 was consistent with the visual examination of the fitness the modeled nh4 no3 and tn in mt2 had higher error 40 higher rmse in comparison with tt2 fig 4 table 4 but the average nrmse was within the same range as in tt2 table 4 for example the simulated near bottom nh4 concentration underestimated the measurements e g on doy 230 of 2015 at station nw fig 4 by 0 2 mg l 1 table 4 and this resulted in higher rmse 0 16 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 06 table 4 similarly the modeled tn and no3 near the bottom also underestimated the measurements at station nw 2015 resulting in the highest rmse in mt2 2 mg l 1 for no3 and tn fig 4 table 4 a tukey comparison test tukey 1949 shows that the nrmse of tp q s 0 29 and tn q s 0 23 between the two ponds are not significantly different and consequently the model had similar accuracy prediction of nutrients in both ponds 3 1 2 dissolved oxygen the simulated do concentrations were well confirmed with the measured time series for both ponds average rmse 2 26 mg l 1 average nrmse 0 58 for tt2 and average rmse 1 88 mg l 1 average nrmse 0 53 for mt2 fig 3 table 4 the model underestimated the do near the surface of tt2 rmse 3 87 mg l 1 nrmse 0 5 but captured the general trend over time e g doy 135 to 155 in 2015 doy 200 to 205 in 2015 fig 3 the over production of do likely resulted from macrophyte photosynthesis caedym is unable to model rooted vegetation as the model correctly simulates do at saturation 8 1 9 8 mg l 1 for water temperature ranges between 17 27 c but the observed do approaches 15 mg l 1 fig 3 doy 155 175 and doy 185 225 the modeled do for mt2 was more accurate than for tt2 with simulated bottom concentrations agreeing better with the measurements rmse 1 44 mg l 1 nrmse 0 54 than near surface ones rmse 2 32 mg l 1 nrmse 0 52 fig 4 for deeper tt2 the do depleted as chla increased and the water column became anoxic by doy 224 station ne doy 134 in 2015 fig 4 shows that the water column at station nw of mt2 was modelled and observed to be hypoxic for most of the simulation and became anoxic from doy 220 to 235 in 2015 thereafter increasing as a result of photosynthetic production 3 1 3 chlorophyll a chla the model predictions of chla were in closer agreement with measurements from the chla logger than with the water sample data in tt2 average rmse 25 8 μg l 1 and 62 4 μg l 1 respectively and nrmse 0 45 and 0 92 respectively the chla logger data was only available near the surface at station ne tt2 in 2015 figs 1 3 and 5 whereas the modeled chla was compared to chla samples for deeper layers in 2015 there are inaccuracies in the modeled chla compared with the 2014 water sample data in tt2 fig 3 rmse 34 76 μg l 1 and nrmse 1 6 especially for doy 197 when the model predicted the correct chla concentration but at 1 5 m deeper than the sample depth fig 3 similar spatial inaccuracy occurred near the surface in tt2 at station ne in 2015 compared to chla samples fig 3 e g doy 160 205 and 218 due to this underestimation of surface chla the rmse of chla near the surface ranged from 34 76 to 102 1 μg l 1 0 84 nrmse 1 6 the predicted bottom chla values were better in comparison to the observations than at the surface 2 16 rmse 63 1 μg l 1 and 0 02 nrmse 0 83 the model was able to predict the lower bound of the logger observed chla time series in tt2 in 2015 fig 5a and was able to follow the trend of the observed chla water sample data in mt2 in 2015 fig 5b decreasing to a minimum at doy 202 3 μg l 1 and then increasing toward the end of the modeling period doy 240 the chla rmse was lower for mt2 than for tt2 particularly near the surface table 4 2 18 rmse 7 76 μg l 1 this was likely because there was less overall chla in mt2 than in tt2 by a factor of 5 in both the measurements and model the higher concentrations led to some visual inaccuracies in simulating chla in tt2 near the surface e g station ne on doy 193 in 2014 and doy 160 in 2014 fig 3 however using the same set of calibration parameters did give similar normalized error nrmse 0 94 in both ponds near the surface at station nw in mt2 the model underestimated the observations but could still predict peaks in chla fig 4 doy 230 2015 and 165 2014 the near bed chla rmse and nrmse varied more than at the surface in mt2 a tukey multiple comparison test revealed that the difference between the near surface and near bed chla nrmse was significant q s 5 43 this supports the more accurate prediction of chla near the bed compared to the surface fig 3 fig 4 and table 4 the tukey test also revealed that the differences in chla nrmse between the stations within each pond were also significant q s 2 14 for tt2 and q s 4 03 for mt2 table 4 however the chla nrmse between the two ponds was not significantly different q s 0 24 confirming that while model accuracy varies within each pond there was similar overall accuracy in predicting the chla concentration between ponds these results show that while it was more accurate to predict lower chla concentrations lower rmse in mt2 and lower rmse near the bed the relative error as given by the nrmse remained consistent 3 1 4 phytoplankton groups the community dynamics of 5 different types of phytoplankton groups cyanobacteria chlorophyte charophytes euglenozoan dinoflagellates cryptophytes diatom were modeled table 5 figs 5 and 6 cyanobacteria chlorophytes charophytes and euglenozoan dinoflagellates were the dominant species in that order observed in both ponds at station ne in tt2 predicted cyanobacteria biomass peaked around doy 220 90 fig 5a which may be related to increasing nutrient concentrations from doy 205 to doy 225 e g tp and tn fig 3 during this period the measured chla increased and modeled chla remained steady fig 5a with nutrients in the water column benefiting chlorophytes charophytes over other groups except cyanobacteria e g doy 170 to 190 and doy 200 to 220 figs 3 and 5 the sum of cryptophytes and diatoms were less than 2 at station ne in tt2 and less than 5 at station ce in tt2 both in the model and in the measurements which indicates that the model could simulate the distribution of these groups with reasonable accuracy at station ne in tt2 the model predicted the distribution of cyanobacteria euglenozoan dinoflagellates and chlorophytes charophytes with less than 10 error except for doy 160 where there was up to 27 error fig 5 table 5 on this day doy 160 the model underestimated the cyanobacteria and as a result overestimated the other two dominant groups fig 5 overall the model predicted the contribution of the dominant groups cyanobacteria euglenozoan dinoflagellates and chlorophyte charophytes with less than 30 error except for some measurements at station ce doy 189 and 203 table 5 at station nw of mt2 the measured and modeled chla dropped from 25 μg l 1 on doy 134 to 2 μg l 1 on doy 202 which may be related to phosphorus limitation figs 4 and 5b during this period the predominance of cyanobacteria increased to 80 of the total chla on doy 202 but in absolute terms was low because of low total of chla starting from doy 200 po4 increased up to 0 01 mg l 1 with chla until doy 240 6 μg l 1 in the model fig 5b with excess po4 the chlorophytes charophytes increased to 50 of total chla observed on doy 230 and modelled on doy 240 which suppressed cyanobacteria 35 on doy 240 fig 5b this was likely driven by the increase in the water temperature from 10 c to 30 c doy 175 until doy 240 fig 4 as chlorophytes charophytes were set to have optimal growth at 25 c which is higher than other groups except cyanobacteria that is also 25 c e g euglenozoan dinoflagellate optimum temperature 22 c as in tt2 the model agreed well with the measurements of diatoms and cryptophytes 1 error at stations nw and se in mt2 table 5 fig 5b although the model reproduced the general trend at nw and se in mt2 there were inaccuracies in predicting the contribution of cyanobacteria and euglenozoan dinoflagellates in the total chla up to 40 table 5 fig 5b fig 6 in general the model was able to predict the distribution of total chla in the algae groups consistently in both ponds with more than 70 accuracy 65 of sample and less than 10 error 55 of samples fig 6 excluding diatoms and cryptophytes non dominant groups with 5 of total chla in both ponds which the model predicted with good accuracy 1 difference the model predicted the majority of other groups with lower than 30 40 error fig 6 there were some overestimations which mostly occurred when the observed algae group was less than 20 of total chla fig 6 this was likely attributed to one or two of the dominant groups cyanobacteria euglenozoan dinoflagellates and chlorophyte charophytes being low causing it to be more difficult for the model to capture the balance between the groups and to predict the groups with lower than 20 of the total chla accurately fig 6 3 2 trophic state and nutrient reduction scenarios tt2 and mt2 ranged from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic in the model with better water quality in mt2 during 2014 and 2015 fig 7 was generated by averaging through the water column to estimate the general trophic state of the ponds based on the chla concentration in the different scenarios comparing the observed chla at different depths with the modeled depth averaged chla showed that they were in agreement in terms of the trophic state in more than 60 of the observations 46 for tt2 and 77 for mt2 figs 7 the model showed that at the start of the season tt2 was oligotrophic in 2014 and remained in that state for 30 of the modeling period until doy 180 fig 7a which is consistent with the near surface observations fig 3 tt2 was predicted to be eutrophic and mesotrophic in 30 and 40 of the modeling period of 2014 respectively fig 7a a near surface measurement showed that tt2 became hypereutrophic on doy 200 in 2014 and the model predicted a change from eutrophic to mesotrophic at approximately the same figs 3 and 7a unlike 2014 in 2015 tt2 was predicted to be eutrophic and mesotrophic over 70 and 25 of the time respectively fig 7b the near bed and surface observations agreed well with the model as they started in a hypereutrophic state and then as in the model became eutrophic on doy 145 figs 3 and 7b afterwards the modelled chla increased and tt2 became eutrophic doy 180 to 230 despite inaccuracies in the modeled chla a similar increasing trend was evident in the measurements at both depths as they showed a change to eutrophic e g near surface doy 190 and hypereutrophic e g near bed and surface doy 202 states figs 3 and 7b in 2014 the model predicted that mt2 was mostly mesotrophic 90 of the modeling period but was briefly oligotrophic as well doy 148 152 and doy 210 220 fig 7c the measurements near the surface had the same trophic state as the model for mt2 in 2014 oligotrophic from doy 177 to doy 219 and mesotrophic on doy 230 with the exception of doy 163 which showed a eutrophic state when the model was mesotrophic figs 4 and 7c in 2015 the model began as eutrophic in mt2 same as the measurements and then changed to mesotrophic until doy 165 the measurements indicated a mesotrophic state on doy 160 and then as the model changes from oligotrophic to mesotrophic doy 215 240 the measurements showed the same trophic state as the model doys 216 and 229 figs 4 and 7d in general similar to 2014 the model predicted mt2 to be mostly mesotrophic 60 and oligotrophic for the rest of the modelling period doy 170 215 fig 7d the 0 and 25 reduction scenarios in tt2 showed eutrophication during summer e g doy 205 220 in 2014 and doy 190 220 in 2015 fig 7a and 7b however for the 50 and 75 reduction scenarios the chla concentration never exceeded 20 μg l 1 mesotrophic except for doy 134 to 150 in 2015 and doy 240 to 245 in 2014 none of the scenarios changed the trophic condition to oligotrophic excluding the first 35 days of 2014 when tt2 was oligotrophic for all scenarios fig 7a the modeled chla concentrations 0 reduction scenario in mt2 were less 3 times and 6 times in 2014 and 2015 respectively than in tt2 causing mt2 to be mesotrophic oligotrophic in 2014 15 fig 7c and 7d in 2015 all scenarios resulted in similar chla concentrations from doy 133 to doy 210 1 5 μg l 1 difference and a slight increase thereafter until doy 240 by the end of the simulation only the 75 nutrient reduction scenario caused an oligotrophic state fig 7d it was also oligotrophic in 2014 for the whole modeling period at station nw in mt2 the 50 and 25 nutrient reduction resulted in an oligotrophic state by the end of the simulation doy 180 to 234 however from doy 155 to doy 180 the chla was above 2 6 μg l 1 mesotrophic for both the 50 and 25 nutrient reduction scenarios overall at least 75 reduction of nutrients in tt2 and 50 reduction of nutrients in mt2 were required to change the trophic state to mesotrophic oligotrophic the initial chla concentrations which were based on measurements were much higher in the spring of 2015 doy 134 than of 2014 doy 148 fig 7 the subsequent decrease of chla in 2015 by doy 160 in both ponds showed the concentrations to approach the lower 2014 levels fig 7b and 5d 4 discussion given the effort required to calibrate a multi parameter 3d biogeochemical model one of the ultimate goals of our process based water quality simulation is to determine a single set of calibration parameters that can be universally applied to systems with different characteristics it has been shown that thermal stratification can occur in ponds and fully mixed modelling approaches e g cstr are not able to fully capture the pond hydrodynamics e g losordo and piedrahita 1991 song et al 2013 rey et al 2017 in this study we found that caedym parameter sets for lake erie leon et al 2011 and lake minnetonka missaghi and hondzo 2010 required significant tuning for calibration 125 runs a single calibration set was ultimately achieved for the two ponds considered in this study and it was within the ranges suggested in the literature e g gal et al 2009 missaghi and hondzo 2010 leon et al 2011 mcbride et al 2014 allan 2016 table 3 for both ponds using the single set of calibration parameters the calculated average rmse and nrmse for do n and p fractions table 4 were comparable with error ranges reported in the literature with the exception of modeled no3 which had a higher error in both ponds trolle et al 2008 used dyresm caedym to model lake ravn denmark and calculated that for po4 tp and do the rmse was 0 061 mg l 1 0 074 mg l 1 and 2 64 mg l 1 respectively they also reported nrmse of 0 27 for tp 0 13 for tn and 0 32 for do elcom caedym has also been used to model lake benmore new zealand trolle et al 2014 and the nrmse was 0 28 1 52 and 0 17 for tn tp and do respectively this demonstrates that while a universal calibration set may not be attainable i e for lake erie lake minnetonka and edmonton storm water ponds calibration sets with acceptable accuracy are achievable for systems with common physical characteristics and different trophic states e g mt2 and tt2 when rmse was low nrmse was a misleading metric to judge model performance for example the model predicted nh4 and no3 at station se tt2 in 2015 had rmse lower than the detection limit indicating a good accuracy however the nrmse were high 0 4 and 0 7 respectively table 4 generally no3 has been reported to be harder to model with caedym as an example mcbride et al 2014 modeled lake tikitapu new zealand using dyresm caedym and no3 had an rmse 0 015 mg l 1 and nrmse 3 6 they simulated nh4 rmse 0 014 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 3 tn rmse 0 08 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 35 po4 rmse 0 002 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 1 tp rmse 0 008 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 1 and do rmse 2 5 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 47 with smaller uncertainties than no3 similarly in another application of dyresm caedym to a small shallow lake lake ohinewai new zealnd no3 was modeled with a higher uncertainty rmse 0 25 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 2 compared to nh4 rmse 0 23 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 23 tn rmse 0 73 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 36 po4 rmse 0 02 mg l 1 and nrmse 0 15 and tp rmse 0 06 mg l 1 and nrmse 1 3 allan 2016 despite of the high rmse and nrmse for no3 in the current study the rmse and nrmse for different parameters including no3 lay within the corresponding values in the literature table 4 although there were some visual inaccuracies in simulating chla and differences in chla rmse between ponds the metrics used to quantify model error chla rmse were comparable to those from an application of caedym by trolle et al 2008 who reported rmse of 10 4 and 12 8 μg l 1 and nrmse of 0 88 and trolle et al 2014 who reported 0 2 nrmse 1 37 in mt2 the chla rmse was between 2 18 and 7 76 μg l 1 which is more accurate than trolle et al 2008 and the nrmse 0 94 which is within the range of their work other studies also reported inaccuracy in modeling systems with high chla for example elcom caedym applications to lake minnetonka missaghi and hondzo 2010 and rio de la plata silva et al 2014 resulted in predictions of chla that were 110 μg l 1 lower than observations other water quality models also underestimated observed chla by 100 μg l 1 e g wasp6 chao et al 2005 arhonditsis and brett 2005 this underestimation as in the present study for tt2 may be related to the difficulty in modeling the inherent patchiness in algae which is typically below the model horizontal grid resolution despite these underestimations the model was successfully able to predict the trophic state of the ponds based on chla in more than 60 of the measurements as the modeled chla was less accurate for tt2 compared to mt2 table 4 the model trophic state prediction was also more accurate for mt2 77 compared to tt2 46 biogeochemical models are still under development hipsey et al 2012 reynolds 2006 and more accurate understanding of the vertical distribution of algae from migration related to nutrient limitation or light inhabitation may result in more accurate simulation of chla while increasing model complexity the simulation of seasonal phytoplankton succession and direct comparisons with observational data e g fig 5 compared to leon et al 2011 their fig 6 and missaghi and hondzo 2010 their fig 5 will serve to improve model performance this was achieved by allowing for different functional groups to respond individually to availability of light nutrients and temperature e g to capture both spring diatom bloom and summer cyanobacteria bloom to our knowledge there are only a few reports of direct comparisons between measured and modelled algae community structure e g trolle et al 2008 bolkhari 2014 and these have been limited to the 1d dyresm caedym version of the model mt2 was ranked as having poorer water quality than tt2 table 1 because of resident complaints driven by cladophora blooms however based on quantitative measures i e water sample analysis and model predictions mt2 is classified as a mesotrophic system whereas tt2 is eutrophic table 1 and fig 7 these conflicting classifications are likely due to the extensive rooted aquatic vegetation macrophytes present in all areas of the pond except the small deepest areas located at the inlets and outlet in mt2 tt2 was more turbid with suspended algae and has rooted macrophytes only at the perimeter in shallow regions near the shore 1 m fig 8 tt2 has a greater mean depth than mt2 suggesting rooted vegetation is shaded by suspended algae and suspended sediment shallower ponds therefore may favor growth of rooted aquatic vegetation which limits nutrient availability to suspended algae and improves water quality as measured by the trophic index fig 7 but the trophic state does not necessarily correlate with public perceptions of a pond s water quality these results suggest that the chla alone is not a suitable index to define trophic state in shallow stormwater ponds bayley and prather 2003 investigated 148 wetland lakes in alberta and classified them based on the predominance of phytoplankton or submerged aquatic vegetation they reported that the phytoplankton dominated systems have higher chla more than 10 times and higher nutrient concentration more than 2 times tp and roughly similar po4 and tn than vegetation dominated systems this agrees well with the results from tt2 phytoplankton dominated and mt2 vegetation dominated it has also been reported that aquatic vegetation macrophytes can significantly decrease phytoplankton biomass and can increase water clarity in shallow lakes mcqueen 1990 demelo et al 1992 where macrophytes apparently suppress phytoplankton growth szczepański 1977 wium andersen et al 1982 therefore chla concentrations in vegetation dominated systems e g mt2 are lower than in phytoplankton dominated systems e g tt2 generally shallow ponds e g mt2 are more efficient in maintaining do at all depths but rooted vegetation can cause problems porges and mackenthun 1963 unlike deeper ponds that can have lower light penetration and higher chla throughout the water column the more oxic water column in shallower ponds can result in less internal nutrient loading from the sediments compared to deeper ponds søndergaard et al 2003 similar to this study modeled nutrient reduction scenarios has been considered in previous studies as possible remediation strategies to control algae growth for example trolle et al 2008 reported a minimum of 40 50 reduction in nutrients are needed for chla concentrations to meet the eu water framework directive for lake ravn in this study the modeled scenarios showed that at least a 50 reduction of nutrients is required to change the trophic state zhang and rao 2012 used wasp to model the effect of up to a 20 reduction of phosphorus and 20 reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus to lake winnipeg canada they reported that in some parts of the lake the maximum reduction of chla by annual average of 2 3 μg l 1 was achieved with 20 reduction of phosphorus alone 5 conclusion strong vertical spatial gradients in water column thermal structure and water quality state variables were observed in the edmonton ponds e g 10 c 0 1 mg l 1 po4 0 5 mg l 1 total p and 50 μg l 1 chlorophyll a over 3m in agreement with other observations showing ponds in temperate regions to be incompletely mixed systems to capture these gradients and to model their response to management scenarios 3d models are required in this study we attempted to simulate two different edmonton stormwater ponds with the 3d elcom caedym water quality model using a single set of calibration coefficients despite differences in their trophic state and phytoplankton community structure the calibration parameter set differed from those used for larger lakes lake erie and lake minnetonka the calibration metrics rmse were comparable in both ponds with the exception of chla rmse which was higher in the hypereutrophic eutrophic system tt2 relative to the oligotrophic mesotrophic mt2 pond which was consistent with the poor visual comparisons to chla extractions in tt2 despite this inaccuracy the normalized metrics chla nrmse were not significantly different between systems and in comparison to values in the literature demonstrating that complex multi parameter biogeochemical models may be generally calibrated with similar normalized error for systems of comparable size in the same local region caedym predicted nitrogen tn no3 and nh4 phosphorus po4 and tp and do concentrations with rmse and nrmse of 0 76 mg l 1 and 0 44 tn 0 35 mg l 1 and 2 91 no3 0 06 mg l 1 and 0 95 nh4 0 014 mg l 1 and 0 9 po4 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 31 tp and 2 26 mg l 1 and 0 53 do respectively caedym simulated chla more accurately when the system was not phytoplankton dominated and was oligotrophic mesotrophic mt2 in comparison to the hypereutrophic eutrophic system tt2 we speculate that patchiness of algae which is difficult to model in caedym and can be affected by the grid size may increase as the chla increases resulting in error in the simulated results despite inaccuracies in predicting chla and some nutrient components the model was successful in forecasting the trophic state over 60 of the time as well as trends in chla in order to control algae blooms and reduce chla the model predictions showed that at least a 50 nutrient reduction was likely needed it was also found that chla alone was not a suitable index to define the pond trophic state prolific macrophyte growth also significantly reduced pond aesthetics while being coincident with lower phytoplankton biomass and increased water clarity therefore future work should focus on the development of the models that can consider nutrient uptake by aquatic vegetation relative to phytoplankton

change satellite imagery allows multi resolution methodologies to obtain estimation and hopefully classification of biomass content over sea surface this information is largely used in numerical simulations and nowadays represents an important contribute to future projections nevertheless satellite models and classical in situ monitoring resolution accuracy sometimes cannot provide data at the finer spatial scales needed to describe the complex three dimensional water column system on the other hand glider surveys allow scientists to collect observations of ocean phenomena at very high resolution along the water column to assess numerical simulations reliability and eventually to assimilate these data into ocean models in this study we present a quantitative comparison between the glider observations collected in the algerian basin western mediterranean sea during the abacus surveys from 2014 to 2018 and the daily outputs of two co located cmems model products i e glb and ibi the achieved results point out that model products are well correlated with glider potential temperature measurements but they still need improvements to provide a correct representation of the chlorophyll concentration variability in the study area generally ibi daily simulations present higher linear correlation with concurrent glider in situ data than glb ones ibi products also reproduce better the pattern of the local maxima of chlorophyll concentration across the algerian basin nevertheless they largely underestimate glider chlorophyll measurements and present significant differences that limit their capability to reproduce its upper ocean concentration that is needed for accomplishing advanced ecological studies keywords glider high resolution measurements phytoplankton biomass monitoring chlorophyll a concentration modelling western mediterranean sea 1 introduction natural capital refers to the stock of natural assets including soil air water and all living things generating a wide range of ecosystem goods and services which enable humans to live and produce value or benefits to people directly or indirectly barbier 2019 these assets are currently under pressure all over the globe resulting in changes in the function of several ecological systems and in the benefits derived by people leach et al 2019 ecosystem services are the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well being so that its valuation is now widely recognised as a useful though sometimes neglected tool for conservation and management in the terrestrial and marine environment merp 2019 moreover understanding marine environment functions and how we alter them is essential for preparation of the basic concepts for conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in the last decades contemporary threats to marine biodiversity due to increasing anthropogenic pressure e g climate change pollution and unsustainable fishing are likely to cause unpredictable changes in the provision of marine ecosystem services marine ecosystems are amongst the most productive environments in the world and their stocks of natural capital offer a bundle of vital ecosystem services merp 2019 in particular ocean biomass distribution has a growing importance in the world economy as a global strategic reserve understanding how the marine environment functions to maintain natural capital to provide goods and services and how we may be altering it directly e g by over exploitation or indirectly e g through climate change is essential for a sustainable long term future for the marine environment and humans picone et al 2017 the alteration of algal community composition and distribution represents an important bio indicator of several climate driven effects on environmental forcing and marine ecosystem equilibrium sathyendranath et al 2014 chlorophyll a hereafter chl a concentration measurements play a fundamental role in marine ecosystem research as excellent proxy for phytoplankton biomass and seawater trophic conditions sathyendranath et al 2017 the information on chl a patterns at global and regional scales is usually pursued through several approaches e g modelling studies in situ measurements and satellite sensors sammartino et al 2018 ocean models has brought to bear a vast range of skills and experience from empirical scientists to modellers to socio economists with the aim of understanding how we can maximise the benefits we get form our seas through trade offs between economic ecological and cultural activities and services while maintaining clean safe and healthy seas and the living natural capital they contain merp 2019 the ocean however is difficult to monitor to study and to model as it is characterized by multiple factors including complex processes occurring on several spatial and temporal scales impressive biodiversity and serious governance issues to obtain a complete view of such processes and provide valuable input data to models ocean scientists aim at collecting data over long time periods and at the higher temporal and spatial resolution feasible historically these measurements were continually provided by fixed sensors e g moorings and ship oceanographic campaigns obtaining measurements which are mostly one dimensional i e at a single point along depth or two dimensional through a cross section i e data along depth on a ship track castagno et al 2020 furthermore using classical methodologies for ocean dynamics monitoring and biomass inventory is usually time consuming and expensive while results can be affected by synopticity and spatio temporal scale issues additionally progress in numerical modelling also demonstrated the importance of mesoscale and fine scale processes in shaping the biochemical cycles and biodiversity distribution lévy et al 2018 since scale interactions are ubiquitous it is then of crucial importance to gain insight simultaneously into the large scale circulation the mesoscale dynamics and the sub mesoscale processes unfortunately reaching this objective using conventional cruise strategies is not straightforward leading to a lack of in situ observations of fine scale processes these difficulties increase due to the lack in some cases of available open source data di luccio et al 2020 since 1970s the availability of satellite imagery allowed the development of new methodologies to obtain a global estimation and hopefully classification of biomass content over sea surface e g strömberg et al 2009 groom et al 2019 also in combination with traditional in situ measurements e g aulicino et al 2016 rivaro et al 2017 misic et al 2017 mangoni et al 2017 rivaro et al 2019a 2019b furthermore 25 years of progress in radar altimetry improved our capability of monitoring and understanding ocean circulation at large and mesoscales but for the fulfillment of stringent requirements of observing sea level rise and its acceleration abdalla et al 2021 buonocore et al 2020 due to their synoptic view satellite observations partly fill the gap between large and fine scale dynamics for many years surface temperature and ocean colour products have been effectively used providing a greatly increased coverage of the ocean at different spatio temporal scales nowadays these products represent an important contribution to ocean studies and are profitably used for assimilation in numerical simulations payne et al 2019 nonetheless their measurements give us information only about the near surface pattern and provide a 2d latitudinal longitudinal view of the ocean without describing what happens in the water column considering the light penetration depth in the seawater for example satellite chl a represents only one fifth of the total chl a content within the euphotic zone ignoring the algal biomass variability at deeper layers morel and berthon 1989 still as for classical in situ measurements satellite products are often limited in resolving the large spatial and temporal variability of ocean biomass distribution and dynamics e g neglecting the small or mesoscale because of their intrinsic characteristics e g revisiting time swath width pixel resolution thus they are not able alone to provide the high resolution detail of the complex three dimensional ocean structure that is needed by ocean modellers for an improved initialization and or validation of their numerical simulations additionally most of satellite data do not reach the adequate resolution and quality when approaching the coast to overcome this limitation several works attempted to reconstruct the sub surface chl a field and or the column integrated primary production from surface satellite observations through different approaches including statistical methods e g morel and berthon 1989 buongiorno nardelli et al 2006 buongiorno nardelli et al 2017 machine learning techniques e g gueye et al 2014 sauzède et al 2016 and neural network methods e g scardi et al 2001 richardson et al 2002 sammartino et al 2018 buongiorno nardelli 2020 although several factors affect the successful extrapolation of the vertical structure from its surface pattern in temperate areas as the mediterranean sea the existence of a strong seasonality makes the chl a vertical structure rather predictable sammartino et al 2018 on the other hand these products are usually validated versus climatological information and infer a smoothed representation of the punctual 3d structure of the ocean that partially improve the very sparse water column in situ information moreover predicted chl a spring bloom can be significantly modified by eddy driven slumping of density gradient at basin scale mahadevan et al 2012 as a result a better design of sampling strategies and an enhanced resolution of data both in space and time are of fundamental importance to capture the observed phenomena along ocean depth lagrangian instruments provided then additional information to complete the description of the ocean variability but faced new limitations this is especially the case of the algerian basin hereafter ab where argo floats residence times for instance are very short taillandier et al 2020 owing to the large density gradients and the associated strong currents poulain et al 2012 bouzaiene et al 2018 recently the advent of autonomous underwater vehicles hereafter auv has enabled a complementary data acquisition approach and a higher accuracy and sampling resolution for a given region of interest such as the ab aulicino et al 2018 cotroneo et al 2019 this could address the pressing need amongst ocean scientists and modellers to efficiently and effectively collect the high resolution data which are expected to improve our monitoring and estimating capability of the phytoplankton ocean biomass stocks in fact auv observations can represent an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the very fine scale ocean processes and provide modellers information useful to reduce the grid size below a few hundred meters and properly resolve the ocean dynamics garreau et al 2020 this is particularly important in specific ocean areas e g the mediterranean sea which are known for being characterized by intense and contrasting dynamics previous studies for instance emphasized that very high resolution in situ data can be essential to identify the effects of frontal instabilities generating chl a filaments or those of eddies acting both as biological barriers and drivers of plankton diversity cotroneo et al 2016 bosse et al 2017 ruiz et al 2019 sanchez roman et al 2019 garreau et al 2020 in this study we i present the high resolution glider ocean observations potential

with co located numerical simulations outputs provided by copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems the main goal is to evaluate the cmems daily products capability to give us reliable information about the chl a concentration of the water column in one of the most important areas of the mediterranean sea i e the ab and strengthen the importance of glider high resolution data for improving our knowledge of the study area phytoplankton biomass and seawater trophic conditions the paper is structured as follows study area datasets and methodologies are described in section 2 results are presented and discussed in section 3 concluding remarks are summarized in section 4 2 study area and datasets 2 1 the algerian basin the mediterranean sea is a semi enclosed evaporation basin largely driven by the thermohaline circulation which exhibits many processes of primary interest in the functioning of the global ocean robinson and golnaraghi 1994 and presents an high connection amongst its sub basins celentano et al 2020 it is a relatively restrained and accessible area thus providing an excellent opportunity to investigate a large amount of geophysical and biochemical oceanic features barceló llull et al 2020 from long term changes in water properties fusco et al 2008 krauzig et al 2020 to the possible interaction between ocean properties and anthropogenic impact on the marine environment i e marine litter dispersion zambianchi et al 2017 the ab is a wide and deep transit region of the south western mediterranean that occupies a large area between the balearic islands the algerian coast and the sardinia channel fig 1 it is characterised by the presence and interaction of different water masses e g fresh surface atlantic waters more saline resident mediterranean waters intermediate levantine intermediate waters western mediterranean deep waters whose properties varies according to different stages of mixing geographical position and residence time millot et al 1999 the general circulation of these water masses is strongly influenced by both an intense inflow outflow regime and complex circulation patterns pascual et al 2013 aulicino et al 2019 which act at different spatial and temporal scales including basin scale sub basin scale and mesoscale robinson and golnaraghi 1994 vidal vijande et al 2011 allowing multiple interactions and a high seasonal and interannual variability in the basin fusco et al 2003 typically atlantic waters entering from the strait of gibraltar flows eastward carried by the algerian current ac due to complex hydrodynamic processes ac becomes unstable along its path and generates several meanders that usually evolve into fresh core mesoscale structures i e eddies and filaments fig

into out of the euphotic layer olita et al 2011 cotroneo et al 2016 these processes contribute to algal blooms and primary production rates also leading locally and episodically to unexpectedly high chl a or primary production values for the mediterranean region robinson 1983 raimbault et al 1993 mahadevan et al 2012 2 2 abacus glider dataset gliders are auvs able to provide high resolution physical and biochemical measurements along the water column controlling their buoyancy to allow vertical motion webb et al 2001 four deep slocum g2 glider missions were carried out in the ab between 2014 and 2018 by università degli studi di napoli parthenope in collaboration with balearic islands coastal observing and forecasting system socib and the mediterranean institute for advanced studies imedea csic uib a total of 14 glider deep transects were completed during the four abacus projects realizing a repeated monitoring line between the island of mallorca and the algerian coast fig 2 each mission had an average duration of about 40 days and was mainly carried out during fall i e between september and december 2014 2018 or spring in may june 2018 as summarized in table 1 all the glider surveys were conducted along neighbouring saral altika abacus 1 to abacus 3 and sentinel 3a abacus 4 satellite groundtracks the timing of the glider missions were also accurately planned to be almost simultaneous with the satellite passages in order to optimize the synopticity between in situ and remote sensed observations additionally in 2014 and 2015 after the realization of the defined transects the glider was deviated from the monitoring line to sample specific mesoscale structures identified through near real time satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature maps during data collection gliders dived with an angle of 26 with the sea surface following a typical saw toothed navigation pathway to a maximum depth of 975 m at an average vertical speed of 0 18 0 02 m s with a resulting net horizontal velocity of about 0 36 m s all the glider platforms used during the abacus surveys were equipped with the same instrumentation i e a glider customized ctd by seabird measuring temperature conductivity salinity and pressure depth a two channel combo fluorometer sensor by wetlabs for chl a concentration and turbidity measurement and an oxygen optode by aadi to measure absolute oxygen concentration and saturation in general temperature salinity and oxygen data were sampled to full diving depth 0 975 m depth while the acquisition of the other optical parameters ceased at 300 m depth taking progressively advantage of the lesson learned the glider was programmed to reach the surface at different rates and spatial resolution during the different abacus missions this resulted in a variable resolution of sampling especially in the very surface layer 0 20 m depth which ranges between 2 and 8 km however physical parameters were generally sampled at 1 2 hz on both descending and ascending phase resulting in a vertical resolution of 0 4 m along the water column oxygen information was acquired at 1 4 hz vertical resolution of 0 8 m turbidity and chl a were sampled at 1 8 hz down to 150 m depth and at 1 16 hz from that level down to 300 m depth i e with a vertical resolution of 1 6 and 3 2 m respectively details and motivations of data acquisition strategy during the different surveys as well as quality control procedures and glider technical information e g setting maintenance calibration permission operations are fully described in cotroneo et al 2019 and references therein a deep quality control was applied to glider data in order to exclude any issue in the observations and support the complete reliability of the in situ dataset in particular a double check was carried out in order to verify that the thermal leg correction garau et al 2011 was correctly applied to glider salinity measurements the final glider dataset is available through an unrestricted repository at https doi org 10 25704 b200 3vf5 budillon et al 2018 please notice that the analysis of oxygen data provided in the repository is not included in the present study which focus on chl a concentration as one of the main marine ecological parameters for assessing phytoplankton biomass and trophic conditions comparing gridded forecasts with observations at point locations needs the use of super observations upscaled observations there are several methods available to upscale observations from simple averages distance weighted averages error observational and representativity weighted methods e g daley 1991 to multi variate statistical methods e g pardo iguzquiza 1998 in this study hydrographic and chl a profiles from gliders have been sorted depending on their matching date and location with the model gridded outputs described in section 2 3 then the selected profiles have been averaged to one mean profile per day which is used for co location with model values potential temperature values have been computed through the algorithm coded in the ocean data view odv software 2 3 cmems data data collected during glider field activities were compared with co located products provided by two cmems models which include daily chl a concentration information i e the global reanalysis hereafter glb and the iberian biscay ireland regional seas ocean reanalysis ibi in particular the analysed products include the global reanalysis bio 001 029 and the ibi reanalysis bio 005 003 for chl a information and the global reanalysis phy 001 030 and the ibi multiyear phy 005 002 for physical parameters i e physical temperature salinity and derived variables as summarized in table 2 the glb biogeochemical hindcast for global ocean is produced at mercator ocean toulouse france using pisces biogeochemical model aumont et al 2015 available on the nemo modelling platform it provides 3d biogeochemical fields for the time period 1993 2019 at 1 4 and on 75 vertical levels with a resolution of 1 m near the surface and 200 m in the deep ocean the model is forced offline by daily 3d fields from the ocean dynamical simulation freeglorys2v4 produced at mercator ocean and era interim atmosphere parameters produced at ecmwf at a daily frequency there is no data assimilation neither physical data nor biogeochemical

sea surface has been estimated for the modelled chlorophyll in comparison with daily satellite observations perruche et al 2019 from this dataset we extracted chl a concentration daily values in coincidence with all the abacus glider transects between mallorca and the ac as for glb daily physical products the cmems global ocean eddy resolving 1 12 horizontal resolution approximatively 8 km 50

the global ocean analysis product global analysis forecast bio 001 028 at 1 4 horizontal resolution for the same starting month baladrón et al 2020 from this dataset we extracted daily chl a concentration values for the time intervals of abacus gliders operations along the mallorca ac transects as for ibi daily physical products the numerical core is based on the nemo v3 6 ocean general circulation model run at 1 12 horizontal resolution in which altimeter data in situ temperature and salinity vertical profiles and satellite sea surface temperature are assimilated baladrón et al 2020 from these datasets we extracted chlorophyll and potential temperature and salinity daily values co located with glider profiles respectively all the data have been accessed from http marine copernicus eu on january 2021 3 results and discussion the description of the water masses and their characteristics using the abacus underwater glider observations has been already given in previous studies e g aulicino et al 2018 cotroneo et al 2019 several authors also discussed the advantages of using glider data for identifying and monitoring mesoscale structures and evaluate their effects on the mixed layer depth hereafter mld and biochemistry e g niewiadomska et al 2008 ruiz et al 2009 olita et al 2014 cotroneo et al 2016 in this work the high resolution in situ glider observations acquired during the abacus surveys realized in the ab during the 2014 2018 period have been analysed and compared to concurrent numerical simulations with a specific focus on chl a concentration measurements and estimates the final goal is to understand to which extent we can obtain a reliable daily estimation of ocean phytoplankton biomass in the study area through the use of cmems models chl a outputs in fact while gliders provide synoptic observations and help monitoring only the ocean area along their tracks numerical simulations can complete this information over wide areas especially when in situ monitoring systems are not available nevertheless they need a proper validation in order to understand the error we commit when using the model products in place of in situ measurements 3 1 statistical analyses comparing ocean datasets obtained by different sources and methodologies e g classical research vessel activities auv remote sensing numerical simulations always requires an accurate statistical analysis here we compare datasets i e cmems model outputs and abacus glider in situ observations that differ in terms of methodological approach spatial and temporal resolution synopticity and that usually are not compared as default thus statistical information is needed to provide a quantitative analysis of the differences between these products firstly each glider profile collected from 2014 to 2018 has been compared to the co located glb and ibi ones considering a subset of the available super observed data from surface to 110 m depth i e the maximum depth at which chl a data presented an interesting variability see figure 8d in cotroneo et al 2019 statistics for the enquired parameters i e potential temperature salinity and chl a concentration have been computed for both the full available dataset table 3 and the single glider surveys table 4 the main results listed in table 3 are also summarized in the taylor diagrams shown in fig 3 which facilitate the comparative assessment of glb red dots and ibi blue dots cmems models these diagrams help to quantify the degree of correspondence between the modelled and the observed information in terms of three statistic descriptors i e the pearson correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse and the standard deviation sd fig 3 points out that the potential temperatures provided by both glb and ibi products present an excellent linear correlation with glider in situ measurements r 0 96 lower but acceptable statistics r 0 66 characterize the performances of both models in representing the upper ocean salinity conversely glb and ibi products present very different statistics when analysing chl a concentrations the correlation results show that glb values are completely unable to reproduce the co located glider in situ observations r 0 05 while ibi ones agree in part with glider measurements r 0 55 this large discrepancy in models performance may be mainly ascribed to the different spatial resolution of the glb 1 4 and ibi 1 12 chl a products which is a significant factor when comparing their outputs to glider data characterized by a variable but finer spatial resolution i e between 2 8 and 8 4 km see details in cotroneo et al 2019 furthermore even though both models underestimate chl a in situ observations table 3 points out that ibi usually provides better simulations also in terms of magnitude of chl a concentration statistical analyses have been also realized for each single glider survey in order to understand if particular in situ ocean conditions encountered during one of the missions at sea could have affected the overall statistical results results are summarized in table 4 as expected also in this case the potential temperatures provided by both cmems models present a high correlation with glider data the r values ranging between 0 82 nov dec 2017 and 0 98 sep oct 2014 and between 0 88 oct dec 2015 and 0 99 sep oct 2014 for glb and ibi respectively this excellent agreement is not found in salinity as well the linear correlation between glb salinities and glider co located observations is more variable ranging between 0 59 and 0 87 just as for potential temperature the highest lowest results are obtained for oct dec 2015 and sep oct 2014 surveys respectively a similar behaviour is found for ibi salinities with r values ranging between 0 69 oct dec 2015 and 0 83 nov dec 2014 a special attention deserves the abacus 4 fall survey nov dec 2017 in fact even though the potential temperatures match well during this glider cruise we found no correlation with glb salinities r 0 07 and a very low one with ibi ones r 0 31 these discrepancies are also evident in latitudinal sections of ab salinity between 0 and 110 m depth provided by the three datasets along the glider track in particular the analysis of the southward transect 16 27 november 2017 see figure s4 in supplementary material shows that glb products do not reproduce correctly neither the spatial pattern nor the magnitude of in situ salinities observed by glider on the other hand although the ibi salinity pattern generally agrees with glider observations the comparison of the latitudinal sections show that the model overestimates the intrusion of fresher surface water masses at the edges of the glider transect this is particularly evident on the southern border where ac variability plays a critical role considering the deep quality control dedicated to glider observations and thermal leg correction we assume that this difference in correlation between potential temperature and salinity may be also ascribed to the higher degree of complexity in salinity model calculation due to the higher number of factors involved in the simulation e g rivers rainfall as for chl a concentration single survey statistics confirm that glb values are not correlated with the co located glider observations as shown by r values which range between 0 47 and 0 22 except than during the may 2018 mission at sea r 0 62 during this survey the thermocline was still deep and a weak stratification characterized the upper ocean as confirmed by the lower values of the derivative of the potential density anomaly observed by the glider see supplementary material it is reasonable to speculate that the model represents the homogeneous water column better than in the other case studies and thus provides a better estimation of the chl a pattern it is also interesting to remark that the 2018 campaign is the only one carried out during spring time instead of fall period unfortunately the available glider dataset does not allow further conclusions about additional in situ observations are necessary to provide more insights about seasonal dependency of models performance conversely ibi simulations agree better than glb with in situ data for most of the glider surveys r 0 6 this is confirmed by the comparison of the upper ocean chl a latitudinal variability along the glider transects see section 3 2 nonetheless very low correlation coefficients are retrieved for nov dec 2016 r 0 30 and nov dec 2017 r 0 24 campaigns even if the chl a simulations present reasonable mean and rmse values all these findings suggested us to pay more attention to chl a concentration variability along the water column thus additional statistical analyses at selected depths between 1 5 m and 108 m have been carried out for each available glider mission at sea the achieved results are summarized in figs 4 and 5 generally glb and ibi potential temperature and salinity products have similar performances when compared to abacus glider measurements with ibi simulations that report higher correlations with in situ data from 60 m to 110 m depth fig 4 conversely chl a simulations present very different results for the two models especially at shallower depths as for potential temperature glb and ibi model outputs have both an excellent correlation with glider measurements in the first meters of the water column from surface to 30 m as we move to deeper levels glb temperature correlation slowly decreases to r 0 62 at 108 m depth while ibi get worse between 40 m and 60 m depth and then improves again to reach r 0 89 at the end of the analysed profile an opposite behaviour characterizes the salinity products with lower performance at surface layer e g r 0 45 at surface than at deeper levels e g r 0 7 at 54 m in particular ibi products show a constant increasing correlation with the highest values computed at 108 m r 0 74 while glb correspondence with glider salinities decreases again from 60 m to 108 m chl a simulations present very different results for the two models especially at shallower depths fig 4 demonstrates that chl a variability along the water column is largely under represented by cmems models daily products and that only ibi outputs are able to reconstruct part of the glider observations i e in the very surface layers r 0 6 in the upper 20 m however for both models there are large changes in the correlation of the analysed parameters between 31 m and 61 m our hypothesis is that this may be associated to the correct simulation of the mld that may have important repercussions on the modelling of the chl a distribution the base of the mixed layer is characterized by rapid variation of the physical parameters and correspond to the depth at which the maximum of chl a is usually observed thus we argue that both models present some inconsistencies more significant for glb products in the mld positioning along the water column mainly due to an inaccurate simulation of the potential temperature and salinity patterns which imply consequent difficulties in representing the correct pattern and magnitude of chl a concentration this hypothesis is also supported by the statistical results of the comparison carried out at selected depths separately for each abacus survey fig 5 as for potential temperature it is difficult to assess that one model always performs better than the other generally ibi products show a more regular correlation with in situ data and give better scores than glb ones but this is not true along the entire water column at shallower depths 0 30 m for example glb seems to reproduce the observed physical variability better than ibi during several surveys e g abacus 2015 this information is also supported by latitudinal sections provided in the supplementary material on the other end glb performance is often characterized by significant decrease in linear correlation with in situ measurements at depths deeper than 40 m we argue that this behaviour strongly depends on the presence of specific ocean features i e local phenomena at spatial scales which are not resolved by glb model the decrease of correlation with glider data in correspondence of the mld is generally noticeable for both models in fig 5 this means that even though a general agreement is found the potential temperature of the ab observed during the glider surveys is adequately represented by cmems daily models only in the very surface meters and in the deep layers with important consequences on the simulations of the primary production descriptors and of other properties associated to strong subsurface gradients as discussed below despite the encouraging results obtained through the overall statistical analyses salinity simulations agree well only with a subset of the available in situ measurements i e those collected during 2014 and 2018 surveys just as for temperature glb simulations give better results at shallower depths ibi between 90 m and 110 m the effect of mld is still appreciable even if its impact on the computed linear correlations is less evident than in potential temperature data as for primary production unfortunately both ibi and glb have serious issues in representing chl a daily variability measured by abacus gliders ibi surface chl a concentrations seem better correlated with in situ observations in the upper layers 0 30 m than in the rest of the water column glb products present less regular agreement and lower r values as discussed above both models show an abrupt decrease of correlation with in situ data at about 30 m to 60 m i e in correspondence of the expected mld position this decrease is clearly recognizable during all the glider surveys presumably a different simulation of the mld causes a shift in the location of the chl a maximum depth along the water column between models and in situ observations and the consequent discrepancy in terms of measured modelled concentrations an indication of the location of the glb and ibi modelled mld during abacus surveys is provided in fig 6 and in the supplementary material figures s1 to s5 where mld position is represented through the first derivative of potential density anomaly this variable shows significant differences between glider and modelled values except in 2016 in terms of both signal intensity and patterns along depth latitude on the other hand a fine agreement exists between this glider derived information and the expected seasonal mld location from climatology d ortenzio et al 2005 for example report seasonal mean values of about 40 m in october and about 60 m in december in the ab see their fig 1 which correspond well with glider observed results this supports our hypothesis of a direct relationship between inaccurate mld modelling and chl a discrepancies nevertheless the statistical results only provide a general picture of the complex scenario that characterizes the ab upper ocean dynamics from this analysis it is extremely difficult to discuss how the model performances are related to other important factors that impact on the variability of the analysed physical and biological properties of the water column e g seasonal variability presence and evolution of small and mesoscale structures and provide a reliable explanation for identifying ocean conditions during which each model is able or not to represent adequately the biomass stocks along the upper ab water column 3 2 latitudinal assessment a case study to enrich the discussion of the statistical analyses reported in the previous section the upper ocean chl a patterns 0 110 m depth observed during each glider survey has been also compared with glb and ibi co located sections across the mallorca ac chokepoint here we discuss the case study of the abacus 2 mission carried out during fall 2015 fig 6 this survey provides the largest number of co located points of comparison for our statistical analyses and is characterized by the higher values of chl a concentration registered during the abacus surveys the other glider data sections along depth and latitude are indeed reported in the supplementary material in order to provide additional examples of the different performances of the glb and ibi models in reproducing the spatial variability of the abacus observations fig 6 presents the potential temperature salinity and chl a glider in situ observations at about 5 km horizontal resolution collected in the algerian basin during 19 30 october 2015 potential density anomaly derivative along depth is also shown to provide information about the mld the measurement collected in the first 110 m depth along the monitoring line realized between the island of mallorca and the ac boundary are reported an evident signature of chl a concentration maximum ranging between 0 4 and 4 8 µg l at different latitudes is generally visible at about 40 70 m depth glider data also point out that the depth of maximum chl a is shallower where chl a concentration is higher the maximum in chl a is likely associated with lower salinity values an evident decrease in temperature and a local rise of isotherms this happens in the southern part of the section at 37 3 and 37 7 n in proximity of the oceanic front between the ac and the mediterranean resident water masses arnone et al 1990 raimbault et al 1993 siokou frangou et al 2010 frontal zones are well known areas where secondary circulation vertical velocities can enhance the uplift of nutrients increasing chl a production a significant increase of chl a in the ac for example has been described by moran et al 2001 who investigated the biomass and production of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in relation to the ac related mesoscale structures during the algers 96 cruise the presence of relatively low salinity filaments located at about 50 60 m depth can be also identified in the middle of the transect at 38 2 n and in its northern part at 38 7 and 39 1 n once again these sub mesoscale filaments are associated with higher chl a concentration respect to the environ even though the observed values are lower than along the southern border this is a confirmation that oceanic fronts as those associated to the ac even at smaller spatial scales can constitute areas of very high chl a concentration cmems ibi and glb model products co located with these glider observations are also presented in fig 6 numerical simulations are able to retrieve some characteristics observed along the water column but important limitations appear due to the lower spatial resolution although the maximum of chl a concentration is usually reproduced well at about 50 70 m depth see also supplementary material both glb and ibi outputs present large differences with glider measurements in terms of concentration that reach up to one order of magnitude as for local maxima patterns of the chl a distribution are also very different especially for glb outputs generally ibi simulations provide better results in terms of both chl a concentration values and patterns in particular these outputs reproduce well the pattern of the local maxima of chl a concentration along the entire transect especially in the northern and southern part of the section i e at 39 2 and 37 7 n nevertheless the retrieved simulations still include important issues that limit its capability to reproduce the ocean structure as needed for advanced ecological studies glider chl a concentration values are generally three four times larger than ibi ones in the euphotic zone these limits may be driven by the impossibility to identify and reproduce sub mesoscale and small scale structures that characterize the study area e g the high salinity filaments observed in fig 6 lower values are indeed provided by glb products which fail in reproducing most of the spatial distribution of the chl a concentration possibly due to the lower spatial resolution 1 4 although it can be argued that models still capture the general picture of the ocean the presence of sub mesoscale structures is rather recurrent and cannot be disregarded in the ab about one month later 1 8 december 2015 the northern part of the mallorca ac transect has been monitored again by the same abacus glider in this second example the signals of the small structures are still evident in terms of potential temperature salinity and chl a concentration even if they show different distribution and magnitude along the first 150 m fig 7 again model products provide a quite different scenario of the water column patterns along depth with ibi products showing the best performance compared with glider observations glb simulations indeed cannot provide reliable insights into the complex structure of the ab water column as seen by the glider 4 discussion and conclusions knowledge of the vertical structure of the bio chemical properties of the ocean is crucial for the estimation of primary production phytoplankton distribution and biological modelling despite its growing importance ocean biomass distribution inventory still needs improvements to represent a valid base for reliable and synoptic estimations chl a concentration represents an excellent proxy for phytoplankton biomass and primary production and offers the possibility to be monitored through several in situ and remote sensed approaches satellite and classical in situ monitoring activities provide an important contribute to chl a estimations but do not resolve completely the spatial and temporal multi resolution variability of ocean biomass distribution and dynamics along sea depth through the water column in fact the analysis of algal biomass is still hindered by practical difficulties satellite observations are strongly limited to penetration depth while in situ samples are based on punctual measurements which are not easy to collect and result discontinue in space and time operational ocean modelling and data assimilation represent an alternative way to obtain a detailed description of the ocean structure with a continuous temporal coverage actually models are able to describe the complex three dimensional water column system but often their outputs do not reproduce its sub mesoscale and small scale characteristics this is crucial to understand ecological processes so additional works are necessary for understanding to which extent different products can be used or not depending on the kind of study the limits of model products are confirmed in this study where two daily cmems products i e glb and ibi are compared with a set of high resolution measurements collected in the ab by gliders during the 2014 2018 time interval the assessment of the cmems simulations show that daily in situ chl a concentration is not well represented by the analysed models whose outputs show low or absent linear correlation with the co located glider measurements and point out important differences in terms of both magnitude and vertical distribution amongst these products the performed statistical analysis show that ibi model provide better results for the analysed case studies for all the available glider surveys the use of ibi model system as a useful tool to better understand the current state and changes in the marine biogeochemistry of mediterranean waters has been already discussed in previous studies e g by gutknecht et al 2019 which also indicated ibi weekly products as useful key variables for developing indicators to monitor the health of marine ecosystems nevertheless section analyses along the glider transects confirm that ibi daily values are largely lower than those observed by gliders even though patterns of chl a maxima generally correspond better than for glb products presumably the effect of sub mesoscale and small scale variability that characterizes the study area is often missed in this context an important role is played by the mld variability that influences the biochemistry processes and could explain differences in chl a concentration described by models and in situ observations previous studies analysed the difference in terms of temperature and salinity patterns between cmems models and glider data along the abacus transects aulicino et al 2018 and showed that medsea analysis forecast outputs produced by the mediterranean forecasting system lecci et al 2019 represent the mld variability of the study area better than ibi and glb products thus having a potential advantage in retrieving more reliable chl a concentration values to date as for medsea only monthly chl a products are available during the abacus campaigns so that it is not possible to verify this hypothesis using co located daily information our findings suggest that if the mld depth is well represented in the ibi and glb outputs then the modelled chl a is in better agreement with glider in situ observations in this sense a deeper quantitative analysis on the role of mld is necessary to complement these results in a separate dedicated study in general as previously assessed by several authors e g pascual et al 2017 hernandez lasheras and mourre 2018 aguiar et al 2020 the absence of a fine correspondence between modelled and measured chl a information stress the importance of further improving the initialization of cmems ocean models usually based on other models having their own weaknesses and of favouring the assimilation of high resolution in situ data in their systems in order to constrain the evolution of the chl a concentration along the water column in the ab the collection and availability of additional in situ observations is essential for feeding numerical models and retrieving more reliable outputs sampling resolution must be also appropriate in order to capture the sub mesoscale and small scale water column patterns which could be missed without the appropriate sampling acquisition strategy this is vital for obtaining high resolution information adequate to improve model performance and advance on the characterisation and understanding of ocean processes and their role in the functioning of marine ecosystems maximizing spatial resolution cannot overlook a proper equilibrium with synopticity and time consumption that usually affect for instance lagrangian floats and ship based measurements respectively for these reasons it becomes necessary to find a complementary use of the available instruments and data in order to supply the discontinuous nature of the actual in situ in this context amongst other sources cost efficient glider surveys can positively contribute to multiplatform data assimilation with important implications in terms of impact on regional modelling improvement of climatology used in model initialization and operational response to emergencies and sustainable management of the marine environment dobricic et al 2010 hayes et al 2019 tintoré et al 2019 additional insights about the usefulness of assimilating glider observations into regional models will be soon provided by forthcoming dedicated research activities by the present authors which will focus on the assimilation of abacus physical and biogeochemical glider data into mediterranean sea regional models e g the western mediterranean operational forecasting system wmop implemented at socib juza et al 2016 mourre et al 2018 although gliders offer the opportunity to modulate the sampling strategy from survey to survey and even during sea activities i e through direct communication when surfacing according to cost efficiency constraints e g days at sea batteries maritime traffic unfortunately at present time the limited number of available auv platforms is largely insufficient to properly contribute to these goals furthermore glider surveys are often dedicated to regional areas and target missions so that acquired data are usually not assimilated or even not suitable to be assimilated in ocean models thus additional efforts are necessary to improve the fleet of operating gliders and increase the number of days at sea as well as to foster and facilitate a closer cooperation between operational oceanographers remote sensing experts and modellers in this direction after the technical issues that halted the 2019 and 2020 campaigns the abacus glider survey series will be back in 2021 enlarging its international and multidisciplinary network in order to complete more glider missions per year to monitor the ab seasonal and interannual variability the increased number of repeated glider sections along the abacus monitoring line will improve the statistical relevancy of the differences and similarities with co located model and satellite retrievals furthermore the glider collection of physical and biological measurements will be enhanced by including new sensors which will provide additional information along the water column of the mallorca ac chokepoint e g cdom par microplastics mammals suberg et al 2014 credit authorship

24588,ocean biomass distribution has a growing importance in the world economy as a global strategic reserve due to environmental and industrial applications and its variability related to climate change satellite imagery allows multi resolution methodologies to obtain estimation and hopefully classification of biomass content over sea surface this information is largely used in numerical simulations and nowadays represents an important contribute to future projections nevertheless satellite models and classical in situ monitoring resolution accuracy sometimes cannot provide data at the finer spatial scales needed to describe the complex three dimensional water column system on the other hand glider surveys allow scientists to collect observations of ocean phenomena at very high resolution along the water column to assess numerical simulations reliability and eventually to assimilate these data into ocean models in this study we present a quantitative comparison between the glider observations collected in the algerian basin western mediterranean sea during the abacus surveys from 2014 to 2018 and the daily outputs of two co located cmems model products i e glb and ibi the achieved results point out that model products are well correlated with glider potential temperature measurements but they still need improvements to provide a correct representation of the chlorophyll concentration variability in the study area generally ibi daily simulations present higher linear correlation with concurrent glider in situ data than glb ones ibi products also reproduce better the pattern of the local maxima of chlorophyll concentration across the algerian basin nevertheless they largely underestimate glider chlorophyll measurements and present significant differences that limit their capability to reproduce its upper ocean concentration that is needed for accomplishing advanced ecological studies keywords glider high resolution measurements phytoplankton biomass monitoring chlorophyll a concentration modelling western mediterranean sea 1 introduction natural capital refers to the stock of natural assets including soil air water and all living things generating a wide range of ecosystem goods and services which enable humans to live and produce value or benefits to people directly or indirectly barbier 2019 these assets are currently under pressure all over the globe resulting in changes in the function of several ecological systems and in the benefits derived by people leach et al 2019 ecosystem services are the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well being so that its valuation is now widely recognised as a useful though sometimes neglected tool for conservation and management in the terrestrial and marine environment merp 2019 moreover understanding marine environment functions and how we alter them is essential for preparation of the basic concepts for conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in the last decades contemporary threats to marine biodiversity due to increasing anthropogenic pressure e g climate change pollution and unsustainable fishing are likely to cause unpredictable changes in the provision of marine ecosystem services marine ecosystems are amongst the most productive environments in the world and their stocks of natural capital offer a bundle of vital ecosystem services merp 2019 in particular ocean biomass distribution has a growing importance in the world economy as a global strategic reserve understanding how the marine environment functions to maintain natural capital to provide goods and services and how we may be altering it directly e g by over exploitation or indirectly e g through climate change is essential for a sustainable long term future for the marine environment and humans picone et al 2017 the alteration of algal community composition and distribution represents an important bio indicator of several climate driven effects on environmental forcing and marine ecosystem equilibrium sathyendranath et al 2014 chlorophyll a hereafter chl a concentration measurements play a fundamental role in marine ecosystem research as excellent proxy for phytoplankton biomass and seawater trophic conditions sathyendranath et al 2017 the information on chl a patterns at global and regional scales is usually pursued through several approaches e g modelling studies in situ measurements and satellite sensors sammartino et al 2018 ocean models has brought to bear a vast range of skills and experience from empirical scientists to modellers to socio economists with the aim of understanding how we can maximise the benefits we get form our seas through trade offs between economic ecological and cultural activities and services while maintaining clean safe and healthy seas and the living natural capital they contain merp 2019 the ocean however is difficult to monitor to study and to model as it is characterized by multiple factors including complex processes occurring on several spatial and temporal scales impressive biodiversity and serious governance issues to obtain a complete view of such processes and provide valuable input data to models ocean scientists aim at collecting data over long time periods and at the higher temporal and spatial resolution feasible historically these measurements were continually provided by fixed sensors e g moorings and ship oceanographic campaigns obtaining measurements which are mostly one dimensional i e at a single point along depth or two dimensional through a cross section i e data along depth on a ship track castagno et al 2020 furthermore using classical methodologies for ocean dynamics monitoring and biomass inventory is usually time consuming and expensive while results can be affected by synopticity and spatio temporal scale issues additionally progress in numerical modelling also demonstrated the importance of mesoscale and fine scale processes in shaping the biochemical cycles and biodiversity distribution lévy et al 2018 since scale interactions are ubiquitous it is then of crucial importance to gain insight simultaneously into the large scale circulation the mesoscale dynamics and the sub mesoscale processes unfortunately reaching this objective using conventional cruise strategies is not straightforward leading to a lack of in situ observations of fine scale processes these difficulties increase due to the lack in some cases of available open source data di luccio et al 2020 since 1970s the availability of satellite imagery allowed the development of new methodologies to obtain a global estimation and hopefully classification of biomass content over sea surface e g strömberg et al 2009 groom et al 2019 also in combination with traditional in situ measurements e g aulicino et al 2016 rivaro et al 2017 misic et al 2017 mangoni et al 2017 rivaro et al 2019a 2019b furthermore 25 years of progress in radar altimetry improved our capability of monitoring and understanding ocean circulation at large and mesoscales but for the fulfillment of stringent requirements of observing sea level rise and its acceleration abdalla et al 2021 buonocore et al 2020 due to their synoptic view satellite observations partly fill the gap between large and fine scale dynamics for many years surface temperature and ocean colour products have been effectively used providing a greatly increased coverage of the ocean at different spatio temporal scales nowadays these products represent an important contribution to ocean studies and are profitably used for assimilation in numerical simulations payne et al 2019 nonetheless their measurements give us information only about the near surface pattern and provide a 2d latitudinal longitudinal view of the ocean without describing what happens in the water column considering the light penetration depth in the seawater for example satellite chl a represents only one fifth of the total chl a content within the euphotic zone ignoring the algal biomass variability at deeper layers morel and berthon 1989 still as for classical in situ measurements satellite products are often limited in resolving the large spatial and temporal variability of ocean biomass distribution and dynamics e g neglecting the small or mesoscale because of their intrinsic characteristics e g revisiting time swath width pixel resolution thus they are not able alone to provide the high resolution detail of the complex three dimensional ocean structure that is needed by ocean modellers for an improved initialization and or validation of their numerical simulations additionally most of satellite data do not reach the adequate resolution and quality when approaching the coast to overcome this limitation several works attempted to reconstruct the sub surface chl a field and or the column integrated primary production from surface satellite observations through different approaches including statistical methods e g morel and berthon 1989 buongiorno nardelli et al 2006 buongiorno nardelli et al 2017 machine learning techniques e g gueye et al 2014 sauzède et al 2016 and neural network methods e g scardi et al 2001 richardson et al 2002 sammartino et al 2018 buongiorno nardelli 2020 although several factors affect the successful extrapolation of the vertical structure from its surface pattern in temperate areas as the mediterranean sea the existence of a strong seasonality makes the chl a vertical structure rather predictable sammartino et al 2018 on the other hand these products are usually validated versus climatological information and infer a smoothed representation of the punctual 3d structure of the ocean that partially improve the very sparse water column in situ information moreover predicted chl a spring bloom can be significantly modified by eddy driven slumping of density gradient at basin scale mahadevan et al 2012 as a result a better design of sampling strategies and an enhanced resolution of data both in space and time are of fundamental importance to capture the observed phenomena along ocean depth lagrangian instruments provided then additional information to complete the description of the ocean variability but faced new limitations this is especially the case of the algerian basin hereafter ab where argo floats residence times for instance are very short taillandier et al 2020 owing to the large density gradients and the associated strong currents poulain et al 2012 bouzaiene et al 2018 recently the advent of autonomous underwater vehicles hereafter auv has enabled a complementary data acquisition approach and a higher accuracy and sampling resolution for a given region of interest such as the ab aulicino et al 2018 cotroneo et al 2019 this could address the pressing need amongst ocean scientists and modellers to efficiently and effectively collect the high resolution data which are expected to improve our monitoring and estimating capability of the phytoplankton ocean biomass stocks in fact auv observations can represent an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the very fine scale ocean processes and provide modellers information useful to reduce the grid size below a few hundred meters and properly resolve the ocean dynamics garreau et al 2020 this is particularly important in specific ocean areas e g the mediterranean sea which are known for being characterized by intense and contrasting dynamics previous studies for instance emphasized that very high resolution in situ data can be essential to identify the effects of frontal instabilities generating chl a filaments or those of eddies acting both as biological barriers and drivers of plankton diversity cotroneo et al 2016 bosse et al 2017 ruiz et al 2019 sanchez roman et al 2019 garreau et al 2020 in this study we i present the high resolution glider ocean observations potential temperature salinity chl a collected in the ab south western mediterranean sea between 2014 and 2018 during a series of dedicated glider surveys cotroneo et al 2019 and ii compare this information with co located numerical simulations outputs provided by copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems the main goal is to evaluate the cmems daily products capability to give us reliable information about the chl a concentration of the water column in one of the most important areas of the mediterranean sea i e the ab and strengthen the importance of glider high resolution data for improving our knowledge of the study area phytoplankton biomass and seawater trophic conditions the paper is structured as follows study area datasets and methodologies are described in section 2 results are presented and discussed in section 3 concluding remarks are summarized in section 4 2 study area and datasets 2 1 the algerian basin the mediterranean sea is a semi enclosed evaporation basin largely driven by the thermohaline circulation which exhibits many processes of primary interest in the functioning of the global ocean robinson and golnaraghi 1994 and presents an high connection amongst its sub basins celentano et al 2020 it is a relatively restrained and accessible area thus providing an excellent opportunity to investigate a large amount of geophysical and biochemical oceanic features barceló llull et al 2020 from long term changes in water properties fusco et al 2008 krauzig et al 2020 to the possible interaction between ocean properties and anthropogenic impact on the marine environment i e marine litter dispersion zambianchi et al 2017 the ab is a wide and deep transit region of the south western mediterranean that occupies a large area between the balearic islands the algerian coast and the sardinia channel fig 1 it is characterised by the presence and interaction of different water masses e g fresh surface atlantic waters more saline resident mediterranean waters intermediate levantine intermediate waters western mediterranean deep waters whose properties varies according to different stages of mixing geographical position and residence time millot et al 1999 the general circulation of these water masses is strongly influenced by both an intense inflow outflow regime and complex circulation patterns pascual et al 2013 aulicino et al 2019 which act at different spatial and temporal scales including basin scale sub basin scale and mesoscale robinson and golnaraghi 1994 vidal vijande et al 2011 allowing multiple interactions and a high seasonal and interannual variability in the basin fusco et al 2003 typically atlantic waters entering from the strait of gibraltar flows eastward carried by the algerian current ac due to complex hydrodynamic processes ac becomes unstable along its path and generates several meanders that usually evolve into fresh core mesoscale structures i e eddies and filaments fig 1 these structures propagate downstream and promote water mass mixing all over the ab ruiz et al 2002 taupier letage et al 2003 testor et al 2005 escudier et al 2016 bosse et al 2016 pessini et al 2018 2020 impacting the distribution of physical properties especially at surface and intermediate depths pascual et al 2013 this dynamic and very energetic activity has also marked repercussions on biogeochemical properties cossarini et al 2012 coppola et al 2018 which modulates biological activity and ecosystems taupier letage 1988 taupier letage et al 2003 through nutrient injection removal into out of the euphotic layer olita et al 2011 cotroneo et al 2016 these processes contribute to algal blooms and primary production rates also leading locally and episodically to unexpectedly high chl a or primary production values for the mediterranean region robinson 1983 raimbault et al 1993 mahadevan et al 2012 2 2 abacus glider dataset gliders are auvs able to provide high resolution physical and biochemical measurements along the water column controlling their buoyancy to allow vertical motion webb et al 2001 four deep slocum g2 glider missions were carried out in the ab between 2014 and 2018 by università degli studi di napoli parthenope in collaboration with balearic islands coastal observing and forecasting system socib and the mediterranean institute for advanced studies imedea csic uib a total of 14 glider deep transects were completed during the four abacus projects realizing a repeated monitoring line between the island of mallorca and the algerian coast fig 2 each mission had an average duration of about 40 days and was mainly carried out during fall i e between september and december 2014 2018 or spring in may june 2018 as summarized in table 1 all the glider surveys were conducted along neighbouring saral altika abacus 1 to abacus 3 and sentinel 3a abacus 4 satellite groundtracks the timing of the glider missions were also accurately planned to be almost simultaneous with the satellite passages in order to optimize the synopticity between in situ and remote sensed observations additionally in 2014 and 2015 after the realization of the defined transects the glider was deviated from the monitoring line to sample specific mesoscale structures identified through near real time satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature maps during data collection gliders dived with an angle of 26 with the sea surface following a typical saw toothed navigation pathway to a maximum depth of 975 m at an average vertical speed of 0 18 0 02 m s with a resulting net horizontal velocity of about 0 36 m s all the glider platforms used during the abacus surveys were equipped with the same instrumentation i e a glider customized ctd by seabird measuring temperature conductivity salinity and pressure depth a two channel combo fluorometer sensor by wetlabs for chl a concentration and turbidity measurement and an oxygen optode by aadi to measure absolute oxygen concentration and saturation in general temperature salinity and oxygen data were sampled to full diving depth 0 975 m depth while the acquisition of the other optical parameters ceased at 300 m depth taking progressively advantage of the lesson learned the glider was programmed to reach the surface at different rates and spatial resolution during the different abacus missions this resulted in a variable resolution of sampling especially in the very surface layer 0 20 m depth which ranges between 2 and 8 km however physical parameters were generally sampled at 1 2 hz on both descending and ascending phase resulting in a vertical resolution of 0 4 m along the water column oxygen information was acquired at 1 4 hz vertical resolution of 0 8 m turbidity and chl a were sampled at 1 8 hz down to 150 m depth and at 1 16 hz from that level down to 300 m depth i e with a vertical resolution of 1 6 and 3 2 m respectively details and motivations of data acquisition strategy during the different surveys as well as quality control procedures and glider technical information e g setting maintenance calibration permission operations are fully described in cotroneo et al 2019 and references therein a deep quality control was applied to glider data in order to exclude any issue in the observations and support the complete reliability of the in situ dataset in particular a double check was carried out in order to verify that the thermal leg correction garau et al 2011 was correctly applied to glider salinity measurements the final glider dataset is available through an unrestricted repository at https doi org 10 25704 b200 3vf5 budillon et al 2018 please notice that the analysis of oxygen data provided in the repository is not included in the present study which focus on chl a concentration as one of the main marine ecological parameters for assessing phytoplankton biomass and trophic conditions comparing gridded forecasts with observations at point locations needs the use of super observations upscaled observations there are several methods available to upscale observations from simple averages distance weighted averages error observational and representativity weighted methods e g daley 1991 to multi variate statistical methods e g pardo iguzquiza 1998 in this study hydrographic and chl a profiles from gliders have been sorted depending on their matching date and location with the model gridded outputs described in section 2 3 then the selected profiles have been averaged to one mean profile per day which is used for co location with model values potential temperature values have been computed through the algorithm coded in the ocean data view odv software 2 3 cmems data data collected during glider field activities were compared with co located products provided by two cmems models which include daily chl a concentration information i e the global reanalysis hereafter glb and the iberian biscay ireland regional seas ocean reanalysis ibi in particular the analysed products include the global reanalysis bio 001 029 and the ibi reanalysis bio 005 003 for chl a information and the global reanalysis phy 001 030 and the ibi multiyear phy 005 002 for physical parameters i e physical temperature salinity and derived variables as summarized in table 2 the glb biogeochemical hindcast for global ocean is produced at mercator ocean toulouse france using pisces biogeochemical model aumont et al 2015 available on the nemo modelling platform it provides 3d biogeochemical fields for the time period 1993 2019 at 1 4 and on 75 vertical levels with a resolution of 1 m near the surface and 200 m in the deep ocean the model is forced offline by daily 3d fields from the ocean dynamical simulation freeglorys2v4 produced at mercator ocean and era interim atmosphere parameters produced at ecmwf at a daily frequency there is no data assimilation neither physical data nor biogeochemical data perruche et al 2019 the available outputs include daily and monthly 3d mean fields interpolated on a standard regular grid in netcdf format on the global ocean an rms difference of 0 371 µg l at sea surface has been estimated for the modelled chlorophyll in comparison with daily satellite observations perruche et al 2019 from this dataset we extracted chl a concentration daily values in coincidence with all the abacus glider transects between mallorca and the ac as for glb daily physical products the cmems global ocean eddy resolving 1 12 horizontal resolution approximatively 8 km 50

concentration values for the time intervals of abacus gliders operations along the mallorca ac transects as for ibi daily physical products the numerical core is based on the nemo v3 6 ocean general circulation model run at 1 12 horizontal resolution in which altimeter data in situ temperature and salinity vertical profiles and satellite sea surface temperature are assimilated baladrón et al 2020 from these datasets we extracted chlorophyll and potential temperature and salinity daily values co located with glider profiles respectively all the data have been accessed from http marine copernicus eu on january 2021 3 results and discussion the description of the water masses and their characteristics using the abacus underwater glider observations has been already given in previous studies e g aulicino et al 2018 cotroneo et al 2019 several authors also discussed the advantages of using glider data for identifying and monitoring mesoscale structures and evaluate their effects on the mixed layer depth hereafter mld and biochemistry e g niewiadomska et al 2008 ruiz et al 2009 olita et al 2014 cotroneo et al 2016 in this work the high resolution in situ glider observations acquired during the abacus surveys realized in the ab during the 2014 2018 period have been analysed and compared to concurrent numerical simulations with a specific focus on chl a concentration measurements and estimates the final goal is to understand to which extent we can obtain a reliable daily estimation of ocean phytoplankton biomass in the study area through the use of cmems models chl a outputs in fact while gliders provide synoptic observations and help monitoring only the ocean area along their tracks numerical simulations can complete this information over wide areas especially when in situ monitoring systems are not available nevertheless they need a proper validation in order to understand the error we commit when using the model products in place of in situ measurements 3 1 statistical analyses comparing ocean datasets obtained by different sources and methodologies e g classical research vessel activities auv remote sensing numerical simulations always requires an accurate statistical analysis here we compare datasets i e cmems model outputs and abacus glider in situ observations that differ in terms of methodological approach spatial and temporal resolution synopticity and that usually are not compared as default thus statistical information is needed to provide a quantitative analysis of the differences between these products firstly each glider profile collected from 2014 to 2018 has been compared to the co located glb and ibi ones considering a subset of the available super observed data from surface to 110 m depth i e the maximum depth at which chl a data presented an interesting variability see figure 8d in cotroneo et al 2019 statistics for the enquired parameters i e potential temperature salinity and chl a concentration have been computed for both the full available dataset table 3 and the single glider surveys table 4 the main results listed in table 3 are also summarized in the taylor diagrams shown in fig 3 which facilitate the comparative assessment of glb red dots and ibi blue dots cmems models these diagrams help to quantify the degree of correspondence between the modelled and the observed information in terms of three statistic descriptors i e the pearson correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse and the standard deviation sd fig 3 points out that the potential temperatures provided by both glb and ibi products present an excellent linear correlation with glider in situ measurements r 0 96 lower but acceptable statistics r 0 66 characterize the performances of both models in representing the upper ocean salinity conversely glb and ibi products present very different statistics when analysing chl a concentrations the correlation results show that glb values are completely unable to reproduce the co located glider in situ observations r 0 05 while ibi ones agree in part with glider measurements r 0 55 this large discrepancy in models performance may be mainly ascribed to the different spatial resolution of the glb 1 4 and ibi 1 12 chl a products which is a significant factor when comparing their outputs to glider data characterized by a variable but finer spatial resolution i e between 2 8 and 8 4 km see details in cotroneo et al 2019 furthermore even though both models underestimate chl a in situ observations table 3 points out that ibi usually provides better simulations also in terms of magnitude of chl a concentration statistical analyses have been also realized for each single glider survey in order to understand if particular in situ ocean conditions encountered during one of the missions at sea could have affected the overall statistical results results are summarized in table 4 as expected also in this case the potential temperatures provided by both cmems models present a high correlation with glider data the r values ranging between 0 82 nov dec 2017 and 0 98 sep oct 2014 and between 0 88 oct dec 2015 and 0 99 sep oct 2014 for glb and ibi respectively this excellent agreement is not found in salinity as well the linear correlation between glb salinities and glider co located observations is more variable ranging between 0 59 and 0 87 just as for potential temperature the highest lowest results are obtained for oct dec 2015 and sep oct 2014 surveys respectively a similar behaviour is found for ibi salinities with r values ranging between 0 69 oct dec 2015 and 0 83 nov dec 2014 a special attention deserves the abacus 4 fall survey nov dec 2017 in fact even though the potential temperatures match well during this glider cruise we found no correlation with glb salinities r 0 07 and a very low one with ibi ones r 0 31 these discrepancies are also evident in latitudinal sections of ab salinity between 0 and 110 m depth provided by the three datasets along the glider track in particular the analysis of the southward transect 16 27 november 2017 see figure s4 in supplementary material shows that glb products do not reproduce correctly neither the spatial pattern nor the magnitude of in situ salinities observed by glider on the other hand although the ibi salinity pattern generally agrees with glider observations the comparison of the latitudinal sections show that the model overestimates the intrusion of fresher surface water masses at the edges of the glider transect this is particularly evident on the southern border where ac variability plays a critical role considering the deep quality control dedicated to glider observations and thermal leg correction we assume that this difference in correlation between potential temperature and salinity may be also ascribed to the higher degree of complexity in salinity model calculation due to the higher number of factors involved in the simulation e g rivers rainfall as for chl a concentration single survey statistics confirm that glb values are not correlated with the co located glider observations as shown by r values which range between 0 47 and 0 22 except than during the may 2018 mission at sea r 0 62 during this survey the thermocline was still deep and a weak stratification characterized the upper ocean as confirmed by the lower values of the derivative of the potential density anomaly observed by the glider see supplementary material it is reasonable to speculate that the model represents the homogeneous water column better than in the other case studies and thus provides a better estimation of the chl a pattern it is also interesting to remark that the 2018 campaign is the only one carried out during spring time instead of fall period unfortunately the available glider dataset does not allow further conclusions about additional in situ observations are necessary to provide more insights about seasonal dependency of models performance conversely ibi simulations agree better than glb with in situ data for most of the glider surveys r 0 6 this is confirmed by the comparison of the upper ocean chl a latitudinal variability along the glider transects see section 3 2 nonetheless very low correlation coefficients are retrieved for nov dec 2016 r 0 30 and nov dec 2017 r 0 24 campaigns even if the chl a simulations present reasonable mean and rmse values all these findings suggested us to pay more attention to chl a concentration variability along the water column thus additional statistical analyses at selected depths between 1 5 m and 108 m have been carried out for each available glider mission at sea the achieved results are summarized in figs 4 and 5 generally glb and ibi potential temperature and salinity products have similar performances when compared to abacus glider measurements with ibi simulations that report higher correlations with in situ data from 60 m to 110 m depth fig 4 conversely chl a simulations present very different results for the two models especially at shallower depths as for potential temperature glb and ibi model outputs have both an excellent correlation with glider measurements in the first meters of the water column from surface to 30 m as we move to deeper levels glb temperature correlation slowly decreases to r 0 62 at 108 m depth while ibi get worse between 40 m and 60 m depth and then improves again to reach r 0 89 at the end of the analysed profile an opposite behaviour characterizes the salinity products with lower performance at surface layer e g r 0 45 at surface than at deeper levels e g r 0 7 at 54 m in particular ibi products show a constant increasing correlation with the highest values computed at 108 m r 0 74 while glb correspondence with glider salinities decreases again from 60 m to 108 m chl a simulations present very different results for the two models especially at shallower depths fig 4 demonstrates that chl a variability along the water column is largely under represented by cmems models daily products and that only ibi outputs are able to reconstruct part of the glider observations i e in the very surface layers r 0 6 in the upper 20 m however for both models there are large changes in the correlation of the analysed parameters between 31 m and 61 m our hypothesis is that this may be associated to the correct simulation of the mld that may have important repercussions on the modelling of the chl a distribution the base of the mixed layer is characterized by rapid variation of the physical parameters and correspond to the depth at which the maximum of chl a is usually observed thus we argue that both models present some inconsistencies more significant for glb products in the mld positioning along the water column mainly due to an inaccurate simulation of the potential temperature and salinity patterns which imply consequent difficulties in representing the correct pattern and magnitude of chl a concentration this hypothesis is also supported by the statistical results of the comparison carried out at selected depths separately for each abacus survey fig 5 as for potential temperature it is difficult to assess that one model always performs better than the other generally ibi products show a more regular correlation with in situ data and give better scores than glb ones but this is not true along the entire water column at shallower depths 0 30 m for example glb seems to reproduce the observed physical variability better than ibi during several surveys e g abacus 2015 this information is also supported by latitudinal sections provided in the supplementary material on the other end glb performance is often characterized by significant decrease in linear correlation with in situ measurements at depths deeper than 40 m we argue that this behaviour strongly depends on the presence of specific ocean features i e local phenomena at spatial scales which are not resolved by glb model the decrease of correlation with glider data in correspondence of the mld is generally noticeable for both models in fig 5 this means that even though a general agreement is found the potential temperature of the ab observed during the glider surveys is adequately represented by cmems daily models only in the very surface meters and in the deep layers with important consequences on the simulations of the primary production descriptors and of other properties associated to strong subsurface gradients as discussed below despite the encouraging results obtained through the overall statistical analyses salinity simulations agree well only with a subset of the available in situ measurements i e those collected during 2014 and 2018 surveys just as for temperature glb simulations give better results at shallower depths ibi between 90 m and 110 m the effect of mld is still appreciable even if its impact on the computed linear correlations is less evident than in potential temperature data as for primary production unfortunately both ibi and glb have serious issues in representing chl a daily variability measured by abacus gliders ibi surface chl a concentrations seem better correlated with in situ observations in the upper layers 0 30 m than in the rest of the water column glb products present less regular agreement and lower r values as discussed above both models show an abrupt decrease of correlation with in situ data at about 30 m to 60 m i e in correspondence of the expected mld position this decrease is clearly recognizable during all the glider surveys presumably a different simulation of the mld causes a shift in the location of the chl a maximum depth along the water column between models and in situ observations and the consequent discrepancy in terms of measured modelled concentrations an indication of the location of the glb and ibi modelled mld during abacus surveys is provided in fig 6 and in the supplementary material figures s1 to s5 where mld position is represented through the first derivative of potential density anomaly this variable shows significant differences between glider and modelled values except in 2016 in terms of both signal intensity and patterns along depth latitude on the other hand a fine agreement exists between this glider derived information and the expected seasonal mld location from climatology d ortenzio et al 2005 for example report seasonal mean values of about 40 m in october and about 60 m in december in the ab see their fig 1 which correspond well with glider observed results this supports our hypothesis of a direct relationship between inaccurate mld modelling and chl a discrepancies nevertheless the statistical results only provide a general picture of the complex scenario that characterizes the ab upper ocean dynamics from this analysis it is extremely difficult to discuss how the model performances are related to other important factors that impact on the variability of the analysed physical and biological properties of the water column e g seasonal variability presence and evolution of small and mesoscale structures and provide a reliable explanation for identifying ocean conditions during which each model is able or not to represent adequately the biomass stocks along the upper ab water column 3 2 latitudinal assessment a case study to enrich the discussion of the statistical analyses reported in the previous section the upper ocean chl a patterns 0 110 m depth observed during each glider survey has been also compared with glb and ibi co located sections across the mallorca ac chokepoint here we discuss the case study of the abacus 2 mission carried out during fall 2015 fig 6 this survey provides the largest number of co located points of comparison for our statistical analyses and is characterized by the higher values of chl a concentration registered during the abacus surveys the other glider data sections along depth and latitude are indeed reported in the supplementary material in order to provide additional examples of the different performances of the glb and ibi models in reproducing the spatial variability of the abacus observations fig 6 presents the potential temperature salinity and chl a glider in situ observations at about 5 km horizontal resolution collected in the algerian basin during 19 30 october 2015 potential density anomaly derivative along depth is also shown to provide information about the mld the measurement collected in the first 110 m depth along the monitoring line realized between the island of mallorca and the ac boundary are reported an evident signature of chl a concentration maximum ranging between 0 4 and 4 8 µg l at different latitudes is generally visible at about 40 70 m depth glider data also point out that the depth of maximum chl a is shallower where chl a concentration is higher the maximum in chl a is likely associated with lower salinity values an evident decrease in temperature and a local rise of isotherms this happens in the southern part of the section at 37 3 and 37 7 n in proximity of the oceanic front between the ac and the mediterranean resident water masses arnone et al 1990 raimbault et al 1993 siokou frangou et al 2010 frontal zones are well known areas where secondary circulation vertical velocities can enhance the uplift of nutrients increasing chl a production a significant increase of chl a in the ac for example has been described by moran et al 2001 who investigated the biomass and production of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton in relation to the ac related mesoscale structures during the algers 96 cruise the presence of relatively low salinity filaments located at about 50 60 m depth can be also identified in the middle of the transect at 38 2 n and in its northern part at 38 7 and 39 1 n once again these sub mesoscale filaments are associated with higher chl a concentration respect to the environ even though the observed values are lower than along the southern border this is a confirmation that oceanic fronts as those associated to the ac even at smaller spatial scales can constitute areas of very high chl a concentration cmems ibi and glb model products co located with these glider observations are also presented in fig 6 numerical simulations are able to retrieve some characteristics observed along the water column but important limitations appear due to the lower spatial resolution although the maximum of chl a concentration is usually reproduced well at about 50 70 m depth see also supplementary material both glb and ibi outputs present large differences with glider measurements in terms of concentration that reach up to one order of magnitude as for local maxima patterns of the chl a distribution are also very different especially for glb outputs generally ibi simulations provide better results in terms of both chl a concentration values and patterns in particular these outputs reproduce well the pattern of the local maxima of chl a concentration along the entire transect especially in the northern and southern part of the section i e at 39 2 and 37 7 n nevertheless the retrieved simulations still include important issues that limit its capability to reproduce the ocean structure as needed for advanced ecological studies glider chl a concentration values are generally three four times larger than ibi ones in the euphotic zone these limits may be driven by the impossibility to identify and reproduce sub mesoscale and small scale structures that characterize the study area e g the high salinity filaments observed in fig 6 lower values are indeed provided by glb products which fail in reproducing most of the spatial distribution of the chl a concentration possibly due to the lower spatial resolution 1 4 although it can be argued that models still capture the general picture of the ocean the presence of sub mesoscale structures is rather recurrent and cannot be disregarded in the ab about one month later 1 8 december 2015 the northern part of the mallorca ac transect has been monitored again by the same abacus glider in this second example the signals of the small structures are still evident in terms of potential temperature salinity and chl a concentration even if they show different distribution and magnitude along the first 150 m fig 7 again model products provide a quite different scenario of the water column patterns along depth with ibi products showing the best performance compared with glider observations glb simulations indeed cannot provide reliable insights into the complex structure of the ab water column as seen by the glider 4 discussion and conclusions knowledge of the vertical structure of the bio chemical properties of the ocean is crucial for the estimation of primary production phytoplankton distribution and biological modelling despite its growing importance ocean biomass distribution inventory still needs improvements to represent a valid base for reliable and synoptic estimations chl a concentration represents an excellent proxy for phytoplankton biomass and primary production and offers the possibility to be monitored through several in situ and remote sensed approaches satellite and classical in situ monitoring activities provide an important contribute to chl a estimations but do not resolve completely the spatial and temporal multi resolution variability of ocean biomass distribution and dynamics along sea depth through the water column in fact the analysis of algal biomass is still hindered by practical difficulties satellite observations are strongly limited to penetration depth while in situ samples are based on punctual measurements which are not easy to collect and result discontinue in space and time operational ocean modelling and data assimilation represent an alternative way to obtain a detailed description of the ocean structure with a continuous temporal coverage actually models are able to describe the complex three dimensional water column system but often their outputs do not reproduce its sub mesoscale and small scale characteristics this is crucial to understand ecological processes so additional works are necessary for understanding to which extent different products can be used or not depending on the kind of study the limits of model products are confirmed in this study where two daily cmems products i e glb and ibi are compared with a set of high resolution measurements collected in the ab by gliders during the 2014 2018 time interval the assessment of the cmems simulations show that daily in situ chl a concentration is not well represented by the analysed models whose outputs show low or absent linear correlation with the co located glider measurements and point out important differences in terms of both magnitude and vertical distribution amongst these products the performed statistical analysis show that ibi model provide better results for the analysed case studies for all the available glider surveys the use of ibi model system as a useful tool to better understand the current state and changes in the marine biogeochemistry of mediterranean waters has been already discussed in previous studies e g by gutknecht et al 2019 which also indicated ibi weekly products as useful key variables for developing indicators to monitor the health of marine ecosystems nevertheless section analyses along the glider transects confirm that ibi daily values are largely lower than those observed by gliders even though patterns of chl a maxima generally correspond better than for glb products presumably the effect of sub mesoscale and small scale variability that characterizes the study area is often missed in this context an important role is played by the mld variability that influences the biochemistry processes and could explain differences in chl a concentration described by models and in situ observations previous studies analysed the difference in terms of temperature and salinity patterns between cmems models and glider data along the abacus transects aulicino et al 2018 and showed that medsea analysis forecast outputs produced by the mediterranean forecasting system lecci et al 2019 represent the mld variability of the study area better than ibi and glb products thus having a potential advantage in retrieving more reliable chl a concentration values to date as for medsea only monthly chl a products are available during the abacus campaigns so that it is not possible to verify this hypothesis using co located daily information our findings suggest that if the mld depth is well represented in the ibi and glb outputs then the modelled chl a is in better agreement with glider in situ observations in this sense a deeper quantitative analysis on the role of mld is necessary to complement these results in a separate dedicated study in general as previously assessed by several authors e g pascual et al 2017 hernandez lasheras and mourre 2018 aguiar et al 2020 the absence of a fine correspondence between modelled and measured chl a information stress the importance of further improving the initialization of cmems ocean models usually based on other models having their own weaknesses and of favouring the assimilation of high resolution in situ data in their systems in order to constrain the evolution of the chl a concentration along the water column in the ab the collection and availability of additional in situ observations is essential for feeding numerical models and retrieving more reliable outputs sampling resolution must be also appropriate in order to capture the sub mesoscale and small scale water column patterns which could be missed without the appropriate sampling acquisition strategy this is vital for obtaining high resolution information adequate to improve model performance and advance on the characterisation and understanding of ocean processes and their role in the functioning of marine ecosystems maximizing spatial resolution cannot overlook a proper equilibrium with synopticity and time consumption that usually affect for instance lagrangian floats and ship based measurements respectively for these reasons it becomes necessary to find a complementary use of the available instruments and data in order to supply the discontinuous nature of the actual in situ in this context amongst other sources cost efficient glider surveys can positively contribute to multiplatform data assimilation with important implications in terms of impact on regional modelling improvement of climatology used in model initialization and operational response to emergencies and sustainable management of the marine environment dobricic et al 2010 hayes et al 2019 tintoré et al 2019 additional insights about the usefulness of assimilating glider observations into regional models will be soon provided by forthcoming dedicated research activities by the present authors which will focus on the assimilation of abacus physical and biogeochemical glider data into mediterranean sea regional models e g the western mediterranean operational forecasting system wmop implemented at socib juza et al 2016 mourre et al 2018 although gliders offer the opportunity to modulate the sampling strategy from survey to survey and even during sea activities i e through direct communication when surfacing according to cost efficiency constraints e g days at sea batteries maritime traffic unfortunately at present time the limited number of available auv platforms is largely insufficient to properly contribute to these goals furthermore glider surveys are often dedicated to regional areas and target missions so that acquired data are usually not assimilated or even not suitable to be assimilated in ocean models thus additional efforts are necessary to improve the fleet of operating gliders and increase the number of days at sea as well as to foster and facilitate a closer cooperation between operational oceanographers remote sensing experts and modellers in this direction after the technical issues that halted the 2019 and 2020 campaigns the abacus glider survey series will be back in 2021 enlarging its international and multidisciplinary network in order to complete more glider missions per year to monitor the ab seasonal and interannual variability the increased number of repeated glider sections along the abacus monitoring line will improve the statistical relevancy of the differences and similarities with co located model and satellite retrievals furthermore the glider collection of physical and biological measurements will be enhanced by including new sensors which will provide additional information along the water column of the mallorca ac chokepoint e g cdom par microplastics mammals suberg et al 2014 credit authorship

24589,in this study a grid based network environ analysis fem nea framework was developed to identify the ecological risks of the internal components within a landscape scale mining ecosystem with multiple land types in this framework an information based network analysis is applied for addressing ecological risk assessments era based on control allocation ca and energy flow matrix which can quantificationally reflect the relationship between soil ecosystems and ecological communities in order to improve the computational accuracy and efficiency the fem and information based network analysis are combined to further quantify the flow risk among different components within each grid as well as the whole ecosystem compared with the existing nea era model various risk factors and receptors are compatible with the proposed fem nea framework and both direct and indirect effects can be taken into consideration altogether by taking an abandoned mining area of the yanshan mountain as an example risk propagation between all component of the ecosystem concerning both direct risk and integral risk dynamic were quantified the results showed that contaminated soil normally poses risks to surrounding ecological environment thereby affecting local vegetation and microorganisms afterward the risks are passed throughout the ecosystem forming threats to herbivores and predators via the food chain here the probability of risk is ranked as follows village farmland bare land woodland moreover the influence of input energy and data attributes on the prediction results are also discussed when the input energy rises by 50 the control allocation ca from herbivores to soil microorganisms correspondingly increases by 1 00 but the value from herbivores to carnivores decreases by 0 71 this highlights the robustness of the proposed ecological risk assessment framework fem nea in general the fem nea results not only presents the macro scale risk distribution caused by the interaction of each component but also reflects the potential migration direction of the risk center findings can provide a new perspective and method for assessing ecological risks and also help support remediation techniques for contaminated areas with different land types keywords network environ analysis nea the finite element method fem ecological risk assessment heavy metals mining ecosystems 1 introduction intensive exploitation of mineral resources has accelerated the deterioration of the local geological environment kusin et al 2019 in particular many pollutants generated during and after mining such as coal fly ash abandoned ore and waste water normally accumulate in the surrounding environment thereby inducing serious ecological risks buch et al 2021 wu et al 2021 generally ecological risks are defined as the environmental impact of certain factors and the immediate and long term damage or hazardness to ecosystems chen et al 2017 paricheh and osanloo 2018 definitely excessive accumulation of trace metals in soil may pose ecological risks especially at the places where trace metals are much higher than local background values and national soil standards lu et al 2009 however the reality is always complex mine ecosystems are usually composed of diverse components and possess complicated structures combined with mining activities ecological risk assessment era of mine ecosystems normally exhibits great uncertainty he et al 2010 monaghan 2017 this makes it difficult to accurately assess ecological risks of complex mine ecosystem with multiple land use types previously many mathematical models have been proposed for ecosystem eras eijsackers et al 2019 fural et al 2020 such as convolutional neural networks philip et al 2019 bayesian networks arzaghi et al 2018 comprehensive aquatic systems models göransson et al 2018 and environmental contaminant dispersion models soares et al 2020 most of them are either restricted to the evaluation of era on the microcosm scale under circumstances of single stressors or developed on the characteristics of limited risk receptors therefore they have relatively poor capacity for fitting into complex ecosystem meanwhile they are difficult to quantify the transmission and indirect effects of ecological risk among different components eijsackers et al 2019 fural et al 2020 in contrast network environ analysis nea is designed to evaluate the structure and function of an ecosystem based on the material flow biomass or nutrients and energy flow between different species or functional guilds within the system see previous works by patten 1978a 1978b 1982 the nea model can explain the risk information transmitting among different components with material energy flow relationships and also can be employed to evaluate the impact of risk transfer effect on different risk receptors min et al 2018 fath et al 2019 liu and chen 2020 for example fang et al 2014 used nea to calculate direct and indirect flows under the social economic water cycle system tang et al 2017 combined the membership function and fuzzy theory with nea to evaluate the ecological risks of various receptors under the influence of heavy metals cd cu and hg within a power plant ecosystem the model identifies and quantifies risks through dynamic data in the system and analysis of network structure and function kinimo et al 2018 rehman et al 2018 modica et al 2021 previously chen et al 2011 proposed an information based nea model to assess and quantify the interaction chain of different components and analyzed their indirect effects at system level fath et al 2019 assessed seven ecological network analysis ena metrics which convey the status of the ecosystem s variables as well as the flows and relations between the various nodes of the network by combining network environment analysis with the groundwater contaminant migration model sqrsa li et al 2021 assessed naphthalene risks induced by groundwater and analyzed the circulation pathways of the internal risks and corresponding multi level risks caused by the remediation measures under different remediation periods the introduction of input and output environs makes it possible to quantify the direct and indirect interactions between different components of the same ecosystem markham and sangermano 2018 although the traditional nea era model can explain the risk information transmitting among different components with material energy flow relationships and also can be employed to evaluate the impact of risk transfer effect on different risk receptors mao et al 2013 schramski et al 2011 however the ecological risk between the various components was expressed in a really rough and inaccurate manner which made it impossible to reveal the influence of land type on different risk receptors e g carnivore and herbivore this is because material or energy oriented nea normally express the transfer of material and energy flows based on system nodes diami et al 2016 pandey et al 2016 ideally any substance originated in the system s interconnecting network as a whole run in pathway consigned to one output environ and one input environ whipple et al 2014 the transmission of material and energy flows of the ecosystem are charactered by system nodes and several straight lines however in the complex mine ecosystem the risk receptors are usually consisted of a series of sub ecosystems with heterogeneous landscape the risk triggering probability of each component is different if they do not exist in the same sub ecosystems the energy and risks do not transmission among individual nodes but various sub ecosystems the application of original nea model based on system nodes cannot handle this spatial incompatibility and are not essentially adaptable for era within areas with multiple land use over or underestimation might possibly occur the current development of the finite element meshing fem has provided new insight to solve this problem malekshahian and naeeni 2018 savant et al 2019 combining fem with traditional era the studied area can be discretized into numeral grids on the basis of its land use type meanwhile the energy and material flows among the system s components in each grid can be calculated through ecological risk transit theory thus for producing realistic simulation results min et al 2018 mo et al 2019 in view of this a new ecological risk assessment framework combined the finite element method and network environ analysis fem nea has been proposed for estimating the integral and direct flowed ecological risk of landscape scale ecosystems of small mines with multiple land use types the objective of this study is 1 combining fem approach and information based nea to solve the spatial mismatch problem both direct and indirect effects were considered and various risk factors and receptors were technically compatible in the same model 2 calculating the integral and direct ecological risk of the mining area through ecological transmit theory and 3 applying the coupled fem nea framework to the ecological risk analysis era of an abandoned mine with multiple land use types e g forest bare land farmland and village in yanshan mountain of hebei province china furthermore the ecological risk flows controlled allocation of input energies as well as the sensitivity of parameters was also discussed 2 methodology 2 1 grid based risk network mechanism network environ analysis nea is a complementary tool for assessing disturbed ecosystems in systematical management in previous studies information based network environ analysis nea has been adopted to evaluate ecological risk flows in many ecosystems chen et al 2011 tang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 combined with the control allocation ca these models assessed the direct and integral risk values and dynamic risk flow of each component mao et al 2013 schramski et al 2011 according to nea theory a compartment receives material and energy from other available compartments e through its input environ generates and transmits material and energy externally through its output environ thereby completing the storage of useful energy during these processes patten 2006 schramski et al 2007 whipple et al 2007 from information perspective the components in an interactive network should comprise information conveyed by material or energy flows so as to determine how to behave in their niche and adapt themselves to the changing environment similar to an energy network each component serves as an information entity h continuously receiving and generating a variety of information critical to the network s sustainability therefore when exposed to a specific hazard some sensitive components will be influenced immediately and be forced some sensitive components will be forced instantly to change energy storage and dynamic properties and generate quantitative risk rfji in output environs thereafter intervention is exerted on other components to control the ecosystem via their input environ h however when nea applied in particular spatial scale the models exhibit their disadvantages in describing hierarchical nesting structures existing in particular spatial scale to solve this problem the risk network proposed by chen et al 2011 simply integrates the risk transmission paths of the same receptors into one value and expressing the risk flows among various components by a couple of nodes and straight lines although this node based information network solved the inherent incompatibility problem of the nea model under the system wide era environment it has not considered the impacts of the receptor environment e g land type change on the transmission pathway especially the higher probability of component in certain area that exposed to some specific pollutants are ignored to adapt nea to era and obtain precise chart of overall distribution for ecological risks an optimized network environ analysis fem nea was proposed for modeling the ecological risk flow of mining ecosystem with multiple land types unlike the model of node based information network this approach divides the entire study area into grids and analyzes the risk flows among components in each grid ci then ca is selected as the metric that determines the dispersion route of a specific risk in a grid conforming to the standardized control magnitudes that one component generates for each of other components through this method it becomes possible to quantify all risk flows throughout the entire disturbed ecosystem within multiple land types in details we assumed that each land type is an autonomous ecosystem qi so as to express the hierarchical nesting structures existing on particular spatial scale thereafter through arcgis and remote sensing rs the land of the same use type qi was divided into a set of grids ci and the ecological risks and dynamic flow of each grid ci were calculated using information based nea model then based on the food chain all compartments of a specific grid ci were determined in the disturbed ecosystem meanwhile all energy or material flows in a grid ci and between the adjacent grid were tracked and quantified on the basis of the ecological network analysis chen et al 2011 subsequently the control allocation of the established network was conducted and all the ecological risks were allocated to different components of the grid ci after all pressure sources were evaluated considering the different sensitivity of various components to the pressure source within each grid a risk transfer pathway covering its generation to allocation in the grid was established in this process the control allocation and overall risk flow were expressed in matrixes afterward a second layer of node center ki was constructed to maintain the connection among different autonomous systems qi here an autonomous system qi refers to the grids of the same land type through the information stored in the central node ki we can effectively comprehend the risk distribution and patterns of the entire ecosystem through this approach various risk factors and receptors can be compatible with the model and both direct and indirect effects can be taken into consideration together the overall chart of the disturbed ecosystem not only presents the macro scale risk distribution caused by the interactions among the components but also exhibits the potential migration direction based on the location of risk center overall based on the fem nea framework the assessment of soil ecological risks induced by heavy metals can be classified into five major parts a creating the geometry and meshing b input risk assessment c network control allocation d direct and integral risk assessment and e the risk spatial distribution 2 2 creating the geometry and meshing the first step is to create the geometric grids and computational domain for the study area in this step geostatistical method and gis technique are adopted to perform spatial disaggregation of ecological risk analysis vincent et al 2018 after that kriging interpolation method was employed to interpolate the concentrations of heavy metals into the discretized study area nauman and thompson 2014 thereafter a distribution graph of the heavy metal concentrations is obtained during this land types in the area is overlapped in the domain to account for their effects on the heavy metal ecological risks otherwise the corresponding ecological risks may be overestimated or underestimated brungard et al 2015 the second step is to subdivide the computational domain the meshes have structured grids in the near wall regions and unstructured grids in other parts of the domain that contains tetrahedral elements grid size is a key parameter in controlling spatial discretization and has to be carefully set to avoid adverse effects on simulation accuracy vasilev et al 2015 the recommended method to eliminate the influence from grid size is gradually reducing its size until the simulation results remain the same level aiming at seeking for mesh independent solutions 2 3 the input risks in nea risk flows normally result from combining the risk intensity of a factor and its occurrence probability laender et al 2015 the differences in component specific sensitivities to a particular contaminant i e cd zn pb cu etc impact may drive the hazard susceptible components to different degrees lu and lu 2019 in this process the input risk value of compartment i is determined by three parameters risk intensity corresponding probability and sensitivity of each compartment the input risk value rtotal of each grid ci can be expressed as follows 1 r t o t a l i n a i a r i where ai refers to the area proportion of each land type in a specific grid ci n is the total number of land types in the same grid a is the area m2 of the same land type in the study site ri represents initial ecological risk value of the grid ci here the input risk value ri is formulated as follows lyubimova et al 2016 2 r i r i x p x s i 0 r i 1 where rix refers to the above mentioned risk intensity px stands for its probability of occurrence and si represents the sensitivity of the compartment i here rix explains the risk intensity rix resulting from a change of the risk factor x and can be formulated as follows 3 r i x i tx i ox max i tx i ox 0 r i x 1 where itx represents the value of a measurable environmental indicator at a specific time point t after a hazard e g one month one year or one century after the hazard and iox refers to the background value of the indicator which may be the value of an adjacent ecosystem involving similar habitats without being affected that is to say the input risk is expressed via the proportion of the varying magnitude correlated with the background value dimensionless the probability of occurrence px can be further expressed as 4 p x p ex p ox 0 p x 1 where pex is the presence probability of the pollution event x it represents the probability of different heavy metal pollution incidents which can be calculated through the probability of a single pollutant incident being divided by that of the total pollutant occurrence p ox refers to the operating probability of pollutants which is closely correlated with to land types indicating the actual extent of the presence of eco toxicants under different land types 5 p i f n x 1 p oi 1 i f n x 1 p oi 0 nx here refers to the number of risk stuffers occurring during the risk operating process within the relevant ecosystem according to the principles of risk measurement ecological risks of each grid are generally calculated through combining the risk intensity of a risk factor with its occurrence probability and the component specific sensitivity towards a concrete exposure to the grid lyubimova et al 2016 in this study the risk intensity is obtained by simulating the difference between the measured contaminant concentration and the background value meanwhile the probability of occurrence represents the possibility of the soil contamination induced by heavy metals the sensitivity means the sensitivity of each ecological component to different heavy metal contaminants finally these parameters and indicators discussed in this part are correlated with the soil ecosystem 2 4 network control allocation 2 4 1 calculation of risk flow ecological risks arising from heavy metals discharged by mining are normally transferred and diffused among different components chen et al 2011 tang et al 2017 here the simulation of risk flow via direct pathway is based on network control allocation ca network control is usually expressed as the ratio between the pair wise integral flows using network flow and storage analysis and represents the control that each component exerts in the entire system chen et al 2011 metrics called the control difference and control ratio were applied to describe the absolute open loop control relationships between components schramski et al 2007 by combining the above mentioned approaches the control allocation ca method was further developed and improved as a revised version of the distributed control index among components li et al 2021 the ca is the deviation of two pair wise integral flows normalized by the output environment of the dominant component the component that controls the other among all interactive compartments ca can reveal the effects of one compartment exerting on another meanwhile input risk of compartment i from the external environment is transferred to compartment j through ca which can calculate a control strength between components besides the allocation and the dispersion for the dominant factor can be expressed as follows 6 ca c a ij c a ij n ij n ji i 1 n n ij n ji n ij n ji 0 c a ij 0 n ij n ji 0 7 n n ij g 0 g 1 g 2 g m 1 g 1 8 n n ij g 1 g 2 g 3 g m 1 g 1 9 g g g ij g ji 10 g ij g ji f ij t j f ij t i where fij represents the energy or material flow from j to i ti or tj is the sum of the inflow or the outflow of the i th or the j th compartment which is also the accumulation of the energy values of each row or each column in the energy matrix caij denotes the control intensity j applied to i the risk information is transmitted and interpreted among components accordingly while the ecosystem is exposed to specific disturbance 2 5 assessment of direct risks in this study we assume that component i receives an input risk expressed as ri from the external environment the variable fij which refers to the direct flow from component j to i indicates that the energy generated by ej will migrate to ei the variable ei or ej is certain species or another polymerized functional group the feedback flow from ei to ej forms a complete energy cycle making the network system operate for different duration in this study rfij represents the risk flow from the information entity ej to ei the feedback risk flow also occurs in the information network between ei to ej in an energy based network risks are passed back to the first risk generated component thereby strengthening the existing information state therefore the ecological risks arising from the environment based on ca spread to all ecosystem components affecting the entire disturbed ecosystem here the ecosystem risk flow labeled rfji is defined as follows 11 r f j i r i c a j i r f k j r f j i c a k j i j k 1 2 n 0 r f j i r f k j 1 where rfji indicates that some risks are allocated from i to j rfkj represents the risk allocation from j to k meanwhile caji denotes the control imposed by i on j and cakj refers to the control applied to k by j the above equation assumes that component i receives a specific input risk from its external environment with a value of ri and then the risk moves to component j based on its control allocation after which the combined risk flow arrives at component k prior to this rfji is calculated through multiplying the input risk value of component i and the control hi applied on hj similarly rfkj is formulated by multiplying rfji and the control hj applied to hk through this method all risk flows throughout the disturbed ecosystem can be clearly quantified 2 6 assessment of integral risks in this study the internal risk flow among components is treated as an element in the direct risk network of the matrix rf meanwhile the integral risk network of the matrix rn is employed to further study the integral risk process between different components among them rn simultaneously considers both direct flow path length 1 and indirect interaction path length 1 so as to put together all possible pathways of all lengths throughout the disturbed ecosystem 12 rn r n i j r f 1 r f 2 r f i r f n 1 r f 1 2 7 the risk spatial distribution the ecological risk of node center ki is calculated to reflect the connection of different autonomous systems qi zoning is achieved by superposing a number of consequence areas onto the land type map as for all autonomous systems qi direct risk rfkj and integral risk rn are calculated 13 r k f i n r f k j n 14 r k n i n r n n 3 case study two abandoned pyrite mines in chengde hebei province located in the yanshan mountain of north china were selected as the study case the region is under the monsoon continental climate with an annual average temperature of 7 5 c and an annual average precipitation of 727 9 mm large scale mining began in 2006 and most of the mining sites were abandoned in 2012 currently only a few mines are still operating in a primitive manner the major minerals in the area include pyrite fes sphalerite zns and galena pbs and some rare earth minerals nakayama et al 2010 there are lots of tailings mine slags along with some abandoned gravel for road building scattered on the hillsides the soil ph ranges from 6 5 to 7 5 due to long term mining a large amount of slag enters the surface runoff and a large quantity of sediment enters the downstream area lin et al 2014 meanwhile mining drainage causes the increase of the heavy metal concentrations in the surface soil and surrounding streams based on the distribution of mines soil types and plant communities soil 0 25 cm and plant samples were collected in a study area of 10 km2 fig 2 from december 2017 to march 2018 the area was divided into 1000 grids using the finite element method fem in arcgis fig 2 all the grids were classified into four subsystems according to land types namely farmland village woodland and bare land fig 2 if there existed two or more subsystems in one grid the initial input risks were calculated based on the area ratio of each land type here the initial input risk is shown in table 1 in addition four system components i e plants herbivores carnivores and soil microbes representing producers consumers and decomposers were selected as the fundamental units to analyze the ecological risks caused by their exposure to the increasing heavy metal contamination table 1 this is because vegetation herbivores carnivores and soil microbes constituted the basic components of the ecosystem which are directly sensitive to heavy metal contamination in soil ecosystems vegetation e1 and soil microbes e3 were firstly disturbed and affected by ecological threat then herbivores and carnivores were demonstrated to be the carriers of energy and information transmission where risks were transmitted from one to another 4 results based on the field investigation and relevant data we structured the energy flows between interrelated components of each grid based on ecological food web analysis all the input flow output flow and throughflow of the selected compartments were examined fig 3 demonstrates a numeric matrix and topology flow diagram of energy network and displays the risk and ca matrix diagram for the interrelated components of each grid in each grid four components were examined e1 vegetation e2 herbivores e3 soil microbes and e4 carnivores fig 3 a meanwhile the input and output flows of each component were roughly calculated based on the survey data and fath s eco food network analysis fath et al 2007 to simplify the calculation it was assumed that the energy flow in each component could be ignored without affecting the final evaluation results according to the food chain the energy input from e1 was further transferred to other components e2 e3 and e4 however no direct energy flow occurred between e1 and e4 on the other hand fig 3 b shows the risk and ca matrix diagram for the interrelated components within each grid which indicates the influence of one component to other components in the same grid compared with the pathways shown in fig 3 a although no direct energy flow occurred between e1 and e4 the risk from e1 still could migrate to e2 and then indirectly move to e4 due to the indirect mutual energy transferring between the components thus e3 was affected by other components to the maximum extent which means heavy metal contaminants have the greatest indirect impact on soil microbes besides the ca of e1 only experienced a one way migration process e1 e2 e1 e3 and e1 e4 in other words except for the initial input risk the vegetation could hardly receive the ecological risks from other components according to the ca matrix fig 4 expresses the formula of risk flows between the risk pathways h1 h4 and the components of the entire network to simplify the calculation the ecological risk transmission pathways between the components in a single grid are assumed to be the same and the changes in land types will not cause differences in the internal risk pathways of ecological risks under different grids all overlapping risk flows in the integral risk network were aggregated and expressed as a single risk value fig 3 b through eq 11 in this process indirect risk flow was also considered in other words the external environment is no longer the only source and each component may possess multiple risk sources affected by direct or indirect risks therefore when the direct and indirect risks of each component were taken into consideration at the same time the risk flows in the transmission would increase significantly in addition the complex ecological correlation between the components also exerted a critical impact on risk transmission bhatti et al 2018 for instance the results show that h1 passed part of the input risk to the remaining three components but h3 only accepted the input risk as the recipient and did not further transmit it to the next stop this indicates that the integral risk flow of the information entity hi in the information network the total flowing risk namely indirect risk direct risk was not necessarily affected by its input risk table 2 presents the input risks of the four components in the information network the initial risk intensity values of herbivores and carnivores were assumed to be zero because they were not exposed to the heavy metals in soil directly meanwhile due to e1 e4 s different sensitivities to the exposure of cd hg cr pb cu and zn the vulnerability values of vegetation and soil microbes were set at 0 3 and 0 5 respectively baird and brink 2007 this was because when the heavy metal particles deposited into soil and water the living conditions of plants and soil microbes were altered immediately which may affect their growth and reproduction gerhardt et al 2017 grandlic et al 2008 rajkumar et al 2012 this was consistent with our previous study wang et al 2016 li et al 2021 fig 5 compares the contour plots of the concentrations of cd hg cr pb cu and zn in the soil of the study area among the six heavy metals cd had the greatest risk value in the system 0 1985 followed by zn 0 1669 and pb 0 0726 this shows that the contents of zn pb cd and cr in the topsoil gradually decreased with the increase of the distance away from the mining area polluting source indicating the major role of mining in causing the heavy metal contamination of the surrounding ecosystems in this study the highest concentration of heavy metals was discovered in the tailing samples collected on the middle part of hillsides that is to say in an abandoned mine with inconvenient transport heavy metal migration caused by mining was mainly correlated with natural factors including wind precipitation surface runoff etc khan et al 2018 sun et al 2018 however due to various terrain conditions cu and hg contents in the sampling sites were negatively correlated to the distance away from pollution source figs 6 and 7 show the input risks of e1 vegetation and e3 soil microbes obtained from the fem nea framework these results obtained by assuming that vegetation or soil microbes were evenly distributed in the same land type area it shows that under different land types the input risks of different components caused by heavy metals were actually not uniform generally high risk areas mainly existed in farmland villages and bare land the risk values of e1 vegetation could reach as high as 0 2366 cd 0 0096 cr 0 0554 cu 0 058 hg 0 078 pb and 0 165 zn however the values of woodland turned out to be 0 105 cd 0 0035 cr 0 0029 cu 0 0032 hg 0 0036 pb and 0 085 zn respectively as for e3 soil microbes the risk values were 0 18 0 38 cd 0 0065 0 0185 cr 0 048 0 09 cu 0 052 0 10 hg 0 06 0 126 pb and 0 145 0 285 zn this indicates that in this study ecological risks e1 and e3 migrated from mining areas to surrounding farmland bare land and villages while nearby woodland received comparatively slighter risks this phenomenon was mainly correlated to the terrain of the study area whose terrain mainly comprises hills and mountains the topographical conditions effectively prevented the contaminants from moving towards the woodland by the main road however higher heavy metal concentrations occurred in the low lying farmland and bare land thereby inducing higher input ecological risks e1 and e3 in these grids doumas et al 2018 novo et al 2018 fig 8 compares the percentage of the direct risk from each component dr1 dr4 and the percentage of the direct risk in the integral risk h1 h4 under the influence of the six heavy metals in the entire study area the direct risk dr1 dr4 the total is 100 respectively represents the risk flow of the four components the accumulation of input risks φ and the direct risks of each component represents the integral risks h1 h4 of the ecosystems among the six metals cd zn and pb possessed the highest integral risks and cr the lowest take cd as an example even though the input risks of h2 and h4 were zero the integral risks increased by 0 0399 φ2 and 0 0237 φ3 respectively this is not supposed to be neglected meanwhile the direct risk associated with h3 0 1984 was 0 6 times the input risk 0 3308 which means that 66 9 of the integral risk originated from input risk φ while the remaining 33 1 from direct risk dr1 dr2 and dr4 giubilato et al 2016 li et al 2019 compared with other metals cd contamination in the soil posed the greatest ecological risk to e3 in the mining area ali et al 2013 the risk of heavy metal contamination to soil microbes h3 was 2 7 times that of vegetation h1 13 3 times that of herbivores h2 and 22 3 times that of carnivores h4 therefore cd had the most significant risk impact on soil microbes e3 and vegetation e1 followed by herbivores e2 and carnivores e4 5 discussion sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the effect of input parameters on the proposed fem nea framework s results fig 9 in the analysis only t1 the sum of the input energies of e1 was assumed to be the sensitive variable three levels of t1 were set including 1369 lowest value 3268 30 higher than the current value and 3771 50 higher kj ft 2 y 1 then the lowest value was employed as the minimum acceptable level to meet the energy requirements of all components and ensure the stability of the soil vegetation ecosystem fig 9 shows the ca at the moment of t1 reaching its lowest level and increasing by 30 and 50 the results indicated that with the change of t1 merely a slight change occurred in the ca transfer from herbivores e2 to soil microbes e3 and carnivores e4 to be specific if t1 reached its minimum level the ca from herbivores e2 to soil microbes e3 would decrease by 2 48 meanwhile the ca from herbivores e2 to carnivores e4 increased by 1 76 fig 9 if t1 increased by 30 the ca would rise by 0 69 at the same time the ca transferred from herbivores e2 to carnivores e4 would decrease slightly by 0 49 fig 9 when t1 had a growth by 50 the ca from herbivores e2 to soil microorganisms e3 would increase by 1 00 and the ca from herbivores to carnivores would decrease by 0 71 fig 9 this indicates that the change of input energy t1 had limited effects on the evaluation results fig 10 shows the comparison of simulated and observed ecological risks induced by heavy metal in the study area the performance of the proposed fem nea framework was illustrated through the determining coefficient i e r 0 5 and p 0 01 fig 10 here carnivores e4 and herbivores e2 were respectively represented by wild snakes n 5 and rabbits n 5 the integral ecological risk values of carnivores e4 and herbivores e2 which was calculated based on the proposed fem nea framework showed a strong correlation within the actual ecological risk values the r values of herbivores e2 were cd 0 750 cr 0 764 cu 0 745 hg 0 667 pb 0 750 and zn 0 750 fig 9 meanwhile the r values of carnivores e4 were respectively cd 0 643 cr 0 886 cu 0 786 hg 0 775 pb 0 857 and zn 0 0679 fig 10 nevertheless on the other hand carnivores cd risk and herbivore hg risk whose p values were respectively 0 119 and 0 102 turned out to be less correlated with the surveyed values fig 9 one speculation is that the concentrations of hg and cd were rather lower in animals and the bioavailability of these two metals was higher than other metals in the mining area bashir et al 2018 rodríguez estival et al 2019 turull et al 2019 in general the proposed fem nea framework was robust enough to tackle the disturbance caused by minimizing parameter uncertainty the computed era results are compared with the relevant literatures and practices to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the fem nea framework for example tang et al 2017 applied information based nea with fuzzy sets for the soil ecosystems results indicate that integral risk to soil microorganism is 1 60 times greater than its initial risk while herbivores and carnivores suffer approximately 11 11 and 16 67 of vegetation s initial risks from external environment li et al 2021 employed information based nea with stepwise quadratic response surface analysis sqrsa for naphthalene contaminated groundwater ecosystems their result shows that integral risk to soil microorganism is 1 13 times larger than its initial risk under 5 year remediation and about 15 81 and 12 89 of vegetation s initial risks can be transferred to herbivores and carnivores respectively in this study the result shown the integral risk induced by heavy metals taken cd as an example to soil microorganism is 1 60 times larger than its initial risk and about 20 10 and 11 94 of vegetation s initial risks can be transferred to herbivores and carnivores respectively furthermore wang et al 2016 presented a nea based ecological risk assessment framework to a contaminated groundwater remediation site results reveal that integral risks increase to 0 0492 and 0 0410 for herbivores and carnivores respectively 58 8 and 41 2 of the integral risk comes from the input and direct risks for soil microorganism respectively similarly this study displays that about 0 0399 and 0 0237 integral risks are observed in herbivores and carnivores respectively 62 51 and 37 49 of the integral risk comes from the input and direct risks for soil microorganism respectively generally our model and output data could be further validated by comparing these published results in literatures the traditional nea era model can be adopted to obtain the ecological risk values of the study area but it is difficult to quantify the transmission and cumulative effects of ecological risk among different components of the ecosystem within multiple land use lu et al 2009 in contrast the information based nea model can explain the risk information transmitting among different components with material energy flow relationships and also can be employed to evaluate the impact of risk transfer effect on different risk receptors min et al 2018 mo et al 2019 in this study we propose a model of ecological risk assessment with the purpose of optimizing the original information based nea method so that the model can be applied to complex ecosystem with multiple land types combining fem with traditional era the studied area can be discretized into numeral units on the basis of land use type i e forest farmland village and bare land etc mo et al 2019 then each unit can be geometrically divided into a series of grids each grid is treated as a single unit environs and the direct and indirect risk received by the organisms related to heavy metal can be calculated through ecological risk transit theory whipple et al 2014 markham and sangermano 2018 li et al 2021 our results shown that land use zoning is an important factor need to be considered in reflecting the distribution of era among different components in the simulation the required small mesh size has an influence on the precise of the simulation results which would determine the trajectory of eras of each grid as well as the eras distribution of the whole domain overall the proposed fem nea framework has three major advantages over the existing nea era methods chen et al 2011 whipple et al 2014 markham and sangermano 2018 li et al 2021 modica et al 2021 a fem nea realizes the calculation of ecological risk based on a grid based network analysis which is more accurate and efficient than the material or energy oriented nea that express the transfer of material and energy flows based on system nodes b fem nea is useful as it grasps both direct and indirect relationships in a system which are hard to be observed though direct empirical observation li et al 2021 c fem nea not only quantifies the multi level risks of all system components but also determines the energy flow and risk flow direction of different heavy metals in the risk flow path of soil vegetation e1 e4 in different land types this can hardly be obtained through the current nea era models for example tang et al 2017 assessed the ecological risks of multiple receptors caused by heavy metals in a power plant the results of that study were merely based on the simulation of some measured values of heavy metals in specified sampling sites but not on the spatial distribution of the entire heavy metal contaminated survey area therefore the simulation was not accurate enough to reflect the ecological risk transmission in this whole area wang et al 2016 focused on the impact of human activities on ecological risk transmission using network environmental analysis while their simulation ignored the impact on ecological risk transmission induced by different land use types 6 conclusions network environ analysis has been widely employed to analyze the effects of ecosystem processes and environmental flow disturbances in this study we optimized the information based nea to quantify the ecological risk caused by the interaction of all system components organism compared with the previous information based nea model the fem nea framework proposed in this paper mainly focuses on the following aspects 1 heavy metals in mining area 2 landscape scale ecosystem 3 multiple land types and 4 the direct integral and dynamic risk flows here we improved the previous single risk transmission pathway changing a single pathway represented by nodes and straight lines into multiple risk network pathway a combination of numeral nodes and straight lines the territorial incompatibility between nea and era was solved through gis rs and ca as a result the dynamic risk flow and risk probability of each unit can be calculated and detailed spatial ecological risk distribution of each component can be obtained which would effectively enhance the accuracy of the model this study provides an approach to extend the traditional nea to a more compatible stage in which the fem nea model can be employed to assess the ecological risks of mining areas containing multiple ecosystems in addition the topological information about ecological risks obtained in this study is also necessary and helpful in designing more targeted remediation strategies for contaminated areas with different land types in particular we found that border areas among different land types normally face greater ecological risk changes therefore it is recommended to adopt strict remedial strategies in these areas for instance some special policies are supposed to be carried out to tackle the farmland near the contaminated river and then to ensure the safety of agricultural products

24589,in this study a grid based network environ analysis fem nea framework was developed to identify the ecological risks of the internal components within a landscape scale mining ecosystem with multiple land types in this framework an information based network analysis is applied for addressing ecological risk assessments era based on control allocation ca and energy flow matrix which can quantificationally reflect the relationship between soil ecosystems and ecological communities in order to improve the computational accuracy and efficiency the fem and information based network analysis are combined to further quantify the flow risk among different components within each grid as well as the whole ecosystem compared with the existing nea era model various risk factors and receptors are compatible with the proposed fem nea framework and both direct and indirect effects can be taken into consideration altogether by taking an abandoned mining area of the yanshan mountain as an example risk propagation between all component of the ecosystem concerning both direct risk and integral risk dynamic were quantified the results showed that contaminated soil normally poses risks to surrounding ecological environment thereby affecting local vegetation and microorganisms afterward the risks are passed throughout the ecosystem forming threats to herbivores and predators via the food chain here the probability of risk is ranked as follows village farmland bare land woodland moreover the influence of input energy and data attributes on the prediction results are also discussed when the input energy rises by 50 the control allocation ca from herbivores to soil microorganisms correspondingly increases by 1 00 but the value from herbivores to carnivores decreases by 0 71 this highlights the robustness of the proposed ecological risk assessment framework fem nea in general the fem nea results not only presents the macro scale risk distribution caused by the interaction of each component but also reflects the potential migration direction of the risk center findings can provide a new perspective and method for assessing ecological risks and also help support remediation techniques for contaminated areas with different land types keywords network environ analysis nea the finite element method fem ecological risk assessment heavy metals mining ecosystems 1 introduction intensive exploitation of mineral resources has accelerated the deterioration of the local geological environment kusin et al 2019 in particular many pollutants generated during and after mining such as coal fly ash abandoned ore and waste water normally accumulate in the surrounding environment thereby inducing serious ecological risks buch et al 2021 wu et al 2021 generally ecological risks are defined as the environmental impact of certain factors and the immediate and long term damage or hazardness to ecosystems chen et al 2017 paricheh and osanloo 2018 definitely excessive accumulation of trace metals in soil may pose ecological risks especially at the places where trace metals are much higher than local background values and national soil standards lu et al 2009 however the reality is always complex mine ecosystems are usually composed of diverse components and possess complicated structures combined with mining activities ecological risk assessment era of mine ecosystems normally exhibits great uncertainty he et al 2010 monaghan 2017 this makes it difficult to accurately assess ecological risks of complex mine ecosystem with multiple land use types previously many mathematical models have been proposed for ecosystem eras eijsackers et al 2019 fural et al 2020 such as convolutional neural networks philip et al 2019 bayesian networks arzaghi et al 2018 comprehensive aquatic systems models göransson et al 2018 and environmental contaminant dispersion models soares et al 2020 most of them are either restricted to the evaluation of era on the microcosm scale under circumstances of single stressors or developed on the characteristics of limited risk receptors therefore they have relatively poor capacity for fitting into complex ecosystem meanwhile they are difficult to quantify the transmission and indirect effects of ecological risk among different components eijsackers et al 2019 fural et al 2020 in contrast network environ analysis nea is designed to evaluate the structure and function of an ecosystem based on the material flow biomass or nutrients and energy flow between different species or functional guilds within the system see previous works by patten 1978a 1978b 1982 the nea model can explain the risk information transmitting among different components with material energy flow relationships and also can be employed to evaluate the impact of risk transfer effect on different risk receptors min et al 2018 fath et al 2019 liu and chen 2020 for example fang et al 2014 used nea to calculate direct and indirect flows under the social economic water cycle system tang et al 2017 combined the membership function and fuzzy theory with nea to evaluate the ecological risks of various receptors under the influence of heavy metals cd cu and hg within a power plant ecosystem the model identifies and quantifies risks through dynamic data in the system and analysis of network structure and function kinimo et al 2018 rehman et al 2018 modica et al 2021 previously chen et al 2011 proposed an information based nea model to assess and quantify the interaction chain of different components and analyzed their indirect effects at system level fath et al 2019 assessed seven ecological network analysis ena metrics which convey the status of the ecosystem s variables as well as the flows and relations between the various nodes of the network by combining network environment analysis with the groundwater contaminant migration model sqrsa li et al 2021 assessed naphthalene risks induced by groundwater and analyzed the circulation pathways of the internal risks and corresponding multi level risks caused by the remediation measures under different remediation periods the introduction of input and output environs makes it possible to quantify the direct and indirect interactions between different components of the same ecosystem markham and sangermano 2018 although the traditional nea era model can explain the risk information transmitting among different components with material energy flow relationships and also can be employed to evaluate the impact of risk transfer effect on different risk receptors mao et al 2013 schramski et al 2011 however the ecological risk between the various components was expressed in a really rough and inaccurate manner which made it impossible to reveal the influence of land type on different risk receptors e g carnivore and herbivore this is because material or energy oriented nea normally express the transfer of material and energy flows based on system nodes diami et al 2016 pandey et al 2016 ideally any substance originated in the system s interconnecting network as a whole run in pathway consigned to one output environ and one input environ whipple et al 2014 the transmission of material and energy flows of the ecosystem are charactered by system nodes and several straight lines however in the complex mine ecosystem the risk receptors are usually consisted of a series of sub ecosystems with heterogeneous landscape the risk triggering probability of each component is different if they do not exist in the same sub ecosystems the energy and risks do not transmission among individual nodes but various sub ecosystems the application of original nea model based on system nodes cannot handle this spatial incompatibility and are not essentially adaptable for era within areas with multiple land use over or underestimation might possibly occur the current development of the finite element meshing fem has provided new insight to solve this problem malekshahian and naeeni 2018 savant et al 2019 combining fem with traditional era the studied area can be discretized into numeral grids on the basis of its land use type meanwhile the energy and material flows among the system s components in each grid can be calculated through ecological risk transit theory thus for producing realistic simulation results min et al 2018 mo et al 2019 in view of this a new ecological risk assessment framework combined the finite element method and network environ analysis fem nea has been proposed for estimating the integral and direct flowed ecological risk of landscape scale ecosystems of small mines with multiple land use types the objective of this study is 1 combining fem approach and information based nea to solve the spatial mismatch problem both direct and indirect effects were considered and various risk factors and receptors were technically compatible in the same model 2 calculating the integral and direct ecological risk of the mining area through ecological transmit theory and 3 applying the coupled fem nea framework to the ecological risk analysis era of an abandoned mine with multiple land use types e g forest bare land farmland and village in yanshan mountain of hebei province china furthermore the ecological risk flows controlled allocation of input energies as well as the sensitivity of parameters was also discussed 2 methodology 2 1 grid based risk network mechanism network environ analysis nea is a complementary tool for assessing disturbed ecosystems in systematical management in previous studies information based network environ analysis nea has been adopted to evaluate ecological risk flows in many ecosystems chen et al 2011 tang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 combined with the control allocation ca these models assessed the direct and integral risk values and dynamic risk flow of each component mao et al 2013 schramski et al 2011 according to nea theory a compartment receives material and energy from other available compartments e through its input environ generates and transmits material and energy externally through its output environ thereby completing the storage of useful energy during these processes patten 2006 schramski et al 2007 whipple et al 2007 from information perspective the components in an interactive network should comprise information conveyed by material or energy flows so as to determine how to behave in their niche and adapt themselves to the changing environment similar to an energy network each component serves as an information entity h continuously receiving and generating a variety of information critical to the network s sustainability therefore when exposed to a specific hazard some sensitive components will be influenced immediately and be forced some sensitive components will be forced instantly to change energy storage and dynamic properties and generate quantitative risk rfji in output environs thereafter intervention is exerted on other components to control the ecosystem via their input environ h however when nea applied in particular spatial scale the models exhibit their disadvantages in describing hierarchical nesting structures existing in particular spatial scale to solve this problem the risk network proposed by chen et al 2011 simply integrates the risk transmission paths of the same receptors into one value and expressing the risk flows among various components by a couple of nodes and straight lines although this node based information network solved the inherent incompatibility problem of the nea model under the system wide era environment it has not considered the impacts of the receptor environment e g land type change on the transmission pathway especially the higher probability of component in certain area that exposed to some specific pollutants are ignored to adapt nea to era and obtain precise chart of overall distribution for ecological risks an optimized network environ analysis fem nea was proposed for modeling the ecological risk flow of mining ecosystem with multiple land types unlike the model of node based information network this approach divides the entire study area into grids and analyzes the risk flows among components in each grid ci then ca is selected as the metric that determines the dispersion route of a specific risk in a grid conforming to the standardized control magnitudes that one component generates for each of other components through this method it becomes possible to quantify all risk flows throughout the entire disturbed ecosystem within multiple land types in details we assumed that each land type is an autonomous ecosystem qi so as to express the hierarchical nesting structures existing on particular spatial scale thereafter through arcgis and remote sensing rs the land of the same use type qi was divided into a set of grids ci and the ecological risks and dynamic flow of each grid ci were calculated using information based nea model then based on the food chain all compartments of a specific grid ci were determined in the disturbed ecosystem meanwhile all energy or material flows in a grid ci and between the adjacent grid were tracked and quantified on the basis of the ecological network analysis chen et al 2011 subsequently the control allocation of the established network was conducted and all the ecological risks were allocated to different components of the grid ci after all pressure sources were evaluated considering the different sensitivity of various components to the pressure source within each grid a risk transfer pathway covering its generation to allocation in the grid was established in this process the control allocation and overall risk flow were expressed in matrixes afterward a second layer of node center ki was constructed to maintain the connection among different autonomous systems qi here an autonomous system qi refers to the grids of the same land type through the information stored in the central node ki we can effectively comprehend the risk distribution and patterns of the entire ecosystem through this approach various risk factors and receptors can be compatible with the model and both direct and indirect effects can be taken into consideration together the overall chart of the disturbed ecosystem not only presents the macro scale risk distribution caused by the interactions among the components but also exhibits the potential migration direction based on the location of risk center overall based on the fem nea framework the assessment of soil ecological risks induced by heavy metals can be classified into five major parts a creating the geometry and meshing b input risk assessment c network control allocation d direct and integral risk assessment and e the risk spatial distribution 2 2 creating the geometry and meshing the first step is to create the geometric grids and computational domain for the study area in this step geostatistical method and gis technique are adopted to perform spatial disaggregation of ecological risk analysis vincent et al 2018 after that kriging interpolation method was employed to interpolate the concentrations of heavy metals into the discretized study area nauman and thompson 2014 thereafter a distribution graph of the heavy metal concentrations is obtained during this land types in the area is overlapped in the domain to account for their effects on the heavy metal ecological risks otherwise the corresponding ecological risks may be overestimated or underestimated brungard et al 2015 the second step is to subdivide the computational domain the meshes have structured grids in the near wall regions and unstructured grids in other parts of the domain that contains tetrahedral elements grid size is a key parameter in controlling spatial discretization and has to be carefully set to avoid adverse effects on simulation accuracy vasilev et al 2015 the recommended method to eliminate the influence from grid size is gradually reducing its size until the simulation results remain the same level aiming at seeking for mesh independent solutions 2 3 the input risks in nea risk flows normally result from combining the risk intensity of a factor and its occurrence probability laender et al 2015 the differences in component specific sensitivities to a particular contaminant i e cd zn pb cu etc impact may drive the hazard susceptible components to different degrees lu and lu 2019 in this process the input risk value of compartment i is determined by three parameters risk intensity corresponding probability and sensitivity of each compartment the input risk value rtotal of each grid ci can be expressed as follows 1 r t o t a l i n a i a r i where ai refers to the area proportion of each land type in a specific grid ci n is the total number of land types in the same grid a is the area m2 of the same land type in the study site ri represents initial ecological risk value of the grid ci here the input risk value ri is formulated as follows lyubimova et al 2016 2 r i r i x p x s i 0 r i 1 where rix refers to the above mentioned risk intensity px stands for its probability of occurrence and si represents the sensitivity of the compartment i here rix explains the risk intensity rix resulting from a change of the risk factor x and can be formulated as follows 3 r i x i tx i ox max i tx i ox 0 r i x 1 where itx represents the value of a measurable environmental indicator at a specific time point t after a hazard e g one month one year or one century after the hazard and iox refers to the background value of the indicator which may be the value of an adjacent ecosystem involving similar habitats without being affected that is to say the input risk is expressed via the proportion of the varying magnitude correlated with the background value dimensionless the probability of occurrence px can be further expressed as 4 p x p ex p ox 0 p x 1 where pex is the presence probability of the pollution event x it represents the probability of different heavy metal pollution incidents which can be calculated through the probability of a single pollutant incident being divided by that of the total pollutant occurrence p ox refers to the operating probability of pollutants which is closely correlated with to land types indicating the actual extent of the presence of eco toxicants under different land types 5 p i f n x 1 p oi 1 i f n x 1 p oi 0 nx here refers to the number of risk stuffers occurring during the risk operating process within the relevant ecosystem according to the principles of risk measurement ecological risks of each grid are generally calculated through combining the risk intensity of a risk factor with its occurrence probability and the component specific sensitivity towards a concrete exposure to the grid lyubimova et al 2016 in this study the risk intensity is obtained by simulating the difference between the measured contaminant concentration and the background value meanwhile the probability of occurrence represents the possibility of the soil contamination induced by heavy metals the sensitivity means the sensitivity of each ecological component to different heavy metal contaminants finally these parameters and indicators discussed in this part are correlated with the soil ecosystem 2 4 network control allocation 2 4 1 calculation of risk flow ecological risks arising from heavy metals discharged by mining are normally transferred and diffused among different components chen et al 2011 tang et al 2017 here the simulation of risk flow via direct pathway is based on network control allocation ca network control is usually expressed as the ratio between the pair wise integral flows using network flow and storage analysis and represents the control that each component exerts in the entire system chen et al 2011 metrics called the control difference and control ratio were applied to describe the absolute open loop control relationships between components schramski et al 2007 by combining the above mentioned approaches the control allocation ca method was further developed and improved as a revised version of the distributed control index among components li et al 2021 the ca is the deviation of two pair wise integral flows normalized by the output environment of the dominant component the component that controls the other among all interactive compartments ca can reveal the effects of one compartment exerting on another meanwhile input risk of compartment i from the external environment is transferred to compartment j through ca which can calculate a control strength between components besides the allocation and the dispersion for the dominant factor can be expressed as follows 6 ca c a ij c a ij n ij n ji i 1 n n ij n ji n ij n ji 0 c a ij 0 n ij n ji 0 7 n n ij g 0 g 1 g 2 g m 1 g 1 8 n n ij g 1 g 2 g 3 g m 1 g 1 9 g g g ij g ji 10 g ij g ji f ij t j f ij t i where fij represents the energy or material flow from j to i ti or tj is the sum of the inflow or the outflow of the i th or the j th compartment which is also the accumulation of the energy values of each row or each column in the energy matrix caij denotes the control intensity j applied to i the risk information is transmitted and interpreted among components accordingly while the ecosystem is exposed to specific disturbance 2 5 assessment of direct risks in this study we assume that component i receives an input risk expressed as ri from the external environment the variable fij which refers to the direct flow from component j to i indicates that the energy generated by ej will migrate to ei the variable ei or ej is certain species or another polymerized functional group the feedback flow from ei to ej forms a complete energy cycle making the network system operate for different duration in this study rfij represents the risk flow from the information entity ej to ei the feedback risk flow also occurs in the information network between ei to ej in an energy based network risks are passed back to the first risk generated component thereby strengthening the existing information state therefore the ecological risks arising from the environment based on ca spread to all ecosystem components affecting the entire disturbed ecosystem here the ecosystem risk flow labeled rfji is defined as follows 11 r f j i r i c a j i r f k j r f j i c a k j i j k 1 2 n 0 r f j i r f k j 1 where rfji indicates that some risks are allocated from i to j rfkj represents the risk allocation from j to k meanwhile caji denotes the control imposed by i on j and cakj refers to the control applied to k by j the above equation assumes that component i receives a specific input risk from its external environment with a value of ri and then the risk moves to component j based on its control allocation after which the combined risk flow arrives at component k prior to this rfji is calculated through multiplying the input risk value of component i and the control hi applied on hj similarly rfkj is formulated by multiplying rfji and the control hj applied to hk through this method all risk flows throughout the disturbed ecosystem can be clearly quantified 2 6 assessment of integral risks in this study the internal risk flow among components is treated as an element in the direct risk network of the matrix rf meanwhile the integral risk network of the matrix rn is employed to further study the integral risk process between different components among them rn simultaneously considers both direct flow path length 1 and indirect interaction path length 1 so as to put together all possible pathways of all lengths throughout the disturbed ecosystem 12 rn r n i j r f 1 r f 2 r f i r f n 1 r f 1 2 7 the risk spatial distribution the ecological risk of node center ki is calculated to reflect the connection of different autonomous systems qi zoning is achieved by superposing a number of consequence areas onto the land type map as for all autonomous systems qi direct risk rfkj and integral risk rn are calculated 13 r k f i n r f k j n 14 r k n i n r n n 3 case study two abandoned pyrite mines in chengde hebei province located in the yanshan mountain of north china were selected as the study case the region is under the monsoon continental climate with an annual average temperature of 7 5 c and an annual average precipitation of 727 9 mm large scale mining began in 2006 and most of the mining sites were abandoned in 2012 currently only a few mines are still operating in a primitive manner the major minerals in the area include pyrite fes sphalerite zns and galena pbs and some rare earth minerals nakayama et al 2010 there are lots of tailings mine slags along with some abandoned gravel for road building scattered on the hillsides the soil ph ranges from 6 5 to 7 5 due to long term mining a large amount of slag enters the surface runoff and a large quantity of sediment enters the downstream area lin et al 2014 meanwhile mining drainage causes the increase of the heavy metal concentrations in the surface soil and surrounding streams based on the distribution of mines soil types and plant communities soil 0 25 cm and plant samples were collected in a study area of 10 km2 fig 2 from december 2017 to march 2018 the area was divided into 1000 grids using the finite element method fem in arcgis fig 2 all the grids were classified into four subsystems according to land types namely farmland village woodland and bare land fig 2 if there existed two or more subsystems in one grid the initial input risks were calculated based on the area ratio of each land type here the initial input risk is shown in table 1 in addition four system components i e plants herbivores carnivores and soil microbes representing producers consumers and decomposers were selected as the fundamental units to analyze the ecological risks caused by their exposure to the increasing heavy metal contamination table 1 this is because vegetation herbivores carnivores and soil microbes constituted the basic components of the ecosystem which are directly sensitive to heavy metal contamination in soil ecosystems vegetation e1 and soil microbes e3 were firstly disturbed and affected by ecological threat then herbivores and carnivores were demonstrated to be the carriers of energy and information transmission where risks were transmitted from one to another 4 results based on the field investigation and relevant data we structured the energy flows between interrelated components of each grid based on ecological food web analysis all the input flow output flow and throughflow of the selected compartments were examined fig 3 demonstrates a numeric matrix and topology flow diagram of energy network and displays the risk and ca matrix diagram for the interrelated components of each grid in each grid four components were examined e1 vegetation e2 herbivores e3 soil microbes and e4 carnivores fig 3 a meanwhile the input and output flows of each component were roughly calculated based on the survey data and fath s eco food network analysis fath et al 2007 to simplify the calculation it was assumed that the energy flow in each component could be ignored without affecting the final evaluation results according to the food chain the energy input from e1 was further transferred to other components e2 e3 and e4 however no direct energy flow occurred between e1 and e4 on the other hand fig 3 b shows the risk and ca matrix diagram for the interrelated components within each grid which indicates the influence of one component to other components in the same grid compared with the pathways shown in fig 3 a although no direct energy flow occurred between e1 and e4 the risk from e1 still could migrate to e2 and then indirectly move to e4 due to the indirect mutual energy transferring between the components thus e3 was affected by other components to the maximum extent which means heavy metal contaminants have the greatest indirect impact on soil microbes besides the ca of e1 only experienced a one way migration process e1 e2 e1 e3 and e1 e4 in other words except for the initial input risk the vegetation could hardly receive the ecological risks from other components according to the ca matrix fig 4 expresses the formula of risk flows between the risk pathways h1 h4 and the components of the entire network to simplify the calculation the ecological risk transmission pathways between the components in a single grid are assumed to be the same and the changes in land types will not cause differences in the internal risk pathways of ecological risks under different grids all overlapping risk flows in the integral risk network were aggregated and expressed as a single risk value fig 3 b through eq 11 in this process indirect risk flow was also considered in other words the external environment is no longer the only source and each component may possess multiple risk sources affected by direct or indirect risks therefore when the direct and indirect risks of each component were taken into consideration at the same time the risk flows in the transmission would increase significantly in addition the complex ecological correlation between the components also exerted a critical impact on risk transmission bhatti et al 2018 for instance the results show that h1 passed part of the input risk to the remaining three components but h3 only accepted the input risk as the recipient and did not further transmit it to the next stop this indicates that the integral risk flow of the information entity hi in the information network the total flowing risk namely indirect risk direct risk was not necessarily affected by its input risk table 2 presents the input risks of the four components in the information network the initial risk intensity values of herbivores and carnivores were assumed to be zero because they were not exposed to the heavy metals in soil directly meanwhile due to e1 e4 s different sensitivities to the exposure of cd hg cr pb cu and zn the vulnerability values of vegetation and soil microbes were set at 0 3 and 0 5 respectively baird and brink 2007 this was because when the heavy metal particles deposited into soil and water the living conditions of plants and soil microbes were altered immediately which may affect their growth and reproduction gerhardt et al 2017 grandlic et al 2008 rajkumar et al 2012 this was consistent with our previous study wang et al 2016 li et al 2021 fig 5 compares the contour plots of the concentrations of cd hg cr pb cu and zn in the soil of the study area among the six heavy metals cd had the greatest risk value in the system 0 1985 followed by zn 0 1669 and pb 0 0726 this shows that the contents of zn pb cd and cr in the topsoil gradually decreased with the increase of the distance away from the mining area polluting source indicating the major role of mining in causing the heavy metal contamination of the surrounding ecosystems in this study the highest concentration of heavy metals was discovered in the tailing samples collected on the middle part of hillsides that is to say in an abandoned mine with inconvenient transport heavy metal migration caused by mining was mainly correlated with natural factors including wind precipitation surface runoff etc khan et al 2018 sun et al 2018 however due to various terrain conditions cu and hg contents in the sampling sites were negatively correlated to the distance away from pollution source figs 6 and 7 show the input risks of e1 vegetation and e3 soil microbes obtained from the fem nea framework these results obtained by assuming that vegetation or soil microbes were evenly distributed in the same land type area it shows that under different land types the input risks of different components caused by heavy metals were actually not uniform generally high risk areas mainly existed in farmland villages and bare land the risk values of e1 vegetation could reach as high as 0 2366 cd 0 0096 cr 0 0554 cu 0 058 hg 0 078 pb and 0 165 zn however the values of woodland turned out to be 0 105 cd 0 0035 cr 0 0029 cu 0 0032 hg 0 0036 pb and 0 085 zn respectively as for e3 soil microbes the risk values were 0 18 0 38 cd 0 0065 0 0185 cr 0 048 0 09 cu 0 052 0 10 hg 0 06 0 126 pb and 0 145 0 285 zn this indicates that in this study ecological risks e1 and e3 migrated from mining areas to surrounding farmland bare land and villages while nearby woodland received comparatively slighter risks this phenomenon was mainly correlated to the terrain of the study area whose terrain mainly comprises hills and mountains the topographical conditions effectively prevented the contaminants from moving towards the woodland by the main road however higher heavy metal concentrations occurred in the low lying farmland and bare land thereby inducing higher input ecological risks e1 and e3 in these grids doumas et al 2018 novo et al 2018 fig 8 compares the percentage of the direct risk from each component dr1 dr4 and the percentage of the direct risk in the integral risk h1 h4 under the influence of the six heavy metals in the entire study area the direct risk dr1 dr4 the total is 100 respectively represents the risk flow of the four components the accumulation of input risks φ and the direct risks of each component represents the integral risks h1 h4 of the ecosystems among the six metals cd zn and pb possessed the highest integral risks and cr the lowest take cd as an example even though the input risks of h2 and h4 were zero the integral risks increased by 0 0399 φ2 and 0 0237 φ3 respectively this is not supposed to be neglected meanwhile the direct risk associated with h3 0 1984 was 0 6 times the input risk 0 3308 which means that 66 9 of the integral risk originated from input risk φ while the remaining 33 1 from direct risk dr1 dr2 and dr4 giubilato et al 2016 li et al 2019 compared with other metals cd contamination in the soil posed the greatest ecological risk to e3 in the mining area ali et al 2013 the risk of heavy metal contamination to soil microbes h3 was 2 7 times that of vegetation h1 13 3 times that of herbivores h2 and 22 3 times that of carnivores h4 therefore cd had the most significant risk impact on soil microbes e3 and vegetation e1 followed by herbivores e2 and carnivores e4 5 discussion sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the effect of input parameters on the proposed fem nea framework s results fig 9 in the analysis only t1 the sum of the input energies of e1 was assumed to be the sensitive variable three levels of t1 were set including 1369 lowest value 3268 30 higher than the current value and 3771 50 higher kj ft 2 y 1 then the lowest value was employed as the minimum acceptable level to meet the energy requirements of all components and ensure the stability of the soil vegetation ecosystem fig 9 shows the ca at the moment of t1 reaching its lowest level and increasing by 30 and 50 the results indicated that with the change of t1 merely a slight change occurred in the ca transfer from herbivores e2 to soil microbes e3 and carnivores e4 to be specific if t1 reached its minimum level the ca from herbivores e2 to soil microbes e3 would decrease by 2 48 meanwhile the ca from herbivores e2 to carnivores e4 increased by 1 76 fig 9 if t1 increased by 30 the ca would rise by 0 69 at the same time the ca transferred from herbivores e2 to carnivores e4 would decrease slightly by 0 49 fig 9 when t1 had a growth by 50 the ca from herbivores e2 to soil microorganisms e3 would increase by 1 00 and the ca from herbivores to carnivores would decrease by 0 71 fig 9 this indicates that the change of input energy t1 had limited effects on the evaluation results fig 10 shows the comparison of simulated and observed ecological risks induced by heavy metal in the study area the performance of the proposed fem nea framework was illustrated through the determining coefficient i e r 0 5 and p 0 01 fig 10 here carnivores e4 and herbivores e2 were respectively represented by wild snakes n 5 and rabbits n 5 the integral ecological risk values of carnivores e4 and herbivores e2 which was calculated based on the proposed fem nea framework showed a strong correlation within the actual ecological risk values the r values of herbivores e2 were cd 0 750 cr 0 764 cu 0 745 hg 0 667 pb 0 750 and zn 0 750 fig 9 meanwhile the r values of carnivores e4 were respectively cd 0 643 cr 0 886 cu 0 786 hg 0 775 pb 0 857 and zn 0 0679 fig 10 nevertheless on the other hand carnivores cd risk and herbivore hg risk whose p values were respectively 0 119 and 0 102 turned out to be less correlated with the surveyed values fig 9 one speculation is that the concentrations of hg and cd were rather lower in animals and the bioavailability of these two metals was higher than other metals in the mining area bashir et al 2018 rodríguez estival et al 2019 turull et al 2019 in general the proposed fem nea framework was robust enough to tackle the disturbance caused by minimizing parameter uncertainty the computed era results are compared with the relevant literatures and practices to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the fem nea framework for example tang et al 2017 applied information based nea with fuzzy sets for the soil ecosystems results indicate that integral risk to soil microorganism is 1 60 times greater than its initial risk while herbivores and carnivores suffer approximately 11 11 and 16 67 of vegetation s initial risks from external environment li et al 2021 employed information based nea with stepwise quadratic response surface analysis sqrsa for naphthalene contaminated groundwater ecosystems their result shows that integral risk to soil microorganism is 1 13 times larger than its initial risk under 5 year remediation and about 15 81 and 12 89 of vegetation s initial risks can be transferred to herbivores and carnivores respectively in this study the result shown the integral risk induced by heavy metals taken cd as an example to soil microorganism is 1 60 times larger than its initial risk and about 20 10 and 11 94 of vegetation s initial risks can be transferred to herbivores and carnivores respectively furthermore wang et al 2016 presented a nea based ecological risk assessment framework to a contaminated groundwater remediation site results reveal that integral risks increase to 0 0492 and 0 0410 for herbivores and carnivores respectively 58 8 and 41 2 of the integral risk comes from the input and direct risks for soil microorganism respectively similarly this study displays that about 0 0399 and 0 0237 integral risks are observed in herbivores and carnivores respectively 62 51 and 37 49 of the integral risk comes from the input and direct risks for soil microorganism respectively generally our model and output data could be further validated by comparing these published results in literatures the traditional nea era model can be adopted to obtain the ecological risk values of the study area but it is difficult to quantify the transmission and cumulative effects of ecological risk among different components of the ecosystem within multiple land use lu et al 2009 in contrast the information based nea model can explain the risk information transmitting among different components with material energy flow relationships and also can be employed to evaluate the impact of risk transfer effect on different risk receptors min et al 2018 mo et al 2019 in this study we propose a model of ecological risk assessment with the purpose of optimizing the original information based nea method so that the model can be applied to complex ecosystem with multiple land types combining fem with traditional era the studied area can be discretized into numeral units on the basis of land use type i e forest farmland village and bare land etc mo et al 2019 then each unit can be geometrically divided into a series of grids each grid is treated as a single unit environs and the direct and indirect risk received by the organisms related to heavy metal can be calculated through ecological risk transit theory whipple et al 2014 markham and sangermano 2018 li et al 2021 our results shown that land use zoning is an important factor need to be considered in reflecting the distribution of era among different components in the simulation the required small mesh size has an influence on the precise of the simulation results which would determine the trajectory of eras of each grid as well as the eras distribution of the whole domain overall the proposed fem nea framework has three major advantages over the existing nea era methods chen et al 2011 whipple et al 2014 markham and sangermano 2018 li et al 2021 modica et al 2021 a fem nea realizes the calculation of ecological risk based on a grid based network analysis which is more accurate and efficient than the material or energy oriented nea that express the transfer of material and energy flows based on system nodes b fem nea is useful as it grasps both direct and indirect relationships in a system which are hard to be observed though direct empirical observation li et al 2021 c fem nea not only quantifies the multi level risks of all system components but also determines the energy flow and risk flow direction of different heavy metals in the risk flow path of soil vegetation e1 e4 in different land types this can hardly be obtained through the current nea era models for example tang et al 2017 assessed the ecological risks of multiple receptors caused by heavy metals in a power plant the results of that study were merely based on the simulation of some measured values of heavy metals in specified sampling sites but not on the spatial distribution of the entire heavy metal contaminated survey area therefore the simulation was not accurate enough to reflect the ecological risk transmission in this whole area wang et al 2016 focused on the impact of human activities on ecological risk transmission using network environmental analysis while their simulation ignored the impact on ecological risk transmission induced by different land use types 6 conclusions network environ analysis has been widely employed to analyze the effects of ecosystem processes and environmental flow disturbances in this study we optimized the information based nea to quantify the ecological risk caused by the interaction of all system components organism compared with the previous information based nea model the fem nea framework proposed in this paper mainly focuses on the following aspects 1 heavy metals in mining area 2 landscape scale ecosystem 3 multiple land types and 4 the direct integral and dynamic risk flows here we improved the previous single risk transmission pathway changing a single pathway represented by nodes and straight lines into multiple risk network pathway a combination of numeral nodes and straight lines the territorial incompatibility between nea and era was solved through gis rs and ca as a result the dynamic risk flow and risk probability of each unit can be calculated and detailed spatial ecological risk distribution of each component can be obtained which would effectively enhance the accuracy of the model this study provides an approach to extend the traditional nea to a more compatible stage in which the fem nea model can be employed to assess the ecological risks of mining areas containing multiple ecosystems in addition the topological information about ecological risks obtained in this study is also necessary and helpful in designing more targeted remediation strategies for contaminated areas with different land types in particular we found that border areas among different land types normally face greater ecological risk changes therefore it is recommended to adopt strict remedial strategies in these areas for instance some special policies are supposed to be carried out to tackle the farmland near the contaminated river and then to ensure the safety of agricultural products
