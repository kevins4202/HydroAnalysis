preliminarily designed for a mild sea zone which is composed of a number of standardized floating modules in this study the mmfs system has been simplified as a seven module connected system considering the structural deformation of the mmfs system mainly occurs in the connectors among adjacent modules each module is viewed as a rigid body both the hydrodynamic interaction effect and mechanical coupling effect among modules have been taken into consideration in the time domain analysis different outermost connector designs have been proposed and investigated for the mmfs system the results indicate that the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system are sensitive to the effects of the connector types the wave phase and the wavelength the hinge type design of the outermost connector can significantly reduce the extreme responses of both the bending moment and the shear force of the connectors the additional pto damper design for the outermost hinge type connector can effectively reduce the motion of the outermost module and also produce considerable wave energy keywords modular multi purpose floating structure mmfs hydrodynamic interaction mechanical coupling hinge type connection power take off pto damper 1 introduction the land resource is usually very limited and precious for fast developing coastal or island cities such as singapore the conventional approach of land reclamation however is now becoming more expensive environmentally unfriendly and time consuming due to the significant increase in water depths this method is also limited by retaining sufficient sea space in meeting shipping passage anchorages and other maritime needs one promising approach for creating more environment friendly and cost effective place in the sea is the very large floating structure vlfs technology park et al 2004 watanabe et al 2004a 2004b ohmatsu 2005 so far there are various vlfs practical concepts for different design purposes and sea conditions such as a floating airport suzuki 2001 rognaas et al 2001 a floating bridge cheng et al 2018 a floating oil storage facility wan et al 2018 and even a floating fish farm shainee et al 2013 the multi function vlfs systems are always designed for a long service life with large investments lamas pardo et al 2015 different from traditional oil and gas floating structure systems the hydro elastic analysis is necessary for the safe design of the vlfs systems due to the non negligible effect of structural deformation therefore more and more researchers have paid attention to the conceptual design and hydro elastic analysis of different vlfs systems for the small draft continuous vlfs system coupling the classic thin plate theory with the linear wave theory is commonly used for the simplified hydro elastic analysis kashiwagi 1998 wang and tay 2011 cheng et al 2016 2017 and the viability of the method has been verified by means of model tests cheng et al 2014 for the relatively deep draft continuous vlfs system it is necessary to model the vlfs as a thick plate by using mindlin plate theory watanabe et al 2004a 2004b at the early stage of the conceptual design the vlfs system is usually viewed as a single continuous structure however the continuous structure results in significant bending moment and considerable shear force in the floating structure due to the large dimension which is very challenging for the structure uls design the modular concept for the vlfs system could be helpful to deal with large internal forces as well as beneficial for the fabrication transportation installation and even potential expansion of the practical vlfs system the modular vlfs system is usually composed of a number of standardized modules with rigid or flexible connectors riggs and ertekin 1993 watanabe et al 2004a 2004b each module can be simplified as a rigid body while the flexibility of the whole modular vlfs system mainly occurs in the connectors especially for the flexible connectors the use of the flexible hinge type or semi rigid connectors can effectively reduce the hydro elastic responses of the modular vlfs system compared with the responses of rigid connectors fu et al 2007 wang et al 2009 the stiffness of the connectors strongly influences the hydro elastic responses of the vlfs and the loads on the connectors khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2002 gao et al 2011 michailides et al 2013 kim et al 1999 took the structural elasticity of modules into consideration for a semi submersible multi module vlfs system by using finite element method fem coupled with wamit for the frequency domain hydrodynamic analysis a comparative study of rmfc rigid module flexible connector and fea finite element analysis models for the hydroelastic analysis of a mobile offshore base mob vlfs has been performed by riggs et al 2000 the results indicate that the simplified rmfc model with proper corresponding parameters can predict as well as the refined fea model the refined fea model of the vlfs requires a very large number of the structural elements for the full vlfs system and the hydrodynamic interaction effect between different modules should also be taken into the consideration for the hydrodynamic analysis of the multi body modular vlfs systems as a result it will be very time consuming and challenging for the hydro elastic simulation of the full size practical vlfs systems therefore the rmfc model may be a suitable selection for hydro elastic analysis of the modular vlfs system especially for the conceptual and preliminary design process a generalized network model based on the rmfc model has been proposed and developed for modeling the modular vlfs system with arbitrary structure topology xu and zhang 2014 zhang and xu 2015 2017 xia and xu 2016 the geometrical nonlinearities in the chain type connectors have been taken into consideration and several nonlinear phenomena of the modular vlfs have been pointed out such as response jumping motion synchronization and the amplitude death the availability of the network model has been validated by scale model tests of a three module floating platform shi and zhang 2018 in addition comparing with the inner modules of the modular vlfs system the outermost up wave module always tends to suffer the largest motion amplitude lamas pardo et al 2015 especially for the flexible connectors zhang and xu 2015 2017 if a pitch type power take off pto damping system can be added to the outermost hinge connector it may be possible and potentially beneficial to utilize the relative pitch motion between the outermost module and the adjacent inner module to absorb wave energy so far there are very few studies on using the relative motion between modules to generate wave power for the modular vlfs system in the present study a modular multi purpose floating structure mmfs conceptual system utilizing a number of standardized modules is proposed for a mild sea zone different connector types are studied to find suitable solutions considering the structure deformation mainly occurs in the connectors between adjacent modules each module is modeled as a rigid body both the hydrodynamic interaction effect and the mechanical coupling effect among modules have been taken into consideration in the time domain different typical outermost connector designs have been proposed and investigated for the mmfs system the effects of the outermost connector types the additional pto damper the wavelength and phase the on the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system are presented 2 description of a modular multi purpose floating structure system an innovative environmentally friendly modular multi purpose floating structure mmfs system is proposed for a mild sea zone which is shown in fig 1 the configuration is flexible to involve any number of standardized modules depending on the desired full scale dimensions and functions the objective of the conceptual mmfs system is to develop smart cost effective solutions for the creation of land on the sea for potential applications in fig 1 the first two inner green modules are designed with double hinge type connectors serving as a floating bridge to connect the large main structure with the onshore quay boundary this connection can effectively adapt to the tidal effect avoiding significant shear force and bending moment loads the main inner grey modules are designed to connect each other with fixed connectors for the initial purpose of creating relatively stable land on the sea the outermost yellow modules are designed as windward side wave breakers with possible flexible connectors to reduce the hydrodynamic loads acting on the main inner grey modules significant load reductions and resulting cost savings are achievable using these flexible connections the relative inclination between modules is studied below to assure suitability for the potential application the size and shape of the basic modular unit should be carefully investigated and determined to meet a mix of requirements including constructability and ease of marine installation as well as connectivity and flexibility for different global shapes and sizes the basic square module is initially designed for the mmfs system the main design parameters of the basic square module are shown in table 1 another critical aspect for the successful development of the mmfs system is the design of the connectors between modules the connector should allow easy installation under marine condition without risk of damage to the structure therefore four types of connectors have been proposed in this work especially for the outermost connectors which can meet different practical requirements and potentially improve the hydrodynamic performance of the mmfs system the four connectors are shown in fig 2 and briefly described as follows 1 the fixed connector adjacent modules are connected together with no relative motion in all degrees of freedom 2 the hinge connector adjacent modules can move freely in pitch mode and move together with no relative motion in others five degrees of freedom 3 the hinge connector with an additional linear rotational spring the relative pitch motion of adjacent modules will be affected by the additional rotational spring 4 the hinge connector with an additional linear rotational damper the relative pitch motion of adjacent modules will be affected by the additional pitch damper the power take off pto system commonly used in wave energy converter wec system will serve as a linear pitch damper ren et al 2018 in addition the gap between adjacent modules is designed to be 1 m for relative pitch motion with the mesh size of 0 25 m and fenders for reducing the possible impact force due to large relative motions have been set up at the bottom corner of each module however the proposed full scale mmfs conceptual system involves more than 40 connected modules and it will be extremely or even unacceptably time consuming for the whole system s hydrodynamic analysis especially in the time domain considering the present work is mainly aimed at investigating the effects of the outermost connectors on the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system it may be feasible to extract a similar seven module connected in one line subsystem from the whole mmfs system to reduce the computational cost the subsystem of the entire mmfs system is shown in fig 1 with a red dotted box for the beam sea cases the simplified seven module connected one line subsystem of the mmfs is used for investigating the effect of different outermost connectors on the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs 3 numerical model of the simplified mmfs system the sketch of the simplified one line mmfs topology is shown in fig 3 which involves one quay boundary seven basic square modules marked as mi i 1 7 and seven connectors marked as ci i 1 7 between adjacent modules the seven modules are assumed to be rigid bodies and the flexibility of the mmfs system is induced by the connectors the first module m1 connects to the quay boundary as well as the second module m2 through the hinge connector which is suitable for adapting to the practical near shore tidal effect the connectors between m2 m3 m4 m5 and m6 are proposed to be fixed type connections to ensure proper stability of the main structure of the mmfs in addition different kinds of connectors have been taken into consideration for the outermost connector the c7 between the m6 and the m7 to investigate its effect on the hydrodynamic performance of the mmfs system 3 1 governing equations of each module considering the wave loads and the connector loads as external forces the governing equations of each module the i th module in the mmfs system can be generally summarized as follows 1 m i x i c i x i k i x i f i w a v e f i c o n where xi 6 dof is the generalized displacement vector of the i th module mi and ci ki are the mass matrix the damping matrix and the hydrostatic restoring matrix respectively fi wave and fi con are the generalized wave force matrix and the connector force matrix ci is the commonly artificial damping to compensate the viscous effect from the fluid the radiation damping is considered in the fi wave the computational flowchart of the mmfs subsystem is shown in fig 4 and the calculation of the fi wave and fi con will be briefly introduced later 3 2 hydrodynamic model as the mmfs subsystem consists of 7 basic modules the hydrodynamic interaction effect should be taken into consideration based on the linear potential theory the total velocity potential can be written as follows 2 ϕ ϕ i ϕ d i ω i 1 7 j 1 6 u i j ϕ i j where ϕi and ϕd are incident potential and diffraction potential respectively u i j indicates the complex amplitude of the i th module in the j th modal 6 dof ϕ i j indicates the potential due to a unit amplitude motion of the i th module only and other modules are viewed as fixed referred to normalized velocity potential of the j th modal of the i th module then the wave force can be expressed by integrating wave velocity potential along the wet surface of the i th module based on the bernoulli equation 3 f i w a v e s i n i i ω ρ ϕ i ϕ d i ω i 1 7 j 1 6 u i j ϕ i j d s i ω ρ s i n i ϕ i ϕ d d s i 1 7 j 1 6 ω 2 ρ s i re ϕ i j n i d s i ω 2 ρ s i im ϕ i j n i d s u i j f i w i 1 7 j 1 6 a i j j u i j b i j j u i j u i j in the above formula 3 the wave forces can usually be divided into two parts fi w can be viewed as the wave exciting force due to the scattering potential ϕi and ϕd and the other can be viewed as the radiation force due to multi body interaction radiation potential aij and bij can indicate added mass and added damping terms respectively when the modules stay in harmonic motion excited by wave forces the total wave force acting on the i th module can be calculated as 4 f i w a v e f i w e i ω t j 1 7 a i j u i b i j u i the frequency domain hydrodynamic properties are calculated by hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 which includes the hydrodynamic interaction effects between the multi bodies the time domain hydrodynamic model is established in simo code marintek 2009 which includes the mechanical coupling effect among the multi bodies 3 3 connector model the connector forces fi con acting on the i th module induced by adjacent modules relative motions can be expressed as 5 f i c o n j 1 7 φ i j k c i j δ x i x j where φij is a topology matrix the φij is set to be one when the j th module connects with the i th module otherwise φij is set to be zero no connection relationship kcij is the connection stiffness matrix between the i th module and the j th module δ xi xj is the relative motion matrix between the i th module and the j th module different connector types can be effectively modeled in simo with different connection stiffness strategies such as the fixed type the hinge type the hinge type with additional springs or dampers 4 numerical results the design service life for vlfs systems should usually be longer than 60 years with minimum maintenance lamas pardo et al 2015 the design sea state is crucial to check whether this goal can be achieved or not therefore environmental conditions for different return periods at a certain mild sea zone near singapore have been considered and the main information has been listed in table 2 one can find that even in the 100 year period the design sea state is quite mild in this coastal area so this paper will mainly focus on the numerical results under this sea state both the hydrodynamic interaction effect and the connectors mechanical coupling effect among modules have been taken into consideration in the time domain analysis 4 1 comparison of the four proposed outermost connections as previously noted the critical connections for the modular structure are at the outermost locations near the up wave side of the structure in this section four proposed connector types have been applied for the outermost connector c7 which are named c7 hinge c7 fixed c7 hinge with kp with additional linear pitch damping stiffness of 1 0e9 nms rad and c7 hinge with ks with additional linear pitch stiffness of 1 0e9 nm rad respectively the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs with the four different outermost connectors have been investigated and compared under a typical extreme regular wave design wave case the wave height and the wave period are assumed to be h 2 m and t 7 s respectively similar to the 100 year extreme sea case the comparison of each connector s main loads of the mmfs system with different outermost connector types is shown in fig 5 in fig 5a it can be seen that the c7 hinge connection type tends to induce the largest horizontal connection force fx for the same connector location while the c7 fixed connection type tends to induce the smallest fx the fx amplitudes for the c7 hinge with kp additional damper connection type are a bit larger than those of the fixed connection type while a bit smaller than those of the c7 hinge with ks additional stiffness connection type therefore the horizontal force amplitude of the connectors seems to increase as the flexibility of the c7 increases in addition for each connection type the fx amplitudes of the c3 c5 and c7 connectors are very similar while they are much larger than those of the c2 c4 and c6 connectors that may be due to the superposition effect of the hydrodynamic interaction between modules as well as the relative wave phase effect in different connectors in fig 5b the c7 hinge connection type tends to induce the smallest shear force fz for the same connector location while the c7 fixed connection type tends to induce the largest fz it is of the opposite trend to the horizontal connection force fx the shear force amplitudes tend to decrease as the flexibility of the c7 increases the c7 hinge with kp connection type can effectively reduce the fz amplitudes compared with the c7 fixed connection type as well as the c7 hinge with ks connection type the outermost up wave module m7 tends to suffer the largest connection shear force while the fz acting on other connectors will be influenced by the potential shadow effect of the m7 in fig 5c it can be seen that the maximum bending moment my occurs at different connector locations for different connection types the maximum my occurs at the c5 for both the c7 fixed connection type and the c7 hinge with ks connection type while the maximum my occurs at the c6 for the c7 hinge connection type and the c7 hinge with kp connection type the my amplitudes of the c1 and c2 are zero due to the hinge connectors for the two locations the c7 hinge with kp type can significantly reduce the maximum my amplitude especially for comparing with the c7 fixed case and the c7 hinge with ks case it seems that the pitch stiffness of 1 0e9 nm rad for the c7 hinge with ks connection type has limited effect on the reduction of the maximum my compared with the c7 fixed connection type the pitch and heave motion information for different modules with different c7 connection types have been compared and shown in fig 6 in fig 6a the pitch amplitudes from m1 to m6 are similar between different c7 connection types while the significant difference occurs at m7 the c7 hinge connection tends to induce the largest pitch motion of the m7 while the c7 hinge with kp connection can effectively reduce the pitching amplitude by about 35 compared with the c7 hinge connection in fig 6b the c7 hinge connection also tends to induce the largest heave motion of the m7 while the c7 hinge with kp connection can effectively reduce the heave amplitude by about 30 compared with the c7 hinge connection the pitch motion and the heave motion of the c7 hinge with ks case with the pitch stiffness of 1 0e9 nm rad are very similar with those of the c7 fixed connection it indicates that if the additional pitch stiffness of the c7 is large enough the motion performance of the mmfs system is very similar with the c7 fixed connection case as well as the similar connection loads shown in fig 5 however considering the additional damping kp effect for the c7 can be effectively provided by a power take off pto system widely used in wave energy converters wec it may be possible to use the relative pitch motion between the m6 and m7 to produce wave energy for the mmfs system based on the results in both figs 5 and 6 it can be concluded that the c7 hinge with kp connection can not only significantly reduce the maximum fz and my acting on the connectors comparing with the c7 fixed connection but also can effectively reduce the maximum pitch and heave motions of the m7 comparing with the c7 hinge connection in addition it may be possible to design the outermost module m7 for some motion insensitive uses such as a solid storage facility and then the c7 hinge with kp connection can also produce considerable wave energy for the mmfs system in addition the most loaded connector locations for different connector types have been summarized in table 3 in table 3 it can be concluded that the c7 connector always tends to suffer the largest responses of the fx fz as well as motions the outermost connection types can affect the connector location of the largest response of the my 4 2 damping effect of the c7 hinge on the wec performance the damping effect of the c7 hinge with kp connection on the wec performance of the mmfs system has been further investigated different damping levels for the linear pto system have been taken into consideration for the same regular wave case h 2 m t 7s and main results are shown in fig 7 in fig 7a it can be seen that the damping force of the c7 increases as the damping increases however in fig 7b the maximum and mean wave power production firstly increase when the c7 damping is less than 1 0e9 nms rad then they decrease when the c7 damping is larger than 1 0e9 nms rad therefore the optimal c7 damping for the sea case t 7s could be about 1 0e9 nms rad from the view of the highest wec energy production the amplitudes of the heave and the pitch responses of the m7 under different damping levels have been compared and shown in fig 7c it indicates that the responses of the heave and the pitch for the m7 both gradually decrease as the c7 damping increases for a potential practical design it is strongly suggested that the optimal value of the c7 damping needs to well balance three key factors the maximum damping force the maximum wave power and the maximum responses of the m7 in addition the effect of different wave periods on the wec performance of the c7 hinge with kp connection type has also been investigated with the same damping of 1 0e9 nms rad and the same wave height of 2 m the main results are shown in fig 8 in fig 8a and b it can be seen that both the damping force and the mean wave power increase when the wave period is less than 10s while they decrease when the wave period is larger than 10s therefore the preliminary optimal wave period for the damping of 1 0e9 nms rad is about 10s 4 3 different wave period effect the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system with the c7 fixed connection and the c7 hinge with kp connection have been further investigated under a series of regular waves with the same wave height of 2 m the main results of the most loaded connectors for the two selected connection types have been compared in fig 9 and the most loaded connector locations under different wave periods are listed in table 4 in fig 9a it can be seen that the maximum fx of the most loaded connector decreases as the wave period increase and the c7 hinge with kp connection tends to induce slightly larger fx responses compared with the c7 fixed connection case in fig 9b and c the maximum fz and my of the most loaded connectors both gradually increase as the wave period increases the c7 hinge with kp connection can effectively reduce both the maximum fz and my responses compared with the c7 fixed connection type the comparison of the heave amplitudes of the m7 for the two selected connection types is shown in fig 9d it indicates that the heave natural period of the m7 is about 10s and the heave amplitudes of the c7 hinge with kp connection are about twice of those of the c7 fixed connection under the same wave period compared with the c7 fixed connection it can be concluded that the c7 hinge with kp connection can effectively reduce the shear force and the bending moment of the connectors but sacrifice the motions of the outermost module to some extent in table 4 the most loaded connector location of the fx for different wave periods and different c7 connection types are usually different while the most loaded connector location of the fz seems less sensitive to the wave period especially for the c7 fixed connection in addition the most loaded my connector for the same c7 connection type is always the same under different wave periods it is the c5 location for the c7 fixed connection type while it is the c6 location for the c7 hinge with kp connection type it should be noticed that when the wave period is large than 7s the most loaded fz connector starts to change from the outermost c7 to the inner connectors considering the length 35 m of the basic square module is about half of the wavelength for the wave period of 7s it indicates that the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system may be sensitive to the ratio between the wavelength and the outermost module length 4 4 outermost module length effect to further investigate the length ratio effect between the outermost module and the wave on the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system the m6 and m7 have been connected with the fixed connection while the m5 and the m6 have been connected with the hinge connection which is named as the c6 hinge connection then the outermost module length for the c6 hinge case can be viewed as 70 m which is twice of the length of the basic module the same regular wave condition has been selected h 2 m t 7s lw 70 5 m the selected hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system with three typical connection types have been compared and shown in fig 10 compared with the c7 fixed connection case the c6 hinge connection case can also significantly reduce the connectors responses of the fz in fig 10b and the my in fig 10c but it tends to induce a bit larger motion of the outermost module compared with the c7 hinge connection case the c6 hinge connection case can also effectively reduce connectors responses of the fx in fig 10a the my in fig 10c and especially for the pitch of the outermost module in fig 10d but it tends to induce slightly larger shear force on the c6 therefore the longer outermost module with the hinge connection may be an effective way to reduce both the loads on connectors and the motion of the outermost module 5 extreme sea 100 year comparison to investigate the extreme hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system under 100 year random sea cases hs 1 8 m tp 7s jonswap three promising connection types have been selected for the comparison which are the c7 fixed connection most stable case the c6 hinge connection smaller motion response of the m7 case and the c7 with kp connection potential wave energy production case the time histories of the main hydrodynamic responses for the most loaded connectors with three selected connection types have been compared and the main results are shown in fig 11 the most loaded connector numbers for different connection types have been introduced in corresponding legends in fig 11a the fx responses for different connection types are very similar in fig 11b and c the c7 hinge with kp connection type is of the smallest fz and my responses so the c7 hinge with kp connection type is the most effective way to reduce the connectors loads in fig 11d and c the motion responses of the m7 with the c7 hinge with kp connection type is the largest of the three connection types however the corresponding extreme pitch and heave responses are limited within 3 and 0 8 m respectively if the outermost module can be designed for less motion sensitive uses the extreme pitch and heave responses of the m7 with the c7 hinge with kp connection may be acceptable for practical projects by considering such a 100 year extreme wave case the time history of the wave power production with the c7 hinge with kp connection is shown in fig 11f it can be seen that the maximum transient wave energy power can be more than 1 0 mw which is very considerable and beneficial for the mmfs power system to reduce the statistical uncertainties five extreme wave realizations are considered and more detailed averaged statistical results are summarized in table 5 in addition there is no significant difference of the extreme responses of the mmfs system among five different extreme wave realizations in table 5 it can be concluded that the c7 fixed connection type is of the smallest motion responses but inducing the largest connector loads especially for the fz and my comparing with the c7 fixed connection type the c7 hinge with kp connection type can significantly reduce the responses of the most loaded connectors fz by about 45 and my by about 55 as well as produce considerable wave energy but it has to scarify the motion of the outermost module to some degree the hydrodynamic performance of the mmfs with the c6 hinge connection type is similar with the c7 hinge with kp connection type as previously discussed except for the wave power production 6 conclusions this paper deals with the hydrodynamic analysis of a proposed modular multi purpose floating structure system mmfs especially for the effect of different outermost connector c7 designs the hydrodynamic interaction effect among different modules and the mechanical coupling effect of the connectors have been taken into consideration in the time domain analysis the effect of different outermost connector types on the hydrodynamic performance of the mmfs subsystem has been investigated and compared and the main results can be summarized as follows 1 different connector types of the outermost module can strongly influence the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system more rigid outermost connector tends to induce much larger responses of the shear force fz and the bending moment my of the inner connectors such as the c7 fixed connection case flexible hinge type outermost connectors can significantly reduce the responses of both the fz and the my of the most loaded connectors but it has to scarify the motion of the outermost module to some degree by adding a proper pto system served as a linear pitch damper to the outermost hinge connector it can effectively reduce the motion of the outermost module and also produce considerable wave energy 2 the hydrodynamic responses of different connection locations are usually different due to the wave phase effect and the hydrodynamic interaction effect among modules the connector type of the outermost module has a great influence on the location of the most loaded connector 3 the effect of the length ratio between the outermost module and the incident wave on the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system has been figured out results indicate that the longer outermost module with the hinge connection may be an effective way to reduce both the loads on connectors and the motion of the outermost module 4 for the 100 year extreme random sea condition the c7 hinge with kp connection type can significantly reduce the connectors extreme responses of the fz by about 45 and the my by about 55 and also produce considerable wave energy compared with the c7 fixed connector if the outermost module can be designed for less motion sensitive uses the extreme pitch and heave responses of the outermost module may be acceptable for the practical project with the consideration of such a 100 year extreme wave case 7 future works many challenges related to the feasibility of the mmfs system still remain and the development of a robust concept for actual deployment requires further investigation challenges will include the scale model test validation and the whole system analysis the mmfs concept is initially designed for a mild sea zone it should be adaptable to other environmental conditions by modifying the module and connector configurations and finding effective survival strategies for extreme sea cases the study of these aspects should be included in future research acknowledgments this research is supported in

be taken into the consideration for the hydrodynamic analysis of the multi body modular vlfs systems as a result it will be very time consuming and challenging for the hydro elastic simulation of the full size practical vlfs systems therefore the rmfc model may be a suitable selection for hydro elastic analysis of the modular vlfs system especially for the conceptual and preliminary design process a generalized network model based on the rmfc model has been proposed and developed for modeling the modular vlfs system with arbitrary structure topology xu and zhang 2014 zhang and xu 2015 2017 xia and xu 2016 the geometrical nonlinearities in the chain type connectors have been taken into consideration and several nonlinear phenomena of the modular vlfs have been pointed out such as response jumping motion synchronization and the amplitude death the availability of the network model has been validated by scale model tests of a three module floating platform shi and zhang 2018 in addition comparing with the inner modules of the modular vlfs system the outermost up wave module always tends to suffer the largest motion amplitude lamas pardo et al 2015 especially for the flexible connectors zhang and xu 2015 2017 if a pitch type power take off pto damping system can be added to the outermost hinge connector it may be possible and potentially beneficial to utilize the relative pitch motion between the outermost module and the adjacent inner module to absorb wave energy so far there are very few studies on using the relative motion between modules to generate wave power for the modular vlfs system in the present study a modular multi purpose floating structure mmfs conceptual system utilizing a number of standardized modules is proposed for a mild sea zone different connector types are studied to find suitable solutions considering the structure deformation mainly occurs in the connectors between adjacent modules each module is modeled as a rigid body both the hydrodynamic interaction effect and the mechanical coupling effect among modules have been taken into consideration in the time domain different typical outermost connector designs have been proposed and investigated for the mmfs system the effects of the outermost connector types the additional pto damper the wavelength and phase the on the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system are presented 2 description of a modular multi purpose floating structure system an innovative environmentally friendly modular multi purpose floating structure mmfs system is proposed for a mild sea zone which is shown in fig 1 the configuration is flexible to involve any number of standardized modules depending on the desired full scale dimensions and functions the objective of the conceptual mmfs system is to develop smart cost effective solutions for the creation of land on the sea for potential applications in fig 1 the first two inner green modules are designed with double hinge type connectors serving as a floating bridge to connect the large main structure with the onshore quay boundary this connection can effectively adapt to the tidal effect avoiding significant shear force and bending moment loads the main inner grey modules are designed to connect each other with fixed connectors for the initial purpose of creating relatively stable land on the sea the outermost yellow modules are designed as windward side wave breakers with possible flexible connectors to reduce the hydrodynamic loads acting on the main inner grey modules significant load reductions and resulting cost savings are achievable using these flexible connections the relative inclination between modules is studied below to assure suitability for the potential application the size and shape of the basic modular unit should be carefully investigated and determined to meet a mix of requirements including constructability and ease of marine installation as well as connectivity and flexibility for different global shapes and sizes the basic square module is initially designed for the mmfs system the main design parameters of the basic square module are shown in table 1 another critical aspect for the successful development of the mmfs system is the design of the connectors between modules the connector should allow easy installation under marine condition without risk of damage to the structure therefore four types of connectors have been proposed in this work especially for the outermost connectors which can meet different practical requirements and potentially improve the hydrodynamic performance of the mmfs system the four connectors are shown in fig 2 and briefly described as follows 1 the fixed connector adjacent modules are connected together with no relative motion in all degrees of freedom 2 the hinge connector adjacent modules can move freely in pitch mode and move together with no relative motion in others five degrees of freedom 3 the hinge connector with an additional linear rotational spring the relative pitch motion of adjacent modules will be affected by the additional rotational spring 4 the hinge connector with an additional linear rotational damper the relative pitch motion of adjacent modules will be affected by the additional pitch damper the power take off pto system commonly used in wave energy converter wec system will serve as a linear pitch damper ren et al 2018 in addition the gap between adjacent modules is designed to be 1 m for relative pitch motion with the mesh size of 0 25 m and fenders for reducing the possible impact force due to large relative motions have been set up at the bottom corner of each module however the proposed full scale mmfs conceptual system involves more than 40 connected modules and it will be extremely or even unacceptably time consuming for the whole system s hydrodynamic analysis especially in the time domain considering the present work is mainly aimed at investigating the effects of the outermost connectors on the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system it may be feasible to extract a similar seven module connected in one line subsystem from the whole mmfs system to reduce the computational cost the subsystem of the entire mmfs system is shown in fig 1 with a red dotted box for the beam sea cases the simplified seven module connected one line subsystem of the mmfs is used for investigating the effect of different outermost connectors on the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs 3 numerical model of the simplified mmfs system the sketch of the simplified one line mmfs topology is shown in fig 3 which involves one quay boundary seven basic square modules marked as mi i 1 7 and seven connectors marked as ci i 1 7 between adjacent modules the seven modules are assumed to be rigid bodies and the flexibility of the mmfs system is induced by the connectors the first module m1 connects to the quay boundary as well as the second module m2 through the hinge connector which is suitable for adapting to the practical near shore tidal effect the connectors between m2 m3 m4 m5 and m6 are proposed to be fixed type connections to ensure proper stability of the main structure of the mmfs in addition different kinds of connectors have been taken into consideration for the outermost connector the c7 between the m6 and the m7 to investigate its effect on the hydrodynamic performance of the mmfs system 3 1 governing equations of each module considering the wave loads and the connector loads as external forces the governing equations of each module the i th module in the mmfs system can be generally summarized as follows 1 m i x i c i x i k i x i f i w a v e f i c o n where xi 6 dof is the generalized displacement vector of the i th module mi and ci ki are the mass matrix the damping matrix and the hydrostatic restoring matrix respectively fi wave and fi con are the generalized wave force matrix and the connector force matrix ci is the commonly artificial damping to compensate the viscous effect from the fluid the radiation damping is considered in the fi wave the computational flowchart of the mmfs subsystem is shown in fig 4 and the calculation of the fi wave and fi con will be briefly introduced later 3 2 hydrodynamic model as the mmfs subsystem consists of 7 basic modules the hydrodynamic interaction effect should be taken into consideration based on the linear potential theory the total velocity potential can be written as follows 2 ϕ ϕ i ϕ d i ω i 1 7 j 1 6 u i j ϕ i j where ϕi and ϕd are incident potential and diffraction potential respectively u i j indicates the complex amplitude of the i th module in the j th modal 6 dof ϕ i j indicates the potential due to a unit amplitude motion of the i th module only and other modules are viewed as fixed referred to normalized velocity potential of the j th modal of the i th module then the wave force can be expressed by integrating wave velocity potential along the wet surface of the i th module based on the bernoulli equation 3 f i w a v e s i n i i ω ρ ϕ i ϕ d i ω i 1 7 j 1 6 u i j ϕ i j d s i ω ρ s i n i ϕ i ϕ d d s i 1 7 j 1 6 ω 2 ρ s i re ϕ i j n i d s i ω 2 ρ s i im ϕ i j n i d s u i j f i w i 1 7 j 1 6 a i j j u i j b i j j u i j u i j in the above formula 3 the wave forces can usually be divided into two parts fi w can be viewed as the wave exciting force due to the scattering potential ϕi and ϕd and the other can be viewed as the radiation force due to multi body interaction radiation potential aij and bij can indicate added mass and added damping terms respectively when the modules stay in harmonic motion excited by wave forces the total wave force acting on the i th module can be calculated as 4 f i w a v e f i w e i ω t j 1 7 a i j u i b i j u i the frequency domain hydrodynamic properties are calculated by hydrostar bureau veritas 2016 which includes the hydrodynamic interaction effects between the multi bodies the time domain hydrodynamic model is established in simo code marintek 2009 which includes the mechanical coupling effect among the multi bodies 3 3 connector model the connector forces fi con acting on the i th module induced by adjacent modules relative motions can be expressed as 5 f i c o n j 1 7 φ i j k c i j δ x i x j where φij is a topology matrix the φij is set to be one when the j th module connects with the i th module otherwise φij is set to be zero no connection relationship kcij is the connection stiffness matrix between the i th module and the j th module δ xi xj is the relative motion matrix between the i th module and the j th module different connector types can be effectively modeled in simo with different connection stiffness strategies such as the fixed type the hinge type the hinge type with additional springs or dampers 4 numerical results the design service life for vlfs systems should usually be longer than 60 years with minimum maintenance lamas pardo et al 2015 the design sea state is crucial to check whether this goal can be achieved or not therefore environmental conditions for different return periods at a certain mild sea zone near singapore have been considered and the main information has been listed in table 2 one can find that even in the 100 year period the design sea state is quite mild in this coastal area so this paper will mainly focus on the numerical results under this sea state both the hydrodynamic interaction effect and the connectors mechanical coupling effect among modules have been taken into consideration in the time domain analysis 4 1 comparison of the four proposed outermost connections as previously noted the critical connections for the modular structure are at the outermost locations near the up wave side of the structure in this section four proposed connector types have been applied for the outermost connector c7 which are named c7 hinge c7 fixed c7 hinge with kp with additional linear pitch damping stiffness of 1 0e9 nms rad and c7 hinge with ks with additional linear pitch stiffness of 1 0e9 nm rad respectively the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs with the four different outermost connectors have been investigated and compared under a typical extreme regular wave design wave case the wave height and the wave period are assumed to be h 2 m and t 7 s respectively similar to the 100 year extreme sea case the comparison of each connector s main loads of the mmfs system with different outermost connector types is shown in fig 5 in fig 5a it can be seen that the c7 hinge connection type tends to induce the largest horizontal connection force fx for the same connector location while the c7 fixed connection type tends to induce the smallest fx the fx amplitudes for the c7 hinge with kp additional damper connection type are a bit larger than those of the fixed connection type while a bit smaller than those of the c7 hinge with ks additional stiffness connection type therefore the horizontal force amplitude of the connectors seems to increase as the flexibility of the c7 increases in addition for each connection type the fx amplitudes of the c3 c5 and c7 connectors are very similar while they are much larger than those of the c2 c4 and c6 connectors that may be due to the superposition effect of the hydrodynamic interaction between modules as well as the relative wave phase effect in different connectors in fig 5b the c7 hinge connection type tends to induce the smallest shear force fz for the same connector location while the c7 fixed connection type tends to induce the largest fz it is of the opposite trend to the horizontal connection force fx the shear force amplitudes tend to decrease as the flexibility of the c7 increases the c7 hinge with kp connection type can effectively reduce the fz amplitudes compared with the c7 fixed connection type as well as the c7 hinge with ks connection type the outermost up wave module m7 tends to suffer the largest connection shear force while the fz acting on other connectors will be influenced by the potential shadow effect of the m7 in fig 5c it can be seen that the maximum bending moment my occurs at different connector locations for different connection types the maximum my occurs at the c5 for both the c7 fixed connection type and the c7 hinge with ks connection type while the maximum my occurs at the c6 for the c7 hinge connection type and the c7 hinge with kp connection type the my amplitudes of the c1 and c2 are zero due to the hinge connectors for the two locations the c7 hinge with kp type can significantly reduce the maximum my amplitude especially for comparing with the c7 fixed case and the c7 hinge with ks case it seems that the pitch stiffness of 1 0e9 nm rad for the c7 hinge with ks connection type has limited effect on the reduction of the maximum my compared with the c7 fixed connection type the pitch and heave motion information for different modules with different c7 connection types have been compared and shown in fig 6 in fig 6a the pitch amplitudes from m1 to m6 are similar between different c7 connection types while the significant difference occurs at m7 the c7 hinge connection tends to induce the largest pitch motion of the m7 while the c7 hinge with kp connection can effectively reduce the pitching amplitude by about 35 compared with the c7 hinge connection in fig 6b the c7 hinge connection also tends to induce the largest heave motion of the m7 while the c7 hinge with kp connection can effectively reduce the heave amplitude by about 30 compared with the c7 hinge connection the pitch motion and the heave motion of the c7 hinge with ks case with the pitch stiffness of 1 0e9 nm rad are very similar with those of the c7 fixed connection it indicates that if the additional pitch stiffness of the c7 is large enough the motion performance of the mmfs system is very similar with the c7 fixed connection case as well as the similar connection loads shown in fig 5 however considering the additional damping kp effect for the c7 can be effectively provided by a power take off pto system widely used in wave energy converters wec it may be possible to use the relative pitch motion between the m6 and m7 to produce wave energy for the mmfs system based on the results in both figs 5 and 6 it can be concluded that the c7 hinge with kp connection can not only significantly reduce the maximum fz and my acting on the connectors comparing with the c7 fixed connection but also can effectively reduce the maximum pitch and heave motions of the m7 comparing with the c7 hinge connection in addition it may be possible to design the outermost module m7 for some motion insensitive uses such as a solid storage facility and then the c7 hinge with kp connection can also produce considerable wave energy for the mmfs system in addition the most loaded connector locations for different connector types have been summarized in table 3 in table 3 it can be concluded that the c7 connector always tends to suffer the largest responses of the fx fz as well as motions the outermost connection types can affect the connector location of the largest response of the my 4 2 damping effect of the c7 hinge on the wec performance the damping effect of the c7 hinge with kp connection on the wec performance of the mmfs system has been further investigated different damping levels for the linear pto system have been taken into consideration for the same regular wave case h 2 m t 7s and main results are shown in fig 7 in fig 7a it can be seen that the damping force of the c7 increases as the damping increases however in fig 7b the maximum and mean wave power production firstly increase when the c7 damping is less than 1 0e9 nms rad then they decrease when the c7 damping is larger than 1 0e9 nms rad therefore the optimal c7 damping for the sea case t 7s could be about 1 0e9 nms rad from the view of the highest wec energy production the amplitudes of the heave and the pitch responses of the m7 under different damping levels have been compared and shown in fig 7c it indicates that the responses of the heave and the pitch for the m7 both gradually decrease as the c7 damping increases for a potential practical design it is strongly suggested that the optimal value of the c7 damping needs to well balance three key factors the maximum damping force the maximum wave power and the maximum responses of the m7 in addition the effect of different wave periods on the wec performance of the c7 hinge with kp connection type has also been investigated with the same damping of 1 0e9 nms rad and the same wave height of 2 m the main results are shown in fig 8 in fig 8a and b it can be seen that both the damping force and the mean wave power increase when the wave period is less than 10s while they decrease when the wave period is larger than 10s therefore the preliminary optimal wave period for the damping of 1 0e9 nms rad is about 10s 4 3 different wave period effect the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system with the c7 fixed connection and the c7 hinge with kp connection have been further investigated under a series of regular waves with the same wave height of 2 m the main results of the most loaded connectors for the two selected connection types have been compared in fig 9 and the most loaded connector locations under different wave periods are listed in table 4 in fig 9a it can be seen that the maximum fx of the most loaded connector decreases as the wave period increase and the c7 hinge with kp connection tends to induce slightly larger fx responses compared with the c7 fixed connection case in fig 9b and c the maximum fz and my of the most loaded connectors both gradually increase as the wave period increases the c7 hinge with kp connection can effectively reduce both the maximum fz and my responses compared with the c7 fixed connection type the comparison of the heave amplitudes of the m7 for the two selected connection types is shown in fig 9d it indicates that the heave natural period of the m7 is about 10s and the heave amplitudes of the c7 hinge with kp connection are about twice of those of the c7 fixed connection under the same wave period compared with the c7 fixed connection it can be concluded that the c7 hinge with kp connection can effectively reduce the shear force and the bending moment of the connectors but sacrifice the motions of the outermost module to some extent in table 4 the most loaded connector location of the fx for different wave periods and different c7 connection types are usually different while the most loaded connector location of the fz seems less sensitive to the wave period especially for the c7 fixed connection in addition the most loaded my connector for the same c7 connection type is always the same under different wave periods it is the c5 location for the c7 fixed connection type while it is the c6 location for the c7 hinge with kp connection type it should be noticed that when the wave period is large than 7s the most loaded fz connector starts to change from the outermost c7 to the inner connectors considering the length 35 m of the basic square module is about half of the wavelength for the wave period of 7s it indicates that the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system may be sensitive to the ratio between the wavelength and the outermost module length 4 4 outermost module length effect to further investigate the length ratio effect between the outermost module and the wave on the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system the m6 and m7 have been connected with the fixed connection while the m5 and the m6 have been connected with the hinge connection which is named as the c6 hinge connection then the outermost module length for the c6 hinge case can be viewed as 70 m which is twice of the length of the basic module the same regular wave condition has been selected h 2 m t 7s lw 70 5 m the selected hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system with three typical connection types have been compared and shown in fig 10 compared with the c7 fixed connection case the c6 hinge connection case can also significantly reduce the connectors responses of the fz in fig 10b and the my in fig 10c but it tends to induce a bit larger motion of the outermost module compared with the c7 hinge connection case the c6 hinge connection case can also effectively reduce connectors responses of the fx in fig 10a the my in fig 10c and especially for the pitch of the outermost module in fig 10d but it tends to induce slightly larger shear force on the c6 therefore the longer outermost module with the hinge connection may be an effective way to reduce both the loads on connectors and the motion of the outermost module 5 extreme sea 100 year comparison to investigate the extreme hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system under 100 year random sea cases hs 1 8 m tp 7s jonswap three promising connection types have been selected for the comparison which are the c7 fixed connection most stable case the c6 hinge connection smaller motion response of the m7 case and the c7 with kp connection potential wave energy production case the time histories of the main hydrodynamic responses for the most loaded connectors with three selected connection types have been compared and the main results are shown in fig 11 the most loaded connector numbers for different connection types have been introduced in corresponding legends in fig 11a the fx responses for different connection types are very similar in fig 11b and c the c7 hinge with kp connection type is of the smallest fz and my responses so the c7 hinge with kp connection type is the most effective way to reduce the connectors loads in fig 11d and c the motion responses of the m7 with the c7 hinge with kp connection type is the largest of the three connection types however the corresponding extreme pitch and heave responses are limited within 3 and 0 8 m respectively if the outermost module can be designed for less motion sensitive uses the extreme pitch and heave responses of the m7 with the c7 hinge with kp connection may be acceptable for practical projects by considering such a 100 year extreme wave case the time history of the wave power production with the c7 hinge with kp connection is shown in fig 11f it can be seen that the maximum transient wave energy power can be more than 1 0 mw which is very considerable and beneficial for the mmfs power system to reduce the statistical uncertainties five extreme wave realizations are considered and more detailed averaged statistical results are summarized in table 5 in addition there is no significant difference of the extreme responses of the mmfs system among five different extreme wave realizations in table 5 it can be concluded that the c7 fixed connection type is of the smallest motion responses but inducing the largest connector loads especially for the fz and my comparing with the c7 fixed connection type the c7 hinge with kp connection type can significantly reduce the responses of the most loaded connectors fz by about 45 and my by about 55 as well as produce considerable wave energy but it has to scarify the motion of the outermost module to some degree the hydrodynamic performance of the mmfs with the c6 hinge connection type is similar with the c7 hinge with kp connection type as previously discussed except for the wave power production 6 conclusions this paper deals with the hydrodynamic analysis of a proposed modular multi purpose floating structure system mmfs especially for the effect of different outermost connector c7 designs the hydrodynamic interaction effect among different modules and the mechanical coupling effect of the connectors have been taken into consideration in the time domain analysis the effect of different outermost connector types on the hydrodynamic performance of the mmfs subsystem has been investigated and compared and the main results can be summarized as follows 1 different connector types of the outermost module can strongly influence the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system more rigid outermost connector tends to induce much larger responses of the shear force fz and the bending moment my of the inner connectors such as the c7 fixed connection case flexible hinge type outermost connectors can significantly reduce the responses of both the fz and the my of the most loaded connectors but it has to scarify the motion of the outermost module to some degree by adding a proper pto system served as a linear pitch damper to the outermost hinge connector it can effectively reduce the motion of the outermost module and also produce considerable wave energy 2 the hydrodynamic responses of different connection locations are usually different due to the wave phase effect and the hydrodynamic interaction effect among modules the connector type of the outermost module has a great influence on the location of the most loaded connector 3 the effect of the length ratio between the outermost module and the incident wave on the hydrodynamic responses of the mmfs system has been figured out results indicate that the longer outermost module with the hinge connection may be an effective way to reduce both the loads on connectors and the motion of the outermost module 4 for the 100 year extreme random sea condition the c7 hinge with kp connection type can significantly reduce the connectors extreme responses of the fz by about 45 and the my by about 55 and also produce considerable wave energy compared with the c7 fixed connector if the outermost module can be designed for less motion sensitive uses the extreme pitch and heave responses of the outermost module may be acceptable for the practical project with the consideration of such a 100 year extreme wave case 7 future works many challenges related to the feasibility of the mmfs system still remain and the development of a robust concept for actual deployment requires further investigation challenges will include the scale model test validation and the whole system analysis the mmfs concept is initially designed for a mild sea zone it should be adaptable to other environmental conditions by modifying the module and connector configurations and finding effective survival strategies for extreme sea cases the study of these aspects should be included in future research acknowledgments this research is supported in

22941,the modelling of the ice failure including icebreaking pattern and ice bearing capacity is an important issue in numerical simulations of ships going through level ice in order to predict ship performance and ice loads previous studies model the shape of ice cusps assuming a simplified geometry e g circular or triangular according to the observations during full scale ship trials the geometry of the ice cusps is more elliptical rather than circular with larger breaking length at the edges than that at the center in this paper a new ice failure model is developed which results in more realistic cusp shapes compared to existing approaches the model is based on an analytically derived differential equation which is solved numerically via the finite difference method fdm the predictions of ice cusps geometry are validated against full scale measurement of ice cusps obtained with an on board stereo camera system satisfying agreement is shown the ice failure model is incorporated into a numerical model for the prediction of ship performance in level ice the predictions are compared with ship speed record obtained from a full scale trial it is shown that the model gives reasonable results for ship speed keywords icebreaking pattern numerical simulation level ice ship performance in ice 1 introduction for the design of ice going ships and safe operation through ice covered areas various models have been proposed for the prediction of ship performance in ice these methods can be classified as analytical and empirical formulas e g lindqvist 1989 riska et al 1997 numerical models e g valanto 2001 lubbad and løset 2011 sawamura et al 2009 and probabilistic methods e g montewka et al 2015 li et al 2017 several numerical models have been developed during recent years because of their capability to account for more details about the hull shape e g su 2011 tan et al 2013 zhou et al 2018b one of the key issues in the numerical approach is to determine the bearing capacity of the ice sheet and the ice cusp geometry the most advanced methods applied in current numerical models apply numerical methods such as finite difference method fdm to solve differential equations for this purpose valanto 2001 these are more physically realistic compared to the other methods by taking e g the hydrodynamic effects into account however the high computational demand makes this approach very time consuming when simulating a ship voyage in an ice field over a considerable distance the complex properties of ice also decrease the accuracy if the applied material model does not capture the ice behavior accurately the second group of models for bearing capacity and ice cusp geometry adopts an empirical approach su 2011 liu et al 2006 zhou et al 2017 these models typically contain a number of empirical coefficients which introduce uncertainties about the resulting ice loads and ship performance when applying these models kuuliala 2015 the remainder of the models implement existing analytical methods lubbad and løset 2011 which usually simplify the problem as two dimension this gives physically grounded basis compared to the empirical approach but deviates from reality due to the simplifications most of the models in the latter two groups treat the ice cusp geometry as simple shape usually circular sawamura et al 2009 zhou et al 2018c or triangular lubbad and løset 2011 the icebreaking pattern has been recorded from some model scale tests in ice tanks e g myland and ehlers 2017 zhou et al 2018a and su et al 2014 as shown by li et al 2018b the shape of ice cusps in reality is more elliptical rather than circular with a longer breaking length at the edges and a shorter one at the center the ice cusp shape is an important issue because it affects the force of the next contact and determines the channel geometry made by the ship li et al 2018b the former influences the ice loads and ship resistance while the latter is important if there is relative lateral motion between the ship and ice sheet the research objective of this paper is to present an engineering model to predict the ice cusp geometry and bearing capacity with good accuracy so that it can be implemented into numerical models for ship performance and ice loads simulation in level ice for this aim the analytical solution of nevel 1958 for a semi infinite narrow wedge beam resting on elastic foundation is further developed to be applicable for cases with large wedge angles considering forces in angular direction in addition to the axial direction the solution gives the stress field in the wedge plate which yields the bearing capacity and cusp geometry as an example the proposed ice failure model is incorporated into a numerical model for ship performance in level ice which simulates the ship motion and ice forces through a set of coupled equations of motion this model is then able to predict ship speed in a level ice field the results of the ice failure model are validated with photos obtained through a stereo camera system installed during a full scale measurement campaign the validation indicates that the proposed cusp failure model can predict the ice cusp geometry reasonably well the results of the numerical model for ship performance in ice are compared to the data measured from the same full scale measurement campaign good agreement is achieved the critical issues regarding numerical simulation of ship performance in level ice are first presented in section 2 to clarify the purpose and scope of this paper in section 3 the derivation of the proposed ice failure model is presented and then the approach to incorporate the method into numerical model is described in section 4 the data applied in this paper are introduced in section 5 the results and comparison with full scale measurement are presented in section 6 section 7 discusses the benefits and deficiencies of the proposed method and gives suggestions for further research section 8 concludes 2 ship performance in level ice numerical approach it is important to clarify the scope of level ice before entering the problem despite of the fact that perfect level ice rarely exists in reality level ice is an important concept which is representative for ice conditions where the ice sheet is continuous and covers a large area in this paper ship in level ice refers to the circumstance when the ship is going through a continuous ice field where the edges of the ice sheet is far from the ship ice interaction area so that the radial crack arise from the interaction is not likely to propagate to the free edges in this case the ice can be regarded as semi infinite field where the ice failure modes around the ship are mostly crushing and bending ship performance in ice has been investigated for decades due to the need of designing ice going ships and making regulations for safe operation ship performance in level ice is an engineering problem involving a large number of physical phenomenon these include e g ice crushing bending and splitting modelling of ship ice contact turning of ice cusps with hydrodynamic effect ice sliding along the hull propeller ice interaction unfortunately most of these problems are not yet well solved some due to the lack of fundamental knowledge on the material level e g crushing and bending and some due to insufficient research and validation e g turning of ice cusps consequently the current available models inevitably contain considerable amount of assumptions and simplifications when dealing with these problems these usually include e g idealizing ice material as perfect elastic assuming the ice cusp geometry as circular or triangular and considering water as elastic foundation an assumption or simplification has certain reasonability and is considered to be useful as long as it a produces similar phenomenon as observed in full scale test and b gives reasonable approximation to the quantity that it is supposed to predict these are purpose oriented criteria which may vary according to different aims due to these reasons the observed information and the validation on corresponding phenomenon are of vital importance in developing models for ship performance in ice numerical simulation of ship performance in level ice is achieved by discretizing the process temporally and spatially and solving motion and force related equations step by step it is developed for better representation of the physical process and thus potentially higher accuracy compared to analytical or empirical formulas however most of the available numerical models are still semi numerical as empirical or analytical approaches are mostly deployed to model certain phenomenon e g ice bending failure and ice submersion resistance one of the reasons is the consideration of computational demand the detection of the contact between ship and ice sheet typically requires small time step since there could be many contacts along the ship hull at each time step the total amount of contact cases to be analyzed for a several minute voyage could be huge making it inefficient to spend much computational power on each single case the aforementioned unsolved fundamental questions on ice behavior also make it questionable whether the result could be greatly improved with the price of heavy computation consequently the computational cost should be balanced with the improvement in accuracy which it can lead to therefore at the current stage in order to improve the accuracy of numerical models the key issue is to make reasonable assumptions and simplifications to derive equations for relevant phenomenon which describes the phenomenon realistically and is easy to implement this is the principle which this paper is developed upon 3 ice failure modelling as mentioned in the introduction this paper aims to propose an engineering model for the ice cusp failure by bending due to the crushing force caused by the ship ice contact the intended model use is in a numerical simulation model for ship speed and ice loads prediction in level ice one of the main expectations of the model is to obtain a more realistic ice cusp geometry compared to the state of art models furthermore in order to efficiently and accurately simulate a ship s motion covering a considerable distance the computation of the ice failure should have the following features 1 the model should be able to take account as many influencing factors as possible e g the geometry of the contact area it should determine whether a failure occurs in the ice sheet according to certain failure criterion when the ice sheet fails a realistic geometry of the broken ice cusp is obtained 2 the bearing capacity and ice cusp size resulting from the model should be statistically reasonable in the context of ship performance in level ice the global resistance is the most important output for this aim it is preferable to predict correct mean values in terms of the bearing capacity and ice cusp size rather than the extreme values 3 as stated in section 2 the result should be easy to be implemented into the numerical model for ship performance in ice the first and the third features seem to contradict with each other since the first requires the ice failure model to be comprehensive and three dimensional which is computationally demanding unless a closed form solution is given analytically while the third feature requires the calculation to be simple and straightforward a possible way to achieve both is via meta modelling this is done by firstly characterizing the problem with certain parameters and then calculating the desired outputs with each combination of the input parameters similar approach has been done by sawamura et al 2008 and sawamura et al 2009 where they simulate the ice failure process with finite element method fem and built a database for the easy implementation in their numerical model for ship in level ice this paper adopts the similar methodology of meta modelling but with different approach for the calculation of ice failure in order to predict more realistic ice cusps geometry 3 1 characterization of ice bending problem the contact between ship and ice is commonly idealized as an ice wedge loaded at the tip e g su 2011 with characteristic dimensions shown in fig 1 the geometry of the ice wedge is described by the wedge angle θ w and ice thickness h near the wedge tip the ice wedge is crushed with a triangle when the lowest crushing point is higher than the bottom of ice sheet or trapezoid when the lowest crushing point is at the bottom of ice sheet crushing area wang 2001 the geometry of the crushing area can be represented by the crushing depth r c crushing angle ψ crushing inclination angle α or slope k tan α and the distance between the crushing center depicted with red dot in fig 1 and crushing line d c in the case of ship ice contact the crushing angle ψ is the ship hull flare angle at the contact location the crushing center is assumed to be the location of the geometrical center of the crushing contact area the stress field in the ice wedge in quasi static case is determined by following variables the method to calculate the stress field should take all of the above factors into account in this section the derivation process of the ice failure model is presented in detail 3 2 nevel s solution for a narrow wedge beam nevel 1958 presented the derivation of an analytical solution for a semi infinite narrow wedge beam resting on an elastic foundation in this context narrow means that the wedge angle θ w in fig 1 is very small so the wedge plate can be considered as a beam with varying cross section area the ice is modelled as an isotropic homogenous elastic material the water support is treated as an elastic foundation the governing equation of this problem is written as 1 d 4 y d χ 4 2 χ d 3 y d χ 3 y 0 nevel presents the solution to this equation as 2 y χ a d u 2 χ b d u 3 χ where y is the vertical deflection χ the beam s non dimensional location coordinate a and b coefficients determined from the boundary conditions and d u 2 and d u 3 two derived functions of χ expressed by series see appendix a χ is the non dimensional coordinate expressed as follows 3 χ x l c w h e r e l c e h 3 12 ρ w g g r a v 0 25 where x is the location coordinate l c the characteristic length ρ w the water density and g g r a v the gravitational acceleration the boundary conditions are that the force and moment at the edge of the contact area balance with the internal moment and shear force in the wedge beam which is expressed by 4 e χ h 3 12 y χ l c 2 χ τ c m 0 e χ h 3 12 y χ l c 2 χ τ c p 0 v where τ c is the non dimensional crushing depth expressed by r c l c see fig 1 m 0 and p 0 v are the moment and shear force at the crushing line position χ τ c with the relationship m 0 p 0 v d c the coefficients a and b then can be calculated according to eq 2 therefore eq 1 can be rewritten as 5 y τ c d c χ a τ c d c d u 2 χ b τ c d c d u 3 χ 3 3 extend nevel s solution to a wedge plate nevel s solution describes stress field in the radial direction while in reality the angular variation introduces another dimension consider a wedge plate with loading conditions sketched in fig 2 if the wedge plate is discretized into a large number of small wedge beams as illustrated in fig 2 initially neglecting the interaction between neighboring beams each wedge beam can be considered as a narrow wedge beam in line with the nevel formulation the non dimensional crushing depth τ in each wedge then becomes a function of θ i e τ τ θ bearing in mind that a and b also depend on d c eq 5 the deflection field can then be expressed as fig 2b shows a special case where the crushing line inclination angle α equals 0 and thus the crushing area is symmetric refer to the general case in fig 1 τ is a function of the crushing line inclination angle α the crushing depth r c and the wedge opening angle θ w a simple derivation according to the geometry of the crushing area gives 7 τ θ τ θ α r c l c cos θ tan θ α sin θ w h e n π θ w 2 θ π θ w 2 0 w h e n θ π θ w 2 o r θ π θ w 2 due to the change of crushing depth τ in angular direction the deflection of the discretized narrow wedges varies with θ close to the edges the crushing depth is larger than that in the middle therefore larger deflections and stresses are associated with the wedges near the edges an instinctive presumption is that the interaction between neighboring discretized narrow wedges will diminish the deflection and stress differences for this purpose the next step is then to modify the deflection field f θ χ so that the forces can be balanced in the angular direction the deflection field w θ χ is approximated by defining a new function g θ to deal with the interaction between neighboring narrow wedges 8 w θ χ f θ χ g θ this does not guarantee that the derived deflection field w θ χ satisfies the governing equation of the kirchhoff love plate theory since g θ is assumed to be independent of the location coordinate χ as an approximation g θ is determined by a weak form of the plate governing equation 4 w 0 instead of exactly satisfying the governing equation of kirchhoff love plate the force is balanced on each narrow wedge with infinite small wedge angle in other words instead of satisfying 4 w 0 an approximation is done to satisfy 4 w d χ 0 considering a discretized narrow wedge as shown in fig 3 a according to the shear force formulation of kirchhoff love plate theory under polar coordinate system the shear force at a point χ θ is expressed by where d e i e h 3 12 and l c e h 3 12 1 ν 2 ρ w g g r a v 0 25 ν the poisson s ratio the shear force v at χ θ δ θ can then be approximated with first order taylor series as 10 v χ θ δ θ v χ θ χ δ θ v χ θ χ θ v χ θ d l c 3 2 θ 2 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 1 ν 2 χ 3 w 4 θ 4 1 χ 3 w δ θ the total internal force acting on the narrow wedges is then derived by integrating the difference between eqs 9 and 10 11 v i n t l c τ v χ θ δ θ v χ θ d χ d δ θ l c 2 τ 2 θ 2 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 1 ν 2 χ 3 w 4 θ 4 1 χ 3 w d χ combining with eq 8 eq 11 can be simply written as follows 12 v i n t d δ θ 2 c 1 θ g θ θ 2 4 c 2 θ g θ θ 4 where 13 c 1 θ 1 l c 2 τ 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 1 ν 2 χ 3 f χ θ d χ c 2 θ 1 l c 2 τ 1 χ 3 f χ θ d χ the external force on the narrow wedge includes the vertical load component δ p v and the buoyancy force from water δ p w a t e r note that δ p v is the total vertical component of the crushing and friction forces recall that f θ x is the solution when there is no angular stress in which case the buoyancy equals the total load denoting k b as the buoyancy force per unit volume this gives 14 δ p v k b τ f χ θ χ δ θ d χ 15 δ p w a t e r k b τ w χ θ χ δ θ d χ k b 0 f χ θ g θ x δ θ d x g θ δ p v 16 v e x t δ p v δ p w a t e r g θ 1 δ p v finally summing up the internal and external force and equaling it to zero the following equation is obtained 17 d 2 c 1 θ g θ θ 2 4 c 2 θ g θ θ 4 1 g θ δ p v δ θ this equation can be physically understood such that the total force on each of the discretized wedge beams in fig 2 equals zero the forces on each wedge beam stem from the interaction with neighboring beams the crushing loads as well as the buoyancy force since the ice wedge is free at both edges the boundary conditions include two equations at each edge which correspond to zero moment and shear force the same weak form approach is adopted so that the integrals of the moment and shear force along the edges equal zero the expressions can be written as 18 m e d g e d c 3 g θ 2 c 4 θ g θ θ 2 0 19 v e d g e d c 1 θ g θ θ 3 c 2 θ g θ θ 3 0 where 20 c 3 1 l c τ ν 2 f χ θ χ 2 1 χ f χ θ χ d χ c 4 1 l c τ 1 χ 2 f χ θ d χ due to the complexity of the above formulations no attempt was made to derive an explicit analytical solution for c 1 θ to c 4 θ instead the values of c 1 θ to c 4 θ are evaluated by numerical integration to obtain the solution for the differential equation of eq 17 the finite difference method fdm is applied fdm is a standard method which is well established for solving differential equations grossmann et al 2007 the solution process of eq 17 is written in appendix b after discretization and some manipulation the discretized equations can be written in the following matrix form 21 cg r where c is the coefficient matrix g the vector of unknown variables g θ and r the result matrix this algebraic equation can be easily solved with little computational power yielding g θ numerically according to eq 8 the deflection field of each discretized ice wedge is then represented by χ θ f χ θ g θ where g θ accounts for the interaction of neighboring wedges according to nevel s solution the location of maximum stress χ m where d 2 f χ θ d χ 2 is maximum within a narrow wedge depends on the crushing depth τ θ the value of the maximum stress σ v is e h 2 d 2 f χ θ l c 2 d χ 2 χ χ m with the derived solution the magnitudes of the maximum stress is then modified by the wedge interaction function g θ and the poisson s ratio this stress is the bending stress and is in radial direction another stress component in the radial direction comes from the horizontal compression force p h which can be assumed to be distributed homogeneously on the cross section of the narrow wedge the radial stresses are sketched in fig 3b here a superposition is applied to obtain the maximum radial stress σ m θ in each discretized narrow wedge as follows 22 σ m θ σ v θ σ h θ where σ v and σ h are expressed by 23 σ v θ g θ e h 2 1 ν 2 d 2 f χ θ l c 2 d χ 2 χ χ m 24 σ h θ 1 h χ m l c δ p h δ θ sin θ α connecting the maximum stress points in all the narrow wedges gives the maximum stress line as shown in fig 2a the bending failure is assumed to occur when the maximum radial stress at a wedge equals the flexural strength of ice when the failure is initiated the crack is assumed to propagate instantaneously along the maximum stress line crossing each discretized wedge beam the shape of the crack is illustrated in fig 1 where l e d g e 1 and l e d g e 2 are the breaking lengths at both edges and l c e n t e r denotes the breaking length at the center the corresponding crushing force is then the bearing capacity of the wedge plate under the given loading condition 3 4 construction of database the derived ice failure model accounts for all the influencing variables as described at the beginning of this section and gives the geometry of the potential ice cusps and the stress in the ice field as outputs in the next step an ice failure database is generated with a set of reference values where e 1 g p a σ c 1 m p a and h 1 m cases with other values of these three factors can then be calculated simply by scaling the results according to the scaling laws derived in appendix c it should be noted that the scaling laws here are the natural product from the theory of kirchhoff love plate instead of being the nature of ice in reality to the authors knowledge the actual scalability of ice remains as an unsolved issue which still needs systematic verification the influence of other factors cannot be dealt with via scaling and thus have to be calculated for each combination of the values these include the wedge angle θ w crushing depth τ c crushing line inclination k ship flare angle ψ and crushing center location d c l fig 4 presents the generation of the database with the discretization of each variable in fig 4 this yields 51 11 31 6 13 10 6 cases resulting in huge diversity in ice bending failure 4 a numerical model for ships going through level ice the database provides a new option for the icebreaking module of numerical simulation models for ship performance in level ice for example lubbad and løset 2011 and su 2011 in this paper a numerical model for ship performance in level ice is developed based on the database generated by the proposed ice failure model to determine the icebreaking pattern and the bearing capacity this section describes the modules of the numerical model 4 1 preliminary set up and thrust modelling fig 5 presents the flow chart of this numerical model in the initiation step the ship waterline and the level ice sheet are discretized into points 800 points along ship waterline and 0 05 m interval for the ice sheet at each time step the net thrust is calculated by the modified net thrust model proposed by li et al 2018a this model takes ship power propeller pitch and ship speed as input and calculates the thrust available to overcome ice resistance the net thrust t n e t is calculated by 25 t n e t t b p p p 1 1 3 v v o w p p p 2 3 v v o w p p p 2 where t b and v o w are the achievable bollard pull and open water speed respectively as a function of ship power p and propeller pitch p p v the ship speed at the current step 4 2 contact modelling the contact area at the current step is defined in a similar way as was done by lubbad and løset 2011 which is the overlapping area between the ship position at the current step and the ice profile in the previous step the time step is taken as 0 001s to achieve good accuracy for explicit simulation an algorithm is designed to detect the contact area according to the discretized field a typical detected contact area is demonstrated in fig 6 the quadrilateral abcd is the detect contact area and the point g is the geometric center of it the five factors in fig 4 are then analyzed and used to extract stress information from the database specifically ψ is obtained from the ship hull geometry at the contact location r c θ and k can be calculated according to the geometry of the triangle abv d c is calculated by the distance between point g and line ab as demonstrated in fig 4 the proposed model is developed for ice wedges with wedge angle below 150 which is most relevant for both sides of the ship bow where splitting is less likely to occur in the stem part of the bow the wedge angle is typically larger than 150 and is then similar to a semi infinite plate considerable splitting is seen to occur prior to ice bending and therefore becomes an issue which should not be simply neglected lubbad and løset 2011 lu et al 2015 to account for this phenomenon the same method developed by lubbad and løset 2011 is adopted to calculate the load to initiate splitting if the wedge angle is larger than 150 the splitting stress σ y 0 0 is calculated by eq 20 in the paper of lubbad and løset 2011 σ y 0 0 denotes the in plane stress which tends to split the ice plate by mode i fracture if σ y 0 0 is larger than the flexural strength of ice the ice sheet is assumed to split into several ice wedges with small wedge angles and therefore can be dealt with according to the method described in the previous paragraph the five factors in fig 4 are then analyzed and the maximum stress σ m is extracted from the database in the next step the extracted stress σ m is compared with the flexural strength σ f to determine if bending failure occurs if σ m is larger than σ f an ice cusp with the shape described in the database is deleted from the ice sheet the icebreaking module updates the ice sheets and returns the contact forces on the ship hull this process is same with that applied by su 2011 and therefore is not elaborated in the current stage the other components of ice resistance are calculated via state of the art formulas as outlined in li et al 2018a which adopts lindqvist s empirical formula to calculate the submersion of the ice cusps this is not the focus of this paper and is therefore to be updated by future research to make this component also numerical the ship motion is then calculated according to rigid body dynamics su 2011 the algorithm continues until the ship reaches the end of the input ice field 5 data the full scale measurement data were collected on a measurement campaign with the south african polar supply and research vessel s a agulhas ii see table 1 for the specifications during her sea trial in march 2012 in the baltic sea a stereo camera system installed at the ship bow shoulder area was used to take photos of the icebreaking process from which broken ice cusps can be identified suominen et al 2013 in addition ship navigational data including the ship speed and propeller and engine settings were recorded the ice thickness was measured by an electromagnetic em device and the stereo camera system this section presents an introduction to the ice cusp measurements as well as the ship performance measurements for further details the reader is referred to suominen et al 2013 5 1 full scale photos of ice cusps photographs obtained from the stereo camera are used to measure the dimensions of the ice cusps the stereo camera was located at the bow shoulder where it recorded photos of the ice sheet directly underneath from a vertical distance of 7 7 m the stereo camera was initially installed for the measurement of ice thickness semi automatically kulovesi and lehtiranta 2014 in this paper a matlab algorithm was designed to measure the geometry of the ice cusps manually using known conversion factors between the measured distances in pixels and the actual distances the dimensions of the ice cusps can be determined fig 7 shows two examples of the ice cusps photos it clearly shows that the breaking crack does not follow a circular track instead it is elliptical with smaller breaking length in the middle and larger breaking length at the edges fig 7 also provides examples of the ice cusp measurements these are done so that the coordinates of five points on the ice cusps are selected including four vertices points 1 3 4 5 in fig 7 and the middle point of the crack points 2 in fig 7 the tip of the wedge is determined by extending the edge lines line 1 5 and line 3 4 in fig 7 and obtaining the intersection point then the breaking length at the edges and at the center are calculated according to the coordinates thus the size and geometry of the ice cusps can be measured the selection of ice cusps is conducted manually an ice cusp is selected for analysis if the crack and edges are clearly shown in the photos special attention should be paid to cases where the ice cusps are re broken by external forces after it breaks off from the intact level ice field fig 8 demonstrates an example of such a case where the ice cusp is re broken during the rotation of the ice cusp relative to the ship hull the two separated cusps in c were together at the moment of breaking off from the ice sheet therefore they should be measured as one whole ice cusp the case shown in fig 8 is relatively easy to identify while there are many other cases where it is not so clear if the cusp has been re broken these unclear cases are therefore not selected for analysis in order to accurately reflect the breaking scene from the photos taken on 21st and 22nd march 2012 100 photos were selected and the geometry of these ice cusps was determined according to the procedure describe above the results are presented and compared with the calculation and simulation results in section 6 5 2 ship performance the ship performance and ice measurement data in level ice used in this paper are the same as used in li et al 2018a and hence these are described here only briefly the ship speed of s a agulhas ii is recorded via the navigational system as well as by the automatic identification system ais the propeller motor power as well as propeller pitch and revolution are obtained from the machinery log ice thickness data are obtained through an electromagnetic em device and a stereo camera system so the accuracy is guaranteed li et al 2018a the ice properties have also been measured during this voyage suominen et al 2013 summarize the measurement results of ice flexural strength and crushing strength by conducting a series of three point bending and uniaxial crushing tests the results give the mean values and standard deviation of the ice properties see table 2 which are implemented in the numerical simulation of the ship performance model to reflect the random nature of ice 6 results this section first shows the results of the icebreaking pattern obtained by the proposed ice failure model after that the ship speed prediction by the numerical simulation model for ship performance in ice are presented comparisons with the ice photos are conducted to validate the ice cusp size and geometry by the proposed method the comparison on ship speed aims to test the reasonability of the proposed method to be incorporated into numerical simulation models for ship performance in ice thus these comparisons give a comprehensive view on the validity of the proposed ice failure model for use in numerical models of ship performance in level ice 6 1 results of the new ice failure model the proposed ice failure model shows some new features which are not provided by previous approaches the following results are presented for a case where ice wedges of 0 28 m thickness are crushed gradually from the moment it contacts with a ship the ice crushing and flexural strength are set as the mean values in table 2 1 28 mpa and 404 kpa the maximum stress and the failure crack geometry are calculated and presented fig 9 presents an example of the location and geometry of the maximum stress lines when the wedge angle equals 2 3 π and 1 3 π with crushing depth τ varying from 0 01 to 0 05 and crushing line slope k equaling 0 and 0 2 as shown in this figure the location of the maximum stress line moves further away from the wedge tip when τ increases the potential breaking lengths at the edges are obviously larger than that at the center this is more evident when the wedge angle equals 2 3 π which is featured with larger angular variation when the wedge angle is small 1 3 π the geometry of the crushing line is similar to a circular arc centered at the wedge tip this is consistent with the observation of nevel 1958 that the angular variation is negligible when the wedge angle is smaller than 1 3 π fig 10 presents the variation of the maximum stress in relation to the crushing depth τ with wedge angles θ w equaling 1 3 π and 2 3 π flare angles ψ equaling 1 6 π and 1 3 π and crushing line slopes k equaling 0 and 0 2 refer to fig 1 for the geometry the green dashed horizontal line is the flexural strength of the ice 404 kpa which is the limit point when the ice is broken by bending the intersection points of this line and the other lines corresponds to the critical crushing depth τ c r i t i c a l when bending failure occurs which combined with fig 9 gives the geometry of the broken ice cusps under each crushing scenario the following aspects are indicated by these two figures a the maximum stress increases with larger wedge angles smaller flare angles and higher crushing line slopes b the sensitivity of maximum stress on the crushing line slope increases with the wedge angle c the increase in ice flexural strength or decrease in crushing strength leads to larger ice cusps fig 11 presents the critical crushing depths τ c r i t i c a l and the breaking lengths at the edges and the center l e d g e 1 l e d g e 2 and l c e n t e r see fig 1 as a function of the combined effect of wedge angle θ w and ship flare angle ψ the results show that when the crushing line slope k is 0 the smallest τ c r i t i c a l and l c e n t e r occurs at the highest θ w while the smallest l e d g e 1 and l e d g e 2 occurs at the lowest θ w when the crushing line slope k equals 0 2 l e d g e 2 the one with shorter crushing depth becomes smaller for the higher θ w the trends with varying flare angle ψ are the same for both k 0 and k 0 2 with increasing ψ the breaking lengths l c e n t e r l e d g e 1 and l e d g e 2 increase which means that the sizes of the broken ice cusps grows this can be physically explained by eq 22 that when the flare angle is larger the in plane crushing stress increases which reduces the maximum stress in the wedge and thus delays the bending failure leading to larger ice cusps since the flare angle of an ice going ship is typically smaller at the bow compared to that in the bow shoulder area the results indicate that the ice cusps are larger in the bow shoulder area than those at the bow given the limitations of the measurement set up where photos are only taken at one ship frame this finding cannot be empirically confirmed with the available evidence but it could be validated in future full scale measurements fig 12 presents the joint effect of the crushing line slope k and wedge angle θ w on the critical crushing depth τ c r i t i c a l and breaking lengths the black areas correspond to conditions where the combination of the k and θ w is not realistic α π θ w 2 see fig 1 when θ w is small the magnitude of τ c r i t i c a l is insensitive to the change in crushing line slope k for example in fig 12 a when the wedge angle is 1 3 π τ c r i t i c a l varies between 0 015 and 0 016 when k change from 0 to 1 however when the wedge angle is around 2 3 π τ c r i t i c a l varies between 0 005 and 0 013 when k changes between 0 and 0 5 a similar difference in sensitivity is also evident for the breaking lengths generally with increasing crushing line slope τ c r i t i c a l l c e n t e r and l e d g e 2 decrease while l e d g e 1 increases this also means that the ice will break within shorter time with larger crushing line slope for the comparison with the cusp measurement results the dependence of l e d g e l c e n t e r and l e d g e l c e n t e r on θ w calculated by the proposed ice failure model are plotted in fig 13 here l e d g e refers to the mean of l e d g e 1 and l e d g e 2 the flare angle ψ is set as 75 which approximates those in the measurement ice thickness crushing strength and flexural strength are set as the mean values shown in table 2 two sets of k 0 and 0 2 are used linear regressions are plotted along with the raw data in order to demonstrate the correlation between the cusp geometry and wedge angle since the data are gathered at bow shoulder area the wedge angles of most ice cusps are above 90 the calculation clearly shows similar trends as indicated by the data where l e d g e and l e d g e l c e n t e r increase with larger θ w while l c e n t e r on the opposite it also shows that k has little influence on l e d g e and moderate influence on l c e n t e r and l e d g e l c e n t e r to evaluate the accuracy of the calculation compared to the measurement the mean signed deviation msd is calculated for each curve in fig 13 the msd is defined in this case as where c i and m i define the calculated and measured quantities n is the number of samples the reason that msd is used instead of standard deviation or other error measures is that the measurement contains the variation of ice thickness and strength properties while the calculation uses the mean values therefore msd gives an overall measure of the calculation accuracy compared to measurement the msd for l e d g e l c e n t e r and l e d g e l c e n t e r are 15 6 8 0 7 9 respectively for k 0 and 17 1 14 28 3 4 respectively for k 0 2 which indicates that the calculated quantities have certain underestimations but the deviations are relatively small therefore the ice failure model can give good estimation on the ice cusp geometry 6 2 results of the numerical model for the ship going through level ice 6 2 1 ship speed in ice as an example of the numerical model the first three s a agulhas ii cases investigated by li et al 2018a are re simulated using the numerical model developed in this paper the fourth case is not applied because there might be ice ridges highly influencing the ship speed the ice properties are set and randomized according to the full scale measurement see table 2 normal distributions are assumed during the randomization the ice thickness conditions of these three cases are summarized in table 3 for detailed information on the measurement system the readers are referred to li et al 2018a the only assumed parameter is the elastic modulus which is set to 5 gpa due to lack of measurement li et al 2018a fig 14 presents the ice channel created by the ship which seems to be realistic the fact that the icebreaking pattern is not symmetrical is due to the randomization of ice thickness and properties according to table 2 for which randomized ice thickness and ice properties are assigned to each 1 m by 1m grid in the simulated ice field fig 15 presents a comparison between the simulated ship speed and the recorded ship speed the mean and final speeds are summarized in table 4 in the first two scenarios the simulation predicts a higher speed while in the last scenario it underestimates the speed the deviations both in terms of mean and final speeds are relatively small compared to recorded speed mostly below 5 compared to other methods investigated by li et al 2018a the new model predicts less breaking resistance thus higher speed as presented in table 3 at around 350 m in the first scenario and around 230 m in the second scenario there are ice rubbles below the ice sheet which is possibly ice ridges this introduces additional resistance and leads to speed drops in the corresponding location as shown in fig 15 taking this into consideration the deviation between simulation and measurement in the first two scenarios are likely to be smaller therefore the simulation results give reasonable approximation on the ship speed in level ice 6 2 2 breaking pattern fig 16 presents the histograms of the ice cusp geometry both from the measurement and from the simulation the ice wedge angle θ w breaking lengths at the center l c e n t e r and the edge l e d g e defined as l e d g e 1 l e d g e 2 2 and the ratio between l e d g e and l c e n t e r are plotted and then summarized in table 5 the simulation results are obtained through a simulation run with the ice properties set in table 2 100 ice cusps information are extracted from the contact events which occurred at the bow shoulder region where the ship flare angle ψ is in the range of 70 80 in order to approximate the ice condition of the measured cases in general the simulation results show good similarities to the measurement with satisfying estimation of the mean values and standard deviation in terms of the measured quantities the estimation for θ w and l c e n t e r are particularly good which deviates from the measured mean values by less than 10 the larger difference comes from l e d g e which underestimates the mean value by 18 2 and results in 11 0 underestimation in the mean value of l e d g e l c e n t e r the simulation generally predicts more scatter than those shown in the measurement which possibly relates to the randomization of the ice properties the larger difference in l e d g e and l e d g e l c e n t e r may be explained by the hydrodynamic effect according to the fem simulation results by sawamura et al 2008 the hydrodynamic force may change the pressure distribution below the ice sheet and thus lead to elliptical ice cusps therefore the ice cusps can be more elliptical if the hydrodynamic effect is considered a method to effectively account for the hydrodynamic effect could be an interesting topic for future research 7 discussions as mentioned in the introduction the objective of this paper is to provide an engineering tool with a physical basis to predict a realistic icebreaking pattern with fast calculation in a simulation model for ship performance in level ice therefore icebreaking patterns of a considerable number of cases with good similarity to the reality are generated in order to implement it into numerical models in this section the comparisons between full scale measurement and simulation are first discussed after which the promising features of the proposed method as well as the limitations and possible improvements are discussed 7 1 discussions on the comparisons with full scale measurement the features of the proposed icebreaking model have been presented and compared with full scale measurement in the previous section the dependency on various influencing variables results in a large variety in icebreaking patterns with a physical basis the comparison with full scale ice photo measurements shows that the predicted icebreaking pattern is more realistic compared to the state of art approaches the shape of ice cusps is elliptical rather than circular when the wedge angle is relatively large this is one of the key aspects to improve the fidelity in numerical simulation models the size of the ice cusps by this approach is also close to the measurement which is very important in resistance calculations according to the findings by li et al 2018a it is interesting to see in fig 13 that the correlation between the ice cusp geometry parameters and the wedge angle is consistent with the calculation which gives evidence to the soundness of the proposed ice failure model however due to the assumptions e g ice material made in the derivation process the predicted geometry values has certain underestimation compared to the measurement see table 5 as a conclusion the proposed ice failure model predicts acceptably realistic ice cusp geometry for the implementation into numerical models while further calibration and validation are still needed the comparison with ship speed data provides insights into the implementation of the ice failure model into numerical models for ship performance in level ice as discussed in li et al 2018a the submersion resistance component calculated by lindqvist s formula takes up a major part of the total resistance and therefore dominates the magnitude and deviation of resistance prediction consequently it is insufficient to claim a numerical model is superior to other models without looking into each resistance component according to the results the predicted ship speed is close to the recorded speed which implies that the method is applicable for ship performance in ice while the proposed ice failure model presents a step forward in terms of the fidelity of the icebreaking module improving the representation of other force components in numerical simulation models for ship performance in ice certainly is an important area of future research in particular the rotation and submersion components should be further developed 7 2 new features of the proposed ice failure model the first new feature of the proposed ice failure model is that it improves the fidelity by realistic ice cusps geometry which is elliptical with larger breaking length along the edges than along the centerline the geometry of the ice cusps is similar to the statistics of the measured cusps geometry both in terms of shape and size this gives evidence to the validity of this method the breaking length varies in the angular direction and is linked to the breaking capacity of an ice wedge since the icebreaking pattern is one of the key issues in numerical modelling of a ship transiting level ice the results indicate an improvement in terms of a more accurate prediction of ship performance and ice loads in addition it results in a more realistic ice channel geometry which is important for analyzing scenarios where a ship breaks out of a channel or is being escorted or in a convoy following an icebreaker the second new feature of the proposed method is that it accounts for most of the potential influencing factors except for speed and hydrodynamic effects which could have influence to the breaking pattern and bearing capacity the dependency from the ship hull flare angle ψ influences ice cusp sizes so that the cusps are smaller in the bow than in the bow shoulder area this is a new feature which has not been captured in previous models for ice cusps the influence of the crushing line inclination k leads to large variations in the icebreaking pattern the influence of the crushing center location denoted by d c accounts for different crushing area geometry the wedge angle θ w has considerable influence on the breaking length and cusps size these parameters are linked together in this model as the input for different loading cases and result in large variety in icebreaking pattern the third important new feature of the proposed method is the fast calculation while retaining the complexity the database approach applied in this paper where results from a physics based ice failure model are stored in a database for a large number of cases allows fast numerical simulation with much more details in the local failure sawamura et al 2009 adopted similar database approach by fem to generate the database since the deflection field is influenced by many factors the number of possible variable combinations is very large about 106 see section 4 this makes the generation of an ice failure database very time consuming with the proposed ice failure model the generation of the database consumes much less time while retaining the huge variety in cases thus this method provides a computationally inexpensive way to calculate the icebreaking pattern while retaining the influence of multiple factors based on a physics based formulation 7 3 limitations and improvements one of the major limitations of the proposed approach at current stage is that it does not consider hydrodynamic effects in the bending process with hydrodynamic effect considered the simulated ship speed in table 4 is expected to be lower according to valanto 2001 and varsta 1983 the cusp size and the bearing capacity of ice will vary at higher speed due to the interaction between water and ice the state of art methods mostly consider the hydrodynamic effect via empirical formulas e g tan et al 2014 lindqvist 1989 wang 2001 it can also be accounted for in the physical model via similar approach where a different formulation of the elastic force by the water could be made dependent on ship speed this however is not elaborated in this paper and is left for future research when the flare angle of the ship becomes large e g over 80 the ship hull becomes close to vertical in this case the horizontal crushing force becomes an important factor in the stress field and could also contribute to bending moment the method then becomes unsuited to properly catch the behavior of ice in this case some ice cusps photos clearly show that ice sheet can fail due to almost horizontal crushing compression force which might be a result of buckling failure this is another important aspect of the icebreaking process modelling which should be studied in future research 8 conclusions this paper presents a novel ice failure model which can be used in numerical models for ship transiting level ice to determine the ship speed and ice loads on the hull the ice failure model depends on various input variables and is based on force balance equations for coupled narrow wedges the model is physics based and results in realistic cusp geometries without the need to resort to semi empirical approximations using simplified cusp geometries as applied in the current state of art the model has a number of features which are not included in previous cusp models e g the variation of breaking length along angular direction and the connection between bearing capacity and the size of ice cusps a comparison with full scale data gives evidence to the validity of the predictions by this model it also shows that it is suitable to implement this model into existing numerical simulation models for ship performance in ice improving the formulation for the icebreaking pattern while further improvements can be made e g related to the treatment of rotation and sliding forces in the ship performance simulation model the improved formulation for the ice failure model is a step towards more realistic models for performance in level ice declaration of interest none acknowledgement this work has

22941,the modelling of the ice failure including icebreaking pattern and ice bearing capacity is an important issue in numerical simulations of ships going through level ice in order to predict ship performance and ice loads previous studies model the shape of ice cusps assuming a simplified geometry e g circular or triangular according to the observations during full scale ship trials the geometry of the ice cusps is more elliptical rather than circular with larger breaking length at the edges than that at the center in this paper a new ice failure model is developed which results in more realistic cusp shapes compared to existing approaches the model is based on an analytically derived differential equation which is solved numerically via the finite difference method fdm the predictions of ice cusps geometry are validated against full scale measurement of ice cusps obtained with an on board stereo camera system satisfying agreement is shown the ice failure model is incorporated into a numerical model for the prediction of ship performance in level ice the predictions are compared with ship speed record obtained from a full scale trial it is shown that the model gives reasonable results for ship speed keywords icebreaking pattern numerical simulation level ice ship performance in ice 1 introduction for the design of ice going ships and safe operation through ice covered areas various models have been proposed for the prediction of ship performance in ice these methods can be classified as analytical and empirical formulas e g lindqvist 1989 riska et al 1997 numerical models e g valanto 2001 lubbad and løset 2011 sawamura et al 2009 and probabilistic methods e g montewka et al 2015 li et al 2017 several numerical models have been developed during recent years because of their capability to account for more details about the hull shape e g su 2011 tan et al 2013 zhou et al 2018b one of the key issues in the numerical approach is to determine the bearing capacity of the ice sheet and the ice cusp geometry the most advanced methods applied in current numerical models apply numerical methods such as finite difference method fdm to solve differential equations for this purpose valanto 2001 these are more physically realistic compared to the other methods by taking e g the hydrodynamic effects into account however the high computational demand makes this approach very time consuming when simulating a ship voyage in an ice field over a considerable distance the complex properties of ice also decrease the accuracy if the applied material model does not capture the ice behavior accurately the second group of models for bearing capacity and ice cusp geometry adopts an empirical approach su 2011 liu et al 2006 zhou et al 2017 these models typically contain a number of empirical coefficients which introduce uncertainties about the resulting ice loads and ship performance when applying these models kuuliala 2015 the remainder of the models implement existing analytical methods lubbad and løset 2011 which usually simplify the problem as two dimension this gives physically grounded basis compared to the empirical approach but deviates from reality due to the simplifications most of the models in the latter two groups treat the ice cusp geometry as simple shape usually circular sawamura et al 2009 zhou et al 2018c or triangular lubbad and løset 2011 the icebreaking pattern has been recorded from some model scale tests in ice tanks e g myland and ehlers 2017 zhou et al 2018a and su et al 2014 as shown by li et al 2018b the shape of ice cusps in reality is more elliptical rather than circular with a longer breaking length at the edges and a shorter one at the center the ice cusp shape is an important issue because it affects the force of the next contact and determines the channel geometry made by the ship li et al 2018b the former influences the ice loads and ship resistance while the latter is important if there is relative lateral motion between the ship and ice sheet the research objective of this paper is to present an engineering model to predict the ice cusp geometry and bearing capacity with good accuracy so that it can be implemented into numerical models for ship performance and ice loads simulation in level ice for this aim the analytical solution of nevel 1958 for a semi infinite narrow wedge beam resting on elastic foundation is further developed to be applicable for cases with large wedge angles considering forces in angular direction in addition to the axial direction the solution gives the stress field in the wedge plate which yields the bearing capacity and cusp geometry as an example the proposed ice failure model is incorporated into a numerical model for ship performance in level ice which simulates the ship motion and ice forces through a set of coupled equations of motion this model is then able to predict ship speed in a level ice field the results of the ice failure model are validated with photos obtained through a stereo camera system installed during a full scale measurement campaign the validation indicates that the proposed cusp failure model can predict the ice cusp geometry reasonably well the results of the numerical model for ship performance in ice are compared to the data measured from the same full scale measurement campaign good agreement is achieved the critical issues regarding numerical simulation of ship performance in level ice are first presented in section 2 to clarify the purpose and scope of this paper in section 3 the derivation of the proposed ice failure model is presented and then the approach to incorporate the method into numerical model is described in section 4 the data applied in this paper are introduced in section 5 the results and comparison with full scale measurement are presented in section 6 section 7 discusses the benefits and deficiencies of the proposed method and gives suggestions for further research section 8 concludes 2 ship performance in level ice numerical approach it is important to clarify the scope of level ice before entering the problem despite of the fact that perfect level ice rarely exists in reality level ice is an important concept which is representative for ice conditions where the ice sheet is continuous and covers a large area in this paper ship in level ice refers to the circumstance when the ship is going through a continuous ice field where the edges of the ice sheet is far from the ship ice interaction area so that the radial crack arise from the interaction is not likely to propagate to the free edges in this case the ice can be regarded as semi infinite field where the ice failure modes around the ship are mostly crushing and bending ship performance in ice has been investigated for decades due to the need of designing ice going ships and making regulations for safe operation ship performance in level ice is an engineering problem involving a large number of physical phenomenon these include e g ice crushing bending and splitting modelling of ship ice contact turning of ice cusps with hydrodynamic effect ice sliding along the hull propeller ice interaction unfortunately most of these problems are not yet well solved some due to the lack of fundamental knowledge on the material level e g crushing and bending and some due to insufficient research and validation e g turning of ice cusps consequently the current available models inevitably contain considerable amount of assumptions and simplifications when dealing with these problems these usually include e g idealizing ice material as perfect elastic assuming the ice cusp geometry as circular or triangular and considering water as elastic foundation an assumption or simplification has certain reasonability and is considered to be useful as long as it a produces similar phenomenon as observed in full scale test and b gives reasonable approximation to the quantity that it is supposed to predict these are purpose oriented criteria which may vary according to different aims due to these reasons the observed information and the validation on corresponding phenomenon are of vital importance in developing models for ship performance in ice numerical simulation of ship performance in level ice is achieved by discretizing the process temporally and spatially and solving motion and force related equations step by step it is developed for better representation of the physical process and thus potentially higher accuracy compared to analytical or empirical formulas however most of the available numerical models are still semi numerical as empirical or analytical approaches are mostly deployed to model certain phenomenon e g ice bending failure and ice submersion resistance one of the reasons is the consideration of computational demand the detection of the contact between ship and ice sheet typically requires small time step since there could be many contacts along the ship hull at each time step the total amount of contact cases to be analyzed for a several minute voyage could be huge making it inefficient to spend much computational power on each single case the aforementioned unsolved fundamental questions on ice behavior also make it questionable whether the result could be greatly improved with the price of heavy computation consequently the computational cost should be balanced with the improvement in accuracy which it can lead to therefore at the current stage in order to improve the accuracy of numerical models the key issue is to make reasonable assumptions and simplifications to derive equations for relevant phenomenon which describes the phenomenon realistically and is easy to implement this is the principle which this paper is developed upon 3 ice failure modelling as mentioned in the introduction this paper aims to propose an engineering model for the ice cusp failure by bending due to the crushing force caused by the ship ice contact the intended model use is in a numerical simulation model for ship speed and ice loads prediction in level ice one of the main expectations of the model is to obtain a more realistic ice cusp geometry compared to the state of art models furthermore in order to efficiently and accurately simulate a ship s motion covering a considerable distance the computation of the ice failure should have the following features 1 the model should be able to take account as many influencing factors as possible e g the geometry of the contact area it should determine whether a failure occurs in the ice sheet according to certain failure criterion when the ice sheet fails a realistic geometry of the broken ice cusp is obtained 2 the bearing capacity and ice cusp size resulting from the model should be statistically reasonable in the context of ship performance in level ice the global resistance is the most important output for this aim it is preferable to predict correct mean values in terms of the bearing capacity and ice cusp size rather than the extreme values 3 as stated in section 2 the result should be easy to be implemented into the numerical model for ship performance in ice the first and the third features seem to contradict with each other since the first requires the ice failure model to be comprehensive and three dimensional which is computationally demanding unless a closed form solution is given analytically while the third feature requires the calculation to be simple and straightforward a possible way to achieve both is via meta modelling this is done by firstly characterizing the problem with certain parameters and then calculating the desired outputs with each combination of the input parameters similar approach has been done by sawamura et al 2008 and sawamura et al 2009 where they simulate the ice failure process with finite element method fem and built a database for the easy implementation in their numerical model for ship in level ice this paper adopts the similar methodology of meta modelling but with different approach for the calculation of ice failure in order to predict more realistic ice cusps geometry 3 1 characterization of ice bending problem the contact between ship and ice is commonly idealized as an ice wedge loaded at the tip e g su 2011 with characteristic dimensions shown in fig 1 the geometry of the ice wedge is described by the wedge angle θ w and ice thickness h near the wedge tip the ice wedge is crushed with a triangle when the lowest crushing point is higher than the bottom of ice sheet or trapezoid when the lowest crushing point is at the bottom of ice sheet crushing area wang 2001 the geometry of the crushing area can be represented by the crushing depth r c crushing angle ψ crushing inclination angle α or slope k tan α and the distance between the crushing center depicted with red dot in fig 1 and crushing line d c in the case of ship ice contact the crushing angle ψ is the ship hull flare angle at the contact location the crushing center is assumed to be the location of the geometrical center of the crushing contact area the stress field in the ice wedge in quasi static case is determined by following variables the method to calculate the stress field should take all of the above factors into account in this section the derivation process of the ice failure model is presented in detail 3 2 nevel s solution for a narrow wedge beam nevel 1958 presented the derivation of an analytical solution for a semi infinite narrow wedge beam resting on an elastic foundation in this context narrow means that the wedge angle θ w in fig 1 is very small so the wedge plate can be considered as a beam with varying cross section area the ice is modelled as an isotropic homogenous elastic material the water support is treated as an elastic foundation the governing equation of this problem is written as 1 d 4 y d χ 4 2 χ d 3 y d χ 3 y 0 nevel presents the solution to this equation as 2 y χ a d u 2 χ b d u 3 χ where y is the vertical deflection χ the beam s non dimensional location coordinate a and b coefficients determined from the boundary conditions and d u 2 and d u 3 two derived functions of χ expressed by series see appendix a χ is the non dimensional coordinate expressed as follows 3 χ x l c w h e r e l c e h 3 12 ρ w g g r a v 0 25 where x is the location coordinate l c the characteristic length ρ w the water density and g g r a v the gravitational acceleration the boundary conditions are that the force and moment at the edge of the contact area balance with the internal moment and shear force in the wedge beam which is expressed by 4 e χ h 3 12 y χ l c 2 χ τ c m 0 e χ h 3 12 y χ l c 2 χ τ c p 0 v where τ c is the non dimensional crushing depth expressed by r c l c see fig 1 m 0 and p 0 v are the moment and shear force at the crushing line position χ τ c with the relationship m 0 p 0 v d c the coefficients a and b then can be calculated according to eq 2 therefore eq 1 can be rewritten as 5 y τ c d c χ a τ c d c d u 2 χ b τ c d c d u 3 χ 3 3 extend nevel s solution to a wedge plate nevel s solution describes stress field in the radial direction while in reality the angular variation introduces another dimension consider a wedge plate with loading conditions sketched in fig 2 if the wedge plate is discretized into a large number of small wedge beams as illustrated in fig 2 initially neglecting the interaction between neighboring beams each wedge beam can be considered as a narrow wedge beam in line with the nevel formulation the non dimensional crushing depth τ in each wedge then becomes a function of θ i e τ τ θ bearing in mind that a and b also depend on d c eq 5 the deflection field can then be expressed as fig 2b shows a special case where the crushing line inclination angle α equals 0 and thus the crushing area is symmetric refer to the general case in fig 1 τ is a function of the crushing line inclination angle α the crushing depth r c and the wedge opening angle θ w a simple derivation according to the geometry of the crushing area gives 7 τ θ τ θ α r c l c cos θ tan θ α sin θ w h e n π θ w 2 θ π θ w 2 0 w h e n θ π θ w 2 o r θ π θ w 2 due to the change of crushing depth τ in angular direction the deflection of the discretized narrow wedges varies with θ close to the edges the crushing depth is larger than that in the middle therefore larger deflections and stresses are associated with the wedges near the edges an instinctive presumption is that the interaction between neighboring discretized narrow wedges will diminish the deflection and stress differences for this purpose the next step is then to modify the deflection field f θ χ so that the forces can be balanced in the angular direction the deflection field w θ χ is approximated by defining a new function g θ to deal with the interaction between neighboring narrow wedges 8 w θ χ f θ χ g θ this does not guarantee that the derived deflection field w θ χ satisfies the governing equation of the kirchhoff love plate theory since g θ is assumed to be independent of the location coordinate χ as an approximation g θ is determined by a weak form of the plate governing equation 4 w 0 instead of exactly satisfying the governing equation of kirchhoff love plate the force is balanced on each narrow wedge with infinite small wedge angle in other words instead of satisfying 4 w 0 an approximation is done to satisfy 4 w d χ 0 considering a discretized narrow wedge as shown in fig 3 a according to the shear force formulation of kirchhoff love plate theory under polar coordinate system the shear force at a point χ θ is expressed by where d e i e h 3 12 and l c e h 3 12 1 ν 2 ρ w g g r a v 0 25 ν the poisson s ratio the shear force v at χ θ δ θ can then be approximated with first order taylor series as 10 v χ θ δ θ v χ θ χ δ θ v χ θ χ θ v χ θ d l c 3 2 θ 2 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 1 ν 2 χ 3 w 4 θ 4 1 χ 3 w δ θ the total internal force acting on the narrow wedges is then derived by integrating the difference between eqs 9 and 10 11 v i n t l c τ v χ θ δ θ v χ θ d χ d δ θ l c 2 τ 2 θ 2 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 1 ν 2 χ 3 w 4 θ 4 1 χ 3 w d χ combining with eq 8 eq 11 can be simply written as follows 12 v i n t d δ θ 2 c 1 θ g θ θ 2 4 c 2 θ g θ θ 4 where 13 c 1 θ 1 l c 2 τ 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 2 ν 1 χ 2 χ 1 ν 2 χ 3 f χ θ d χ c 2 θ 1 l c 2 τ 1 χ 3 f χ θ d χ the external force on the narrow wedge includes the vertical load component δ p v and the buoyancy force from water δ p w a t e r note that δ p v is the total vertical component of the crushing and friction forces recall that f θ x is the solution when there is no angular stress in which case the buoyancy equals the total load denoting k b as the buoyancy force per unit volume this gives 14 δ p v k b τ f χ θ χ δ θ d χ 15 δ p w a t e r k b τ w χ θ χ δ θ d χ k b 0 f χ θ g θ x δ θ d x g θ δ p v 16 v e x t δ p v δ p w a t e r g θ 1 δ p v finally summing up the internal and external force and equaling it to zero the following equation is obtained 17 d 2 c 1 θ g θ θ 2 4 c 2 θ g θ θ 4 1 g θ δ p v δ θ this equation can be physically understood such that the total force on each of the discretized wedge beams in fig 2 equals zero the forces on each wedge beam stem from the interaction with neighboring beams the crushing loads as well as the buoyancy force since the ice wedge is free at both edges the boundary conditions include two equations at each edge which correspond to zero moment and shear force the same weak form approach is adopted so that the integrals of the moment and shear force along the edges equal zero the expressions can be written as 18 m e d g e d c 3 g θ 2 c 4 θ g θ θ 2 0 19 v e d g e d c 1 θ g θ θ 3 c 2 θ g θ θ 3 0 where 20 c 3 1 l c τ ν 2 f χ θ χ 2 1 χ f χ θ χ d χ c 4 1 l c τ 1 χ 2 f χ θ d χ due to the complexity of the above formulations no attempt was made to derive an explicit analytical solution for c 1 θ to c 4 θ instead the values of c 1 θ to c 4 θ are evaluated by numerical integration to obtain the solution for the differential equation of eq 17 the finite difference method fdm is applied fdm is a standard method which is well established for solving differential equations grossmann et al 2007 the solution process of eq 17 is written in appendix b after discretization and some manipulation the discretized equations can be written in the following matrix form 21 cg r where c is the coefficient matrix g the vector of unknown variables g θ and r the result matrix this algebraic equation can be easily solved with little computational power yielding g θ numerically according to eq 8 the deflection field of each discretized ice wedge is then represented by χ θ f χ θ g θ where g θ accounts for the interaction of neighboring wedges according to nevel s solution the location of maximum stress χ m where d 2 f χ θ d χ 2 is maximum within a narrow wedge depends on the crushing depth τ θ the value of the maximum stress σ v is e h 2 d 2 f χ θ l c 2 d χ 2 χ χ m with the derived solution the magnitudes of the maximum stress is then modified by the wedge interaction function g θ and the poisson s ratio this stress is the bending stress and is in radial direction another stress component in the radial direction comes from the horizontal compression force p h which can be assumed to be distributed homogeneously on the cross section of the narrow wedge the radial stresses are sketched in fig 3b here a superposition is applied to obtain the maximum radial stress σ m θ in each discretized narrow wedge as follows 22 σ m θ σ v θ σ h θ where σ v and σ h are expressed by 23 σ v θ g θ e h 2 1 ν 2 d 2 f χ θ l c 2 d χ 2 χ χ m 24 σ h θ 1 h χ m l c δ p h δ θ sin θ α connecting the maximum stress points in all the narrow wedges gives the maximum stress line as shown in fig 2a the bending failure is assumed to occur when the maximum radial stress at a wedge equals the flexural strength of ice when the failure is initiated the crack is assumed to propagate instantaneously along the maximum stress line crossing each discretized wedge beam the shape of the crack is illustrated in fig 1 where l e d g e 1 and l e d g e 2 are the breaking lengths at both edges and l c e n t e r denotes the breaking length at the center the corresponding crushing force is then the bearing capacity of the wedge plate under the given loading condition 3 4 construction of database the derived ice failure model accounts for all the influencing variables as described at the beginning of this section and gives the geometry of the potential ice cusps and the stress in the ice field as outputs in the next step an ice failure database is generated with a set of reference values where e 1 g p a σ c 1 m p a and h 1 m cases with other values of these three factors can then be calculated simply by scaling the results according to the scaling laws derived in appendix c it should be noted that the scaling laws here are the natural product from the theory of kirchhoff love plate instead of being the nature of ice in reality to the authors knowledge the actual scalability of ice remains as an unsolved issue which still needs systematic verification the influence of other factors cannot be dealt with via scaling and thus have to be calculated for each combination of the values these include the wedge angle θ w crushing depth τ c crushing line inclination k ship flare angle ψ and crushing center location d c l fig 4 presents the generation of the database with the discretization of each variable in fig 4 this yields 51 11 31 6 13 10 6 cases resulting in huge diversity in ice bending failure 4 a numerical model for ships going through level ice the database provides a new option for the icebreaking module of numerical simulation models for ship performance in level ice for example lubbad and løset 2011 and su 2011 in this paper a numerical model for ship performance in level ice is developed based on the database generated by the proposed ice failure model to determine the icebreaking pattern and the bearing capacity this section describes the modules of the numerical model 4 1 preliminary set up and thrust modelling fig 5 presents the flow chart of this numerical model in the initiation step the ship waterline and the level ice sheet are discretized into points 800 points along ship waterline and 0 05 m interval for the ice sheet at each time step the net thrust is calculated by the modified net thrust model proposed by li et al 2018a this model takes ship power propeller pitch and ship speed as input and calculates the thrust available to overcome ice resistance the net thrust t n e t is calculated by 25 t n e t t b p p p 1 1 3 v v o w p p p 2 3 v v o w p p p 2 where t b and v o w are the achievable bollard pull and open water speed respectively as a function of ship power p and propeller pitch p p v the ship speed at the current step 4 2 contact modelling the contact area at the current step is defined in a similar way as was done by lubbad and løset 2011 which is the overlapping area between the ship position at the current step and the ice profile in the previous step the time step is taken as 0 001s to achieve good accuracy for explicit simulation an algorithm is designed to detect the contact area according to the discretized field a typical detected contact area is demonstrated in fig 6 the quadrilateral abcd is the detect contact area and the point g is the geometric center of it the five factors in fig 4 are then analyzed and used to extract stress information from the database specifically ψ is obtained from the ship hull geometry at the contact location r c θ and k can be calculated according to the geometry of the triangle abv d c is calculated by the distance between point g and line ab as demonstrated in fig 4 the proposed model is developed for ice wedges with wedge angle below 150 which is most relevant for both sides of the ship bow where splitting is less likely to occur in the stem part of the bow the wedge angle is typically larger than 150 and is then similar to a semi infinite plate considerable splitting is seen to occur prior to ice bending and therefore becomes an issue which should not be simply neglected lubbad and løset 2011 lu et al 2015 to account for this phenomenon the same method developed by lubbad and løset 2011 is adopted to calculate the load to initiate splitting if the wedge angle is larger than 150 the splitting stress σ y 0 0 is calculated by eq 20 in the paper of lubbad and løset 2011 σ y 0 0 denotes the in plane stress which tends to split the ice plate by mode i fracture if σ y 0 0 is larger than the flexural strength of ice the ice sheet is assumed to split into several ice wedges with small wedge angles and therefore can be dealt with according to the method described in the previous paragraph the five factors in fig 4 are then analyzed and the maximum stress σ m is extracted from the database in the next step the extracted stress σ m is compared with the flexural strength σ f to determine if bending failure occurs if σ m is larger than σ f an ice cusp with the shape described in the database is deleted from the ice sheet the icebreaking module updates the ice sheets and returns the contact forces on the ship hull this process is same with that applied by su 2011 and therefore is not elaborated in the current stage the other components of ice resistance are calculated via state of the art formulas as outlined in li et al 2018a which adopts lindqvist s empirical formula to calculate the submersion of the ice cusps this is not the focus of this paper and is therefore to be updated by future research to make this component also numerical the ship motion is then calculated according to rigid body dynamics su 2011 the algorithm continues until the ship reaches the end of the input ice field 5 data the full scale measurement data were collected on a measurement campaign with the south african polar supply and research vessel s a agulhas ii see table 1 for the specifications during her sea trial in march 2012 in the baltic sea a stereo camera system installed at the ship bow shoulder area was used to take photos of the icebreaking process from which broken ice cusps can be identified suominen et al 2013 in addition ship navigational data including the ship speed and propeller and engine settings were recorded the ice thickness was measured by an electromagnetic em device and the stereo camera system this section presents an introduction to the ice cusp measurements as well as the ship performance measurements for further details the reader is referred to suominen et al 2013 5 1 full scale photos of ice cusps photographs obtained from the stereo camera are used to measure the dimensions of the ice cusps the stereo camera was located at the bow shoulder where it recorded photos of the ice sheet directly underneath from a vertical distance of 7 7 m the stereo camera was initially installed for the measurement of ice thickness semi automatically kulovesi and lehtiranta 2014 in this paper a matlab algorithm was designed to measure the geometry of the ice cusps manually using known conversion factors between the measured distances in pixels and the actual distances the dimensions of the ice cusps can be determined fig 7 shows two examples of the ice cusps photos it clearly shows that the breaking crack does not follow a circular track instead it is elliptical with smaller breaking length in the middle and larger breaking length at the edges fig 7 also provides examples of the ice cusp measurements these are done so that the coordinates of five points on the ice cusps are selected including four vertices points 1 3 4 5 in fig 7 and the middle point of the crack points 2 in fig 7 the tip of the wedge is determined by extending the edge lines line 1 5 and line 3 4 in fig 7 and obtaining the intersection point then the breaking length at the edges and at the center are calculated according to the coordinates thus the size and geometry of the ice cusps can be measured the selection of ice cusps is conducted manually an ice cusp is selected for analysis if the crack and edges are clearly shown in the photos special attention should be paid to cases where the ice cusps are re broken by external forces after it breaks off from the intact level ice field fig 8 demonstrates an example of such a case where the ice cusp is re broken during the rotation of the ice cusp relative to the ship hull the two separated cusps in c were together at the moment of breaking off from the ice sheet therefore they should be measured as one whole ice cusp the case shown in fig 8 is relatively easy to identify while there are many other cases where it is not so clear if the cusp has been re broken these unclear cases are therefore not selected for analysis in order to accurately reflect the breaking scene from the photos taken on 21st and 22nd march 2012 100 photos were selected and the geometry of these ice cusps was determined according to the procedure describe above the results are presented and compared with the calculation and simulation results in section 6 5 2 ship performance the ship performance and ice measurement data in level ice used in this paper are the same as used in li et al 2018a and hence these are described here only briefly the ship speed of s a agulhas ii is recorded via the navigational system as well as by the automatic identification system ais the propeller motor power as well as propeller pitch and revolution are obtained from the machinery log ice thickness data are obtained through an electromagnetic em device and a stereo camera system so the accuracy is guaranteed li et al 2018a the ice properties have also been measured during this voyage suominen et al 2013 summarize the measurement results of ice flexural strength and crushing strength by conducting a series of three point bending and uniaxial crushing tests the results give the mean values and standard deviation of the ice properties see table 2 which are implemented in the numerical simulation of the ship performance model to reflect the random nature of ice 6 results this section first shows the results of the icebreaking pattern obtained by the proposed ice failure model after that the ship speed prediction by the numerical simulation model for ship performance in ice are presented comparisons with the ice photos are conducted to validate the ice cusp size and geometry by the proposed method the comparison on ship speed aims to test the reasonability of the proposed method to be incorporated into numerical simulation models for ship performance in ice thus these comparisons give a comprehensive view on the validity of the proposed ice failure model for use in numerical models of ship performance in level ice 6 1 results of the new ice failure model the proposed ice failure model shows some new features which are not provided by previous approaches the following results are presented for a case where ice wedges of 0 28 m thickness are crushed gradually from the moment it contacts with a ship the ice crushing and flexural strength are set as the mean values in table 2 1 28 mpa and 404 kpa the maximum stress and the failure crack geometry are calculated and presented fig 9 presents an example of the location and geometry of the maximum stress lines when the wedge angle equals 2 3 π and 1 3 π with crushing depth τ varying from 0 01 to 0 05 and crushing line slope k equaling 0 and 0 2 as shown in this figure the location of the maximum stress line moves further away from the wedge tip when τ increases the potential breaking lengths at the edges are obviously larger than that at the center this is more evident when the wedge angle equals 2 3 π which is featured with larger angular variation when the wedge angle is small 1 3 π the geometry of the crushing line is similar to a circular arc centered at the wedge tip this is consistent with the observation of nevel 1958 that the angular variation is negligible when the wedge angle is smaller than 1 3 π fig 10 presents the variation of the maximum stress in relation to the crushing depth τ with wedge angles θ w equaling 1 3 π and 2 3 π flare angles ψ equaling 1 6 π and 1 3 π and crushing line slopes k equaling 0 and 0 2 refer to fig 1 for the geometry the green dashed horizontal line is the flexural strength of the ice 404 kpa which is the limit point when the ice is broken by bending the intersection points of this line and the other lines corresponds to the critical crushing depth τ c r i t i c a l when bending failure occurs which combined with fig 9 gives the geometry of the broken ice cusps under each crushing scenario the following aspects are indicated by these two figures a the maximum stress increases with larger wedge angles smaller flare angles and higher crushing line slopes b the sensitivity of maximum stress on the crushing line slope increases with the wedge angle c the increase in ice flexural strength or decrease in crushing strength leads to larger ice cusps fig 11 presents the critical crushing depths τ c r i t i c a l and the breaking lengths at the edges and the center l e d g e 1 l e d g e 2 and l c e n t e r see fig 1 as a function of the combined effect of wedge angle θ w and ship flare angle ψ the results show that when the crushing line slope k is 0 the smallest τ c r i t i c a l and l c e n t e r occurs at the highest θ w while the smallest l e d g e 1 and l e d g e 2 occurs at the lowest θ w when the crushing line slope k equals 0 2 l e d g e 2 the one with shorter crushing depth becomes smaller for the higher θ w the trends with varying flare angle ψ are the same for both k 0 and k 0 2 with increasing ψ the breaking lengths l c e n t e r l e d g e 1 and l e d g e 2 increase which means that the sizes of the broken ice cusps grows this can be physically explained by eq 22 that when the flare angle is larger the in plane crushing stress increases which reduces the maximum stress in the wedge and thus delays the bending failure leading to larger ice cusps since the flare angle of an ice going ship is typically smaller at the bow compared to that in the bow shoulder area the results indicate that the ice cusps are larger in the bow shoulder area than those at the bow given the limitations of the measurement set up where photos are only taken at one ship frame this finding cannot be empirically confirmed with the available evidence but it could be validated in future full scale measurements fig 12 presents the joint effect of the crushing line slope k and wedge angle θ w on the critical crushing depth τ c r i t i c a l and breaking lengths the black areas correspond to conditions where the combination of the k and θ w is not realistic α π θ w 2 see fig 1 when θ w is small the magnitude of τ c r i t i c a l is insensitive to the change in crushing line slope k for example in fig 12 a when the wedge angle is 1 3 π τ c r i t i c a l varies between 0 015 and 0 016 when k change from 0 to 1 however when the wedge angle is around 2 3 π τ c r i t i c a l varies between 0 005 and 0 013 when k changes between 0 and 0 5 a similar difference in sensitivity is also evident for the breaking lengths generally with increasing crushing line slope τ c r i t i c a l l c e n t e r and l e d g e 2 decrease while l e d g e 1 increases this also means that the ice will break within shorter time with larger crushing line slope for the comparison with the cusp measurement results the dependence of l e d g e l c e n t e r and l e d g e l c e n t e r on θ w calculated by the proposed ice failure model are plotted in fig 13 here l e d g e refers to the mean of l e d g e 1 and l e d g e 2 the flare angle ψ is set as 75 which approximates those in the measurement ice thickness crushing strength and flexural strength are set as the mean values shown in table 2 two sets of k 0 and 0 2 are used linear regressions are plotted along with the raw data in order to demonstrate the correlation between the cusp geometry and wedge angle since the data are gathered at bow shoulder area the wedge angles of most ice cusps are above 90 the calculation clearly shows similar trends as indicated by the data where l e d g e and l e d g e l c e n t e r increase with larger θ w while l c e n t e r on the opposite it also shows that k has little influence on l e d g e and moderate influence on l c e n t e r and l e d g e l c e n t e r to evaluate the accuracy of the calculation compared to the measurement the mean signed deviation msd is calculated for each curve in fig 13 the msd is defined in this case as where c i and m i define the calculated and measured quantities n is the number of samples the reason that msd is used instead of standard deviation or other error measures is that the measurement contains the variation of ice thickness and strength properties while the calculation uses the mean values therefore msd gives an overall measure of the calculation accuracy compared to measurement the msd for l e d g e l c e n t e r and l e d g e l c e n t e r are 15 6 8 0 7 9 respectively for k 0 and 17 1 14 28 3 4 respectively for k 0 2 which indicates that the calculated quantities have certain underestimations but the deviations are relatively small therefore the ice failure model can give good estimation on the ice cusp geometry 6 2 results of the numerical model for the ship going through level ice 6 2 1 ship speed in ice as an example of the numerical model the first three s a agulhas ii cases investigated by li et al 2018a are re simulated using the numerical model developed in this paper the fourth case is not applied because there might be ice ridges highly influencing the ship speed the ice properties are set and randomized according to the full scale measurement see table 2 normal distributions are assumed during the randomization the ice thickness conditions of these three cases are summarized in table 3 for detailed information on the measurement system the readers are referred to li et al 2018a the only assumed parameter is the elastic modulus which is set to 5 gpa due to lack of measurement li et al 2018a fig 14 presents the ice channel created by the ship which seems to be realistic the fact that the icebreaking pattern is not symmetrical is due to the randomization of ice thickness and properties according to table 2 for which randomized ice thickness and ice properties are assigned to each 1 m by 1m grid in the simulated ice field fig 15 presents a comparison between the simulated ship speed and the recorded ship speed the mean and final speeds are summarized in table 4 in the first two scenarios the simulation predicts a higher speed while in the last scenario it underestimates the speed the deviations both in terms of mean and final speeds are relatively small compared to recorded speed mostly below 5 compared to other methods investigated by li et al 2018a the new model predicts less breaking resistance thus higher speed as presented in table 3 at around 350 m in the first scenario and around 230 m in the second scenario there are ice rubbles below the ice sheet which is possibly ice ridges this introduces additional resistance and leads to speed drops in the corresponding location as shown in fig 15 taking this into consideration the deviation between simulation and measurement in the first two scenarios are likely to be smaller therefore the simulation results give reasonable approximation on the ship speed in level ice 6 2 2 breaking pattern fig 16 presents the histograms of the ice cusp geometry both from the measurement and from the simulation the ice wedge angle θ w breaking lengths at the center l c e n t e r and the edge l e d g e defined as l e d g e 1 l e d g e 2 2 and the ratio between l e d g e and l c e n t e r are plotted and then summarized in table 5 the simulation results are obtained through a simulation run with the ice properties set in table 2 100 ice cusps information are extracted from the contact events which occurred at the bow shoulder region where the ship flare angle ψ is in the range of 70 80 in order to approximate the ice condition of the measured cases in general the simulation results show good similarities to the measurement with satisfying estimation of the mean values and standard deviation in terms of the measured quantities the estimation for θ w and l c e n t e r are particularly good which deviates from the measured mean values by less than 10 the larger difference comes from l e d g e which underestimates the mean value by 18 2 and results in 11 0 underestimation in the mean value of l e d g e l c e n t e r the simulation generally predicts more scatter than those shown in the measurement which possibly relates to the randomization of the ice properties the larger difference in l e d g e and l e d g e l c e n t e r may be explained by the hydrodynamic effect according to the fem simulation results by sawamura et al 2008 the hydrodynamic force may change the pressure distribution below the ice sheet and thus lead to elliptical ice cusps therefore the ice cusps can be more elliptical if the hydrodynamic effect is considered a method to effectively account for the hydrodynamic effect could be an interesting topic for future research 7 discussions as mentioned in the introduction the objective of this paper is to provide an engineering tool with a physical basis to predict a realistic icebreaking pattern with fast calculation in a simulation model for ship performance in level ice therefore icebreaking patterns of a considerable number of cases with good similarity to the reality are generated in order to implement it into numerical models in this section the comparisons between full scale measurement and simulation are first discussed after which the promising features of the proposed method as well as the limitations and possible improvements are discussed 7 1 discussions on the comparisons with full scale measurement the features of the proposed icebreaking model have been presented and compared with full scale measurement in the previous section the dependency on various influencing variables results in a large variety in icebreaking patterns with a physical basis the comparison with full scale ice photo measurements shows that the predicted icebreaking pattern is more realistic compared to the state of art approaches the shape of ice cusps is elliptical rather than circular when the wedge angle is relatively large this is one of the key aspects to improve the fidelity in numerical simulation models the size of the ice cusps by this approach is also close to the measurement which is very important in resistance calculations according to the findings by li et al 2018a it is interesting to see in fig 13 that the correlation between the ice cusp geometry parameters and the wedge angle is consistent with the calculation which gives evidence to the soundness of the proposed ice failure model however due to the assumptions e g ice material made in the derivation process the predicted geometry values has certain underestimation compared to the measurement see table 5 as a conclusion the proposed ice failure model predicts acceptably realistic ice cusp geometry for the implementation into numerical models while further calibration and validation are still needed the comparison with ship speed data provides insights into the implementation of the ice failure model into numerical models for ship performance in level ice as discussed in li et al 2018a the submersion resistance component calculated by lindqvist s formula takes up a major part of the total resistance and therefore dominates the magnitude and deviation of resistance prediction consequently it is insufficient to claim a numerical model is superior to other models without looking into each resistance component according to the results the predicted ship speed is close to the recorded speed which implies that the method is applicable for ship performance in ice while the proposed ice failure model presents a step forward in terms of the fidelity of the icebreaking module improving the representation of other force components in numerical simulation models for ship performance in ice certainly is an important area of future research in particular the rotation and submersion components should be further developed 7 2 new features of the proposed ice failure model the first new feature of the proposed ice failure model is that it improves the fidelity by realistic ice cusps geometry which is elliptical with larger breaking length along the edges than along the centerline the geometry of the ice cusps is similar to the statistics of the measured cusps geometry both in terms of shape and size this gives evidence to the validity of this method the breaking length varies in the angular direction and is linked to the breaking capacity of an ice wedge since the icebreaking pattern is one of the key issues in numerical modelling of a ship transiting level ice the results indicate an improvement in terms of a more accurate prediction of ship performance and ice loads in addition it results in a more realistic ice channel geometry which is important for analyzing scenarios where a ship breaks out of a channel or is being escorted or in a convoy following an icebreaker the second new feature of the proposed method is that it accounts for most of the potential influencing factors except for speed and hydrodynamic effects which could have influence to the breaking pattern and bearing capacity the dependency from the ship hull flare angle ψ influences ice cusp sizes so that the cusps are smaller in the bow than in the bow shoulder area this is a new feature which has not been captured in previous models for ice cusps the influence of the crushing line inclination k leads to large variations in the icebreaking pattern the influence of the crushing center location denoted by d c accounts for different crushing area geometry the wedge angle θ w has considerable influence on the breaking length and cusps size these parameters are linked together in this model as the input for different loading cases and result in large variety in icebreaking pattern the third important new feature of the proposed method is the fast calculation while retaining the complexity the database approach applied in this paper where results from a physics based ice failure model are stored in a database for a large number of cases allows fast numerical simulation with much more details in the local failure sawamura et al 2009 adopted similar database approach by fem to generate the database since the deflection field is influenced by many factors the number of possible variable combinations is very large about 106 see section 4 this makes the generation of an ice failure database very time consuming with the proposed ice failure model the generation of the database consumes much less time while retaining the huge variety in cases thus this method provides a computationally inexpensive way to calculate the icebreaking pattern while retaining the influence of multiple factors based on a physics based formulation 7 3 limitations and improvements one of the major limitations of the proposed approach at current stage is that it does not consider hydrodynamic effects in the bending process with hydrodynamic effect considered the simulated ship speed in table 4 is expected to be lower according to valanto 2001 and varsta 1983 the cusp size and the bearing capacity of ice will vary at higher speed due to the interaction between water and ice the state of art methods mostly consider the hydrodynamic effect via empirical formulas e g tan et al 2014 lindqvist 1989 wang 2001 it can also be accounted for in the physical model via similar approach where a different formulation of the elastic force by the water could be made dependent on ship speed this however is not elaborated in this paper and is left for future research when the flare angle of the ship becomes large e g over 80 the ship hull becomes close to vertical in this case the horizontal crushing force becomes an important factor in the stress field and could also contribute to bending moment the method then becomes unsuited to properly catch the behavior of ice in this case some ice cusps photos clearly show that ice sheet can fail due to almost horizontal crushing compression force which might be a result of buckling failure this is another important aspect of the icebreaking process modelling which should be studied in future research 8 conclusions this paper presents a novel ice failure model which can be used in numerical models for ship transiting level ice to determine the ship speed and ice loads on the hull the ice failure model depends on various input variables and is based on force balance equations for coupled narrow wedges the model is physics based and results in realistic cusp geometries without the need to resort to semi empirical approximations using simplified cusp geometries as applied in the current state of art the model has a number of features which are not included in previous cusp models e g the variation of breaking length along angular direction and the connection between bearing capacity and the size of ice cusps a comparison with full scale data gives evidence to the validity of the predictions by this model it also shows that it is suitable to implement this model into existing numerical simulation models for ship performance in ice improving the formulation for the icebreaking pattern while further improvements can be made e g related to the treatment of rotation and sliding forces in the ship performance simulation model the improved formulation for the ice failure model is a step towards more realistic models for performance in level ice declaration of interest none acknowledgement this work has

the numerical simulation provides detailed flow field information which allows for an analysis of the spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber and the measurement error associated with it new numerical results show that vortex shedding at the sharp edge of the owc chamber enhances the spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber through a resonant sloshing mechanism the enhanced spatial non uniformity can affect the accuracy of the experimentally determined quantities such as the extraction efficiency of the owc chamber and the characteristics of the power take off device suggestions are also provided to improve the accuracy of the experimentally determined quantities that may be affected by the spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber keywords oscillating water column numerical modeling openfoam resonant sloshing wave energy converter 1 introduction there has been a rise of interest and practice in obtaining clean and renewable energy technology as the global warming issue becomes a concern and the resources of fossil fuels are depleting ocean wave energy is sustainable clean and abundant falnes 2007 compared to other clean energy sources such as solar and wind energy ocean wave energy has less short term variation and can serve as an important part of the clean energy puzzle in order to extract ocean wave energy various types of devices have been proposed falcão 2010 among these devices oscillating water column owc type of wave energy converters wecs are widely tested and investigated mainly due to its robustness in simplicity of wave energy extraction mechanism easy maintenance and potentially high energy capture efficiency a typical owc type wec consists of a semi submerged and semi closed pneumatic chamber referred to as owc chamber and a power take off pto system the bottom of the chamber allows the ocean waves to create an oscillation of the water mass inside the chamber which compresses and expands the air volume above the water surface inside the chamber evans 1978 the fluctuating air pressure in the pneumatic chamber drives a power take off pto turbine which extracts the wave energy into electricity through a generator since the first theoretical work studying the energy extraction and hydrodynamic characteristics of an owc device evans 1978 which treats the air water interface inside the owc chamber as a rigid weightless piston for simplicity a wide range of theoretical and experimental studies have been done to provide better understanding of the hydrodynamic processes involved and to improve the energy extraction efficiency of such devices for example evans 1982 extended the theory of evans 1978 to account for the spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber and sarmento and falcão 1985 examined the effects of the air compressibility in their theoretical study more recently matched eigenfunction expansion methods which are based on linear wave theory have been applied to study owc devices with various geometric configurations evans and porter 1995 martins rivas and mei 2008 lovas et al 2010 deng et al 2013 2014 xu et al 2016 these theoretical studies provide convenient tools to perform frequency domain analysis of owc devices for system optimization at the early stage of the system design process however because these theories are based on linear wave theory and potential flow assumption they are usually not able to address issues related to viscous energy loss i e the energy loss associated with vortex shedding and generation of higher harmonics that may affect the extraction efficiency of the owc devices scaled laboratory experiments can provide observations of some physical processes and help improve the system optimization of owc devices a number of experimental studies on the hydrodynamics and energy extraction of owc devices can be found in the literature existing experimental studies have focused on providing understanding of the wave energy capture efficiency wang et al 2002 he et al 2013 ning et al 2016 xu et al 2016 fleming and macfarlane 2017b vyzikas et al 2017 hydrodynamic characteristics such as vortex shedding wave scattering and the motion responses of floating owc devices rapaka et al 2004 he et al 2013 he and huang 2014 xu et al 2016 ning et al 2016 fleming and macfarlane 2017b prototype owc devices have also been put to test over the last few decades goda et al 1991 boake et al 2002 torre enciso et al 2009 prototype operations have shown that the major challenges in putting owc devices into commercial applications include the high unit cost of generated electricity and low structure survivability under extreme events thorpe 1999 medina lopez et al 2015 it has been widely acknowledged that spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber plays a role in the measurement of owc wave energy capture efficiency many small scale laboratory tests studied two dimensional owc chambers he and huang 2014 bingham et al 2015 ning et al 2016 and used one wave gauge wang et al 2002 simonetti et al 2015 xu et al 2016 to measure the waves inside the owc chambers they studied the use of one wave gauge makes it difficult to accurately determine the mean motion of the air water surface inside the owc chamber he and huang 2017 proposed a method to reconstruct the water surface inside a rectangular shaped owc by using two wave gauges which allows an accurate determination of the water surface inside the owc chamber for three dimensional owc chamber geometries however the use of one or two wave gauges cannot provide enough information to reconstruct the water surface inside the owc chamber as a result the spatial non uniformity in the water surface may affect the accuracy of the measured capture efficiency bingham et al 2015 used two wave gauges inside the owc chamber and examined the spatial non uniformity including sloshing inside the chamber by comparing the measurements of the two wave gauges and visually inspecting the water surface during the experiment some experimental studies have also revealed the spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber via ccd camera recordings ning et al 2016 or piv techniques fleming and macfarlane 2017b vyzikas et al 2017 placed three wave probes in the width direction of the chamber to examine the lateral sloshing effect inside a rectangular owc chamber however systematic discussion on the spatial non uniformity and its effect on the measured capture efficiency in both two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d chamber geometries remains rare xu et al 2016 proposed to use the results provided by a linear frequency domain solver to reduce the effects of the spatial non uniformity on the calculation of the energy capture efficiency and the determination of the pto characteristics as shown in xu et al 2016 the spatial non uniformity is more significant for shorter waves however the generation of higher harmonic waves and their effects cannot be considered in xu et al 2016 s method because of the linear theory used in the analysis in actual laboratory conditions short wave components exist in nonlinear incident waves and may also be generated by the higher harmonic components in the fluctuating air pressure due to a nonlinear pto nonlinear wave wave interaction and the vortices shed from the edges of the owc chamber these higher harmonic waves may resonate with the owc chamber resulting in resonant sloshing mode inside the owc chamber these effects of higher harmonics and viscosity that cannot be addressed by frequency domain solvers can be easily addressed by computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations cfd simulations of wave interaction with an owc device can provide important information about the flow field and the spatial distribution of the water surface inside the owc chamber which is otherwise very difficult to obtain in wave flume tests with the development of cfd methods and computing technology an increasing number of numerical simulations of wave interaction with owc devices can be found in the literature liu et al 2008 used a 2d cfd model to study the oscillation amplitude of the water surface inside the owc chamber and the effect of pto mechanism on the water column oscillation two types of time domain numerical models have been applied to study the wave power extraction efficiency and the hydrodynamic process of owc devices in waves one is based on non linear potential flow theory koo and kim 2010 ning et al 2015 and the other is based on cfd simulations which involves solving the navier stokes equations time domain potential solvers have the advantage of high computational efficiency and are fairly accurate for some problems but viscous effects cannot be modeled explicitly even though non linear potential solvers such as higher order boundary element methods hobem can be modified to include a parametric consideration of viscous loss wang et al 2018 a detailed and comprehensive modeling of viscous effects can only be provided by cfd models zhang et al 2012 performed cfd simulations based on two phase level set and immersed boundary method to study the hydrodynamic performance of a 2d owc device teixeira et al 2013 used a numerical solver based on navier stokes equations and an aerodynamic model in their investigation of optimization of owc devices the open source cfd library openfoam has been used to study bottom fixed 2d owc devices iturrioz et al 2015 simonetti et al 2015 where the turbulence was handled through either a k ω sst model or large eddy simulations les and the air water surface was tracked using the volume of fluid vof method comparisons with experimental data have shown that the openfoam based simulations can reproduce the experiments well in terms of the chamber pressure and free surface elevations measured at single points suggesting the potential of using openfoam based simulations to further study 3d owc devices more recently elhanafi et al 2016 and elhanafi et al 2017a used starccm which is a cfd software package based on reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans and vof method to study various hydrodynamic and energy conversion aspects of two types of 2d owc devices lópez et al 2016 proposed to use an rans vof method in a numerical study aimed at finding optimum pto damping under a given local wave climate elhanafi et al 2017b studied numerically the impact of air compressibility at different model scaling using compressible and incompressible rans vof methods it was found that for the three dimensional owc device studied ignoring air compressibility at full scale could introduce an error of 12 in the estimation of power extraction efficiency all these aforementioned cfd simulations have focused on owc devices with 2d geometries with the exception of elhanafi et al 2017b and the spatial non uniformity of the water surface surface sloshing inside the owc chamber is not the focus of these studies in this study we present a numerical simulation of a 3d bottom sitting owc device and propose a data analysis method to reduce the effects of spatial non uniformity surface sloshing within an owc chamber in the calculation of the capture efficiency and the characteristics of the pto in both the experimental studies and numerical simulations the numerical model used in this study is based on the open source cfd library openfoam with a vof method to track the air water surface and a k ω turbulence closure the 3d owc device is a circular owc pile device tested experimentally by xu et al 2016 the numerical model and the setup of the numerical wave tank are described in section 2 the validation of the numerical model and a systematic discussion on the spatial non uniformity surface sloshing as well as the effect of such non uniformity on the analysis of experimental results are discussed in section 4 together with suggestions for data analysis to reduce the error induced by spatial non uniformity main conclusions are summarized in section 7 1 1 description of the numerical model to facilitate further discussion the coordinate system used in this paper is defined in fig 1 where a sketch of the domain and the coordinate system are shown the x axis is horizontal with its positive direction pointing from the wave maker to the wave absorbing zone the y axis is vertical with its positive direction pointing vertically upward the z axis is horizontal with its positive direction pointing laterally out of the paper 1 2 governing equations the numerical model is based on the open source computational fluid dynamics library openfoam the model employs the 3d incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans as the governing equations for a water air mixture let s be the saturation of water in a particular volume s 0 for the air above the air water surface and s 1 for the water below the air water surface the air water interface is treated as a thin layer of the water air mixture where 0 s 1 the density ρ and the dynamic viscosity μ of the water air mixture are calculated by 1 ρ s ρ w 1 s ρ a 2 μ s μ w 1 s μ a where the subscripts w and a refer to water and air respectively the continuity equation for the water air mixture is 3 u 0 where u is the velocity field of the water air mixture the vector form of the momentum equations is 4 ρ u t ρ u u t ρ g p μ u ρ t σ t κ α where p is the pressure g is the gravitational acceleration σ t is the surface tension constant κ the curvature of the air water interface and t is the specific reynolds stress tensor which needs to be closed by a selected turbulence model rusche 2003 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 in order to track the water air interface we adopt a modified vof method which uses the following phase governing equation 5 s t s u u r s 1 s 0 with u r being an interface compression velocity only present in the water air interface to suppress the diffusive behavior of the interface for more details of this modified interface compressive vof scheme the reader is referred to rusche 2003 the following k ω turbulence model is used to provide a closure to the specific reynolds stress tensor t wilcox 1993 2008 6 ρ ω t ρ u ω α p ω β ρ ω 2 σ d ω ρ k ω t μ σ ω ρ k ω ω and 7 ρ k t ρ u k p k β ρ ω k μ σ μ t k where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and ω is a characteristic eddy frequency p k and p ω are the production terms of k and ω respectively following mayer and madsen 2000 and jacobsen et al 2012 the following forms are adopted for p k and p ω in order to suppress the abnormal growth of the turbulent viscosity and turbulent kinetic energy across the interface in potential flows 8 p k μ t u u t p ω ω k p k note that the expressions given in eq 8 are different from the original forms of turbulence production terms suggested by wilcox wilcox 1993 2008 the expressions given in eq 8 state that the production of turbulent kinetic energy is related to the vorticity of the fluid motion instead of the shear rate of the fluid velocity the dynamic turbulent eddy viscosity μ t is defined as 9 μ t ρ k ω where 10 ω max ω c l i m 2 s s β with s being the strain rate tensor the specific reynolds stress tensor can be calculated by 11 t 2 ρ μ t s 2 3 k i where s is the strain rate tensor expressed by 12 s 1 2 u u t and i is the identity tensor we use the following suggested values for the coefficients in the k ω model wilcox 2008 α 13 25 β 0 072 β 0 09 σ ω 0 5 σ 3 5 and c l i m 7 8 the free open source cfd software openfoam weller et al 1998 was used to solve these equations with appropriate boundary and initial conditions a finite volume numerical discretization method on unstructured grids was used to discretize the numerical fields the pressure implicit split operator piso see e g ferziger and peric 2012 issa 1986 method was used for the pressure velocity coupling solution a mixed crank nicolson method ferziger and peric 2012 was used for the discretization in the time domain 1 3 the owc model the owc device in this study is a numerical reproduction of the circular owc supported by a c shaped support structure which has been studied experimentally and theoretically by xu et al 2016 the left panel of fig 2 shows a sketch of this owc model which consists of a circular tube section covered on the top by a plate with an orifice in it as the pto mechanism the upper portion of the model is a partially submerged tube forming an owc chamber and the lower portion of the model is a c shaped support structure the overall height of the model is h 0 4 m the height from the bottom to the top of the c shaped support structure is d s 0 244 m the outer diameter of the model is d 0 125 m and the orifice diameter is d o 0 014 m in the wave flume tests conducted by xu et al 2016 the model was made of stainless steel of 3 mm in thickness which is used here in the numerical simulations 1 4 setup of the numerical wave flume referring to fig 1 a three dimensional numerical wave flume of 14 00 m 0 54 m 0 60 m length width height is used to perform all numerical simulations the numerical wave flume consists of three sections the first section from x 0 00 m 4 00 m is the wave generating zone the second section from x 4 00 m 10 00 m is the test zone the third section from x 10 00 m 14 00 m is the wave absorbing zone the boundary conditions of the numerical wave flume are set up to resemble the actual test conditions in the wave flume tests xu et al 2016 i wave inlet boundary conditions are used at x 0 m ii wall boundary conditions are used on the bottom and two lateral boundaries and at x 14 m iii atmospheric boundary condition is used at the top boundary of the computational domain iv the walls of the owc model are set to wall boundaries all wall boundaries are assumed to be hydraulically smooth because the walls of the wave flume in the experiment are made of glass and the walls of the owc model are made of stainless steel as in the wave flume tests xu et al 2016 the numerical owc model is placed at x 7 m and z 0 25 m and three numerical wave gauges g 1 g 2 and g 3 are used to measure the surface displacements inside and outside the owc model the locations of g 1 g 2 and g 3 are shown in fig 1 g 1 is 5 cm away from the outer edge of the model on the up wave side g 2 is inside the owc chamber and 3 7 cm away from the geometrical axis of the owc chamber on the down wave side of the orifice g 3 is 5 cm away from the outer edge of the owc model on the down wave side the pressure gauge is placed 3 7 cm away from the central axis of the orifice on the up wave side of the orifice one numerical pressure gauge is used to measure the air pressure inside the pneumatic chamber the measured air pressure and the surface displacements at these three locations can be used to verify and validate the numerical model 1 5 wave generation and absorption in the present study the wave generation toolbox waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 is implemented to generate monochromatic waves and provide wave absorbing boundaries waves2foam implements a relaxation zone for wave generation on top of the vof based two phase flow solver interfoam see chapter 4 of rusche 2003 more information about the implementation of waves2foam in this study can be found in appendix b the method is based on the relaxation zone concept on a mesh cell located in the prescribed relaxation zone physical quantities have prescribed values that are computed using the following expression 13 ϕ α r ϕ c 1 α r ϕ t where ϕ c is the actual computed value ϕ t is the target value and α r is the relaxation factor defined by 14 α r χ r 1 exp χ r 3 5 1 exp 1 1 with χ r x l r being the location relative to the horizontal length of the relaxation zone and l r the length of the relaxation zone thus it is ensured that at χ r 0 which is the most upstream point α r 0 and ϕ ϕ t and at χ r 1 which is the boundary between relaxation zone and non relaxed zone α r 1 and ϕ ϕ c between these two limits the value of a physical quantity such as u or s is a blend of the computed and target values in this study the target values are obtained from potential wave theory active wave absorption is intrinsically included in the wave generation relaxation zone the relaxation zone method is also used in the wave absorbing zone to reduce wave reflection this can be achieved by setting the target value for u to 0 everywhere in the absorbing zone and setting the target value for s to the calculated value based on the still water line inside the flume the length of the relaxation zone was fixed at 4 m in all simulations which is equivalent to 1 6 to 5 3 wave lengths depending on the incident wave period the reflecting coefficient defined by wave amplitudes of the relaxation zone for the longest waves considered in this study t 1 6 s is 5 which is comparable to the largest reflection coefficient in the wave flume test for shorter waves the reflection coefficient of the relaxation zone is much smaller than 5 1 6 mesh setup we used an unstructured nested mesh to cover the entire computational domain the right panel of fig 2 shows a slice of the mesh in detail in order to reduce the computational load a coarse mesh of resolution 1 64 cm 1 00 cm 5 00 cm δ x δ y δ z was used in the relaxation zones however in the test section away from the model the mesh was refined to a resolution of at least 0 82 cm 1 00 cm 2 50 cm which had been confirmed to be fine enough by comparing the simulation results in an empty flume with second order stokes wave theory in order to accurately track the free surface the mesh within 5 cm around the still water surface was further refined to a resolution of 0 82 cm 0 25 cm 1 25 cm representing about 100 horizontal nodes in one wave length and 8 to 20 vertical nodes covering a single wave length profile of 0 8 s wave period and 2 cm 5 cm wave height in the vicinity of the owc model an even more refined mesh was used to accurately snap the thin walls of the model with a characteristic mesh resolution of 0 205 cm 0 125 cm 0 159 cm an openfoam built in pre processing mesh tool snappyhexmesh was used to deform re size and remove mesh cells according to the geometry of the owc model resulting in two layers of even finer mesh with a characteristic mesh resolution of 0 1 cm 0 1 cm 0 1 cm which closely snaps the surface of the owc model the total cell count of the final mesh is about 1 4 million a the mesh dependence study based on three sets of mesh configurations near the surfaces of the owc model a coarser mesh 1 5 mm 1 5 mm 1 5 mm the present mesh 1 0 mm 1 0 mm x 1 0 mm and a finer mesh 0 5 mm 0 5 mm x 0 5 mm has confirmed that the quadratic loss coefficients obtained using the present mesh have less than 3 difference from those obtained using the finer mesh the present mesh was chosen to achieve a balance between computational cost and accuracy 2 model verification and validation this section presents the model verification and validation using the experimental results reported in xu et al 2016 these experimental results include the surface displacements measured at three locations inside and around the owc model the pressure of the air inside the owc chamber and the calculated capture width and the characteristics of the pto these results were obtained for 29 test conditions a typical simulation of about 20 wave periods takes about one week on a high performance workstation with a total of 20 physical processors dual intel xeon e5 2650 v3 and 128 gb of ddr4 memory 2 1 physical and numerical test conditions table 1 shows a summary of all test conditions used in the model verification and validation these test conditions have been chosen to test the effects of incident wave period water depth and wave height on the owc performance xu et al 2016 the waves generated in the numerical simulations have a maximum difference of 5 in wave height compared to the corresponding waves used in the experiment the wave heights given in table 1 are those used in the physical experiment experiment a and experiment b were designed to test effects of wave period and water depth and experiment c was designed to test effects of wave height 2 2 simulated surface displacement and air pressure inside the owc chamber fig 3 shows sample comparisons of the simulated and measured surface displacements for two locations outside the owc chamber the left panel is for the location g 1 and the right panel is for the location g 3 the left panel of fig 4 shows sample comparisons of the simulated and measured surface displacements for the location g 2 which is inside the owc chamber to quantify the comparison between the measurement and the simulation we use the following normalized root mean square error nrmse as a measure of the closeness between the experiment and the simulation ris et al 1999 15 nrmse 1 o m a x o m i n 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 where o i represents the i t h data point from the experimental observation o m a x and o m i n are the maximum and minimum values occurred in the experimental observation time series used in the analysis and p i represents the data point from the model prediction that corresponds to the observation o i when nrmse 0 a perfect prediction by the simulation is achieved if nrmse 1 0 the root mean square error of the simulated time series is comparable to the variation of the observed time series making the simulation prediction unreliable in figs 3 and 4 the values of nrmse for all comparisons range from 2 18 to 6 86 indicating good agreements between the numerical simulations and the experimental observations the right panel of fig 4 shows comparisons of the simulated and measured variations of the air pressure in the pneumatic chamber the cfd simulation can capture the air pressure variation very well especially the nonlinear features associated with the quadratic nature of the pto a small orifice on the top cover of the pneumatic chamber the good agreement between the simulated and measured surface displacements at three locations and the air pressure inside the pneumatic chamber indicates that the present cfd model and numerical setup can adequately capture the important physical processes involved in the nonlinear wave interaction with the circular owc device because the detailed flow field inside the owc chamber can be provided by the numerical simulation it is possible to address issues that cannot be addressed by wave flume experiments such as surface sloshing and its effects on the extraction efficiency determined using the velocity measured at one point inside the owc chamber 2 3 extraction efficiency the extraction efficiency of a wave energy converter is usually measured by the so called capture width which is defined as the ratio between the absorbed power and the available wave power per meter of wave crest of the incident waves for an owc type wave energy converter the wave power extracted by the device denoted by p o w c is calculated by 16 p o w c 1 n t t 0 t 0 n t s p t v x z t d x d z d t where s is the cross section of the owc chamber p t is the air pressure fluctuation inside the owc chamber v x z t is the local velocity of the oscillation of the water surface inside the owc chamber t 0 is an arbitrary time instance t is the wave period and n is an integer the spatial i e cross sectional average velocity v t is determined by 17 v t 1 a 0 s v x z t d x d z with a 0 being the cross sectional area of the owc pneumatic chamber in terms of v t p o w c can be written as 18 p o w c a 0 n t t 0 t 0 n t p t v t d t therefore the capture width λ can be written as 19 λ p o w c e i c g where the incident wave energy density e i and the group velocity c g are given by 20 e i 1 8 ρ w g h i 2 c g l t 1 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h in eqn 20 h is the local water depth ρ w is the density of water h i is the incident wave height l is the wave length and k 2 π l is the wave number the spatial average velocity v t is not obtainable in wave flume experiments usually a limited number of wave gauges are used to measured the surface motion at selected locations in most wave flume tests the spatial average velocity v t is usually approximated by the velocity measured at one single point inside the owc chamber say g 2 in our experiment xu et al 2016 we denote the velocity measured at a single point by v and the pneumatic power extraction calculated using v denoted by p o w c is 21 p o w c a 0 n t t 0 t 0 n t p t v t d t in other words the capture width measured in the experiment is actually λ 22 λ p o w c e i c g the difference between λ and λ is affected by the difference between v and v which reflects the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber for a uniform water surface i e a weightless piston v v and λ λ if there is a surface sloshing we should expect v v and λ λ the capture width is usually normalized by either the wave length lovas et al 2010 martins rivas and mei 2008 or a characteristic dimension of the energy converter xu et al 2016 we choose the diameter of the owc model d to normalize the capture width and refer to λ d as the capture width ratio cwr in this study fig 5 shows a comparison of the capture width ratios obtained from the cfd simulation and the experiment for the three sets of the experiments listed in table 1 it can be seen that the cfd simulation can reproduce the measured capture width ratios λ d very well implying that the present cfd simulation can reproduce satisfactorily both the magnitudes and phases of the air pressure fluctuation and the water surface oscillation inside the owc chamber 2 4 parameterization of the nonlinear pto when using potential flow theory to study wave interaction with an owc device with a quadratic nonlinear pto in frequency domain or time domain a parametrization of the pto is needed in wave flume tests the pto is usually modeled by an orifice which causes a pressure drop between the pneumatic chamber and the surrounding air outside for incompressible air this pressure drop can be modeled by the following equation mei et al 1989 xu et al 2016 23 p t 1 2 c f ρ a v t v t ρ a l g d v t d t where p t is the relative pressure of the air inside the pneumatic chamber ρ a the density of the air v t the spatial average velocity of the water surface oscillation inside the owc chamber c f is a quadratic loss coefficient related to drag effect and l g is an inertial length scale it has been shown that the inertial effect represented by the last term in eq 23 is not important in small scale wave flume tests xu et al 2016 therefore the nonlinear pto can be parametrized by the quadratic loss coefficient c f alone we remark that the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber can introduce significant error in the value of c f determined using eq 23 and the local velocity measured at a single point inside the owc chamber in the wave flume experiment of xu et al 2016 p t was measured by a pressure sensor mounted on the top of the owc pneumatic chamber the surface displacement was measured at one location g 2 inside the owc chamber therefore the spatial average velocity v is not obtainable from the wave flume experiment but approximated by v t the local velocity measured at the location g 2 which itself needs to be calculated using the surface displacement measured at the location g 2 we use c f to denote the quadratic loss coefficient determined by using velocity v 24 p t 1 2 c f ρ a v t v t where the inertial term has been neglected xu et al 2016 the measured and simulated values of c f are shown in fig 6 a satisfactory agreement between the simulation and the experiment can be observed for all test cases the minor difference is due mainly to the minor difference in the local velocity v obtained from the experiment and the simulation 3 spatial non uniformity and resonant sloshing inside the owc chamber because the cross sectional dimension of a typical owc device is smaller than the wave length of design waves the spatial non uniformity in the water surface inside the owc chamber is expected to be stronger for shorter waves than for longer waves using the cfd simulation results we are able to obtain detailed flow information which can help understand factors that affect the spatial non uniformity and reduce the measurement error in the determination of capture width and the characteristics of the pto 3 1 spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber one way to show the spatial non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber is the spatial distribution of the wave height inside the owc chamber as shown in fig 7 where the wave height is the vertical distance between the local maximum and the local minimum of the surface displacement measured within one wave period because there exists a partial standing wave pattern in front of the c shaped support structure the wave height is larger closer to this reflective boundary both the wave period and the draft of the owc chamber affect the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber shorter waves generally give a stronger spatial non uniformity which is in general agreement with our intuition and the theoretical predictions of xu et al 2016 increasing the draft of the owc chamber reduces the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber because the velocity obtained at a single location is used to represent the spatial averaged velocity there is an error introduced to the calculated capture width λ and the quadratic loss coefficient c f 3 2 spectral analysis of the sloshing motion inside the owc chamber to further understand the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber the simulated surface displacement η x z t is decomposed into two components the cross sectional average and the deviation from this spatial average 25 η x z t η t η x z t where η x z t the sloshing component is the deviation from the cross sectional average component η t the spatial mean component 26 η t 1 a 0 s η x z t d x d z with s being the cross section of the owc chamber by definition 27 s η x z t d x d z 0 in eq 25 η t represents a piston like oscillation inside the owc chamber and η x z t represents the spatial non uniformity superimposed on η t we refer to the motion associated with η as spatial average motion and the motion associated with η x z t as sloshing motion hereinafter in a wave flume experiment the surface displacement is measured at a very limited number of points as a result the spatial average motion η t is not measurable so is the sloshing motion η x z t in their wave flume experiment xu et al 2016 approximated the spatial average motion η t by the surface displacement measured at the location g 2 see fig 1 when the surface displacement is measured at a given point say g 2 in the experiment of xu et al 2016 the harmonic components in the spatial average motion η t and the sloshing motion η t can be studied through an harmonic analysis to understand the relationship between the incident waves and the motion of the air water surface inside the owc chamber we use the simulated data to show the spectral characteristics of the incident waves the spatial average motion and sloshing motion inside the owc chamber we use η t to represent η x g 2 z g 2 t for simplicity hereinafter the incident waves can be expressed as 28 η i 1 2 a f e 2 π i f t d f and the amplitude spectrum of η i t is a f the displacements for the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion can be expressed as 29 η 1 2 b f e 2 π i f t d f η t 1 2 b f e 2 π i f t d f and the amplitude spectra of η t and η x z t are b f and b f respectively the matlab built in fast fourier transfer fft function was used to perform the spectrum analysis in this study the fft analysis was performed only on the stable segment of the signal which consists of several stable waves the length of the signal was carefully chosen so that energy leaking between frequency bins is minimized fig 8 shows the simulated amplitude spectra a f b f and b f for three cases t 0 7 1 1 and 1 6 s selected from experiment a h 0 29 m the surface displacement measured at g 1 is due mainly to wave diffraction it was used to approximate the main features in the incident waves the displacements for the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion are obtained using the surface displacement at the location of g 2 the vertical dashed line at f n 2 717 hz in fig 8 indicates the resonant sloshing frequency of the owc chamber see deng et al 2013 xu et al 2016 which corresponds to a wave length about 1 8 times the diameter of the owc chamber because the higher harmonic locked waves all have the same phase speed as that of the incident fundamental waves i e the second harmonic locked waves have a length that is one half of the length of the first harmonic incident waves and the third harmonic locked waves have a length that is one third of the length of the first harmonic incident waves the resonant sloshing motion discovered by deng et al 2013 and xu et al 2016 is a free standing wave whose phase speed is not locked to that of the incident waves for all three wave periods even though the incident waves have weak second harmonic components the third harmonic components in the incident waves are negligibly small among the three wave periods the incident waves with t 1 6 s have a relatively larger second harmonic component which is about 25 of the amplitude of the first harmonic component refer to the first row in fig 8 for t 0 7 s the amplitude of the first harmonic oscillation in the spatial average motion is slightly smaller than that in the incident waves the first harmonic in the sloshing motion also contributes to the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber the amplitude of the second harmonic in the spatial average component is negligibly small however it is significantly large in the sloshing component as large as 20 of the amplitude of the first harmonic in the spatial average component we remark here that the second harmonic sloshing motion has a frequency close to the owc s resonant sloshing frequency refer to the second row in fig 8 for t 1 1 s the spatial average motion is dominated by the first harmonic motion which has an amplitude similar to that of the incident waves the sloshing motion is dominated by the third harmonic motion whose frequency is almost identical to that of the owc s resonant sloshing frequency the sloshing motion has a first harmonic component similar to that for t 0 7 s but both the second and fourth harmonic component are small refer to the third row in fig 8 for t 1 6 s in addition to the first harmonic motion the spatial average motion has also a noticeable second harmonic oscillation whose amplitude is larger than that of the incident waves the higher harmonics in the sloshing motion are all weak which is in agreement with the generally accepted conclusion that the water surface acts like a weightless position for longer waves evans 1982 no resonant sloshing occur for longer waves fig 9 shows the simulated amplitude spectra a f b f and b f for three cases t 0 7 1 1 and 1 6 s selected from experiment b h 0 31 m for all three wave periods even though the incident waves have weak second harmonic components the third harmonic components in the incident waves are negligibly small the vertical dashed line at f n 2 717 hz indicates the resonant frequency of the owc chamber see deng et al 2013 xu et al 2016 which corresponds to a wave length about 1 8 times the diameter of the owc chamber for a given design of the owc pile a deeper water depth means a deeper draft or submergence of the owc chamber similar to h 0 29 m the resonant sloshing occurs at the second harmonic for t 0 7 s and the resonant sloshing occurs at the third harmonic for t 1 1 s a comparison of figs 8 and 9 shows that slightly increasing the draft can slightly reduce the first harmonic amplitudes in both the spatial average motion and sloshing motion but can noticeably reduce the higher harmonic amplitudes in the sloshing motion from figs 8 and 9 some important conclusions about the sloshing motion inside the owc chamber can be drawn for t 0 7 s resonant sloshing is excited by a second harmonic forcing for t 1 1 s the resonant sloshing is excited by a third harmonic forcing for t 1 6 s there is no resonant sloshing the excitation forcing that feeds energy into resonant sloshing cannot be the higher harmonic locked waves for two reasons i the third harmonic locked waves in the incident waves for t 1 1 s have a strength too weak to provide enough energy to excite the resonant sloshing ii the resonant sloshing has a wave length about 1 8 times the owc diameter which is much shorter than the lengths of the second and third harmonic locked waves therefore it is not the second or third harmonic locked waves that provide the excitation forcing through wave wave nonlinear interaction other possible nonlinear mechanisms that may be responsible for exciting the resonant sloshing inside the owc chamber are i the air flow through the nonlinear pto and ii vortex shedding because the pto in the experiment was an orifice which has a quadratic relation with the spatial average velocity of the water surface inside the owc chamber the nonlinear pto may play a role in exciting the resonant sloshing vortex shedding at the lower tip of the owc front skirt may perturb the flow field inside the owc chamber and thus may play a role in exciting the resonant sloshing 3 3 sloshing motion in the owc chamber without pto the nonlinear pto described by eq 23 can generate higher harmonic components in the fluctuating air pressure p t it is interesting to know whether or not the higher harmonic sloshing in the owc chamber is related to the nonlinear pto for this purpose another set of cfd simulations were performed with the pto being removed from the top cover so that the owc chamber is fully open to the surrounding air i e the pressure on the water surface is the constant atmospheric pressure figs 10 and 11 show the simulated amplitude spectra of the incident waves the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion for experiment a and experiment b respectively for a fully opened owc the spatial average motion is dominated by the first harmonic oscillation but the sloshing motion is dominated by higher harmonics for t 0 7 s the amplitude of the first harmonic in the spatial average motion is almost two times that of the corresponding incident waves and the sloshing motion is dominated by the second harmonic motion whose amplitude can reach about 60 of the amplitude of the first harmonic in the incident waves the third and fourth harmonic components can also be identified in the sloshing motion for this case the frequency of the second harmonic is close to that of the resonant sloshing note that the third and fourth harmonics are negligibly small in the incident waves compared to the case with a pto the pressure fluctuation inside the owc chamber suppresses the amplitudes of both the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion for t 1 1 s the first harmonic amplitude of the spatial average motion is almost 1 5 times that of the corresponding incident waves and the sloshing motion is dominated by the third harmonic motion whose amplitude can reach about 20 of the first harmonic amplitude of the incident waves the fourth harmonic is also noticeable in the sloshing motion for this case the frequency of the third harmonic sloshing motion is close to that of the resonant sloshing note also that the third and fourth harmonics are negligibly small in the incident waves again compared to the case with a pto the pressure fluctuation inside the pneumatic chamber suppresses the amplitudes of both the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion for t 1 6 s the first harmonic amplitude of the spatial average motion is almost the same as that of the corresponding incident waves but the sloshing motion is not present it can be concluded that the resonant sloshing motion in the owc chamber is not excited by the nonlinear pto even though the resonant sloshing is not excited by the air pressure fluctuation introduced by the nonlinear pto but the nonlinear pto can suppress both the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion through generation of radiated waves 3 4 excitation of resonant sloshing by vortex shedding if the resonant sloshing motion inside the owc chamber is not excited by the nonlinear pto or the higher harmonic wave components in the incoming waves it may be excited by the vortex shedding at the sharp edges of the owc pile wave induced vortex shedding is a viscous nonlinear process to understand the relation between the vortex shedding and the resonant sloshing we examine the spectrum of the computed vorticty fig 12 shows snapshots of the computed magnitudes of the vorticity at four time instants within one wave period for the case of t 1 1 s in experiment a it can be seen that the dominant direction of the vorticity should be tangent to the outer surface of the owc chamber which is z direction at any point on the mirror symmetric plane in the coordinate system used here we chose to use the vorticity at a location on the mirror symmetric plane and 1 cm below the lower tip of the owc chamber skirt this location is representative of the vorticity shed from the lower tip see appendix a the z component of the vorticity vector at a given location ω z t can be written as 30 ω z t 1 2 ω z f e 2 π f t d f we denote the amplitude spectrum of the vorticity ω z t as ω f ω z f fig 13 shows the vorticity spectra at a location 1 cm below the lower skirt of the owc chamber along the central axis for the cases of t 0 7 s t 1 1 s and t 1 6 s in experiment a but without pto i e the owc chamber is fully open to the surrounding air at this location the vorticity component ω z is tangent to the outer surface of the owc chamber the vorticity spectrum for t 0 7 s has four harmonics and the vorticity spectrum for t 1 1 s has three harmonics the vortex shedding can generate fluctuating pressure which can generate free waves of various frequency components for t 0 7 s the second harmonic fluctuation of the vorticity is able to excite the resonant sloshing for t 1 1 s the third harmonic fluctuation of the vorticity is able to excite the resonant sloshing for t 1 6 s no harmonic fluctuation of the vorticity is close to the resonant sloshing frequency to excite the resonant sloshing of course the nonlinear pto will modify the amplitude spectrum of the vorticity through the generation of the radiated waves for the cases of t 0 7 s t 1 1 s and t 1 6 s in experiment b but without pto figures are not shown here conclusions same as those for the corresponding cases in experiment a can be drawn 4 effects of sloshing motion inside the owc chamber due to the lack of a good method to accurately measure the complex 3d motion of the water surface inside the owc chamber wave flume experiments rely on a very limited number of wave gauges to measure the displacements of the water surface at one morris thomas et al 2007 xu et al 2016 ning et al 2016 or two locations he and huang 2014 inside the owc chamber the existence of the surface sloshing inside the owc chamber causes the velocity measured at a single point to be larger than the spatial average velocity and thus affects the experimentally determined capture width ratio and the measured characteristics of the nonlinear pto because the calculation of both needs the spatial average velocity of the water surface inside the owc chamber 4 1 effects on parameterization of the nonlinear pto data fitting using eq 23 to both the laboratory data xu et al 2016 and the simulation data has indicated that for the small scale model as tested the effect of inertia in p t is very small less than 3 and thus negligible fig 14 shows the values of the quadratic loss coefficient obtained using the velocity measured at one point c f and the spatial average velocity c f difference between c f and c f can be observed as expected this difference is smaller for longer waves and deeper draft the sloshing will make the velocity measured at a point larger than spatial average velocity and thus makes c f smaller than c f this is especially true when resonant sloshing occurs the values of c f are smaller at l d 6 019 and 12 450 i e t 0 7 s and 1 1 s the two periods at which resonant sloshing occurr the following conclusions can be drawn from fig 14 1 the quadratic loss coefficient c f is not sensitive to wave period 2 the values of c f and c f for long waves are almost the same for both experiment a and experiment b therefore it is possible to use the values of c f obtained for long waves as the average of c f for the tested wave periods 4 2 effects on capture width ratio recall that the pneumatic power extraction is calculated by 31 p o w c 1 n t t 0 t 0 n t s p t v x z t d x d z d t which can be written as 32 p o w c a 0 n t t 0 t 0 n t p t v t d t 1 n t t 0 t 0 n t s p t v x z t d x d z d t again v t is the spatial average velocity and v x z t is the sloshing velocity note that the second term on the right hand side of eq 32 is zero if v x z t is known at every point on the water surface in the experiment v x z t is usually approximated by the value obtained at one location x g z g i e v x z t v x g z g t which is denoted by v g t for simplicity hereinafter therefore the approximate pneumatic power extraction is 33 p o w c a 0 n t t 0 t 0 n t p t v t v g t d t the capture width ratio obtained based on one point measurement is 34 λ d p o w c e i c g d the error introduced by the one point measurement method to the capture width ratio is 35 p o w c p o w c e i c g d a 0 e i c g d n t t 0 t 0 n t p t v g t d t which clearly shows that the sloshing motion will affect the capture width ratio calculated using the local velocity measured at one point inside the owc chamber fig 15 shows a comparison between λ d and λ d for experiments a b and c in general the values of the capture width ratios calculated using the spatial average velocity and the local velocity measured at one point agree well except for the two shortest waves in experiment a for l d 6 0186 t 0 7 s in experiment a λ d is about 20 larger than λ d it is interesting to note that the resonant sloshing at l d 12 450 t 1 1 s does not have a significant influence on the calculated capture width ratio in the next section a method will be proposed to improve the accuracy of the capture width ratio calculated using one point measurement results 4 3 one method to improve the accuracy of the calculated capture width one method to reduce the measurement error in the capture width ratio determined by using the velocity obtained from one wave gauge is to use the pto model given by eq 23 and a constant quadratic loss coefficient determined for long waves because the inertial effect is not important for small owc models tested in wave flume tests xu et al 2016 we can set l g 0 and then the pressure can be written as 36 p t 1 2 c f ρ a v t v t using eq 36 in eq 18 gives 37 p o w c a 0 t t 0 t 0 t p t v t d t 1 2 c f ρ a a 0 t t 0 t 0 t v t 3 d t from eq 36 we have 38 p t 1 2 c f ρ a v t 2 or 39 v t 3 2 2 p t c f ρ a 3 2 using eq 39 in eq 37 gives 40 p o w c 2 a 0 t c f ρ a t 0 t 0 t p t 3 2 d t because the pressure measured in wave flume experiment is not affected by the sloshing motion if we can have a better estimation of c f eq 40 can be used to calculate the capture width ratio for waves that may cause large errors due to the surface sloshing inside the owc chamber we remark that fleming and macfarlane 2017a has suggested the use of air pressure to better calculate the rate of the air flow through the orifice fig 16 shows three comparisons to support the use of eq 40 to calculate the capture width ratio the left panel of fig 16 shows a comparison between the values of the capture width ratios calculated using the spatial average velocity and eq 40 with individual values of c f it can be seen that eq 40 can provide an accurate determination of the capture width ratio if an accurate estimation of c f is available the middle panel of fig 16 shows a comparison between the values of the capture width ratios calculated using eq 40 with individual values of c f and a mean value of c f obtained from the spatial average velocity it can be seen that it is possible to use a constant c f to determine the capture width ratio with good accuracy the right panel of fig 16 shows a comparison between the values of the capture width ratio calculated using eq 40 with a constant c f the mean c f determined from the experimental results for long waves and using eq 31 with the pressure and velocity measurements from respective numerical probes it can be seen that using the mean c f from long waves can improve the estimation of the capture width ratio for short waves such as t 0 7 and 0 8 s therefore it is possible to use the measured pressure and a good estimation of c f to reduce the measurement introduced to the capture width ratio by the one point measurement error because the sloshing motion for longer waves is negligible a mean value of c f can be determined by using wave flume experimental results for long waves using this mean value of c f and the measured pressure in eq 40 we can reduce the error in the measured capture width ratio for short waves 5 conclusions a cfd numerical wave flume was constructed using openfoam cfd library to study a bottom sitting 3d circular owc type wave energy converter the numerical solver was based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with a modified k ω model and a vof method a relaxation zone method was used to generate regular waves and implement wave absorbing boundary condition the numerical model was validated by comparing the numerical results with a set of existing experimental results the validated model was used to understand the surface sloshing inside the owc chamber the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the cfd model was able to reproduce with acceptable accuracy the key measured quantities including the free surface displacements inside and outside the owc chamber the pressure variation inside the owc chamber the quadratic loss coefficient of the pto simulating orifice and the capture width ratio of the owc device indicating that the cfd model and the numerical setup are capable of simulating the key physical processes involved 2 larger measurement errors in the measured quadratic loss coefficient and capture width were found at wave periods 0 7 s and 1 1 s the large measurement errors at these frequencies were found to be caused by spatial non uniformity and the use of a single wave gauge inside the owc chamber even though short wave length also contributed to the large measurement error for wave period 0 7 s the measurement errors found at wave period 1 1 s were due mainly to the enhanced spatial non uniformity cfd simulations revealed that the resonant sloshing inside the owc chamber was the cause for the enhanced spatial non uniformity at these wave periods 3 the resonant sloshing found in the physical model experiment was not excited by the fundamental waves or the higher harmonic locked waves or the nonlinear pto it was excited by the vortex shedding at the sharp edge of the owc chamber 4 the quadratic loss coefficient was found to be weakly dependent on wave period and wave height the capture width ratio can be calculated by using a constant quadratic loss coefficient and the measured air pressure inside the owc pneumatic chamber 5 the capture width ratio for shorter waves and at the periods of resonant sloshing could be determined with acceptable accuracy using the measured air pressure and the quadratic loss coefficients measured for longer waves only one orifice size was examined in this study optimization of the pile owc involves optimizing the orifice size and reducing the vortex strength at the edges of the owc chamber this part of the work will be reported in a

lower edge of the owc chamber does not have a large spatial variation to show this we include here plots showing the vorticity spectra at four locations in the vicinity of the lower edge of the owc chamber skirt the four locations are shown in fig appendix a 1 fig appendix a 1 four locations where where the vorticity spectra are analyzed the transect a a indicates the mirror symmetry plane of the model points s1 s3 are located 1 cm below the lower tip of the owc chamber skirt s1 is on the a a transect s2 is 1 5 cm away from the a a transect s3 is 3 cm away from the a a transect the point s4 is located 1 cm below point s1 fig appendix a 1 as an example fig appendix a 2 shows the spectra of the vorticity component tangential to the outer surface of the owc chamber at the four locations shown in fig appendix a 1 for t 0 7 s comparing the spectra among s1 s2 and s3 reveals that there is a slightly decrease in the vorticity along the lower skirt but the peaks close to the resonant sloshing frequency 2 72 hz persist therefore the tangential components of the vorticity along the tip of the lower skirt do not have large variation comparing the spectra at s 1 and s 4 reveals the same spectrum features even through the spectrum magnitude at the location s 4 is smaller than that at the location s 1 due to the decay of the vorticity we conclude that the vorticity at the location s 1 is representative of the vorticity shed from the lower tip of the owc chamber skirt fig appendix a 2 amplitude spectra of the vorticity component ω z for t 0 7 s showing results sampled at point

for 3 dimensional computational domain the lateral boundaries need to be changed from empty to wall no slip boundary condition for velocity field and zero gradient for α p k ω and ν t 2 the patch representing the surface of the owc model generated by snappyhexmesh needs to be set to wall the glass side walls of the wave flume and the owc model s gloss surface of the stainless steel can be

22942,this study presents a three dimensional numerical simulation of a circular bottom sitting owc device for wave energy extraction the numerical model is based on reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with a modified k ω turbulence model and a volume of fluid method to track the air water surface the numerical model and setup are validated against a set of wave flume experimental results the numerical simulation provides detailed flow field information which allows for an analysis of the spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber and the measurement error associated with it new numerical results show that vortex shedding at the sharp edge of the owc chamber enhances the spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber through a resonant sloshing mechanism the enhanced spatial non uniformity can affect the accuracy of the experimentally determined quantities such as the extraction efficiency of the owc chamber and the characteristics of the power take off device suggestions are also provided to improve the accuracy of the experimentally determined quantities that may be affected by the spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber keywords oscillating water column numerical modeling openfoam resonant sloshing wave energy converter 1 introduction there has been a rise of interest and practice in obtaining clean and renewable energy technology as the global warming issue becomes a concern and the resources of fossil fuels are depleting ocean wave energy is sustainable clean and abundant falnes 2007 compared to other clean energy sources such as solar and wind energy ocean wave energy has less short term variation and can serve as an important part of the clean energy puzzle in order to extract ocean wave energy various types of devices have been proposed falcão 2010 among these devices oscillating water column owc type of wave energy converters wecs are widely tested and investigated mainly due to its robustness in simplicity of wave energy extraction mechanism easy maintenance and potentially high energy capture efficiency a typical owc type wec consists of a semi submerged and semi closed pneumatic chamber referred to as owc chamber and a power take off pto system the bottom of the chamber allows the ocean waves to create an oscillation of the water mass inside the chamber which compresses and expands the air volume above the water surface inside the chamber evans 1978 the fluctuating air pressure in the pneumatic chamber drives a power take off pto turbine which extracts the wave energy into electricity through a generator since the first theoretical work studying the energy extraction and hydrodynamic characteristics of an owc device evans 1978 which treats the air water interface inside the owc chamber as a rigid weightless piston for simplicity a wide range of theoretical and experimental studies have been done to provide better understanding of the hydrodynamic processes involved and to improve the energy extraction efficiency of such devices for example evans 1982 extended the theory of evans 1978 to account for the spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber and sarmento and falcão 1985 examined the effects of the air compressibility in their theoretical study more recently matched eigenfunction expansion methods which are based on linear wave theory have been applied to study owc devices with various geometric configurations evans and porter 1995 martins rivas and mei 2008 lovas et al 2010 deng et al 2013 2014 xu et al 2016 these theoretical studies provide convenient tools to perform frequency domain analysis of owc devices for system optimization at the early stage of the system design process however because these theories are based on linear wave theory and potential flow assumption they are usually not able to address issues related to viscous energy loss i e the energy loss associated with vortex shedding and generation of higher harmonics that may affect the extraction efficiency of the owc devices scaled laboratory experiments can provide observations of some physical processes and help improve the system optimization of owc devices a number of experimental studies on the hydrodynamics and energy extraction of owc devices can be found in the literature existing experimental studies have focused on providing understanding of the wave energy capture efficiency wang et al 2002 he et al 2013 ning et al 2016 xu et al 2016 fleming and macfarlane 2017b vyzikas et al 2017 hydrodynamic characteristics such as vortex shedding wave scattering and the motion responses of floating owc devices rapaka et al 2004 he et al 2013 he and huang 2014 xu et al 2016 ning et al 2016 fleming and macfarlane 2017b prototype owc devices have also been put to test over the last few decades goda et al 1991 boake et al 2002 torre enciso et al 2009 prototype operations have shown that the major challenges in putting owc devices into commercial applications include the high unit cost of generated electricity and low structure survivability under extreme events thorpe 1999 medina lopez et al 2015 it has been widely acknowledged that spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber plays a role in the measurement of owc wave energy capture efficiency many small scale laboratory tests studied two dimensional owc chambers he and huang 2014 bingham et al 2015 ning et al 2016 and used one wave gauge wang et al 2002 simonetti et al 2015 xu et al 2016 to measure the waves inside the owc chambers they studied the use of one wave gauge makes it difficult to accurately determine the mean motion of the air water surface inside the owc chamber he and huang 2017 proposed a method to reconstruct the water surface inside a rectangular shaped owc by using two wave gauges which allows an accurate determination of the water surface inside the owc chamber for three dimensional owc chamber geometries however the use of one or two wave gauges cannot provide enough information to reconstruct the water surface inside the owc chamber as a result the spatial non uniformity in the water surface may affect the accuracy of the measured capture efficiency bingham et al 2015 used two wave gauges inside the owc chamber and examined the spatial non uniformity including sloshing inside the chamber by comparing the measurements of the two wave gauges and visually inspecting the water surface during the experiment some experimental studies have also revealed the spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber via ccd camera recordings ning et al 2016 or piv techniques fleming and macfarlane 2017b vyzikas et al 2017 placed three wave probes in the width direction of the chamber to examine the lateral sloshing effect inside a rectangular owc chamber however systematic discussion on the spatial non uniformity and its effect on the measured capture efficiency in both two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d chamber geometries remains rare xu et al 2016 proposed to use the results provided by a linear frequency domain solver to reduce the effects of the spatial non uniformity on the calculation of the energy capture efficiency and the determination of the pto characteristics as shown in xu et al 2016 the spatial non uniformity is more significant for shorter waves however the generation of higher harmonic waves and their effects cannot be considered in xu et al 2016 s method because of the linear theory used in the analysis in actual laboratory conditions short wave components exist in nonlinear incident waves and may also be generated by the higher harmonic components in the fluctuating air pressure due to a nonlinear pto nonlinear wave wave interaction and the vortices shed from the edges of the owc chamber these higher harmonic waves may resonate with the owc chamber resulting in resonant sloshing mode inside the owc chamber these effects of higher harmonics and viscosity that cannot be addressed by frequency domain solvers can be easily addressed by computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations cfd simulations of wave interaction with an owc device can provide important information about the flow field and the spatial distribution of the water surface inside the owc chamber which is otherwise very difficult to obtain in wave flume tests with the development of cfd methods and computing technology an increasing number of numerical simulations of wave interaction with owc devices can be found in the literature liu et al 2008 used a 2d cfd model to study the oscillation amplitude of the water surface inside the owc chamber and the effect of pto mechanism on the water column oscillation two types of time domain numerical models have been applied to study the wave power extraction efficiency and the hydrodynamic process of owc devices in waves one is based on non linear potential flow theory koo and kim 2010 ning et al 2015 and the other is based on cfd simulations which involves solving the navier stokes equations time domain potential solvers have the advantage of high computational efficiency and are fairly accurate for some problems but viscous effects cannot be modeled explicitly even though non linear potential solvers such as higher order boundary element methods hobem can be modified to include a parametric consideration of viscous loss wang et al 2018 a detailed and comprehensive modeling of viscous effects can only be provided by cfd models zhang et al 2012 performed cfd simulations based on two phase level set and immersed boundary method to study the hydrodynamic performance of a 2d owc device teixeira et al 2013 used a numerical solver based on navier stokes equations and an aerodynamic model in their investigation of optimization of owc devices the open source cfd library openfoam has been used to study bottom fixed 2d owc devices iturrioz et al 2015 simonetti et al 2015 where the turbulence was handled through either a k ω sst model or large eddy simulations les and the air water surface was tracked using the volume of fluid vof method comparisons with experimental data have shown that the openfoam based simulations can reproduce the experiments well in terms of the chamber pressure and free surface elevations measured at single points suggesting the potential of using openfoam based simulations to further study 3d owc devices more recently elhanafi et al 2016 and elhanafi et al 2017a used starccm which is a cfd software package based on reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans and vof method to study various hydrodynamic and energy conversion aspects of two types of 2d owc devices lópez et al 2016 proposed to use an rans vof method in a numerical study aimed at finding optimum pto damping under a given local wave climate elhanafi et al 2017b studied numerically the impact of air compressibility at different model scaling using compressible and incompressible rans vof methods it was found that for the three dimensional owc device studied ignoring air compressibility at full scale could introduce an error of 12 in the estimation of power extraction efficiency all these aforementioned cfd simulations have focused on owc devices with 2d geometries with the exception of elhanafi et al 2017b and the spatial non uniformity of the water surface surface sloshing inside the owc chamber is not the focus of these studies in this study we present a numerical simulation of a 3d bottom sitting owc device and propose a data analysis method to reduce the effects of spatial non uniformity surface sloshing within an owc chamber in the calculation of the capture efficiency and the characteristics of the pto in both the experimental studies and numerical simulations the numerical model used in this study is based on the open source cfd library openfoam with a vof method to track the air water surface and a k ω turbulence closure the 3d owc device is a circular owc pile device tested experimentally by xu et al 2016 the numerical model and the setup of the numerical wave tank are described in section 2 the validation of the numerical model and a systematic discussion on the spatial non uniformity surface sloshing as well as the effect of such non uniformity on the analysis of experimental results are discussed in section 4 together with suggestions for data analysis to reduce the error induced by spatial non uniformity main conclusions are summarized in section 7 1 1 description of the numerical model to facilitate further discussion the coordinate system used in this paper is defined in fig 1 where a sketch of the domain and the coordinate system are shown the x axis is horizontal with its positive direction pointing from the wave maker to the wave absorbing zone the y axis is vertical with its positive direction pointing vertically upward the z axis is horizontal with its positive direction pointing laterally out of the paper 1 2 governing equations the numerical model is based on the open source computational fluid dynamics library openfoam the model employs the 3d incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans as the governing equations for a water air mixture let s be the saturation of water in a particular volume s 0 for the air above the air water surface and s 1 for the water below the air water surface the air water interface is treated as a thin layer of the water air mixture where 0 s 1 the density ρ and the dynamic viscosity μ of the water air mixture are calculated by 1 ρ s ρ w 1 s ρ a 2 μ s μ w 1 s μ a where the subscripts w and a refer to water and air respectively the continuity equation for the water air mixture is 3 u 0 where u is the velocity field of the water air mixture the vector form of the momentum equations is 4 ρ u t ρ u u t ρ g p μ u ρ t σ t κ α where p is the pressure g is the gravitational acceleration σ t is the surface tension constant κ the curvature of the air water interface and t is the specific reynolds stress tensor which needs to be closed by a selected turbulence model rusche 2003 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 in order to track the water air interface we adopt a modified vof method which uses the following phase governing equation 5 s t s u u r s 1 s 0 with u r being an interface compression velocity only present in the water air interface to suppress the diffusive behavior of the interface for more details of this modified interface compressive vof scheme the reader is referred to rusche 2003 the following k ω turbulence model is used to provide a

weller et al 1998 was used to solve these equations with appropriate boundary and initial conditions a finite volume numerical discretization method on unstructured grids was used to discretize the numerical fields the pressure implicit split operator piso see e g ferziger and peric 2012 issa 1986 method was used for the pressure velocity coupling solution a mixed crank nicolson method ferziger and peric 2012 was used for the discretization in the time domain 1 3 the owc model the owc device in this study is a numerical reproduction of the circular owc supported by a c shaped support structure which has been studied experimentally and theoretically by xu et al 2016 the left panel of fig 2 shows a sketch of this owc model which consists of a circular tube section covered on the top by a plate with an orifice in it as the pto mechanism the upper portion of the model is a partially submerged tube forming an owc chamber and the lower portion of the model is a c shaped support structure the overall height of the model is h 0 4 m the height from the bottom to the top of the c shaped support structure is d s 0 244 m the outer diameter of the model is d 0 125 m and the orifice diameter is d o 0 014 m in the wave flume tests conducted by xu et al 2016 the model was made of stainless steel of 3 mm in thickness which is used here in the numerical simulations 1 4 setup of the numerical wave flume referring to fig 1 a three dimensional numerical wave flume of 14 00 m 0 54 m 0 60 m length width height is used to perform all numerical simulations the numerical wave flume consists of three sections the first section from x 0 00 m 4 00 m is the wave generating zone the second section from x 4 00 m 10 00 m is the test zone the third section from x 10 00 m 14 00 m is the wave absorbing zone the boundary conditions of the numerical wave flume are set up to resemble the actual test conditions in the wave flume tests xu et al 2016 i wave inlet boundary conditions are used at x 0 m ii wall boundary conditions are used on the bottom and two lateral boundaries and at x 14 m iii atmospheric boundary condition is used at the top boundary of the computational domain iv the walls of the owc model are set to wall boundaries all wall boundaries are assumed to be hydraulically smooth because the walls of the wave flume in the experiment are made of glass and the walls of the owc model are made of stainless steel as in the wave flume tests xu et al 2016 the numerical owc model is placed at x 7 m and z 0 25 m and three numerical wave gauges g 1 g 2 and g 3 are used to measure the surface displacements inside and outside the owc model the locations of g 1 g 2 and g 3 are shown in fig 1 g 1 is 5 cm away from the outer edge of the model on the up wave side g 2 is inside the owc chamber and 3 7 cm away from the geometrical axis of the owc chamber on the down wave side of the orifice g 3 is 5 cm away from the outer edge of the owc model on the down wave side the pressure gauge is placed 3 7 cm away from the central axis of the orifice on the up wave side of the orifice one numerical pressure gauge is used to measure the air pressure inside the pneumatic chamber the measured air pressure and the surface displacements at these three locations can be used to verify and validate the numerical model 1 5 wave generation and absorption in the present study the wave generation toolbox waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 is implemented to generate monochromatic waves and provide wave absorbing boundaries waves2foam implements a relaxation zone for wave generation on top of the vof based two phase flow solver interfoam see chapter 4 of rusche 2003 more information about the implementation of waves2foam in this study can be found in appendix b the method is based on the relaxation zone concept on a mesh cell located in the prescribed relaxation zone physical quantities have prescribed values that are computed using the following expression 13 ϕ α r ϕ c 1 α r ϕ t where ϕ c is the actual computed value ϕ t is the target value and α r is the relaxation factor defined by 14 α r χ r 1 exp χ r 3 5 1 exp 1 1 with χ r x l r being the location relative to the horizontal length of the relaxation zone and l r the length of the relaxation zone thus it is ensured that at χ r 0 which is the most upstream point α r 0 and ϕ ϕ t and at χ r 1 which is the boundary between relaxation zone and non relaxed zone α r 1 and ϕ ϕ c between these two limits the value of a physical quantity such as u or s is a blend of the computed and target values in this study the target values are obtained from potential wave theory active wave absorption is intrinsically included in the wave generation relaxation zone the relaxation zone method is also used in the wave absorbing zone to reduce wave reflection this can be achieved by setting the target value for u to 0 everywhere in the absorbing zone and setting the target value for s to the calculated value based on the still water line inside the flume the length of the relaxation zone was fixed at 4 m in all simulations which is equivalent to 1 6 to 5 3 wave lengths depending on the incident wave period the reflecting coefficient defined by wave amplitudes of the relaxation zone for the longest waves considered in this study t 1 6 s is 5 which is comparable to the largest reflection coefficient in the wave flume test for shorter waves the reflection coefficient of the relaxation zone is much smaller than 5 1 6 mesh setup we used an unstructured nested mesh to cover the entire computational domain the right panel of fig 2 shows a slice of the mesh in detail in order to reduce the computational load a coarse mesh of resolution 1 64 cm 1 00 cm 5 00 cm δ x δ y δ z was used in the relaxation zones however in the test section away from the model the mesh was refined to a resolution of at least 0 82 cm 1 00 cm 2 50 cm which had been confirmed to be fine enough by comparing the simulation results in an empty flume with second order stokes wave theory in order to accurately track the free surface the mesh within 5 cm around the still water surface was further refined to a resolution of 0 82 cm 0 25 cm 1 25 cm representing about 100 horizontal nodes in one wave length and 8 to 20 vertical nodes covering a single wave length profile of 0 8 s wave period and 2 cm 5 cm wave height in the vicinity of the owc model an even more refined mesh was used to accurately snap the thin walls of the model with a characteristic mesh resolution of 0 205 cm 0 125 cm 0 159 cm an openfoam built in pre processing mesh tool snappyhexmesh was used to deform re size and remove mesh cells according to the geometry of the owc model resulting in two layers of even finer mesh with a characteristic mesh resolution of 0 1 cm 0 1 cm 0 1 cm which closely snaps the surface of the owc model the total cell count of the final mesh is about 1 4 million a the mesh dependence study based on three sets of mesh configurations near the surfaces of the owc model a coarser mesh 1 5 mm 1 5 mm 1 5 mm the present mesh 1 0 mm 1 0 mm x 1 0 mm and a finer mesh 0 5 mm 0 5 mm x 0 5 mm has confirmed that the quadratic loss coefficients obtained using the present mesh have less than 3 difference from those obtained using the finer mesh the present mesh was chosen to achieve a balance between computational cost and accuracy 2 model verification and validation this section presents the model verification and validation using the experimental results reported in xu et al 2016 these experimental results include the surface displacements measured at three locations inside and around the owc model the pressure of the air inside the owc chamber and the calculated capture width and the characteristics of the pto these results were obtained for 29 test conditions a typical simulation of about 20 wave periods takes about one week on a high performance workstation with a total of 20 physical processors dual intel xeon e5 2650 v3 and 128 gb of ddr4 memory 2 1 physical and numerical test conditions table 1 shows a summary of all test conditions used in the model verification and validation these test conditions have been chosen to test the effects of incident wave period water depth and wave height on the owc performance xu et al 2016 the waves generated in the numerical simulations have a maximum difference of 5 in wave height compared to the corresponding waves used in the experiment the wave heights given in table 1 are those used in the physical experiment experiment a and experiment b were designed to test effects of wave period and water depth and experiment c was designed to test effects of wave height 2 2 simulated surface displacement and air pressure inside the owc chamber fig 3 shows sample comparisons of the simulated and measured surface displacements for two locations outside the owc chamber the left panel is for the location g 1 and the right panel is for the location g 3 the left panel of fig 4 shows sample comparisons of the simulated and measured surface displacements for the location g 2 which is inside the owc chamber to quantify the comparison between the measurement and the simulation we use the following normalized root mean square error nrmse as a measure of the closeness between the experiment and the simulation ris et al 1999 15 nrmse 1 o m a x o m i n 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 where o i represents the i t h data point from the experimental observation o m a x and o m i n are the maximum and minimum values occurred in the experimental observation time series used in the analysis and p i represents the data point from the model prediction that corresponds to the observation o i when nrmse 0 a perfect prediction by the simulation is achieved if nrmse 1 0 the root mean square error of the simulated time series is comparable to the variation of the observed time series making the simulation prediction unreliable in figs 3 and 4 the values of nrmse for all comparisons range from 2 18 to 6 86 indicating good agreements between the numerical simulations and the experimental observations the right panel of fig 4 shows comparisons of the simulated and measured variations of the air pressure in the pneumatic chamber the cfd simulation can capture the air pressure variation very well especially the nonlinear features associated with the quadratic nature of the pto a small orifice on the top cover of the pneumatic chamber the good agreement between the simulated and measured surface displacements at three locations and the air pressure inside the pneumatic chamber indicates that the present cfd model and numerical setup can adequately capture the important physical processes involved in the nonlinear wave interaction with the circular owc device because the detailed flow field inside the owc chamber can be provided by the numerical simulation it is possible to address issues that cannot be addressed by wave flume experiments such as surface sloshing and its effects on the extraction efficiency determined using the velocity measured at one point inside the owc chamber 2 3 extraction efficiency the extraction efficiency of a wave energy converter is usually measured by the so called capture width which is defined as the ratio between the absorbed power and the available wave power per meter of wave crest of the incident waves for an owc type wave energy converter the wave power extracted by the device denoted by p o w c is calculated by 16 p o w c 1 n t t 0 t 0 n t s p t v x z t d x d z d t where s is the cross section of the owc chamber p t is the air pressure fluctuation inside the owc chamber v x z t is the local velocity of the oscillation of the water surface inside the owc chamber t 0 is an arbitrary time instance t is the wave period and n is an integer the spatial i e cross sectional average velocity v t is determined by 17 v t 1 a 0 s v x z t d x d z with a 0 being the cross sectional area of the owc pneumatic chamber in terms of v t p o w c can be written as 18 p o w c a 0 n t t 0 t 0 n t p t v t d t therefore the capture width λ can be written as 19 λ p o w c e i c g where the incident wave energy density e i and the group velocity c g are given by 20 e i 1 8 ρ w g h i 2 c g l t 1 2 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h in eqn 20 h is the local water depth ρ w is the density of water h i is the incident wave height l is the wave length and k 2 π l is the wave number the spatial average velocity v t is not obtainable in wave flume experiments usually a limited number of wave gauges are used to measured the surface motion at selected locations in most wave flume tests the spatial average velocity v t is usually approximated by the velocity measured at one single point inside the owc chamber say g 2 in our experiment xu et al 2016 we denote the velocity measured at a single point by v and the pneumatic power extraction calculated using v denoted by p o w c is 21 p o w c a 0 n t t 0 t 0 n t p t v t d t in other words the capture width measured in the experiment is actually λ 22 λ p o w c e i c g the difference between λ and λ is affected by the difference between v and v which reflects the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber for a uniform water surface i e a weightless piston v v and λ λ if there is a surface sloshing we should expect v v and λ λ the capture width is usually normalized by either the wave length lovas et al 2010 martins rivas and mei 2008 or a characteristic dimension of the energy converter xu et al 2016 we choose the diameter of the owc model d to normalize the capture width and refer to λ d as the capture width ratio cwr in this study fig 5 shows a comparison of the capture width ratios obtained from the cfd simulation and the experiment for the three sets of the experiments listed in table 1 it can be seen that the cfd simulation can reproduce the measured capture width ratios λ d very well implying that the present cfd simulation can reproduce satisfactorily both the magnitudes and phases of the air pressure fluctuation and the water surface oscillation inside the owc chamber 2 4 parameterization of the nonlinear pto when using potential flow theory to study wave interaction with an owc device with a quadratic nonlinear pto in frequency domain or time domain a parametrization of the pto is needed in wave flume tests the pto is usually modeled by an orifice which causes a pressure drop between the pneumatic chamber and the surrounding air outside for incompressible air this pressure drop can be modeled by the following equation mei et al 1989 xu et al 2016 23 p t 1 2 c f ρ a v t v t ρ a l g d v t d t where p t is the relative pressure of the air inside the pneumatic chamber ρ a the density of the air v t the spatial average velocity of the water surface oscillation inside the owc chamber c f is a quadratic loss coefficient related to drag effect and l g is an inertial length scale it has been shown that the inertial effect represented by the last term in eq 23 is not important in small scale wave flume tests xu et al 2016 therefore the nonlinear pto can be parametrized by the quadratic loss coefficient c f alone we remark that the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber can introduce significant error in the value of c f determined using eq 23 and the local velocity measured at a single point inside the owc chamber in the wave flume experiment of xu et al 2016 p t was measured by a pressure sensor mounted on the top of the owc pneumatic chamber the surface displacement was measured at one location g 2 inside the owc chamber therefore the spatial average velocity v is not obtainable from the wave flume experiment but approximated by v t the local velocity measured at the location g 2 which itself needs to be calculated using the surface displacement measured at the location g 2 we use c f to denote the quadratic loss coefficient determined by using velocity v 24 p t 1 2 c f ρ a v t v t where the inertial term has been neglected xu et al 2016 the measured and simulated values of c f are shown in fig 6 a satisfactory agreement between the simulation and the experiment can be observed for all test cases the minor difference is due mainly to the minor difference in the local velocity v obtained from the experiment and the simulation 3 spatial non uniformity and resonant sloshing inside the owc chamber because the cross sectional dimension of a typical owc device is smaller than the wave length of design waves the spatial non uniformity in the water surface inside the owc chamber is expected to be stronger for shorter waves than for longer waves using the cfd simulation results we are able to obtain detailed flow information which can help understand factors that affect the spatial non uniformity and reduce the measurement error in the determination of capture width and the characteristics of the pto 3 1 spatial non uniformity inside the owc chamber one way to show the spatial non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber is the spatial distribution of the wave height inside the owc chamber as shown in fig 7 where the wave height is the vertical distance between the local maximum and the local minimum of the surface displacement measured within one wave period because there exists a partial standing wave pattern in front of the c shaped support structure the wave height is larger closer to this reflective boundary both the wave period and the draft of the owc chamber affect the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber shorter waves generally give a stronger spatial non uniformity which is in general agreement with our intuition and the theoretical predictions of xu et al 2016 increasing the draft of the owc chamber reduces the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber because the velocity obtained at a single location is used to represent the spatial averaged velocity there is an error introduced to the calculated capture width λ and the quadratic loss coefficient c f 3 2 spectral analysis of the sloshing motion inside the owc chamber to further understand the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber the simulated surface displacement η x z t is decomposed into two components the cross sectional average and the deviation from this spatial average 25 η x z t η t η x z t where η x z t the sloshing component is the deviation from the cross sectional average component η t the spatial mean component 26 η t 1 a 0 s η x z t d x d z with s being the cross section of the owc chamber by definition 27 s η x z t d x d z 0 in eq 25 η t represents a piston like oscillation inside the owc chamber and η x z t represents the spatial non uniformity superimposed on η t we refer to the motion associated with η as spatial average motion and the motion associated with η x z t as sloshing motion hereinafter in a wave flume experiment the surface displacement is measured at a very limited number of points as a result the spatial average motion η t is not measurable so is the sloshing motion η x z t in their wave flume experiment xu et al 2016 approximated the spatial average motion η t by the surface displacement measured at the location g 2 see fig 1 when the surface displacement is measured at a given point say g 2 in the experiment of xu et al 2016 the harmonic components in the spatial average motion η t and the sloshing motion η t can be studied through an harmonic analysis to understand the relationship between the incident waves and the motion of the air water surface inside the owc chamber we use the simulated data to show the spectral characteristics of the incident waves the spatial average motion and sloshing motion inside the owc chamber we use η t to represent η x g 2 z g 2 t for simplicity hereinafter the incident waves can be expressed as 28 η i 1 2 a f e 2 π i f t d f and the amplitude spectrum of η i t is a f the displacements for the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion can be expressed as 29 η 1 2 b f e 2 π i f t d f η t 1 2 b f e 2 π i f t d f and the amplitude spectra of η t and η x z t are b f and b f respectively the matlab built in fast fourier transfer fft function was used to perform the spectrum analysis in this study the fft analysis was performed only on the stable segment of the signal which consists of several stable waves the length of the signal was carefully chosen so that energy leaking between frequency bins is minimized fig 8 shows the simulated amplitude spectra a f b f and b f for three cases t 0 7 1 1 and 1 6 s selected from experiment a h 0 29 m the surface displacement measured at g 1 is due mainly to wave diffraction it was used to approximate the main features in the incident waves the displacements for the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion are obtained using the surface displacement at the location of g 2 the vertical dashed line at f n 2 717 hz in fig 8 indicates the resonant sloshing frequency of the owc chamber see deng et al 2013 xu et al 2016 which corresponds to a wave length about 1 8 times the diameter of the owc chamber because the higher harmonic locked waves all have the same phase speed as that of the incident fundamental waves i e the second harmonic locked waves have a length that is one half of the length of the first harmonic incident waves and the third harmonic locked waves have a length that is one third of the length of the first harmonic incident waves the resonant sloshing motion discovered by deng et al 2013 and xu et al 2016 is a free standing wave whose phase speed is not locked to that of the incident waves for all three wave periods even though the incident waves have weak second harmonic components the third harmonic components in the incident waves are negligibly small among the three wave periods the incident waves with t 1 6 s have a relatively larger second harmonic component which is about 25 of the amplitude of the first harmonic component refer to the first row in fig 8 for t 0 7 s the amplitude of the first harmonic oscillation in the spatial average motion is slightly smaller than that in the incident waves the first harmonic in the sloshing motion also contributes to the non uniformity of the water surface inside the owc chamber the amplitude of the second harmonic in the spatial average component is negligibly small however it is significantly large in the sloshing component as large as 20 of the amplitude of the first harmonic in the spatial average component we remark here that the second harmonic sloshing motion has a frequency close to the owc s resonant sloshing frequency refer to the second row in fig 8 for t 1 1 s the spatial average motion is dominated by the first harmonic motion which has an amplitude similar to that of the incident waves the sloshing motion is dominated by the third harmonic motion whose frequency is almost identical to that of the owc s resonant sloshing frequency the sloshing motion has a first harmonic component similar to that for t 0 7 s but both the second and fourth harmonic component are small refer to the third row in fig 8 for t 1 6 s in addition to the first harmonic motion the spatial average motion has also a noticeable second harmonic oscillation whose amplitude is larger than that of the incident waves the higher harmonics in the sloshing motion are all weak which is in agreement with the generally accepted conclusion that the water surface acts like a weightless position for longer waves evans 1982 no resonant sloshing occur for longer waves fig 9 shows the simulated amplitude spectra a f b f and b f for three cases t 0 7 1 1 and 1 6 s selected from experiment b h 0 31 m for all three wave periods even though the incident waves have weak second harmonic components the third harmonic components in the incident waves are negligibly small the vertical dashed line at f n 2 717 hz indicates the resonant frequency of the owc chamber see deng et al 2013 xu et al 2016 which corresponds to a wave length about 1 8 times the diameter of the owc chamber for a given design of the owc pile a deeper water depth means a deeper draft or submergence of the owc chamber similar to h 0 29 m the resonant sloshing occurs at the second harmonic for t 0 7 s and the resonant sloshing occurs at the third harmonic for t 1 1 s a comparison of figs 8 and 9 shows that slightly increasing the draft can slightly reduce the first harmonic amplitudes in both the spatial average motion and sloshing motion but can noticeably reduce the higher harmonic amplitudes in the sloshing motion from figs 8 and 9 some important conclusions about the sloshing motion inside the owc chamber can be drawn for t 0 7 s resonant sloshing is excited by a second harmonic forcing for t 1 1 s the resonant sloshing is excited by a third harmonic forcing for t 1 6 s there is no resonant sloshing the excitation forcing that feeds energy into resonant sloshing cannot be the higher harmonic locked waves for two reasons i the third harmonic locked waves in the incident waves for t 1 1 s have a strength too weak to provide enough energy to excite the resonant sloshing ii the resonant sloshing has a wave length about 1 8 times the owc diameter which is much shorter than the lengths of the second and third harmonic locked waves therefore it is not the second or third harmonic locked waves that provide the excitation forcing through wave wave nonlinear interaction other possible nonlinear mechanisms that may be responsible for exciting the resonant sloshing inside the owc chamber are i the air flow through the nonlinear pto and ii vortex shedding because the pto in the experiment was an orifice which has a quadratic relation with the spatial average velocity of the water surface inside the owc chamber the nonlinear pto may play a role in exciting the resonant sloshing vortex shedding at the lower tip of the owc front skirt may perturb the flow field inside the owc chamber and thus may play a role in exciting the resonant sloshing 3 3 sloshing motion in the owc chamber without pto the nonlinear pto described by eq 23 can generate higher harmonic components in the fluctuating air pressure p t it is interesting to know whether or not the higher harmonic sloshing in the owc chamber is related to the nonlinear pto for this purpose another set of cfd simulations were performed with the pto being removed from the top cover so that the owc chamber is fully open to the surrounding air i e the pressure on the water surface is the constant atmospheric pressure figs 10 and 11 show the simulated amplitude spectra of the incident waves the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion for experiment a and experiment b respectively for a fully opened owc the spatial average motion is dominated by the first harmonic oscillation but the sloshing motion is dominated by higher harmonics for t 0 7 s the amplitude of the first harmonic in the spatial average motion is almost two times that of the corresponding incident waves and the sloshing motion is dominated by the second harmonic motion whose amplitude can reach about 60 of the amplitude of the first harmonic in the incident waves the third and fourth harmonic components can also be identified in the sloshing motion for this case the frequency of the second harmonic is close to that of the resonant sloshing note that the third and fourth harmonics are negligibly small in the incident waves compared to the case with a pto the pressure fluctuation inside the owc chamber suppresses the amplitudes of both the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion for t 1 1 s the first harmonic amplitude of the spatial average motion is almost 1 5 times that of the corresponding incident waves and the sloshing motion is dominated by the third harmonic motion whose amplitude can reach about 20 of the first harmonic amplitude of the incident waves the fourth harmonic is also noticeable in the sloshing motion for this case the frequency of the third harmonic sloshing motion is close to that of the resonant sloshing note also that the third and fourth harmonics are negligibly small in the incident waves again compared to the case with a pto the pressure fluctuation inside the pneumatic chamber suppresses the amplitudes of both the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion for t 1 6 s the first harmonic amplitude of the spatial average motion is almost the same as that of the corresponding incident waves but the sloshing motion is not present it can be concluded that the resonant sloshing motion in the owc chamber is not excited by the nonlinear pto even though the resonant sloshing is not excited by the air pressure fluctuation introduced by the nonlinear pto but the nonlinear pto can suppress both the spatial average motion and the sloshing motion through generation of radiated waves 3 4 excitation of resonant sloshing by vortex shedding if the resonant sloshing motion inside the owc chamber is not excited by the nonlinear pto or the higher harmonic wave components in the incoming waves it may be excited by the vortex shedding at the sharp edges of the owc pile wave induced vortex shedding is a viscous nonlinear process to understand the relation between the vortex shedding and the resonant sloshing we examine the spectrum of the computed vorticty fig 12 shows snapshots of the computed magnitudes of the vorticity at four time instants within one wave period for the case of t 1 1 s in experiment a it can be seen that the dominant direction of the vorticity should be tangent to the outer surface of the owc chamber which is z direction at any point on the mirror symmetric plane in the coordinate system used here we chose to use the vorticity at a location on the mirror symmetric plane and 1 cm below the lower tip of the owc chamber skirt this location is representative of the vorticity shed from the lower tip see appendix a the z component of the vorticity vector at a given location ω z t can be written as 30 ω z t 1 2 ω z f e 2 π f t d f we denote the amplitude spectrum of the vorticity ω z t as ω f ω z f fig 13 shows the vorticity spectra at a location 1 cm below the lower skirt of the owc chamber along the central axis for the cases of t 0 7 s t 1 1 s and t 1 6 s in experiment a but without pto i e the owc chamber is fully open to the surrounding air at this location the vorticity component ω z is tangent to the outer surface of the owc chamber the vorticity spectrum for t 0 7 s has four harmonics and the vorticity spectrum for t 1 1 s has three harmonics the vortex shedding can generate fluctuating pressure which can generate free waves of various frequency components for t 0 7 s the second harmonic fluctuation of the vorticity is able to excite the resonant sloshing for t 1 1 s the third harmonic fluctuation of the vorticity is able to excite the resonant sloshing for t 1 6 s no harmonic fluctuation of the vorticity is close to the resonant sloshing frequency to excite the resonant sloshing of course the nonlinear pto will modify the amplitude spectrum of the vorticity through the generation of the radiated waves for the cases of t 0 7 s t 1 1 s and t 1 6 s in experiment b but without pto figures are not shown here conclusions same as those for the corresponding cases in experiment a can be drawn 4 effects of sloshing motion inside the owc chamber due to the lack of a good method to accurately measure the complex 3d motion of the water surface inside the owc chamber wave flume experiments rely on a very limited number of wave gauges to measure the displacements of the water surface at one morris thomas et al 2007 xu et al 2016 ning et al 2016 or two locations he and huang 2014 inside the owc chamber the existence of the surface sloshing inside the owc chamber causes the velocity measured at a single point to be larger than the spatial average velocity and thus affects the experimentally determined capture width ratio and the measured characteristics of the nonlinear pto because the calculation of both needs the spatial average velocity of the water surface inside the owc chamber 4 1 effects on parameterization of the nonlinear pto data fitting using eq 23 to both the laboratory data xu et al 2016 and the simulation data has indicated that for the small scale model as tested the effect of inertia in p t is very small less than 3 and thus negligible fig 14 shows the values of the quadratic loss coefficient obtained using the velocity measured at one point c f and the spatial average velocity c f difference between c f and c f can be observed as expected this difference is smaller for longer waves and deeper draft the sloshing will make the velocity measured at a point larger than spatial average velocity and thus makes c f smaller than c f this is especially true when resonant sloshing occurs the values of c f are smaller at l d 6 019 and 12 450 i e t 0 7 s and 1 1 s the two periods at which resonant sloshing occurr the following conclusions can be drawn from fig 14 1 the quadratic loss coefficient c f is not sensitive to wave period 2 the values of c f and c f for long waves are almost the same for both experiment a and experiment b therefore it is possible to use the values of c f obtained for long waves as the average of c f for the tested wave periods 4 2 effects on capture width ratio recall that the pneumatic power extraction is calculated by 31 p o w c 1 n t t 0 t 0 n t s p t v x z t d x d z d t which can be written as 32 p o w c a 0 n t t 0 t 0 n t p t v t d t 1 n t t 0 t 0 n t s p t v x z t d x d z d t again v t is the spatial average velocity and v x z t is the sloshing velocity note that the second term on the right hand side of eq 32 is zero if v x z t is known at every point on the water surface in the experiment v x z t is usually approximated by the value obtained at one location x g z g i e v x z t v x g z g t which is denoted by v g t for simplicity hereinafter therefore the approximate pneumatic power extraction is 33 p o w c a 0 n t t 0 t 0 n t p t v t v g t d t the capture width ratio obtained based on one point measurement is 34 λ d p o w c e i c g d the error introduced by the one point measurement method to the capture width ratio is 35 p o w c p o w c e i c g d a 0 e i c g d n t t 0 t 0 n t p t v g t d t which clearly shows that the sloshing motion will affect the capture width ratio calculated using the local velocity measured at one point inside the owc chamber fig 15 shows a comparison between λ d and λ d for experiments a b and c in general the values of the capture width ratios calculated using the spatial average velocity and the local velocity measured at one point agree well except for the two shortest waves in experiment a for l d 6 0186 t 0 7 s in experiment a λ d is about 20 larger than λ d it is interesting to note that the resonant sloshing at l d 12 450 t 1 1 s does not have a significant influence on the calculated capture width ratio in the next section a method will be proposed to improve the accuracy of the capture width ratio calculated using one point measurement results 4 3 one method to improve the accuracy of the calculated capture width one method to reduce the measurement error in the capture width ratio determined by using the velocity obtained from one wave gauge is to use the pto model given by eq 23 and a constant quadratic loss coefficient determined for long waves because the inertial effect is not important for small owc models tested in wave flume tests xu et al 2016 we can set l g 0 and then the pressure can be written as 36 p t 1 2 c f ρ a v t v t using eq 36 in eq 18 gives 37 p o w c a 0 t t 0 t 0 t p t v t d t 1 2 c f ρ a a 0 t t 0 t 0 t v t 3 d t from eq 36 we have 38 p t 1 2 c f ρ a v t 2 or 39 v t 3 2 2 p t c f ρ a 3 2 using eq 39 in eq 37 gives 40 p o w c 2 a 0 t c f ρ a t 0 t 0 t p t 3 2 d t because the pressure measured in wave flume experiment is not affected by the sloshing motion if we can have a better estimation of c f eq 40 can be used to calculate the capture width ratio for waves that may cause large errors due to the surface sloshing inside the owc chamber we remark that fleming and macfarlane 2017a has suggested the use of air pressure to better calculate the rate of the air flow through the orifice fig 16 shows three comparisons to support the use of eq 40 to calculate the capture width ratio the left panel of fig 16 shows a comparison between the values of the capture width ratios calculated using the spatial average velocity and eq 40 with individual values of c f it can be seen that eq 40 can provide an accurate determination of the capture width ratio if an accurate estimation of c f is available the middle panel of fig 16 shows a comparison between the values of the capture width ratios calculated using eq 40 with individual values of c f and a mean value of c f obtained from the spatial average velocity it can be seen that it is possible to use a constant c f to determine the capture width ratio with good accuracy the right panel of fig 16 shows a comparison between the values of the capture width ratio calculated using eq 40 with a constant c f the mean c f determined from the experimental results for long waves and using eq 31 with the pressure and velocity measurements from respective numerical probes it can be seen that using the mean c f from long waves can improve the estimation of the capture width ratio for short waves such as t 0 7 and 0 8 s therefore it is possible to use the measured pressure and a good estimation of c f to reduce the measurement introduced to the capture width ratio by the one point measurement error because the sloshing motion for longer waves is negligible a mean value of c f can be determined by using wave flume experimental results for long waves using this mean value of c f and the measured pressure in eq 40 we can reduce the error in the measured capture width ratio for short waves 5 conclusions a cfd numerical wave flume was constructed using openfoam cfd library to study a bottom sitting 3d circular owc type wave energy converter the numerical solver was based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with a modified k ω model and a vof method a relaxation zone method was used to generate regular waves and implement wave absorbing boundary condition the numerical model was validated by comparing the numerical results with a set of existing experimental results the validated model was used to understand the surface sloshing inside the owc chamber the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the cfd model was able to reproduce with acceptable accuracy the key measured quantities including the free surface displacements inside and outside the owc chamber the pressure variation inside the owc chamber the quadratic loss coefficient of the pto simulating orifice and the capture width ratio of the owc device indicating that the cfd model and the numerical setup are capable of simulating the key physical processes involved 2 larger measurement errors in the measured quadratic loss coefficient and capture width were found at wave periods 0 7 s and 1 1 s the large measurement errors at these frequencies were found to be caused by spatial non uniformity and the use of a single wave gauge inside the owc chamber even though short wave length also contributed to the large measurement error for wave period 0 7 s the measurement errors found at wave period 1 1 s were due mainly to the enhanced spatial non uniformity cfd simulations revealed that the resonant sloshing inside the owc chamber was the cause for the enhanced spatial non uniformity at these wave periods 3 the resonant sloshing found in the physical model experiment was not excited by the fundamental waves or the higher harmonic locked waves or the nonlinear pto it was excited by the vortex shedding at the sharp edge of the owc chamber 4 the quadratic loss coefficient was found to be weakly dependent on wave period and wave height the capture width ratio can be calculated by using a constant quadratic loss coefficient and the measured air pressure inside the owc pneumatic chamber 5 the capture width ratio for shorter waves and at the periods of resonant sloshing could be determined with acceptable accuracy using the measured air pressure and the quadratic loss coefficients measured for longer waves only one orifice size was examined in this study optimization of the pile owc involves optimizing the orifice size and reducing the vortex strength at the edges of the owc chamber this part of the work will be reported in a

lower edge of the owc chamber does not have a large spatial variation to show this we include here plots showing the vorticity spectra at four locations in the vicinity of the lower edge of the owc chamber skirt the four locations are shown in fig appendix a 1 fig appendix a 1 four locations where where the vorticity spectra are analyzed the transect a a indicates the mirror symmetry plane of

s4 is located 1 cm below point s1 fig appendix a 1 as an example fig appendix a 2 shows the spectra of the vorticity component tangential to the outer surface of the owc chamber at the four locations shown in fig appendix a 1 for t 0 7 s comparing the spectra among s1 s2 and s3 reveals that there is a slightly decrease in the vorticity along the lower skirt but the peaks close to the resonant sloshing frequency 2 72 hz persist therefore the tangential components of the vorticity along the tip of the lower skirt do not have large variation comparing the spectra at s 1 and s 4 reveals the same spectrum features even through the spectrum magnitude at the location s 4 is smaller than that at the location s 1 due to the decay of the vorticity we conclude that the vorticity at the location s 1 is representative of the vorticity shed from the lower tip of the owc chamber skirt fig appendix a 2 amplitude spectra of the vorticity component ω z for t 0 7 s showing results sampled at point

for 3 dimensional computational domain the lateral boundaries need to be changed from empty to wall no slip boundary condition for velocity field and zero gradient for α p k ω and ν t 2 the patch representing the surface of the owc model generated by snappyhexmesh needs to be set to wall the glass side walls of the wave flume and the owc model s gloss surface of the stainless steel can be

22943,after a long period of crisis and uncertainty the yacht market seems to exit from the tunnel many shipyards are developing new interesting projects especially for vessels over 50 m in length the high intrinsic value of these vessels fosters technical offices to deepen the research on some critical subjects to increase competitiveness the onboard comfort with particular reference to vibrations is probably one of the key aspects of this trend which nowadays drives most of the design choices relatively to structure lay out and materials for interior outfit a great help comes from classification society new rules and regulations for the evaluation of noise and vibration the so called comfort class rules contain the general criteria for noise and vibration measurements in various yacht areas and suggest maximum limit values as a function of the required quality level of the yacht in this paper a study carried out in cooperation between the university of genova and a leading italian shipyard on the dynamic behaviour of superyacht structures is presented a detailed fem analysis of the global and local natural frequencies of a 60 m superyacht was carried out in order to evaluate the reliability of simplified procedures based on reduced numerical models the investigation has been carried out by two different fem codes and the numerical results have been compared with experimental data measured during the construction of the vessel keywords superyacht structures numerical vibration analysis superyacht vibration measurements 1 introduction since its beginning the recreational boat market is driven by different objectives with respect to the traditional merchant ship world after the recent economic crisis a significant recovery seems to take place almost for larger vessels over 50 m in length ivaldi 2015 which is the strength field of italian shipyard industry this leadership stimulated designers to take out again all their creativity in order to give rise to innovative and sometimes provocative projects even if related to some commercial risks this philosophy had the objective to attract potential owners and to go over many competitors at these days as safety and reliability have reached more than satisfactory levels aesthetical and comfort characteristics in addition to eco compatibility issues became the competition front on which the game should be played as a matter of fact till few years ago on board comfort held a secondary position in yacht design often considered as the personal feeling of the designer who didn t worry at all to sacrifice it in advantage of other more remarkable performances for ships and yachts comfort is mainly related to their seakeeping qualities and to the physical consequences that vibrations and noise caused by exciting sources such as propellers engines and wave encounters induce in the crew and passengers at these days comfort became a more objective matter deeply conditioned by class societies rules which suggest impose even more severe and restrictive limit values for vibration and noise levels according to the limits the ship complies with a comfort class will be delivered which considerably rises or lowers its intrinsic value yacht designers and builders are then continuously looking for design procedures and solutions addressed to reduce the impact of vibration and noise sources on the comfort level of their vessels both in the initial phase of the project when it is necessary to have preliminary information about the response of the structure and during construction given the difficulty in intervening in the dynamic behaviour of hull structure after its construction it is extremely important to perform very detailed predictive analyses to identify the natural frequency of the hull and of local structures such as decks and bulkheads then their response to load excitation induced by propellers engines and waves can be determined boote et al 2013a pais et al 2018 this approach is only possible by making use of fem analysis techniques validated by proper experimental measurements carried out on real scale parts of the ship during construction and on the complete ship during the pre delivery sea trials this is the activity which the university of genova by its yacht design department in la spezia is carrying out in cooperation with some of the most important italian yacht builders pais et al 2017 boote et al 2013b boote et al 2013b in this paper a detailed fem analysis of a 60 m superyacht is presented aimed at investigating the natural frequencies of the main steel deck and of the superstructure light alloy decks the numerical results have been compared with experimental data gathered during the vessel construction 2 regulatory state of the art onboard comfort mainly depends on the vibration and noise intensity and frequencies for what vibrations are concerned the subject has been extensively assessed by iso standards 6954 1984 iso 6954 1984 in order to improve the work conditions of merchant ships crew and the comfort level of passenger on board passenger and cruise ships the rules were then developed and renewed into iso 6954 2000 iso 6954 2000 and recently they underwent a further updating with the new iso20283 5 2016 e in 2016 iso 20283 5 2016 which is the reference standard in force at these days the new standard represents a decisive turning point mainly because measurement directives have been decisively simplified and the vibration limits unified most part of the new standard has been fully integrated in comfort rules of many classification societies in the following table 1 the highest r m s values proposed by the new iso 201283 5 in any direction are provided classification societies produce and continuously update their rules for the assessment of comfort levels on board merchant and passenger ships mainly based or complying with correspondent in force iso standards owing to the growing superyacht market and the great interest arising about yacht comfort conditions since 2000 in their comfort rules classification societies inserted specific sections dedicated to pleasure yachts and superyachts all of them are mainly inspired to iso 2000 or iso 2016 standards in the following a list of the most recent ones in force at these days is reported american bureau of ships

classification of yachts designed for commercial use rina s p a genova italy 2016 registro italiano navale 2016 3 structural vibrations as already said in the previous paragraphs vibrations are the dynamic response of the hull structures to exciting forces mainly represented by propeller and engine rotation in the range of higher frequencies and by wave encounter in the range of lower ones the response mainly depends on the stiffness distribution along the hull structure the focus point of any structural analysis is always to avoid any resonance phenomena between the forcing sources and the hull natural frequencies at both global and local level for what the global case is concerned it is quite impossible to apply any corrective action after the vessel construction thus it is mandatory to carry out detailed analyses at the design stage the simplified approach based on variable section beams with concentrated masses remains a simple and valuable tool for the calculation of the first natural frequencies of the hull in the preliminary stage of the project nevertheless the current trend in the yacht general arrangements requires large openings in the hull such as aft and side garage doors balconies and deck passages generally positioned in asymmetric way this aspect considerably complicates the dynamic behaviour of the hull which should be evaluated by using more sophisticated analysis tools the only way to obtain reliable results consists in fem structural analysis as a matter of fact the hull natural frequencies are very low and far from the frequencies of usual excitation forces fig 1 in terms of local vibrations the most critical areas are represented by decks bulkheads and superstructures pinea and marchesini 2014 their higher natural frequencies make them more sensitive to resonance induced not only by propellers and main engines but also by electric generators and bow thrusters while internal combustion engines such as main propulsor and generators are sufficiently isolated from structures by resilient mountings it is not possible to avoid propeller excitation caused by the pressure field generated by blades passing close to the aft vault in this regards aft and central parts are the most exposed areas of the hull the bow thruster should be considered as well even if excitation forces are of minor intensity the harmonics of main propeller dynamic forces corresponds to their blade passing frequency bpf equal to the number of blades times shaft rpm this parameter is not a constant depending on yacht speed and operating conditions for medium large size yachts blade passing frequencies could be between 15 and 20 hz at cruise speed condition and up to 30 40 hz at maximum speed in case of bow thruster the blade passing frequency bt is much higher than bpf over 50 hz and it mainly affects the fore part of the vessel only fig 2 in this frequency range the use of fem can be considered reliable blanchet and caillet 2014 to avoid deck resonance the designer should keep first natural frequencies far enough from propeller bpf in the most frequent operative conditions in case of possible proximity the only possible action is to increase the structure stiffness with a consequent weight increase for what superstructures are concerned the problem is less critical because of the higher distance from propellers and consequently of the lower exciting forces however large spans of unsupported decks lower their natural frequencies requiring the installation of additional pillars which are never welcome by architects because of their interference with internal spaces often it becomes nearly impossible to keep natural frequencies higher than bpf and the only solution is to remain well below the cruise speed bpf even in this case a detailed fem analysis is the only way to identify critical areas and to select in advance possible solutions nevertheless it is unavoidable that every action aiming at reducing structure vibration will lead to an increase in the hull weight it has been estimated that for a superyacht in the range between 90 and 100 m the weight increase to reduce vibrations is more than 100 tons roy et al 2011 the purpose of this work is to present the complete analysis procedure to verify the low frequency dynamic behaviour of superstructure decks of a superyacht built in aluminium light alloy l a the aft parts of the upper deck and the sun deck have a considerable overhang that in conjunction with the lower stiffness of l a may cause annoying vibrations as they have natural frequencies close to the frequencies of the propeller exciting forces in the first phase of the analysis after a detailed modelling of the yacht structures the natural frequencies of superstructures have been determined by using two different general purpose fem codes the calculation results were compared between the two fem codes and then with the results of a measurements campaign carried out on the vessel during construction described in section 6 in order to verify their reliability 4 fem modelling a three deck superyacht 60 m in length under construction in an italian shipyard has been assumed as study case the ship has a steel hull and aluminium superstructures longitudinally framed with web frame at intervals of 1200 mm the hull presents many openings for tender recovering and balconies making very difficult a preliminary simplified analysis by the simple beam varying section analytical approach for this reason a fem investigation represented the only way to assess the dynamic behaviour of the vessel thanks to the shipyard cooperation all the construction drawings were made available for the investigation making it possible to realize very accurate numerical models in order to check the analysis reliability independently from the numerical codes two general purpose fem packages ansys swanson analysis system inc 2011 and msc nastran 2018 have been used they have been chosen because already in use in the naval architecture section of the diten department for both educational and research purposes given the high amount of calculation time needed for dynamic analyses the aim of this first part of the study was to investigate the influence of different schematizations in terms of both model dimensions and mesh refinement on the result reliability in a second phase of the investigation the attention has been focused on the comparison of the results gathered on a complete numerical model of the whole ship with the results obtained by studying only a portion of the ship where vibration problems could be more critical this second study could offer significant advantages in terms of calculation time especially when transient analysis is to be carried out the first phase of the work consisted in the creation of two complete numerical models of the 60 m yacht one by ansys and one by nastran code without taking advantage of any structural symmetry the hull geometry was created in accordance to the block assembly scheme fig 3 used by the shipyard for the yacht construction and starting from constructive drawings made available by the shipyard technical office fig 4 a in ansys code the mesh was created using shell63 elements of the ansys library for plating and main reinforcements such as keelsons floors and girders for secondary stiffeners such as longitudinals simple beam44 elements have been selected to keep the model dimension as low as possible the mass and loads of the main deck and the two superstructure decks have been modelled by surf154 elements which are particularly suitable for dynamic analyses in a similar manner in the case of msc nastran numerical model the mesh was created using linear 4 node shell elements based on the reissner mindlin theory nastran 2018 for plating and main reinforcements for secondary stiffeners linear 2 node beam elements have been preferred in order to keep the number of dof to a minimum without any sensible effect on the final results sensitivity tests have been carried out with both codes on a reference model represented by a portion of the aft bottom structure block highlighted in black in fig 3 and shown in detail in fig 4a b c for both ansys and nastran models all blocks have been carefully schematised and before assembling them into the global model accurately meshed and tested a good compromise between structure definition and mesh weight was obtained with an average panel diagonal around 300 mm fig 4 b and fig 4 c the mesh size has a strict relation to the maximum frequency that has to be analysed by considering that a wavelength can be correctly simulated only by 5 nodes a mesh size of 300 mm can adequately represent a frequency range up to 40 hz that is the aim of this research a further check has been carried out by assembling the blocks into three parts corresponding to the stern centre and fore portion of the vessel excluding minor details such as brackets and bars all components and details have been included in the two schematisations in total the numerical model figures are ansys complete model 263000 nodes and 365000 elements see fig 5 a fig 5 b fig 5 c fig 5 d nastran complete model 250000 nodes and 340900 elements see fig 6 a fig 6 b fig 6 c fig 6 d calculations have been carried out for different model configurations in order to evaluate the influence that each case can have on results the following cases have been investigated two complete models with different outfitting conditions model a complete model of hull and superstructures in this case only steel and aluminium structures has been considered without any kind of outfitting no outfitting n o case model b complete model of hull and superstructures including the weight of outfitting and machineries with outfitting w o case two partial models stern part model c partial model extended from approximately midship section to stern in this model no outfitting components have been included only steel and aluminium structures has been modelled n o model d same numerical model as case c but with outfitting and machinery weights w o six single deck numerical models model e main deck single model n o the model includes the hull structures from bottom to main deck model f main deck single model w o model g upper deck single model n o model h upper deck single model w o model i sun deck single model n o model l upper deck single model w o the six numerical models e l have been used to compare the fem results with the experimental measurements carried out on the same parts during construction in the shed and in the same work advancement practically consisting in only steel and l a structures to reproduce the outfitting weight on each deck a distributed consistent load has been applied corresponding to the finishing and outfit weight about 300 n m2 on the main deck the concentrated load of the tender crane in the garage and of the tender itself have been considered as well the c and d numerical models have been constrained in correspondence of the engine room fore bulkhead all nodes located on this section have been completely clamped thus forcing the structure to behave as a cantilever see fig 7 a as constraints are located far enough from the area of interest their effect on the results is negligible the same solution has been assumed for single deck models in fig 7b and c the upper and sun deck constraint schemes are shown 5 modal analysis initially the calculation of the first vibration modes of the complete hull has been carried out in order to make a comparison with the available data gathered on other similar vessels the natural frequencies of the complete model have been determined by modal analysis the lanczos mode extraction method has been employed in both ansys and nastran codes this solver is particularly suitable for large shell models in the case of the model with outfit w o the water added mass has been applied to the numerical model by considering a mass increase equal to the 80 of the total displacement in the ansys models the hydrodynamic added mass has been simulated in msc nastran by using the mfluid card as better explained in pais 2017 this method distributes a set of sources over the outer boundary each producing a simple solution to the laplace equation in a simplified potential flow scheme by matching the assumed known boundary motions to the effective motion caused by the sources a linear matrix equation for the magnitude of the sources is solved the values of the sources determine the effective pressures and thereby the forces on the grid points that is transformed in a virtual mass matrix this method has a limitation due to the fact that is not frequency dependent but it can estimate a realistic added mass value without any cfd computation the first analysis has been run to obtain the first hull natural frequency see fig 8 the attained results were found to be in accordance with the typical natural frequency of similar yachts built by the same shipyard see table 2 after that attention has been focused on other local modes which can be critical with regard to possible resonance phenomena induced by propellers or main engines as expected the most significant vibration modes were found to take place on the main deck and on the superstructure decks in table 3 the most significant natural frequencies calculated on the two models a and b are reported the displacement plot of the first natural frequency of the three decks are shown in fig 9 a b c for ansys model and in fig 10 a b c for nastran one these plots are useful to identify other local vibration modes taking place at the same frequency as it is possible to see from the plots the local modes resulting from the two code analyses matches very well each other with the only exception of the upper deck of the ansys model which shows a number of other minor local vibrations it should be noted that sometimes it s very difficult to recognize particular local mode frequencies because there are many values very close each other same calculations carried out for the global models have been repeated on c and d partial models and the obtained results are summarised in table 3 as it is possible to see the results matches very well with those of the global a and b models the displacement plots of the first natural frequency of the three decks ansys and nastran d models are shown in fig 11 a b c and in fig 12 a b c respectively in this case the deck frequencies are more clear let s say more isolated with respect to the complete model also in the case of the upper deck model of ansys analysis finally the natural frequencies of decks were calculated on the single deck partial models with and without outfitting e f g h i and l models the results of which are summarised in table 4 the displacement plots of models with outfitting f h and l are shown in fig 13 a b c c and in fig 14 a b c as it is possible to see from table 4 also for partial models the results matches very well between the two codes in terms of natural frequencies also the local modes shown in the plots are clearly identifiable and comparable this last aspect gives to the analysis a good reliability level further confirmed by the experimental measurements presented in the next paragraph 6 experimental measurements during the yacht construction when the work progress and yard conditions made it possible real scale measurements of the natural frequencies on partial structures and on the complete hull have been carried out in order to make a comparison with the fem results previously attained the tests refers to different phases of the vessel construction the complete steel hull without superstructures and any kind of outfitting in the shed some parts of light alloy superstructures before assembling in the shed the complete hull with assembled superstructures and without outfitting in the shed the complete vessel during open sea trials the test facility used for the tests consists of a four channels analyser soundbook system with the acquisitions software sinus

of bees wax in case of light alloy decks the excitation devices are instrumented impulse hammers pcb impact hammer with different weights from 3 to 15 kg as a function of the type and dimension of the structure to be tested other greater steel masses have been used accordingly fig 15 a and b c the same instrumentation has been used for other measurements campaigns carried out in cooperation with rina s p a on superyachts vibration analysis vergassola et al 2018 boote et al 2017a vergassola and boote 2018 measurements have been carried out on partial structures blocks as they were based on the shed floor by a system of steel struts as that illustratively represented in fig 16 obviously this support scheme represents a very different constraint condition with respect to that assumed in previous fem calculations reported in table 4 in order to make the comparison possible between experimental and numerical results the partial fem models without outfitting e g and i have been modified for what constraint conditions are concerned by reproducing the same support system the correspondent blocks had in the shed during the tests see fig 17 the ansys and nastran modified models renamed as e g and i have been run and the first mode plots only nastran results as an example are shown in fig 18 a b c the real scale measurements have been performed by positioning accelerometers in some points of the deck area to individuate the point of maximum deflection after that accelerometers have been repositioned accordingly and the measurements repeated obtaining the final results reported in table 5 together with fem results for an easier comparison the numerical and experimental results show a good agreement with the exception of the sun deck for which the real scale measurements seems to be much lower this is probably due to the temperature effect inside the shed which at the time the measurements have been collected was over 40 this can cause anomalous deflection of the light alloy block boote et al 2017b with possible consequences of its stiffness and on vibration modes another possible cause of difference between numerical and experimental results can be ascribed to the presence of workers and people involved in the trials their weight and position cannot be simulated the weight of additional non structural material inside the hull and on the main deck when the yacht has been completed and launched a final testing campaign has been carried out during the sea trials before her delivery the dynamic behaviour of the hull structure has been measured by distributing accelerometers along the hull to individuate global natural frequencies after that accelerometers have been positioned on the three investigated decks in correspondence of the maximum deflection points individuated by the fem analysis the results obviously refers to the yacht with the complete outfit and with added mass even if this last aspect does not affect the local vibration modes of decks in table 6 the results for all models and measurements are presented in order to compare them to each other in terms of both outfit or non outfit schematisation the results show that if models are properly refined partial models can be as reliable as full models this could be very useful for reducing fem analysis time especially when only local modes are of interest in comparing fem results with experimental measurements good agreement exists for main and upper deck cases 7 conclusions in this paper the results of a numerical experimental research carried out on yacht comfort in cooperation with an italian shipyard have been presented a calculation procedure to preventively determine hull vibrations which can be problematic for crew and passenger comfort has been set up and then applied to a case study consisting in a 60 m steel yacht with light alloy superstructures the dynamic behaviour of the same vessel has been constantly monitored during the various construction phases different fem models of the reference yacht have been set up by two multipurpose fem codes with the aim of identifying the natural frequencies of local structures such as bulkheads main deck and aluminium super structure decks the results of this first modal analysis has been validated by real scale measurements carried out on the hull structures during construction the objective of this part of the investigation was to verify the reliability of numerical models with different refinement levels starting from single parts of the hull structure moving to more complete ones up to the global model of the yacht all the models have been analysed with and without outfitting as confirmed by the analysis results if models are properly refined the results gathered on partial models can be as reliable as global models this approach is very useful to reduce fem analysis time especially when only local vibration modes are of interest at present a more complex part of the research is under course in the field of transient analysis in order to verify the effect of propeller excitation forces on the structural dynamic behaviour and in particular if the structural response remains or not within the new cs rule limits acknowledgements authors want to acknowledge mr angelo tonelli from rina spa for his kind availability and support 
22943,after a long period of crisis and uncertainty the yacht market seems to exit from the tunnel many shipyards are developing new interesting projects especially for vessels over 50 m in length the high intrinsic value of these vessels fosters technical offices to deepen the research on some critical subjects to increase competitiveness the onboard comfort with particular reference to vibrations is probably one of the key aspects of this trend which nowadays drives most of the design choices relatively to structure lay out and materials for interior outfit a great help comes from classification society new rules and regulations for the evaluation of noise and vibration the so called comfort class rules contain the general criteria for noise and vibration measurements in various yacht areas and suggest maximum limit values as a function of the required quality level of the yacht in this paper a study carried out in cooperation between the university of genova and a leading italian shipyard on the dynamic behaviour of superyacht structures is presented a detailed fem analysis of the global and local natural frequencies of a 60 m superyacht was carried out in order to evaluate the reliability of simplified procedures based on reduced numerical models the investigation has been carried out by two different fem codes and the numerical results have been compared with experimental data measured during the construction of the vessel keywords superyacht structures numerical vibration analysis superyacht vibration measurements 1 introduction since its beginning the recreational boat market is driven by different objectives with respect to the traditional merchant ship world after the recent economic crisis a significant recovery seems to take place almost for larger vessels over 50 m in length ivaldi 2015 which is the strength field of italian shipyard industry this leadership stimulated designers to take out again all their creativity in order to give rise to innovative and sometimes provocative projects even if related to some commercial risks this philosophy had the objective to attract potential owners and to go over many competitors at these days as safety and reliability have reached more than satisfactory levels aesthetical and comfort characteristics in addition to eco compatibility issues became the competition front on which the game should be played as a matter of fact till few years ago on board comfort held a secondary position in yacht design often considered as the personal feeling of the designer who didn t worry at all to sacrifice it in advantage of other more remarkable performances for ships and yachts comfort is mainly related to their seakeeping qualities and to the physical consequences that vibrations and noise caused by exciting sources such as propellers engines and wave encounters induce in the crew and passengers at these days comfort became a more objective matter deeply conditioned by class societies rules which suggest impose even more severe and restrictive limit values for vibration and noise levels according to the limits the ship complies with a comfort class will be delivered which considerably rises or lowers its intrinsic value yacht designers and builders are then continuously looking for design procedures and solutions addressed to reduce the impact of vibration and noise sources on the comfort level of their vessels both in the initial phase of the project when it is necessary to have preliminary information about the response of the structure and during construction given the difficulty in intervening in the dynamic behaviour of hull structure after its construction it is extremely important to perform very detailed predictive analyses to identify the natural frequency of the hull and of local structures such as decks and bulkheads then their response to load excitation induced by propellers engines and waves can be determined boote et al 2013a pais et al 2018 this approach is only possible by making use of fem analysis techniques validated by proper experimental measurements carried out on real scale parts of the ship during construction and on the complete ship during the pre delivery sea trials this is the activity which the university of genova by its yacht design department in la spezia is carrying out in cooperation with some of the most important italian yacht builders pais et al 2017 boote et al 2013b boote et al 2013b in this paper a detailed fem analysis of a 60 m superyacht is presented aimed at investigating the natural frequencies of the main steel deck and of the superstructure light alloy decks the numerical results have been compared with experimental data gathered during the vessel construction 2 regulatory state of the art onboard comfort mainly depends on the vibration and noise intensity and frequencies for what vibrations are concerned the subject has been extensively assessed by iso standards 6954 1984 iso 6954 1984 in order to improve the work conditions of merchant ships crew and the comfort level of passenger on board passenger and cruise ships the rules were then developed and renewed into iso 6954 2000 iso 6954 2000 and recently they underwent a further updating with the new iso20283 5 2016 e in 2016 iso 20283 5 2016 which is the reference standard in force at these days the new standard represents a decisive turning point mainly because measurement directives have been decisively simplified and the vibration limits unified most part of the new standard has been fully integrated in comfort rules of many classification societies in the following table 1 the highest r m s values proposed by the new iso 201283 5 in any direction are provided classification societies produce and continuously update their rules for the assessment of comfort levels on board merchant and passenger ships mainly based or complying with correspondent in force iso standards owing to the growing superyacht market and the great interest arising about yacht comfort conditions since 2000 in their comfort rules classification societies inserted specific sections dedicated to pleasure yachts and superyachts all of them are mainly inspired to iso 2000 or iso 2016 standards in the following a list of the most recent ones in force at these days is reported american bureau of ships

dynamic response of the hull structures to exciting forces mainly represented by propeller and engine rotation in the range of higher frequencies and by wave encounter in the range of lower ones the response mainly depends on the stiffness distribution along the hull structure the focus point of any structural analysis is always to avoid any resonance phenomena between the forcing sources and the hull natural frequencies at both global and local level for what the global case is concerned it is quite impossible to apply any corrective action after the vessel construction thus it is mandatory to carry out detailed analyses at the design stage the simplified approach based on variable section beams with concentrated masses remains a simple and valuable tool for the calculation of the first natural frequencies of the hull in the preliminary stage of the project nevertheless the current trend in the yacht general arrangements requires large openings in the hull such as aft and side garage doors balconies and deck passages generally positioned in asymmetric way this aspect considerably complicates the dynamic behaviour of the hull which should be evaluated by using more sophisticated analysis tools the only way to obtain reliable results consists in fem structural analysis as a matter of fact the hull natural frequencies are very low and far from the frequencies of usual excitation forces fig 1 in terms of local vibrations the most critical areas are represented by decks bulkheads and superstructures pinea and marchesini 2014 their higher natural frequencies make them more sensitive to resonance induced not only by propellers and main engines but also by electric generators and bow thrusters while internal combustion engines such as main propulsor and generators are sufficiently isolated from structures by resilient mountings it is not possible to avoid propeller excitation caused by the pressure field generated by blades passing close to the aft vault in this regards aft and central parts are the most exposed areas of the hull the bow thruster should be considered as well even if excitation forces are of minor intensity the harmonics of main propeller dynamic forces corresponds to their blade passing frequency bpf equal to the number of blades times shaft rpm this parameter is not a constant depending on yacht speed and operating conditions for medium large size yachts blade passing frequencies could be between 15 and 20 hz at cruise speed condition and up to 30 40 hz at maximum speed in case of bow thruster the blade passing frequency bt is much higher than bpf over 50 hz and it mainly affects the fore part of the vessel only fig 2 in this frequency range the use of fem can be considered reliable blanchet and caillet 2014 to avoid deck resonance the designer should keep first natural frequencies far enough from propeller bpf in the most frequent operative conditions in case of possible proximity the only possible action is to increase the structure stiffness with a consequent weight increase for what superstructures are concerned the problem is less critical because of the higher distance from propellers and consequently of the lower exciting forces however large spans of unsupported decks lower their natural frequencies requiring the installation of additional pillars which are never welcome by architects because of their interference with internal spaces often it becomes nearly impossible to keep natural frequencies higher than bpf and the only solution is to remain well below the cruise speed bpf even in this case a detailed fem analysis is the only way to identify critical areas and to select in advance possible solutions nevertheless it is unavoidable that every action aiming at reducing structure vibration will lead to an increase in the hull weight it has been estimated that for a superyacht in the range between 90 and 100 m the weight increase to reduce vibrations is more than 100 tons roy et al 2011 the purpose of this work is to present the complete analysis procedure to verify the low frequency dynamic behaviour of superstructure decks of a superyacht built in aluminium light alloy l a the aft parts of the upper deck and the sun deck have a considerable overhang that in conjunction with the lower stiffness of l a may cause annoying vibrations as they have natural frequencies close to the frequencies of the propeller exciting forces in the first phase of the analysis after a detailed modelling of the yacht structures the natural frequencies of superstructures have been determined by using two different general purpose fem codes the calculation results were compared between the two fem codes and then with the results of a measurements campaign carried out on the vessel during construction described in section 6 in order to verify their reliability 4 fem modelling a three deck superyacht 60 m in length under construction in an italian shipyard has been assumed as study case the ship has a steel hull and aluminium superstructures longitudinally framed with web frame at intervals of 1200 mm the hull presents many openings for tender recovering and balconies making very difficult a preliminary simplified analysis by the simple beam varying section analytical approach for this reason a fem investigation represented the only way to assess the dynamic behaviour of the vessel thanks to the shipyard cooperation all the construction drawings were made available for the investigation making it possible to realize very accurate numerical models in order to check the analysis reliability independently from the numerical codes two general purpose fem packages ansys swanson analysis system inc 2011 and msc nastran 2018 have been used they have been chosen because already in use in the naval architecture section of the diten department for both educational and research purposes given the high amount of calculation time needed for dynamic analyses the aim of this first part of the study was to investigate the influence of different schematizations in terms of both model dimensions and mesh refinement on the result reliability in a second phase of the investigation the attention has been focused on the comparison of the results gathered on a complete numerical model of the whole ship with the results obtained by studying only a portion of the ship where vibration problems could be more critical this second study could offer significant advantages in terms of calculation time especially when transient analysis is to be carried out the first phase of the work consisted in the creation of two complete numerical models of the 60 m yacht one by ansys and one by nastran code without taking advantage of any structural symmetry the hull geometry was created in accordance to the block assembly scheme fig 3 used by the shipyard for the yacht construction and starting from constructive drawings made available by the shipyard technical office fig 4 a in ansys code the mesh was created using shell63 elements of the ansys library for plating and main reinforcements such as keelsons floors and girders for secondary stiffeners such as longitudinals simple beam44 elements have been selected to keep the model dimension as low as possible the mass and loads of the main deck and the two superstructure decks have been modelled by surf154 elements which are particularly suitable for dynamic analyses in a similar manner in the case of msc nastran numerical model the mesh was created using linear 4 node shell elements based on the reissner mindlin theory nastran 2018 for plating and main reinforcements for secondary stiffeners linear 2 node beam elements have been preferred in order to keep the number of dof to a minimum without any sensible effect on the final results sensitivity tests have been carried out with both codes on a reference model represented by a portion of the aft bottom structure block highlighted in black in fig 3 and shown in detail in fig 4a b c for both ansys and nastran models all blocks have been carefully schematised and before assembling them into the global model accurately meshed and tested a good compromise between structure definition and mesh weight was obtained with an average panel diagonal around 300 mm fig 4 b and fig 4 c the mesh size has a strict relation to the maximum frequency that has to be analysed by considering that a wavelength can be correctly simulated only by 5 nodes a mesh size of 300 mm can adequately represent a frequency range up to 40 hz that is the aim of this research a further check has been carried out by assembling the blocks into three parts corresponding to the stern centre and fore portion of the vessel excluding minor details such as brackets and bars all components and details have been included in the two schematisations in total the numerical model figures are ansys complete model 263000 nodes and 365000 elements see fig 5 a fig 5 b fig 5 c fig 5 d nastran complete model 250000 nodes and 340900 elements see fig 6 a fig 6 b fig 6 c fig 6 d calculations have been carried out for different model configurations in order to evaluate the influence that each case can have on results the following cases have been investigated two complete models with different outfitting conditions model a complete model of hull and superstructures in this case only steel and aluminium structures has been considered without any kind of outfitting no outfitting n o case model b complete model of hull and superstructures including the weight of outfitting and machineries with outfitting w o case two partial models stern part model c partial model extended from approximately midship section to stern in this model no outfitting components have been included only steel and aluminium structures has been modelled n o model d same numerical model as case c but with outfitting and machinery weights w o six single deck numerical models model e main deck single model n o the model includes the hull structures from bottom to main deck model f main deck single model w o model g upper deck single model n o model h upper deck single model w o model i sun deck single model n o model l upper deck single model w o the six numerical models e l have been used to compare the fem results with the experimental measurements carried out on the same parts during construction in the shed and in the same work advancement practically consisting in only steel and l a structures to reproduce the outfitting weight on each deck a distributed consistent load has been applied corresponding to the finishing and outfit weight about 300 n m2 on the main deck the concentrated load of the tender crane in the garage and of the tender itself have been considered as well the c and d numerical models have been constrained in correspondence of the engine room fore bulkhead all nodes located on this section have been completely clamped thus forcing the structure to behave as a cantilever see fig 7 a as constraints are located far enough from the area of interest their effect on the results is negligible the same solution has been assumed for single deck models in fig 7b and c the upper and sun deck constraint schemes are shown 5 modal analysis initially the calculation of the first vibration modes of the complete hull has been carried out in order to make a comparison with the available data gathered on other similar vessels the natural frequencies of the complete model have been determined by modal analysis the lanczos mode extraction method has been employed in both ansys and nastran codes this solver is particularly suitable for large shell models in the case of the model with outfit w o the water added mass has been applied to the numerical model by considering a mass increase equal to the 80 of the total displacement in the ansys models the hydrodynamic added mass has been simulated in msc nastran by using the mfluid card as better explained in pais 2017 this method distributes a set of sources over the outer boundary each producing a simple solution to the laplace equation in a simplified potential flow scheme by matching the assumed known boundary motions to the effective motion caused by the sources a linear matrix equation for the magnitude of the sources is solved the values of the sources determine the effective pressures and thereby the forces on the grid points that is transformed in a virtual mass matrix this method has a limitation due to the fact that is not frequency dependent but it can estimate a realistic added mass value without any cfd computation the first analysis has been run to obtain the first hull natural frequency see fig 8 the attained results were found to be in accordance with the typical natural frequency of similar yachts built by the same shipyard see table 2 after that attention has been focused on other local modes which can be critical with regard to possible resonance phenomena induced by propellers or main engines as expected the most significant vibration modes were found to take place on the main deck and on the superstructure decks in table 3 the most significant natural frequencies calculated on the two models a and b are reported the displacement plot of the first natural frequency of the three decks are shown in fig 9 a b c for ansys model and in fig 10 a b c for nastran one these plots are useful to identify other local vibration modes taking place at the same frequency as it is possible to see from the plots the local modes resulting from the two code analyses matches very well each other with the only exception of the upper deck of the ansys model which shows a number of other minor local vibrations it should be noted that sometimes it s very difficult to recognize particular local mode frequencies because there are many values very close each other same calculations carried out for the global models have been repeated on c and d partial models and the obtained results are summarised in table 3 as it is possible to see the results matches very well with those of the global a and b models the displacement plots of the first natural frequency of the three decks ansys and nastran d models are shown in fig 11 a b c and in fig 12 a b c respectively in this case the deck frequencies are more clear let s say more isolated with respect to the complete model also in the case of the upper deck model of ansys analysis finally the natural frequencies of decks were calculated on the single deck partial models with and without outfitting e f g h i and l models the results of which are summarised in table 4 the displacement plots of models with outfitting f h and l are shown in fig 13 a b c c and in fig 14 a b c as it is possible to see from table 4 also for partial models the results matches very well between the two codes in terms of natural frequencies also the local modes shown in the plots are clearly identifiable and comparable this last aspect gives to the analysis a good reliability level further confirmed by the experimental measurements presented in the next paragraph 6 experimental measurements during the yacht construction when the work progress and yard conditions made it possible real scale measurements of the natural frequencies on partial structures and on the complete hull have been carried out in order to make a comparison with the fem results previously attained the tests refers to different phases of the vessel construction the complete steel hull without superstructures and any kind of outfitting in the shed some parts of light alloy superstructures before assembling in the shed the complete hull with assembled superstructures and without outfitting in the shed the complete vessel during open sea trials the test facility used for the tests consists of a four channels analyser soundbook system with the acquisitions software sinus

light alloy block boote et al 2017b with possible consequences of its stiffness and on vibration modes another possible cause of difference between numerical and experimental results can be ascribed to the presence of workers and people involved in the trials their weight and position cannot be simulated the weight of additional non structural material inside the hull and on the main deck when

22944,a constrained interpolation profile cip based multi phase numerical viscous wave flume was constructed to investigate extremely nonlinear interaction between solitary waves and a submerged flat plate tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme was employed to capture the free surface accurately a total of 12 cases in constant water depth was investigated considering 4 incident wave heights and 3 submergence depths of the plate firstly computational results of the solitary wave profiles free surface elevations and hydrodynamic forces on a flat plate were validated against the published experimental data secondly the evolution process of solitary waves interacting with the flat plate was shown for an intuitive impression thirdly the influence of the incident wave height and submergence depth of the plate on the free surface elevation and hydrodynamic forces was investigated the pressure distribution at the time instant when peak force occurred was then presented finally the velocity and vorticity fields containing several strongly nonlinear and interesting phenomena were illustrated and discussed keywords solitary wave submerged plate wave structure interaction cip hydrodynamic force velocity and vorticity 1 introduction flat plate structure is widely used in coastal and ocean engineering such as submerged breakwaters where the width of the structure is relatively smaller than the wavelength seiffert et al 2014 during hurricanes ivan in 2004 and katrina in 2005 many bridges become fully submerged by storm surge compared with other coastal structures or elevated bridge decks the submerged bridge has a specific characteristic that wave loads acting on a fully submerged bridge deck has a different failure mode which contains the influence of the buoyance to understand the failure caused by the tsunami and possibly avoid it evaluating the solitary wave induced loads on the bridge deck which can be modeled as a flat plate is needed because wave structure interactions in extreme sea states usually couple with strongly nonlinear phenomena including slamming wave breaking and overtopping conventional theoretical methods can hardly be applied to these problems to date the most direct way for studying these strongly nonlinear wave structure interaction problems is experimental testing however the scaled model testing generally provides limited flow information and load estimation and it is also time consuming and expensive hence the development of a numerical model which is capable of quantitative estimation for extreme wave structure interaction problems is of great benefit for the design of ocean and offshore structures the preliminary experimental study on the wave plate interaction was conducted by kulin 1958 in which solitary waves propagating over a submerged plate were tested solitary wave loads on an elevated platform were experimentally carried out by french 1970 but his study did not consider the overtopping in the vicinity of the plate lin et al 2005 conducted a range of experiments on interactions of solitary wave and a submerged vertical plate their study focused on the vortex shedding process induced by the wave plate interaction but not on wave forces experimental study on solitary wave propagating over a bridge model with girders was performed by mcpherson 2010 subsequently a set of experiments were carried out by lau et al 2011 to measure solitary wave forces acting on a coastal bridge model more recently a series of experiments on hydrodynamic forces acting on a submerged plate due to solitary waves were conducted by seiffert et al 2014 with a wide range of parameters including water depths submergence depths elevations and wave heights some other experimental studies on wave interacting with a flat plate mainly focused on periodic waves such as takaki 2001 rey and touboul 2011 using analytical methods it is difficult to solve the problem of solitary wave plate interaction due to its strongly nonlinear effects the potential flow based numerical studies for wave loads on a flat plate were performed by several scholars such as siew and hurley 2006 and kojima et al 1994 lo and liu 2014 used a linear long wave approximation to study the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged plate which was followed by a study on nonlinear wave induced forces on a submerged plate conducted by hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 using the green naghdi equations recently lu and wang 2015 simulated the interaction of solitary waves with a fixed and partially immersed body moreover morison 1950 kaplan et al 1995 and bea et al 1999 estimated wave loads on a flat plate by dividing wave induced forces into different components including slamming force drag force inertia force and buoyancy force due to the negligence of the viscosity it is difficult for potential flow based studies to accurately predict the vorticity field and strongly nonlinear effects such as wave breaking and air entrapment computational fluid dynamics cfd solvers are considered as a promising alternative approach for the strongly nonlinear wave structure interaction liang et al 2010 studied the hydrodynamic forces on the coastal structure due to solitary waves using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method seiffert et al 2014 studied solitary wave forces on a flat plate using the openfoam cfd toolbox without consideration of viscous effects in the present study a cip based cartesian grid method hu and kashiwagi 2004 with an interface capturing approach called tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme xiao et al 2005 was performed to simulate the strongly nonlinear interaction between a solitary wave and a flat plate a virtual particle method hu and kashiwagi 2009 was used to determine the boundary of a rigid plate submerged in the water this numerical model is capable to solve the strongly nonlinear problems and handle the complicated free surface geometry by further developing it it is reasonable to treat violently moving floating bodies this program also has a potential to handle strongly nonlinear sea keeping problems including ship motions in large amplitude waves slamming on ship s bottom and flare the green water impact on deck and so on moreover because of the employing of multiphase model the flow solver can be readily extended to solve several other multiphase problems such as stratified flow problems and internal waves two major objectives of the present study were that one was to study hydrodynamic characteristics during wave plate interaction with consideration of strongly nonlinear and viscous effects and the other one was to validate the developed numerical model by comparing current simulations with available experiments in this paper the generation of solitary wave free surface elevation during the interaction process horizontal and vertical forces acting on the plate were validated with the available experimental results the performance of wave profile and hydrodynamic forces were investigated as a function of wave heights and submergence depths of the plate respectively especially the unilateral forces acting on the four sides were examined the pressure fields at the time instant when peak hydrodynamic forces occurred were applied to explain the time series of hydrodynamic forces the velocity fields of different wave heights were exhibited to clarify the nonlinear phenomena such as wave breaking and air entrapment and some specific characteristics which cannot be calculated by potential theory were presented the vortex evolution process was analyzed and compared with the velocity field this paper was organized as follows the numerical model calculation setup and the generation and validation of solitary waves were described in section 2 free surface elevation hydrodynamic forces pressure distribution and fluid field were performed and discussed in section 3 finally the conclusions were drawn 2 numerical method 2 1 flow solver the constrained interpolation profile cip scheme is distinguished from conventional high order schemes by reconstructing the profile inside a grid cell the cip scheme uses the grid point value and its spatial derivative gradient to form a cubic polynomial to approximate the profile the flow solver divides the navier stokes equations into three fractional steps 1 u i u i n δ t u j n u i n x j 0 2 u i u i δ t 1 ρ x j μ s i j f i 3 u i n 1 u i δ t 1 ρ p n 1 x i where n n 1 i and j denote the present time level new time level the cell addresses in x and y direction respectively u ρ p t and f denote velocity density pressure time and body force respectively and s ij u i x j u j x i 2 eq 1 is the advection step which is solved by the cip method eq 2 and eq 3 are the non advection steps the diffusion term in eq 2 is treated by the central difference method while the pressure coupled with velocity in eq 3 is solved by successive over relaxation sor iteration u and u are employed to distinguish the velocity calculated before and after the advection step respectively the pressure velocity coupling is treated in a non advection calculation step and the poisson equation eq 4 for pressure can be obtained by taking divergence of eq 3 4 x i 1 ρ p n 1 x i 1 δ t u i x i numerical solution of eq 4 provides the pressure distribution over the whole computational domain due to the assumption that eq 4 is valid for liquid gas and solid phases once the pressure is computed by the poisson equation the velocity field can be updated by the algebraic operations of eq 3 as follow 5 u i n 1 u i δ t ρ p n 1 x i the problem of violent free surface flows is treated as a multi phase problem wang et al 2018 the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme xiao et al 2005 is employed to capture the interface of fluid phase and gas phase in the thinc scheme the profile of density function inside a computational cell is approximated by a hyperbolic tangent function multi phase model is applied in this numerical wave flume the density function φ m is introduced to define 3 different phases m 1 2 and 3 denotes the liquid gas and solid phases respectively the density functions satisfy the following advection equation 6 φ m t u i φ m x i 0 after the density functions for all phases are determined the physical properties such as the dynamic viscosity μ can be calculated by the following formula 7 μ m 1 3 φ m μ m the dynamic viscosity of each cell is calculated by accumulating the product of viscosity and the density function of each phase once the dynamic viscosity is obtained the viscous force can be calculated by integrating the product of the dynamic viscosity and the rate of strain tensor s ik 8 f i v a 2 μ s i k n k d a where f i v are forces due to viscous friction a denotes the surface of the solid body and n k represents the k th component of the outward unit normal vector after the pressure velocities and density function for all computational cells are obtained hydrodynamic forces acting on the solid body can be calculated by integrating the pressure and friction along the body surface as follows 9 f i f i p f i v a p δ i k n k d a a 2 μ s i k n k d a where f i p are forces due to pressure two approaches are applied to confirm the correctness of the friction force one is to increase the amount of virtual particles hu and kashiwagi 2009 employed to simulate the flat plate the virtual particles are arranged along each side of the flat plate for predicting the friction force four virtual particles are used for each side of the grid and totally 5048 virtual particles are employed to simulate this flat plate another one is to considering the periphery four grids top bottom left and right while calculating the viscosity of each grid the dynamic viscosity μ is calculated as the integration of four grids the minimum grid size in x direction is 0 005 and we refine the grids in y direction to 0 0005 to simulate the thickness of the plate the numerical calculation is validated by comparison with analytical solution 2 2 numerical wave flume the schematic diagram of the present numerical wave flume is shown in fig 1 where x and y are abscissa and ordinate in the cartesian coordinate system a two dimensional numerical wave flume has a dimension of 17 50 m long and 1 05 m deep a piston type wave maker is set at the left side of the flume to generate solitary waves with a damping zone in the right side a horizontal plate is 0 305 m wide and 0 013 m thick the leading edge of the plate is located at x lp 8 00 m the submergence depth of the plate z is the distance between still water level swl and the top of the plate the water depth is defined as h the height of solitary wave a is normalized as α by dividing h η is the free surface elevation which can be normalized as η h a total of 12 cases are investigated in constant water depth of h 0 086 m involving 4 normalized incoming wave heights α a h 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 and 3 normalized submergence depths z z z h 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 of the flat plate three wave gauges wg1 wg2 and wg3 are allocated at two plate width upstream of the leading edge two plate width and six plate width downstream of the trailing edge of the plate respectively all 12 computational cases are listed in table 1 the laboratory experiments conducted by seiffert et al 2014 have the same setup on the water depth incoming wave height and vertical locations of the flat plate as the present numerical model it should be mentioned that the difference between the setup of the present model and seiffert et al 2014 is that the plate in experiment is essentially a three dimensional structure with a length of 0 149 m into the paper which can cause three dimensional effect another discrepancy between the present numerical model and experimental measurement is that an aluminum strut is attached to fix the experimental plate at required locations 2 3 spatial and temporal discretization convergence study for this numerical model is carried out by wang et al 2018 in this paper the mesh combination is 551 302 where 551 refers to the total cell number in the x direction and 302 refers to the total cell number in the y direction block structured grid is employed the computational domain is sub divided into regions each of which has a structured mesh inside these blocked structured meshes δx and δy vary following a cosine function the minimum grid spacing in y direction is 0 0005 m to catch the thickness of the plate which measured as 0 013 m the minimum time step is restricted by courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition to achieve numerical convergence for two dimensional flow the cfl condition is 10 u δ t δ x v δ t δ y c max where u and v are the x velocity and y velocity components respectively and δt is the time step the total simulation time is 7 times of the truncated period of solitary wave to make sure that the whole evolution process of solitary wave propagating over the plate can be simulated the target solitary wave is generated at x 0 m left boundary by a piston type wavemaker a damping zone is adopted to absorb waves as the outflow boundary right boundary no slip condition is employed at solid boundaries 2 4 generation of solitary wave he and kashiwagi 2012 found out that solitary wave generated via a paddle law of motion derived from rayleigh s solution rayleigh 1876 could achieve more ideal profile hence implementation of generation of solitary wave in he and kashiwagi 2012 is also employed in the present model and the paddle motion can be found in he and kashiwagi 2012 fig 2 shows the comparison of time history of the free surface elevation at x 8 0 m between the present cip method solid line and the g n equation dash line a total of 4 normalized heights of the incident wave α 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 are tested the free surface elevation is measured at x 8 0 m where the leading edge of the horizontal plate was set the y coordinate is the normalized free surface elevation the x coordinate denotes time target solitary waves with negligible oscillation tails are generated at the reference location x 8 0 m it can be seen that the present results agree well with those predicted by the g n equation in the duration of the wave crest running through the wave gauge 3 results and discussion 3 1 deformation of free surface the evolution of a solitary wave interacting with a flat plate is presented in fig 3 snapshots of wave profiles in the numerical wave flume at six typical time instants are selected to illustrate 6 main stages of the progress fig 3 a shows the time instant when the solitary wave reaches wg1 with a symmetric wave profile at the beginning of the interaction between the solitary wave and the flat plate fig 3 b and c present a phenomenon that the main wave crest decomposes into two parts a backflow returning to upstream and a forward flow propagating downstream fig 3 b is the initial moment when the split of wave occurs at the main wave crest while fig 3 c is the moment when the two parts have similar height then the height of the backflow reduces and the forward flow interacts continually with the flat plate fig 3 d shows an asymmetric wave profile as solitary wave propagates through the flat plate prior to breaking in this image the front face of the wave becomes steeper than the back face fig 3 e presents large deformation of the free surface after the strong interaction between the solitary wave and flat plate the conclusion can be drawn that the present cip based numerical model with thinc scheme can capture the large deformation of the free surface well fig 3 f is the snapshot when the backflow returns back to wg1 and this phenomenon is also recorded by wg1 in fig 4 a fig 4 a c show time series of the free surface elevation measured at wg1 wg2 and wg3 respectively three different data were presented as the solid line dash line and dot line which are obtained from the present method the laboratory experiment and openfoam seiffert et al 2014 respectively the present results at wg1 agree well with the other two methods in fig 4 a another thing needs to be noticed in fig 4 a is that three peaks appear at three different time instants 1 t 7 85 s 2 t 9 02 s and 3 t 9 89 s 1 at the first time instant of t 7 85 s the main crest of solitary wave reaches the location of wg1 which is coincident with that in fig 3 a 2 the peak occurred at the second time instant of t 9 02 s is considered as the reflected wave from the leading edge of the plate it is known that the phase celerity of the solitary wave is c g a h 0 1 2 1 04673 m s and wg1 is located at a distance of δx 0 61 m to the leading edge of the plate then the theoretical duration of solitary wave reflected back to wg1 can be evaluated as δt 2δx c 1 165 s the actual time that reflected wave return back to wg1 in the simulation is δt t 2 t 1 9 02 s 7 85 s 1 17 s it is approximately equal to the theoretical time δt which confirms that the second wave peak is the reflected wave 3 the third peak is the backflow propagated to wg1 as illustrated in fig 3 f at t 9 89 s fig 4 b is the free surface elevation measured at wg2 where the solitary wave has already propagated over the plate the free surface elevation calculated by two numerical methods the present cip method and openfoam seiffert et al 2014 is larger than the experimental data the cip results agree well with the openfoam but both of them deviate from the experimental results the experimenters seiffert et al 2014 indicate that it may be caused by the attenuation of the experimental flume so it may because the 3 d effect of the wave flume in which the length of plate into the wave flume could not stick tightly with the side wall moreover it also may because the strut fixed on the plate in the experiment which may interact with the solitary wave and thus bring the dissipation of wave energy after the interaction the profile of solitary wave becomes asymmetric and the front of the wave crest becomes steep fig 4 c shows the wave profile measured at wg3 which is 1 22 m downstream of wg2 compared fig 4 c with fig 4 b an interesting phenomenon can be observed that the disturbance to the solitary wave caused by the interaction with the plate which leaded to asymmetric profile in fig 4 b disappears a lot and the wave profile recovers to be symmetric in fig 4 c this phenomenon reveals that solitary wave has the characteristics of self recover and profile maintaining su and mirie 1980 reported a similar phenomenon when they investigated head on collisions between two solitary waves fig 5 presents the normalized free surface elevation with respect to different incident wave heights α 0 4 solid line α 0 3 dash line α 0 2 dot line and α 0 1 dash dot line at the submergence depth of z 0 2 with the increase of the incident wave height the solitary waves propagate faster and the wave profiles become narrower in fig 5 a the reflected wave and backflow increase as the height of the incident wave increases in fig 5 b the wave profile becomes asymmetric after the interaction with the flat plate and the front of the wave profile shows much steeper as the height of the incident wave increases fig 5 c shows that the characteristics of self recover and profile maintaining of solitary waves are found in all these 4 cases with different wave heights fig 6 shows the free surface elevation at 3 wave gauges with respect to different submergence depths z 0 2 solid line z 0 4 dash line and z 0 6 dot line the incident wave height remains constant at α 0 3 the abscissa and ordinate denote the time and non dimensional free surface elevation η h respectively fig 6 a shows the free surface elevation measured at the wave gauge wg1 the main crest of solitary waves measured at wg1 for all three cases is almost identical with each other since the solitary wave is still not disturbed by the structure at wg1 but the reflected wave and backflow are distinguished by different submergence locations as the submergence depth decreases that means the plate is closer to the water free surface the height of the reflected wave and backflow increases moreover the time when the reflected wave returned back to wg1 comes early with the decrease of submergence depth z in fig 6 b the maximum height of the free surface elevation becomes small as the submergence depth decreases they are 0 225 0 265 and 0 283 for three submergence depths z 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 respectively one reason may be that more wave energy is transferred into the backflow in the case of low submergence depth it can be confirmed by fig 6 a the large backflow is formed in the case of low submergence z 0 2 another reason is that when the plate is set close to the free surface the energy dissipation increases brossard et al 2003 also indicate that the free surface contains much energy flux from fig 6 b it can also be found that the maximum height of the free surface occurs at t 9 43 s 9 35 s and 9 31 s for z 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 respectively so as the submergence depth decreases the peak force appears later the analysis of the peak force and its occurrence time is discussed in detail in section 3 3 the free surface elevation for z 0 2 has the most asymmetric profile the free surface measured at wg2 for z 0 4 and 0 6 is not deviated with each other a lot while it can be distinguished with wg1 this phenomenon implies that below a certain submergence depth the submergence of the plate may not affect the hydrodynamic characteristics so much hydrodynamic forces also present a similar phenomenon the wave profiles presented in fig 6 c tend to regain their symmetric characteristics for all cases of 3 different submergence depths 3 2 hydrodynamic forces fig 7 shows comparisons between the experiment dash line the present cip method solid line and openfoam seiffert et al 2014 dot line of horizontal and vertical forces α 0 3 z 0 2 the abscissa and ordinate denote the time and force components respectively generally speaking three lines have a similar tendency both the horizontal and vertical forces have two peaks one is positive and the other is negative here the maximum positive horizontal force is defined as positive force pf and the minimum negative horizontal force is defined as negative force nf the maximum positive vertical force is uplift force uf and downward force df is for the minimum negative vertical force for positive force the results from the cip and openfoam seiffert et al 2014 agree well with each other but both these two numerical results have a discrepancy with the experiments which can be obviously seen from fig 7 a as mentioned in section 2 2 the existence of the vertical strut might affect the measurement of hydrodynamic forces the positive force predicted by the present cip method is 27 smaller than the experimental results partially because of the strut in the experiment this is because the vertical strut has much lateral surface where the fluids impact on and lead to horizontal forces however the vertical strut does not affect much on the prediction of vertical forces in fig 7 b the effects on the hydrodynamic forces caused by the vertical strut are further investigated in fig 10 fig 8 shows the time series of the horizontal and vertical forces with respect to 4 incident heights α 0 4 solid line α 0 3 dash line α 0 2 dot line and α 0 1 dash dot line with the plate located at the submergence depth of z 0 2 generally the vertical forces are larger than the horizontal forces by one order of magnitude two peaks are found in both horizontal and vertical forces during the interaction of solitary wave with the flat plate and their directions are contrary it can be seen from fig 8 that the positive force and uplift force are almost equal to the negative and downward forces in most cases respectively because the part of the wave impacting on the plate is not the wave crest and the fluid under both the crest of the wave and swl acting on the plate directly which contains small nonlinearity the time series of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the submerged plate are also smooth in most simulating cases due to the weak nonlinearity with the decrease of incident wave height α hydrodynamic forces descend and take a long time to reach the peak fig 9 presents time series of horizontal and vertical forces with respect to 3 different submergence depths z 0 2 solid line z 0 4 dash line and z 0 6 dot line the incident wave height α is kept constant α 0 3 in these three cases with the decrease of submergence depth z both maximum horizontal and vertical forces increase this is because when the plate is set closer to the free surface that contains most wave energy where the velocity field of solitary wave crest is strongly disturbed by the plate the hydrodynamic forces increase with z decreases the occurrence time of the peak force is postponed and this postponing may be caused by the delay of appearance of the wave crest as illustrated in fig 6 b comparing fig 9 a with fig 9 b it can be seen that the vertical force is affected much by different submergence depths than the horizontal force in fig 9 a the horizontal forces calculated for cases of z 0 4 and z 0 6 nearly coincide with each other and it has a rapid increase for the case of z 0 2 this phenomenon accords with the free surface elevation in fig 6 b and thus suggests that below a certain depth the influence of the submergence depth on horizontal forces can be neglected fig 9 b demonstrates that with the decrease of submergence depth z the duration of vertical forces extends another characteristic is that the asymmetry of uplift force and downward force varies with different z the quotient of downward force and uplift force is defined as an asymmetric index the asymmetric indexes for these 3 cases z 0 6 0 4 and 0 2 are 1 81 1 60 and 1 31 respectively it can be seen that with the submergence depth decreases the distinction between downward force and uplift force decreases for the case of z 0 2 the occurrence time instants of positive force negative force uplift force and downward force are t 8 406 s 8 806 s 8 319 s and 8 663 s respectively these occurrence time instants of each component peak force are compared with the unilateral peak force on one side of body in figs 10 and 11 unilateral forces are presented in fig 10 by decomposing hydrodynamic forces on the whole plate surface into forces on 4 surfaces left right top and bottom sides of the plate fig 10 a and b are horizontal forces acting on 4 sides fig 10 c and d are for the vertical forces the ordinate of fig 10 b exceeds fig 10 a by two orders of magnitude while the ordinate of fig 10 c exceeds fig 10 d by three orders of magnitude from the comparison between fig 10 a and b the horizontal forces mainly act on the left weather side and right lee side of the plate occurrence time instants of positive force and negative force shown in fig 9 a accord with forces on the left side of the body reaching a maximum t 8 406 s and forces on the right side reaching a maximum t 8 806 s the effect of forces acting on the top and bottom surfaces on the occurrence time of horizontal peak forces is negligible in fig 10 c and d the vertical forces mainly focus on top and bottom side of the plate uplift force occurs at t 8 319 s which is earlier than forces reaching a maximum on the bottom surface t 8 388 s downward force occurs at t 8 663 s which is later than forces reaching a maximum on the top surface t 8 632 s fig 11 shows the friction force calculated by present cip method in the present case the maximum local reynolds number along the plate surface is re x u b ν 7 32 10 4 for the flat plate the transition reynolds number is about re x t r 5 10 5 thus the boundary layer along the flat plate can be treated as laminar and the blasius solution is available for the calculation of drag force the non dimensional drag coefficient is defined as c d 1 328 re 4 99 10 3 for laminar plate flow the total frictional drag force c d is twice the value of the skin friction coefficient at the trailing edge d 2 c d 1 2 ρ u 2 b l 0 081 n the friction force calculated by the cip model is 0 075 n and the difference from the blasius solution is within 10 the numerical results show that the frictional drag force acting on the flat plate is less than 0 3 of the total hydrodynamic forces for the present simulation with a larger wave amplitude of α 0 4 the viscous force on the plate surface is found of o 0 1 n m while the pressure related force is of o 10 n m hence the contribution of the viscous forces on the total hydrodynamic forces can be neglected at the present study case however the viscous effects still needs to be considered in the analysis of the fluid field for example the circulations found in velocity field in fig 15 and the vortex shedding process in fig 16 in which ignoring the viscosity would fail to predict these phenomenon 3 3 pressure distribution in fig 12 a d the pressure distribution at the time instants of the peak forces occurring is employed to illustrate the appearance of the maximum and the minimum forces and it can also provide insight view into how this horizontal barrier affects the solitary wave fig 12 e f show pressure distribution at the time instants of unilateral uplift force and unilateral downward force occurring which are not coincide with the occurrence time of the integrated peak force the pressure distribution presents the same law as the unilateral force shows at t 8 319 s uplift force occurs when concentrated pressure under the solitary wave crest is at the leading edge of the plate as shown in fig 12 a at t 8 406 s positive force occurs when the solitary wave arrives at the leading edge of plate where the pressure concentrates on the weather side as shown in fig 12 b at t 8 663 s downward force occurs when the wave crest is above the plate as shown in fig 12 c at t 8 806 s negative force occurs when the wave crest is close to the right side of the plate where the pressure concentration is at the lee side as shown in fig 12 d the pressure distribution in fig 12 e and f does not distinguish from fig 12 a and c though they are of distinct time instants the time of 4 peak forces occurring for 3 submergence depths z is also listed in table 2 with the submergence depth z decreases the peak force occurs later the sequence of the appearance for the peak force is uplift force positive force downward force and negative force 3 4 flow field figs 13 and 14 provide velocity fields at the submergence depth of z 0 2 for 2 different incident wave heights α 0 1 and α 0 4 respectively the velocity vectors are plotted at grids while the grids are skipped for clarity one thing needs to be mentioned is that although no slip condition is employed at the plate boundary the velocity vector at boundary is skipped so that s why the velocity vector seems like the same at the vicinity of the plate the unit length of the vector denotes the same value in figs 13 and 14 generally velocity field for the case of α 0 1 shown in fig 13 presents more moderate than that of α 0 4 in fig 14 strong nonlinear phenomenon such as wave breaking occurs with a relatively large wave height α 0 4 as the incident wave height increases the velocity vector has a longer length and more drastic variation with respect to direction and length wave breaking which induces the jet impinging on the free surface and air entrapment phenomenon occurs in the case of α 0 4 while that does not appear in the case of α 0 1 fig 13 a is the main wave crest acting on the top of the flat plate at t 9 93 s the deformation of the free surface is slight the vector in the velocity field is uniform except the small region in the vicinity of the plate end fig 13 b is the main wave crest leaving the plate during the entire progress of interaction the free surface and the velocity vector change slightly being similar with figs 3 d fig 14 a presents the moment of the critical scenarios before wave breaking and the wave front face is nearly perpendicular to the still water level this asymmetry also leads the particle velocities at the wave crest increasing to crest instability and wave breaking like in fig 14 b the wave crest curls up and forms a jet and is about to impinge on the free surface in fig 14 c jet impinges on the free surface and involves air into the fluid phase the circles appearing in the impingement region are benefitted from the using of a vof type free surface capturing method the density flux is divided into 20 contours with an openness coefficient of 0 05 the closed circle in the impingement area indicates that this region is not entirely composed of fluid phase hsiao and lin 2010 point out that their numerical model based on a vof type also has this phenomenon another thing needs to be noticed is that the velocity of air phase can be obtained as well since the air phase is defined as one phase in the calculation fig 15 shows the velocity field at t 8 82 s after the solitary wave propagates over the flat plate the time instant of t 8 82 s is chosen because a striking phenomenon occurs two circulations in each end of the flat plate the circulation might be due to the shedding of vortices which are further proved in fig 16 d since the circulation is caused by vortices the numerical models based on the potential theory which ignores the viscosity fail to predict this phenomenon as illustrated by carter et al 2006 this phenomenon has also been discovered in experiments poupardin et al 2012 two circulations remain at the upstream and downstream in the vicinity of two ends of the plate larger velocity is observed in the circulation compared with that in the nearby region left circulation is anti clockwise while the right one is clockwise another distinguishing characteristic of these 2 circulations is that the lee side circulation has a larger circumference than the weather side this may be because the viscosity at the lee side is more considerable than that at the weather side liu et al 2009 calculate reflection coefficient using the potential theory and found that the weather side results agree well with the measurement and thus the conclusion is obtained that viscosity is only important at the lee side of the plate poupardin et al 2012 also indicate that when the potential theory was employed results of the weather side which are little affected by the viscosity agree better with the experimental data in the present cip model vorticity is calculated by v x u y using the central differencing scheme fig 16 presents the vorticity field of one case z 0 2 α 0 4 in the vicinity of the flat plate direction of rotation is defined by different colors clockwise vortices are portrayed by blue while anti clockwise direction is defined as red generally both two directions of vortices appear in the interaction progress the vorticity field mainly consists of two parts one is the main vortex underneath the water level another one is the vortex generating at the free surface in fig 16 a the main vortices generated at 4 vertices of the plate and the extent of development distinguishes from each other the northwestern vortex is the first vortex which is about to shed fig 16 b presents the moment when the wave crest is in the critical state to form a jet and impinge on the free surface the vorticity at the free surface reaches its maximum and a vorticity intensity is obviously observed at the overturning jet the northwestern vortex shedding in fig 16 a moves along the top edge of the plate to downstream and partially participates in the formation of the northeastern vortex the southwestern vortex has a concentrated core and the density of the vortex decreases with the distance away from the core as illustrated by the fading in color then the southwestern vortex begins to shed and the density of the vortex attenuates due to diffusion during the shedding which can be seen from fig 16 c d the whole vortex evolution progress is similar to the turbulence intensity variety during the solitary wave over a bottom mounted barrier investigated by wu et al 2012 fig 16 d is at the time instant that the same with fig 15 by comparing these two images it can be found that the location of velocity circulation in fig 15 is the shedding vortices in fig 16 d this phenomenon proves that the circulation formed in fig 15 is caused by the vortex and the present cip model which considers the viscosity can simulate the flow field elaborately 4 conclusions the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged flat plate was studied numerically by a newly developed cip based cartesian grid method a

22944,a constrained interpolation profile cip based multi phase numerical viscous wave flume was constructed to investigate extremely nonlinear interaction between solitary waves and a submerged flat plate tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme was employed to capture the free surface accurately a total of 12 cases in constant water depth was investigated considering 4 incident wave heights and 3 submergence depths of the plate firstly computational results of the solitary wave profiles free surface elevations and hydrodynamic forces on a flat plate were validated against the published experimental data secondly the evolution process of solitary waves interacting with the flat plate was shown for an intuitive impression thirdly the influence of the incident wave height

finally the velocity and vorticity fields containing several strongly nonlinear and interesting phenomena were illustrated and discussed keywords solitary wave submerged plate wave structure interaction cip hydrodynamic force velocity and vorticity 1 introduction flat plate structure is widely used in coastal and ocean engineering such as submerged breakwaters where the width of the structure is relatively smaller than the wavelength seiffert et al 2014 during hurricanes ivan in 2004 and katrina in 2005 many bridges become fully submerged by storm surge compared with other coastal structures or elevated bridge decks the submerged bridge has a specific characteristic that wave loads acting on a fully submerged bridge deck has a different failure mode which contains the influence of the buoyance to understand the failure caused by the tsunami and possibly avoid it evaluating the solitary wave induced loads on the bridge deck which can be modeled as a flat plate is needed because wave structure interactions in extreme sea states usually couple with strongly nonlinear phenomena including slamming wave breaking and overtopping conventional theoretical methods can hardly be applied to these problems to date the most direct way for studying these strongly nonlinear wave structure interaction problems is experimental testing however the scaled model testing generally provides limited flow information and load estimation and it is also time consuming and expensive hence the development of a numerical model which is capable of quantitative estimation for extreme wave structure interaction problems is of great benefit for the design of ocean and offshore structures the preliminary experimental study on the wave plate interaction was conducted by kulin 1958 in which solitary waves propagating over a submerged plate were tested solitary wave loads on an elevated platform were experimentally carried out by french 1970 but his study did not consider the overtopping in the vicinity of the plate lin et al 2005 conducted a range of experiments on interactions of solitary wave and a submerged vertical plate their study focused on the vortex shedding process induced by the wave plate interaction but not on wave forces experimental study on solitary wave propagating over a bridge model with girders was performed by mcpherson 2010 subsequently a set of experiments were carried out by lau et al 2011 to measure solitary wave forces acting on a coastal bridge model more recently a series of experiments on hydrodynamic forces acting on a submerged plate due to solitary waves were conducted by seiffert et al 2014 with a wide range of parameters including water depths submergence depths elevations and wave heights some other experimental studies on wave interacting with a flat plate mainly focused on periodic waves such as takaki 2001 rey and touboul 2011 using analytical methods it is difficult to solve the problem of solitary wave plate interaction due to its strongly nonlinear effects the potential flow based numerical studies for wave loads on a flat plate were performed by several scholars such as siew and hurley 2006 and kojima et al 1994 lo and liu 2014 used a linear long wave approximation to study the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged plate which was followed by a study on nonlinear wave induced forces on a submerged plate conducted by hayatdavoodi and ertekin 2015 using the green naghdi equations recently lu and wang 2015 simulated the interaction of solitary waves with a fixed and partially immersed body moreover morison 1950 kaplan et al 1995 and bea et al 1999 estimated wave loads on a flat plate by dividing wave induced forces into different components including slamming force drag force inertia force and buoyancy force due to the negligence of the viscosity it is difficult for potential flow based studies to accurately predict the vorticity field and strongly nonlinear effects such as wave breaking and air entrapment computational fluid dynamics cfd solvers are considered as a promising alternative approach for the strongly nonlinear wave structure interaction liang et al 2010 studied the hydrodynamic forces on the coastal structure due to solitary waves using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method seiffert et al 2014 studied solitary wave forces on a flat plate using the openfoam cfd toolbox without consideration of viscous effects in the present study a cip based cartesian grid method hu and kashiwagi 2004 with an interface capturing approach called tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme xiao et al 2005 was performed to simulate the strongly nonlinear interaction between a solitary wave and a flat plate a virtual particle method hu and kashiwagi 2009 was used to determine the boundary of a rigid plate submerged in the water this numerical model is capable to solve the strongly nonlinear problems and handle the complicated free surface geometry by further developing it it is reasonable to treat violently moving floating bodies this program also has a potential to handle strongly nonlinear sea keeping problems including ship motions in large amplitude waves slamming on ship s bottom and flare the green water impact on deck and so on moreover because of the employing of multiphase model the flow solver can be readily extended to solve several other multiphase problems such as stratified flow problems and internal waves two major objectives of the present study were that one was to study hydrodynamic characteristics during wave plate interaction with consideration of strongly nonlinear and viscous effects and the other one was to validate the developed numerical model by comparing current simulations with available experiments in this paper the generation of solitary wave free surface elevation during the interaction process horizontal and vertical forces acting on the plate were validated with the available experimental results the performance of wave profile and hydrodynamic forces were investigated as a function of wave heights and submergence depths of the plate respectively especially the unilateral forces acting on the four sides were examined the pressure fields at the time instant when peak hydrodynamic forces occurred were applied to explain the time series of hydrodynamic forces the velocity fields of different wave heights were exhibited to clarify the nonlinear phenomena such as wave breaking and air entrapment and some specific characteristics which cannot be calculated by potential theory were presented the vortex evolution process was analyzed and compared with the velocity field this paper was organized as follows the numerical model calculation setup and the generation and validation of solitary waves were described in section 2 free surface elevation hydrodynamic forces pressure distribution and fluid field were performed and discussed in section 3 finally the conclusions were drawn 2 numerical method 2 1 flow solver the constrained interpolation profile cip scheme is distinguished from conventional high order schemes by reconstructing the profile inside a grid cell the cip scheme uses the grid point value and its spatial derivative gradient to form a cubic polynomial to approximate the profile the flow solver divides the navier stokes equations into three fractional steps 1 u i u i n δ t u j n u i n x j 0 2 u i u i δ t 1 ρ x j μ s i j f i 3 u i n 1 u i δ t 1 ρ p n 1 x i where n n 1 i and j denote the present time level new time level the cell addresses in x and y direction respectively u ρ p t and f denote velocity density pressure time and body force respectively and s ij u i x j u j x i 2 eq 1 is the advection step which is solved by the cip method eq 2 and eq 3 are the non advection steps the diffusion term in eq 2 is treated by the central difference method while the pressure coupled with velocity in eq 3 is solved by successive over relaxation sor iteration u and u are employed to distinguish the velocity calculated before and after the advection step respectively the pressure velocity coupling is treated in a non advection calculation step and the poisson equation eq 4 for pressure can be obtained by taking divergence of eq 3 4 x i 1 ρ p n 1 x i 1 δ t u i x i numerical solution of eq 4 provides the pressure distribution over the whole computational domain due to the assumption that eq 4 is valid for liquid gas and solid phases once the pressure is computed by the poisson equation the velocity field can be updated by the algebraic operations of eq 3 as follow 5 u i n 1 u i δ t ρ p n 1 x i the problem of violent free surface flows is treated as a multi phase problem wang et al 2018 the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme xiao et al 2005 is employed to capture the interface of fluid phase and gas phase in the thinc scheme the profile of density function inside a computational cell is approximated by a hyperbolic tangent function multi phase model is applied in this numerical wave flume the density function φ m is introduced to define 3 different phases m 1 2 and 3 denotes the liquid gas and solid phases respectively the density functions satisfy the following advection equation 6 φ m t u i φ m x i 0 after the density functions for all phases are determined the physical properties such as the dynamic viscosity μ can be calculated by the following formula 7 μ m 1 3 φ m μ m the dynamic viscosity of each cell is calculated by accumulating the product of viscosity and the density function of each phase once the dynamic viscosity is obtained the viscous force can be calculated by integrating the product of the dynamic viscosity and the rate of strain tensor s ik 8 f i v a 2 μ s i k n k d a where f i v are forces due to viscous friction a denotes the surface of the solid body and n k represents the k th component of the outward unit normal vector after the pressure velocities and density function for all computational cells are obtained hydrodynamic forces acting on the solid body can be calculated by integrating the pressure and friction along the body surface as follows 9 f i f i p f i v a p δ i k n k d a a 2 μ s i k n k d a where f i p are forces due to pressure two approaches are applied to confirm the correctness of the friction force one is to increase the amount of virtual particles hu and kashiwagi 2009 employed to simulate the flat plate the virtual particles are arranged along each side of the flat plate for predicting the friction force four virtual particles are used for each side of the grid and totally 5048 virtual particles are employed to simulate this flat plate another one is to considering the periphery four grids top bottom left and right while calculating the viscosity of each grid the dynamic viscosity μ is calculated as the integration of four grids the minimum grid size in x direction is 0 005 and we refine the grids in y direction to 0 0005 to simulate the thickness of the plate the numerical calculation is validated by comparison with analytical solution 2 2 numerical wave flume the schematic diagram of the present numerical wave flume is shown in fig 1 where x and y are abscissa and ordinate in the cartesian coordinate system a two dimensional numerical wave flume has a dimension of 17 50 m long and 1 05 m deep a piston type wave maker is set at the left side of the flume to generate solitary waves with a damping zone in the right side a horizontal plate is 0 305 m wide and 0 013 m thick the leading edge of the plate is located at x lp 8 00 m the submergence depth of the plate z is the distance between still water level swl and the top of the plate the water depth is defined as h the height of solitary wave a is normalized as α by dividing h η is the free surface elevation which can be normalized as η h a total of 12 cases are investigated in constant water depth of h 0 086 m involving 4 normalized incoming wave heights α a h 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 and 3 normalized submergence depths z z z h 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 of the flat plate three wave gauges wg1 wg2 and wg3 are allocated at two plate width upstream of the leading edge two plate width and six plate width downstream of the trailing edge of the plate respectively all 12 computational cases are listed in table 1 the laboratory experiments conducted by seiffert et al 2014 have the same setup on the water depth incoming wave height and vertical locations of the flat plate as the present numerical model it should be mentioned that the difference between the setup of the present model and seiffert et al 2014 is that the plate in experiment is essentially a three dimensional structure with a length of 0 149 m into the paper which can cause three dimensional effect another discrepancy between the present numerical model and experimental measurement is that an aluminum strut is attached to fix the experimental plate at required locations 2 3 spatial and temporal discretization convergence study for this numerical model is carried out by wang et al 2018 in this paper the mesh combination is 551 302 where 551 refers to the total cell number in the x direction and 302 refers to the total cell number in the y direction block structured grid is employed the computational domain is sub divided into regions each of which has a structured mesh inside these blocked structured meshes δx and δy vary following a cosine function the minimum grid spacing in y direction is 0 0005 m to catch the thickness of the plate which measured as 0 013 m the minimum time step is restricted by courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition to achieve numerical convergence for two dimensional flow the cfl condition is 10 u δ t δ x v δ t δ y c max where u and v are the x velocity and y velocity components respectively and δt is the time step the total simulation time is 7 times of the truncated period of solitary wave to make sure that the whole evolution process of solitary wave propagating over the plate can be simulated the target solitary wave is generated at x 0 m left boundary by a piston type wavemaker a damping zone is adopted to absorb waves as the outflow boundary right boundary no slip condition is employed at solid boundaries 2 4 generation of solitary wave he and kashiwagi 2012 found out that solitary wave generated via a paddle law of motion derived from rayleigh s solution rayleigh 1876 could achieve more ideal profile hence implementation of generation of solitary wave in he and kashiwagi 2012 is also employed in the present model and the paddle motion can be found in he and kashiwagi 2012 fig 2 shows the comparison of time history of the free surface elevation at x 8 0 m between the present cip method solid line and the g n equation dash line a total of 4 normalized heights of the incident wave α 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 are tested the free surface elevation is measured at x 8 0 m where the leading edge of the horizontal plate was set the y coordinate is the normalized free surface elevation the x coordinate denotes time target solitary waves with negligible oscillation tails are generated at the reference location x 8 0 m it can be seen that the present results agree well with those predicted by the g n equation in the duration of the wave crest running through the wave gauge 3 results and discussion 3 1 deformation of free surface the evolution of a solitary wave interacting with a flat plate is presented in fig 3 snapshots of wave profiles in the numerical wave flume at six typical time instants are selected to illustrate 6 main stages of the progress fig 3 a shows the time instant when the solitary wave reaches wg1 with a symmetric wave profile at the beginning of the interaction between the solitary wave and the flat plate fig 3 b and c present a phenomenon that the main wave crest decomposes into two parts a backflow returning to upstream and a forward flow propagating downstream fig 3 b is the initial moment when the split of wave occurs at the main wave crest while fig 3 c is the moment when the two parts have similar height then the height of the backflow reduces and the forward flow interacts continually with the flat plate fig 3 d shows an asymmetric wave profile as solitary wave propagates through the flat plate prior to breaking in this image the front face of the wave becomes steeper than the back face fig 3 e presents large deformation of the free surface after the strong interaction between the solitary wave and flat plate the conclusion can be drawn that the present cip based numerical model with thinc scheme can capture the large deformation of the free surface well fig 3 f is the snapshot when the backflow returns back to wg1 and this phenomenon is also recorded by wg1 in fig 4 a fig 4 a c show time series of the free surface elevation measured at wg1 wg2 and wg3 respectively three different data were presented as the solid line dash line and dot line which are obtained from the present method the laboratory experiment and openfoam seiffert et al 2014 respectively the present results at wg1 agree well with the other two methods in fig 4 a another thing needs to be noticed in fig 4 a is that three peaks appear at three different time instants 1 t 7 85 s 2 t 9 02 s and 3 t 9 89 s 1 at the first time instant of t 7 85 s the main crest of solitary wave reaches the location of wg1 which is coincident with that in fig 3 a 2 the peak occurred at the second time instant of t 9 02 s is considered as the reflected wave from the leading edge of the plate it is known that the phase celerity of the solitary wave is c g a h 0 1 2 1 04673 m s and wg1 is located at a distance of δx 0 61 m to the leading edge of the plate then the theoretical duration of solitary wave reflected back to wg1 can be evaluated as δt 2δx c 1 165 s the actual time that reflected wave return back to wg1 in the simulation is δt t 2 t 1 9 02 s 7 85 s 1 17 s it is approximately equal to the theoretical time δt which confirms that the second wave peak is the reflected wave 3 the third peak is the backflow propagated to wg1 as illustrated in fig 3 f at t 9 89 s fig 4 b is the free surface elevation measured at wg2 where the solitary wave has already propagated over the plate the free surface elevation calculated by two numerical methods the present cip method and openfoam seiffert et al 2014 is larger than the experimental data the cip results agree well with the openfoam but both of them deviate from the experimental results the experimenters seiffert et al 2014 indicate that it may be caused by the attenuation of the experimental flume so it may because the 3 d effect of the wave flume in which the length of plate into the wave flume could not stick tightly with the side wall moreover it also may because the strut fixed on the plate in the experiment which may interact with the solitary wave and thus bring the dissipation of wave energy after the interaction the profile of solitary wave becomes asymmetric and the front of the wave crest becomes steep fig 4 c shows the wave profile measured at wg3 which is 1 22 m downstream of wg2 compared fig 4 c with fig 4 b an interesting phenomenon can be observed that the disturbance to the solitary wave caused by the interaction with the plate which leaded to asymmetric profile in fig 4 b disappears a lot and the wave profile recovers to be symmetric in fig 4 c this phenomenon reveals that solitary wave has the characteristics of self recover and profile maintaining su and mirie 1980 reported a similar phenomenon when they investigated head on collisions between two solitary waves fig 5 presents the normalized free surface elevation with respect to different incident wave heights α 0 4 solid line α 0 3 dash line α 0 2 dot line and α 0 1 dash dot line at the submergence depth of z 0 2 with the increase of the incident wave height the solitary waves propagate faster and the wave profiles become narrower in fig 5 a the reflected wave and backflow increase as the height of the incident wave increases in fig 5 b the wave profile becomes asymmetric after the interaction with the flat plate and the front of the wave profile shows much steeper as the height of the incident wave increases fig 5 c shows that the characteristics of self recover and profile maintaining of solitary waves are found in all these 4 cases with different wave heights fig 6 shows the free surface elevation at 3 wave gauges with respect to different submergence depths z 0 2 solid line z 0 4 dash line and z 0 6 dot line the incident wave height remains constant at α 0 3 the abscissa and ordinate denote the time and non dimensional free surface elevation η h respectively fig 6 a shows the free surface elevation measured at the wave gauge wg1 the main crest of solitary waves measured at wg1 for all three cases is almost identical with each other since the solitary wave is still not disturbed by the structure at wg1 but the reflected wave and backflow are distinguished by different submergence locations as the submergence depth decreases that means the plate is closer to the water free surface the height of the reflected wave and backflow increases moreover the time when the reflected wave returned back to wg1 comes early with the decrease of submergence depth z in fig 6 b the maximum height of the free surface elevation becomes small as the submergence depth decreases they are 0 225 0 265 and 0 283 for three submergence depths z 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 respectively one reason may be that more wave energy is transferred into the backflow in the case of low submergence depth it can be confirmed by fig 6 a the large backflow is formed in the case of low submergence z 0 2 another reason is that when the plate is set close to the free surface the energy dissipation increases brossard et al 2003 also indicate that the free surface contains much energy flux from fig 6 b it can also be found that the maximum height of the free surface occurs at t 9 43 s 9 35 s and 9 31 s for z 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 respectively so as the submergence depth decreases the peak force appears later the analysis of the peak force and its occurrence time is discussed in detail in section 3 3 the free surface elevation for z 0 2 has the most asymmetric profile the free surface measured at wg2 for z 0 4 and 0 6 is not deviated with each other a lot while it can be distinguished with wg1 this phenomenon implies that below a certain submergence depth the submergence of the plate may not affect the hydrodynamic characteristics so much hydrodynamic forces also present a similar phenomenon the wave profiles presented in fig 6 c tend to regain their symmetric characteristics for all cases of 3 different submergence depths 3 2 hydrodynamic forces fig 7 shows comparisons between the experiment dash line the present cip method solid line and openfoam seiffert et al 2014 dot line of horizontal and vertical forces α 0 3 z 0 2 the abscissa and ordinate denote the time and force components respectively generally speaking three lines have a similar tendency both the horizontal and vertical forces have two peaks one is positive and the other is negative here the maximum positive horizontal force is defined as positive force pf and the minimum negative horizontal force is defined as negative force nf the maximum positive vertical force is uplift force uf and downward force df is for the minimum negative vertical force for positive force the results from the cip and openfoam seiffert et al 2014 agree well with each other but both these two numerical results have a discrepancy with the experiments which can be obviously seen from fig 7 a as mentioned in section 2 2 the existence of the vertical strut might affect the measurement of hydrodynamic forces the positive force predicted by the present cip method is 27 smaller than the experimental results partially because of the strut in the experiment this is because the vertical strut has much lateral surface where the fluids impact on and lead to horizontal forces however the vertical strut does not affect much on the prediction of vertical forces in fig 7 b the effects on the hydrodynamic forces caused by the vertical strut are further investigated in fig 10 fig 8 shows the time series of the horizontal and vertical forces with respect to 4 incident heights α 0 4 solid line α 0 3 dash line α 0 2 dot line and α 0 1 dash dot line with the plate located at the submergence depth of z 0 2 generally the vertical forces are larger than the horizontal forces by one order of magnitude two peaks are found in both horizontal and vertical forces during the interaction of solitary wave with the flat plate and their directions are contrary it can be seen from fig 8 that the positive force and uplift force are almost equal to the negative and downward forces in most cases respectively because the part of the wave impacting on the plate is not the wave crest and the fluid under both the crest of the wave and swl acting on the plate directly which contains small nonlinearity the time series of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the submerged plate are also smooth in most simulating cases due to the weak nonlinearity with the decrease of incident wave height α hydrodynamic forces descend and take a long time to reach the peak fig 9 presents time series of horizontal and vertical forces with respect to 3 different submergence depths z 0 2 solid line z 0 4 dash line and z 0 6 dot line the incident wave height α is kept constant α 0 3 in these three cases with the decrease of submergence depth z both maximum horizontal and vertical forces increase this is because when the plate is set closer to the free surface that contains most wave energy where the velocity field of solitary wave crest is strongly disturbed by the plate the hydrodynamic forces increase with z decreases the occurrence time of the peak force is postponed and this postponing may be caused by the delay of appearance of the wave crest as illustrated in fig 6 b comparing fig 9 a with fig 9 b it can be seen that the vertical force is affected much by different submergence depths than the horizontal force in fig 9 a the horizontal forces calculated for cases of z 0 4 and z 0 6 nearly coincide with each other and it has a rapid increase for the case of z 0 2 this phenomenon accords with the free surface elevation in fig 6 b and thus suggests that below a certain depth the influence of the submergence depth on horizontal forces can be neglected fig 9 b demonstrates that with the decrease of submergence depth z the duration of vertical forces extends another characteristic is that the asymmetry of uplift force and downward force varies with different z the quotient of downward force and uplift force is defined as an asymmetric index the asymmetric indexes for these 3 cases z 0 6 0 4 and 0 2 are 1 81 1 60 and 1 31 respectively it can be seen that with the submergence depth decreases the distinction between downward force and uplift force decreases for the case of z 0 2 the occurrence time instants of positive force negative force uplift force and downward force are t 8 406 s 8 806 s 8 319 s and 8 663 s respectively these occurrence time instants of each component peak force are compared with the unilateral peak force on one side of body in figs 10 and 11 unilateral forces are presented in fig 10 by decomposing hydrodynamic forces on the whole plate surface into forces on 4 surfaces left right top and bottom sides of the plate fig 10 a and b are horizontal forces acting on 4 sides fig 10 c and d are for the vertical forces the ordinate of fig 10 b exceeds fig 10 a by two orders of magnitude while the ordinate of fig 10 c exceeds fig 10 d by three orders of magnitude from the comparison between fig 10 a and b the horizontal forces mainly act on the left weather side and right lee side of the plate occurrence time instants of positive force and negative force shown in fig 9 a accord with forces on the left side of the body reaching a maximum t 8 406 s and forces on the right side reaching a maximum t 8 806 s the effect of forces acting on the top and bottom surfaces on the occurrence time of horizontal peak forces is negligible in fig 10 c and d the vertical forces mainly focus on top and bottom side of the plate uplift force occurs at t 8 319 s which is earlier than forces reaching a maximum on the bottom surface t 8 388 s downward force occurs at t 8 663 s which is later than forces reaching a maximum on the top surface t 8 632 s fig 11 shows the friction force calculated by present cip method in the present case the maximum local reynolds number along the plate surface is re x u b ν 7 32 10 4 for the flat plate the transition reynolds number is about re x t r 5 10 5 thus the boundary layer along the flat plate can be treated as laminar and the blasius solution is available for the calculation of drag force the non dimensional drag coefficient is defined as c d 1 328 re 4 99 10 3 for laminar plate flow the total frictional drag force c d is twice the value of the skin friction coefficient at the trailing edge d 2 c d 1 2 ρ u 2 b l 0 081 n the friction force calculated by the cip model is 0 075 n and the difference from the blasius solution is within 10 the numerical results show that the frictional drag force acting on the flat plate is less than 0 3 of the total hydrodynamic forces for the present simulation with a larger wave amplitude of α 0 4 the viscous force on the plate surface is found of o 0 1 n m while the pressure related force is of o 10 n m hence the contribution of the viscous forces on the total hydrodynamic forces can be neglected at the present study case however the viscous effects still needs to be considered in the analysis of the fluid field for example the circulations found in velocity field in fig 15 and the vortex shedding process in fig 16 in which ignoring the viscosity would fail to predict these phenomenon 3 3 pressure distribution in fig 12 a d the pressure distribution at the time instants of the peak forces occurring is employed to illustrate the appearance of the maximum and the minimum forces and it can also provide insight view into how this horizontal barrier affects the solitary wave fig 12 e f show pressure distribution at the time instants of unilateral uplift force and unilateral downward force occurring which are not coincide with the occurrence time of the integrated peak force the pressure distribution presents the same law as the unilateral force shows at t 8 319 s uplift force occurs when concentrated pressure under the solitary wave crest is at the leading edge of the plate as shown in fig 12 a at t 8 406 s positive force occurs when the solitary wave arrives at the leading edge of plate where the pressure concentrates on the weather side as shown in fig 12 b at t 8 663 s downward force occurs when the wave crest is above the plate as shown in fig 12 c at t 8 806 s negative force occurs when the wave crest is close to the right side of the plate where the pressure concentration is at the lee side as shown in fig 12 d the pressure distribution in fig 12 e and f does not distinguish from fig 12 a and c though they are of distinct time instants the time of 4 peak forces occurring for 3 submergence depths z is also listed in table 2 with the submergence depth z decreases the peak force occurs later the sequence of the appearance for the peak force is uplift force positive force downward force and negative force 3 4 flow field figs 13 and 14 provide velocity fields at the submergence depth of z 0 2 for 2 different incident wave heights α 0 1 and α 0 4 respectively the velocity vectors are plotted at grids while the grids are skipped for clarity one thing needs to be mentioned is that although no slip condition is employed at the plate boundary the velocity vector at boundary is skipped so that s why the velocity vector seems like the same at the vicinity of the plate the unit length of the vector denotes the same value in figs 13 and 14 generally velocity field for the case of α 0 1 shown in fig 13 presents more moderate than that of α 0 4 in fig 14 strong nonlinear phenomenon such as wave breaking occurs with a relatively large wave height α 0 4 as the incident wave height increases the velocity vector has a longer length and more drastic variation with respect to direction and length wave breaking which induces the jet impinging on the free surface and air entrapment phenomenon occurs in the case of α 0 4 while that does not appear in the case of α 0 1 fig 13 a is the main wave crest acting on the top of the flat plate at t 9 93 s the deformation of the free surface is slight the vector in the velocity field is uniform except the small region in the vicinity of the plate end fig 13 b is the main wave crest leaving the plate during the entire progress of interaction the free surface and the velocity vector change slightly being similar with figs 3 d fig 14 a presents the moment of the critical scenarios before wave breaking and the wave front face is nearly perpendicular to the still water level this asymmetry also leads the particle velocities at the wave crest increasing to crest instability and wave breaking like in fig 14 b the wave crest curls up and forms a jet and is about to impinge on the free surface in fig 14 c jet impinges on the free surface and involves air into the fluid phase the circles appearing in the impingement region are benefitted from the using of a vof type free surface capturing method the density flux is divided into 20 contours with an openness coefficient of 0 05 the closed circle in the impingement area indicates that this region is not entirely composed of fluid phase hsiao and lin 2010 point out that their numerical model based on a vof type also has this phenomenon another thing needs to be noticed is that the velocity of air phase can be obtained as well since the air phase is defined as one phase in the calculation fig 15 shows the velocity field at t 8 82 s after the solitary wave propagates over the flat plate the time instant of t 8 82 s is chosen because a striking phenomenon occurs two circulations in each end of the flat plate the circulation might be due to the shedding of vortices which are further proved in fig 16 d since the circulation is caused by vortices the numerical models based on the potential theory which ignores the viscosity fail to predict this phenomenon as illustrated by carter et al 2006 this phenomenon has also been discovered in experiments poupardin et al 2012 two circulations remain at the upstream and downstream in the vicinity of two ends of the plate larger velocity is observed in the circulation compared with that in the nearby region left circulation is anti clockwise while the right one is clockwise another distinguishing characteristic of these 2 circulations is that the lee side circulation has a larger circumference than the weather side this may be because the viscosity at the lee side is more considerable than that at the weather side liu et al 2009 calculate reflection coefficient using the potential theory and found that the weather side results agree well with the measurement and thus the conclusion is obtained that viscosity is only important at the lee side of the plate poupardin et al 2012 also indicate that when the potential theory was employed results of the weather side which are little affected by the viscosity agree better with the experimental data in the present cip model vorticity is calculated by v x u y using the central differencing scheme fig 16 presents the vorticity field of one case z 0 2 α 0 4 in the vicinity of the flat plate direction of rotation is defined by different colors clockwise vortices are portrayed by blue while anti clockwise direction is defined as red generally both two directions of vortices appear in the interaction progress the vorticity field mainly consists of two parts one is the main vortex underneath the water level another one is the vortex generating at the free surface in fig 16 a the main vortices generated at 4 vertices of the plate and the extent of development distinguishes from each other the northwestern vortex is the first vortex which is about to shed fig 16 b presents the moment when the wave crest is in the critical state to form a jet and impinge on the free surface the vorticity at the free surface reaches its maximum and a vorticity intensity is obviously observed at the overturning jet the northwestern vortex shedding in fig 16 a moves along the top edge of the plate to downstream and partially participates in the formation of the northeastern vortex the southwestern vortex has a concentrated core and the density of the vortex decreases with the distance away from the core as illustrated by the fading in color then the southwestern vortex begins to shed and the density of the vortex attenuates due to diffusion during the shedding which can be seen from fig 16 c d the whole vortex evolution progress is similar to the turbulence intensity variety during the solitary wave over a bottom mounted barrier investigated by wu et al 2012 fig 16 d is at the time instant that the same with fig 15 by comparing these two images it can be found that the location of velocity circulation in fig 15 is the shedding vortices in fig 16 d this phenomenon proves that the circulation formed in fig 15 is caused by the vortex and the present cip model which considers the viscosity can simulate the flow field elaborately 4 conclusions the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged flat plate was studied numerically by a newly developed cip based cartesian grid method a series of numerical simulations with constant water depth involving 4 wave heights and 3 submergence depths were carried out the calculated results were validated by the published experimental data the free surface elevation and hydrodynamic forces were compared with respect to different incident wave heights and submergence depths fluid fields including the pressure distribution velocity vector and vorticity fields were illustrated and analyzed the results show that the present model simulated velocity and vortex field well the present numerical model has the ability to simulate the stages of interaction between solitary waves and plate and is capable of quantitative prediction of nonlinear wave structure interaction problems acknowledgements this work was supported by national natural
