16285,advanced nutrient removal in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs can reduce coastal eutrophication but can increase economic costs and indirect environmental impacts associated with energy and materials usage for wrrf construction and operation a strategy of interest to reduce coastal eutrophication is the cultivation of seaweeds in proximity to wrrf discharge plumes to bioextract nutrients from coastal waters we report economic and environmental trade offs of this proposed strategy for a 1 170 m3 d 1 0 31 mgd wrrf in boothbay harbor maine targeting a water environment research federation werf level 2 effluent nitrogen goal of 3 mg n l 1 the scenarios investigated include wrrf upgrade and year round nutrient bioextractive aquaculture saccharina latissima and gracilaria tikvahiae cultivation with end uses of bioenergy feedstock fertilizer or food based on biomass production characteristics and tissue nitrogen contents in boothbay harbor an aquaculture site of 5 4 hectares would bioextract equivalent nitrogen mass as wrrf upgrade to meet level 2 nitrogen effluent goals using a techno economic analysis the cost of a wrrf upgrade was estimated to be 0 31 m 3 wastewater treated the cost of bioextractive seaweed aquaculture depended on beneficial use of seaweed if dried and sold as sea vegetables for human consumption a net revenue of 0 72 m 3 wastewater treated could be generated if dried and sold as commercial fertilizer the net cost of nutrient removal would be 0 26 m 3 wastewater treated less than the wrrf upgrade however if anaerobically digested to produce biogas the net cost of treatment was estimated to be 0 499 m 3 wastewater treated wrrf upgrade and bioextractive aquaculture significantly reduced marine eutrophication bioextractive aquaculture with use as biofuel feedstock had the best performance on human carcinogenic toxicity global warming and fossil resource scarcity marine ecotoxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity use of seaweed product as sea vegetables was favorable considering human non carcinogenic toxicity marine eutrophication freshwater eutrophication and terrestrial ecotoxicity the study results imply that nutrient bioextraction by seaweed aquaculture may be attractive as an alternative to advanced nutrient removal technologies in small coastal wrrfs providing potential economic and environmental benefits for nutrient management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment macroalgae nutrient management bioextraction life cycle assessment techno economic analysis 1 introduction coastal water bodies have multiple nutrient inputs that include point source discharges e g water resource recovery facility wrrf discharges and nonpoint sources such as runoff from agricultural operations lawn fertilization and urban runoff howarth 2008 kim et al 2014 scavia and bricker 2007 agricultural runoff is considered the primary contributor of nutrients to rivers streams and estuaries in the u s which lead to coastal eutrophication nevertheless wrrf effluents remain significant sources of nutrient inputs to coastal waters and have remained a priority for reduction of coastal eutrophication kim et al 2014 while advanced nutrient removal technologies in wrrfs can improve effluent water quality they also incur economic costs and indirect environmental impacts associated with energy and materials resources for construction and operation especially for small plants the sum of which along a coastline can be significant nutrient contributors foley et al 2010 rahman et al 2016 cultivated macroalgae grow rapidly and extract nutrients incorporated in their tissues from coastal waters upon harvest their environmental benefits including those to integrated multitrophic aquaculture are well reported kim et al 2014 klinger and naylor 2012 macroalgae are valued for human food animal feed fertilizer and as biofeedstocks for materials and energy production ghadiryanfar et al 2016 johnson et al 2014 mchugh 2003 global production of farmed aquatic algae dominated by seaweeds reached 32 4 million metric tons in 2018 and the seaweed market in the united states is increasing rapidly fao 2020 piconi et al 2020 while production is dominated by asian countries where the labor costs are lower technical advancements in the last 10 15 years have led to expanding production in europe and the u s fao 2020 mchugh 2003 although use of macroalgae cultivation to bioextract nutrients from coastal water bodies has been proposed research has yet to appropriately consider relationships between the elements of the food energy and water few security nexus including economic and environmental trade offs between civil infrastructure and operational demands aquaculture versus advanced wastewater treatment new information about these relationships is needed to assure appropriate decision making in the future improvement in one area of few security may impact others in unintended ways kim et al 2014 lindahl and kollberg 2009 this study evaluates environmental and economic trade offs associated with two options to reduce nutrients in coastal waters expansion of bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture or wrrf infrastructure upgrades to support life cycle assessment lca and technoeconomic analysis tea we use data from the boothbay harbor sewer district bhsd boothbay harbor maine where we have complementary data on long line cultivated macroalgae biomass growth rates and characteristics wrrf upgrades used in the model were consistent with existing infrastructure and site constraints for the bhsd and designed to meet a level 2 effluent nitrogen goal of 3 mg n l 1 wef 2010 bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture was designed to achieve the same nutrient removal by nitrogen mass based upon three potential end uses of cultivated macroalgae lca and tea explored environmental and economic trade offs of four scenarios to meet equivalent level 2 nitrogen effluent goals option 1 scenario a upgraded wrrf option 2 existing wrrf bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture with end use of seaweed as scenario b anaerobic digester ad biomass feedstock for combined heat and power with land application of ad effluent to offset chemical fertilizer scenario c dry seaweed fertilizer commercial product to offset chemical fertilizer scenario d dry seaweed commercial product for sale as human food sea vegetables 2 methods 2 1 bhsd wrrf simulation bhsd is a secondary municipal water resource recovery facility wrrf with an annual average flowrate of 1170 m3 d 1 0 31 mgd and design peak flowrate of 4540 m3 d 1 1 2 mgd it receives primarily municipal wastewater with heavier flows from restaurants associated with tourism during the summer months discharge in the summer months during peak tourism season average 1325 m3 d 1 0 35 mgd and during the winter off season average 1098 m3 d 1 0 29 mgd the wrrf operates with two sequencing batch reactor sbr tanks providing sedimentation and biological treatment following centrifugation for grit removal chlorine disinfection is practiced between mid may to the end of september before discharge to boothbay harbor a centrifuge is used for sludge dewatering prior to biosolids composting and land application both of which occur off site fig si 1 presents the layout of the bhsd wrrf gps x pro hydromantis environmental software solutions inc ontario canada was used to simulate bhsd wrrf performance and predict performance after upgrade influent characteristics listed in table 1 were based upon measured data provided by bhsd january 2014 through october 2018 recommended design parameters metcalf and eddy 2014 wef 2010 and when necessary gps x pro default parameters structural and operational parameters of the current processes were from the blueprint and operational files of the bhsd the upgrade design was constructed with minimal infrastructure alteration to meet water environment research federation werf recommendations for a level 2 nitrogen effluent goal of 3 0 mg n l 1 wef 2010 this was achieved by increasing the existing sbr tank number from two to four facilitating extended aeration and denitrification rashid et al 2020 added infrastructure requirements to achieve a werf level 2 phosphorus removal goal 0 10 mg p l 1 was site and cost prohibitive simulations were used to evaluate wastewater treatment performance in steady state additionally a monthly simulation for each design was completed using monthly average parameters to estimate the impact of seasonal changes on the bhsd and upgraded design performance influent characteristics and model coefficients by month are presented in table si 1 2 2 bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture simulation macroalgae considered for bioextractive aquaculture in this study included saccharina latissima and gracilaria tikvahiae s latissima is a winter crop typically grown in maine between late october and may g tikvahiae is a summer crop typically cultivated between july and october bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture was sized to achieve total nitrogen removal equivalent to that of the simulated bhsd wrrf upgrade based upon tissue elemental nitrogen contents and produced biomass at the time of harvest macroalgae absorb and fix nutrients during their growth phase and may store nutrients internally that are not incorporated into plant tissues increased environmental nutrient concentration may also increase biomass density and tissue nutrient contents however as a conservative estimate the potential impacts on biomass yield and tissue nutrient contents were excluded and it was assumed that only nutrients contained in the plant tissues at the time of harvest were removed data regarding s latissima biomass production characteristics biomass composition and nutrient uptake from coastal waters were previously collected from field trials in boothbay harbor maine and summarized from reported scientific literature from cultivation sites globally median values for g tikvahiae are used in this study and come from literature long line cultivation of s latissima and g tikvahiae were assumed for this study a section view and plan view of the seaweed farm site design is presented in fig si 2 briefly in each one hectare farm there are ten 248 m longlines with four meters of spacing between longlines we assumed a long narrow seaweed farm configuration based on flavin et al 2013 which reduces material required for construction and makes the aquaculture operation more convenient the space between longlines considered typical barge width for harvest and to reduce potential for crossed longlines during the growing season flavin et al 2013 peteiro and freire 2013 post harvested seaweed products considered include dry commercial fertilizer product biogas for combined heat and power via anaerobic digestion ad with land application of ad residuals and commercial dried food product biomethane potential of s latissima harvested from grow out in boothbay harbor was previously characterized in our laboratory using a biomethane potential test system ii yang 2014 additional reports of biogas production characteristics for s latissima and g tikvahiae were summarized from reported scientific literature to provide a range of expected characteristics biomass production rates and tissue characteristics of s latissima and g tikvahiae are reported in table si 2 2 3 cost analysis capital and operational costs associated with wrrf nutrient removal processes were estimated using capdetworks hydromantis environmental software solutions inc ontario canada which is based upon the computer assisted procedure for design and evaluation of wastewater treatment capdet model developed by the u s epa harris et al 1982 the estimated lifetime of the wrrf was 25 years glumrb 2014 solid waste from bhsd is composted and then land applied as fertilizer for grain which requires 120 km of transportation thus transportation distances assumed for this study were equivalent input parameters to capdetworks were populated from existing bhsd wrrf data and wrrf simulations produced in gps x pro as a quality check estimated bhsd capital cost for the existing wrrf simulated by capdetworks was compared with actual bhsd capital cost from 1995 both adjusted to 2020u s dollars similarly cost estimates of current bhsd operation from capdetworks was compared with actual 2018 bhsd operating cost data after adjustment to 2020u s dollars the costs of infrastructure upgrade for nutrient management were estimated based upon the difference between capital costs between new and existing wrrf construction which we assumed would balance upgrade costs considering reuse of some materials and demolition and reorganization of others macroalgae aquaculture cost estimates assume macroalgae can be sourced from existing hatcheries which is often done commercially at present thus capital costs of a macroalgae hatchery were not included as they would be encompassed in the purchase price of the sporelings operational costs associated with sufficient production of macroalgae in nurseries as well as capital and operational costs associated with deployment harvest further processing to products and the economic values of various seaweed products were included the lifespan of the seaweed farm site was assumed as 25 years to be equivalent to that of the wrrf with appropriate operation and maintenance requirements as reported below the production chain of s latissima aquaculture is presented in fig 1 data regarding macroalgae cultivation facility setup material use and labor costs were sourced from various scientific and technical publications flavin et al 2013 greene 2019 peteiro and freire 2013 piconi et al 2020 van oirschot et al 2017 and through interviews with owners of macroalgae nurseries and seaweed farms in maine olsen and piconi 2020 prices of materials were conservatively sourced from local or online stores actual costs for large sea farms are likely to benefit from scale standard procedures in capdetworks were used for calculation of wrrf amortization costs assuming an interest rate of 8 see si 1 for details the annual insurance and maintenance costs for macroalgae aquaculture were assumed to be 3 and 5 of capital costs respectively greene 2019 use of seaweed as ad biofuel feedstock was assumed to occur offsite as a co digestate in an existing anaerobic digester owing the lack of an existing anaerobic digester at the bhsd we assumed 120 km transportation distance of fresh biomass for co digestion in an agricultural anaerobic digester consistent with transportation distance for current land application of composted sewage sludge residuals for seaweed used as saleable commercial fertilizer the cultivated seaweed was assumed to be dried and ground before transportation for sea vegetables the seaweed was assumed to be dried before transportation but not ground for each case transportation distance was assumed to average 120 km although we also explored the effect of this distance on cost and environmental impact through sensitivity analysis in our models the capital cost of the seaweed dryer and grinder were excluded from our analyses assuming existing infrastructure equipment rental costs for seaweed drying and custom costs of seaweed grinding were acquired from government of saskatchewan 2020 and included equipment rental power units fuel and labor energy use of the dryer was from the life cycle inventory 2 4 life cycle assessment 2 4 1 goal and scope definitions the goal of the life cycle assessment was to evaluate the environmental impacts of tertiary treatment upgrade of the bhsd wrrf to achieve level 2 nutrient effluent goals of 3 mg n l 1 and 0 1 mg p l 1 versus bioextraction of an equivalent nutrient mass by seaweed with different seaweed end uses as a supplement to the current secondary bhsd wrrf design the functional unit was the environmental impact of treating 1 m3 of wastewater plant maintenance and decommissioning after the 25 year design lifespan were excluded the system boundary for the lca is presented in fig 2 the lca considered both the construction and operation phases for wastewater treatment and macroalgae aquaculture and processing as well as different end uses of harvested seaweed the products displaced by seaweed end production were included in the lca as a credit processes associated with the end life phase were ignored since they are negligible compared to the construction and operation phases rahman et al 2016 2 4 2 life cycle inventory the life cycle inventory lci for the wrrf includes use of concrete steel electricity and chemicals as well as greenhouse gas emissions during biological nutrient removal processes process unit sizes energy and chemical use and direct greenhouse gas emissions were acquired from bhsd carbon footprint models were developed in gps x pro the use of concrete and steel was proportional to the designed unit sizes usage was estimated from capdetworks simulations and the data reported by rahman et al 2016 the lci of existing and upgraded wrrf are presented in table si 3 to incorporate the use of biosolids as fertilizer they were assumed to substitute diammonium phosphate dap fertilizer based upon the phosphorus content itemization of the lci for macroalgae cultivation followed the inventory used for the cost analysis and is presented in table si 4 the avoided materials and energy were included in the lcis as a credit based on standard lcis in the uslci and ecoinvent 3 7 databases sea vegetables dry seaweed were assumed to be an alternative to land based vegetables fresh lettuce based upon fresh weight seaweed used as fertilizer was assumed to substitute for dap and urea fertilizer the produced biogas from anaerobic digestion with seaweed feedstock was assumed to displace biogas from anaerobic digestion with grass feedstock 2 4 3 life cycle impact assessment and interpretation life cycle impact assessment lcia was conducted with openlca recipe hierarchist a widely used midpoint lcia methodology owing its base upon the most common policy principles impact categories included human carcinogenic toxicity human non carcinogenic toxicity global warming marine eutrophication freshwater eutrophication fossil resource scarcity marine ecotoxicity freshwater ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity we note that impacts of land use and sea use were not included in our lcia in the context of this study land use and sea use are one sided impact categories that do not add value to the analysis sea use impacts are heavily weighted towards macroalgae aquaculture while land use impacts are heavily weighted towards expansion of wrrf infrastructure and lettuce growing as a trade off for sea vegetables methods for sea use impact assessment are only emerging and largely incomplete relative to land use langlois et al 2015 indeed a sea use impact category is not included in the recipe method or other major lcia methodologies as of the time of this research e g cml 2001 impact 2002 and traci considering any predicted impacts of land use or sea use could not be normalized to compare to one another it is worthwhile to further note that for this study the environmental impact on land use was minor compared to the impacts among other categories listed above less than 1 5 of the total environmental impacts according to normalization while we recognize that conflicts may arise regarding sea use for macroalgae aquaculture with other activities of interest e g lobster fishing we assume these activities will be appropriately negotiated and licensed 3 results 3 1 scenario design the gps x pro model frameworks based upon the existing bhsd wrrf and an upgraded design for additional nutrient removal to achieve the werf level 2 effluent nitrogen goal 3 mg l 1 are presented in fig si 3 table 2 presents the five year annual average effluent quality for the bhsd wrrf alongside steady state gps x pro simulation results for the existing wrrf and upgraded design the detailed sbr design and operational parameters in the existing and upgraded wrrf simulations are presented in table si 5 the existing wrrf has two sbr tanks with a four hour total cycle time including two hours of aeration and 0 83 h of sedimentation the short total cycle time limits nitrification and denitrification thus limits nitrogen removal the upgraded design doubled the sbr tanks to four doubling the total cycle time including aeration and settling phases this facilitated nitrogen removal to meet on annual average the werf level 2 effluent nitrogen effluent goal of 3 mg n l 1 table 2 the proposed upgrade could only achieve an effluent quality of 0 23 mg p l 1 compared to 0 30 mg p l 1 for the present wrrf falling short of the werf level 2 phosphorus goal 0 1 mg p l 1 however site constraints limited further technology interventions boothbay harbor experiences heavy summer tourism that results in variable wastewater flow and quality between summer and winter seasons we accounted for these variations in our simulation on a month by month basis to yield more realistic results than an annual average would provide simulation results presented in fig 3 demonstrate reasonable fit between the gps x pro simulation and measured water quality data of the existing bhsd wrrf the upgraded wrrf simulation predicted decreased monthly discharge of tss between 56 and 63 reduction and bod between 45 and 86 reduction relative to the existing bhsd wrrf effluents it is worthwhile to note that the discharge of these pollutants from the existing bhsd wrrf are below permitted effluent limitations and thus not a required performance criterion of any potential upgrade total nitrogen effluent concentrations were also predicted to decrease 15 8 43 3 reduction except in march when the simulations predicted no more than 1 0 difference differences between the predicted effluent phosphorus concentrations of the existing bhsd wrrf and upgraded wrrf design remained marginal to the greatest extent possible actual data on bhsd influent quality were used in the simulations however lacking nutrient data the us average total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in raw wastewater were used this may have led to some differences between the simulated and actual effluent total nitrogen concentrations in fig 3 additionally since there are only five effluent nutrient concentration measurements reported by maine dep there is some added uncertainty provided rotational s latissima and g tikvahiae cultivation single grow out each a 5 4 hectare aquaculture site 0 126 m2 m 3 wastewater treated would be required to bioextract 1 79 mg n l 1 767 kg n yr 1 from the existing bhsd wrrf effluent to meet level 2 nitrogen effluent goals 3 mg l 1 phosphorus bioextraction would be 0 16 mg p l 1 70 kg p yr 1 yielding an equivalent effluent quality of 0 14 mg p l 1 while not achieving a level 2 phosphorus effluent goal 0 1 mg p l 1 it is 0 09 mg p l 1 less than the bhsd wrrf upgrade design s latissima cultivation accounted for bioextraction of 87 9 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 8 3 kg p ha 1 yr 1 while rotational g tikvahiae cultivation could increase bioextraction by an additional 54 2 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 4 7 kg p ha 1 yr 1 notably increasing the aquaculture site size to 6 6 hectares 0 154 m2 m 3 wastewater treated would result in sufficient bioextraction of phosphorus to achieve level 2 phosphorus removal goals fig si 4 presents for wrrfs of different plant flowrate q m 3 nitrogen effluent concentration neffluent mg n l 1 and phosphorus effluent concentration peffluent mg p l 1 the seaweed aquaculture site size m2 m 3 effluent required to trade differential nitrogen removal δn neffluent ntarget mg n l 1 and phosphorus removal δp peffluent ptarget mg p l 1 to achieve any target nitrogen or phosphorus goal 3 2 techno economic analysis cost estimates for the existing and upgraded wrrf are presented in table 3 along with actual costs from the bhsd wrrf as a reference the capital cost estimated by capdetworks 4490000 was 27 6 lower than the actual capital cost the difference was attributable to capdetworks use of the hydromantis 2014 database based upon u s average cost increased construction costs for the bhsd wrrf were associated with relatively the remote location simulated o m costs were only 2 6 higher than the actual costs at bhsd but there were larger differences in selected cost categories notably simulated labor costs were 13 1 higher than the actual labor costs reflecting lower regional labor rates and less than typical staffing of the bhsd wrrf labor costs reflect approximately 76 of the total annual o m costs on the other hand actual bhsd wrrf whole plant energy costs were nearly three times greater than the those estimated by capdetworks the difference may be attributable to the regional costs of energy versus nationwide average and that capdetworks estimates energy cost based upon energy requirements of the simulated unit operations and processes rather than whole plant energy requirements this study conservatively ignored added sludge produced by the upgraded wrrf which favors the wrrf upgrade approach over bioextraction based upon our simulations the project cost of treating one cubic meter of wastewater was 2 16 for the existing bhsd wrrf and 2 47 for the upgraded design thus 0 31 m 3 wastewater treated would be required to achieve werf level 2 effluent nitrogen goals by the wrrf plant upgrade described above costs estimated for s latissima and g tikvahiae bioextractive aquaculture are presented in table 4 with a more detailed cost inventory presented in table si 6 the total annual project cost of s latissima and g tikvahiae cultivation was estimated to be 259 250 assuming shared long line infrastructure for the cultivation of both species based upon tissue elemental nitrogen contents of the sum of annual grow out the cultivation costs of bioextractive aquaculture would be 0 50 m 3 wastewater treated costs of s latissima and g tikvahiae transportation and processing plus the seaweed selling price are reported in table 5 macroalgae had the greatest economic value when dried and sold as sea vegetables net revenues were estimated at 0 72 m 3 wastewater treated using a value of dry edible seaweed products of 15 43 kg 1 piconi et al 2020 notably bioextractive aquaculture would avoid costs of bhds wrrf upgrade of 0 31 m 3 wastewater treated producing greater economic incentive even though sale of dry and ground seaweeds as commercial fertilizer product would result in a net cost of 0 26 m 3 wastewater treated these costs would still compete favorably to bhsd wrrf upgrade net cost of 0 31 m 3 wastewater treated use of seaweed as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digestion on the other hand would have a net cost 0 499 m 3 wastewater treated favoring upgrade of the bhsd wrrf over this scenario from a cost perspective 3 3 life cycle impact assessment a comparison of the impacts of the existing bhsd wrrf and bioextraction scenarios a b c and d to achieve werf level 2 effluent nitrogen goals are shown in table si 7 and fig 4 positive values indicate environmental impact and negative values indicate environmental services according to the lcia normalization see table si 7 human carcinogenic toxicity fig 4 a yielded the greatest impacts among all the impact categories reinforcing steel production contributed 84 of the

lettuce reduced human carcinogenic toxicity by 0 0029 kg 1 4 dcb m 3 wastewater treated the most important contribution to human non carcinogenic toxicity fig 4 b and freshwater eutrophication fig 4 e was reinforcing steel production for the existing bhsd wrrf wrrf upgrade scenario a and bioextractive aquaculture with seaweed used as ad feedstock scenario b the major contributions of bioextractive aquaculture with commercial fertilizer production scenario c or sale as sea vegetables scenario d to these impact categories was seaweed drying for human non carcinogenic toxicity and freshwater eutrophication the best performing scenario was d mainly due to the substitution of lettuce with dry edible seaweed electricity use in the existing bhsd wrrf and scenario b bioextractive aquaculture with production of commercial fertilizer contributed most to global warming impacts fig 4 c greenhouse gas emissions from the sbr tanks of an upgraded wrrf were the greatest contributor to global warming impacts of scenario a seaweed drying scenarios c and d had significant influence on global warming impacts as the process was energy intensive sale of fresh sea vegetables may reduce needed drying but would increase refrigeration requirements almost certainly resulting in greater impacts use of farmed seaweed as ad feedstock scenario b had the lowest global warming impact 0 15 kg co2 eq

freshwater ecotoxicity fig 4 h mirrored human non carcinogenic toxicity the existing bhsd wrrf and bioextractive aquaculture with use of seaweeds as ad feedstock scenario b or sea vegetables scenario d had environmental benefits for both marine and freshwater ecotoxicity terrestrial ecotoxicity fig 7 i was greatest for an upgraded bhsd wrrf scenario a predominantly attributable to reinforcing steel production by comparison electricity use was the greatest contributor to terrestrial ecotoxicity in the existing bhsd wrrf and for use of seaweed as ad feedstock scenario b seaweed drying negatively impacted terrestrial ecotoxicity when seaweed was used for commercial fertilizer scenario c or dry sea vegetables scenario d none the less terrestrial ecotoxicity was least for bioextractive aquaculture with use of seaweed as sea vegetables scenario d primarily owing to displacement of land based lettuce production 4 discussion this study investigated life cycle environmental and economic tradeoffs of nutrient management alternatives for the bhsd wrrf to achieve the werf level 2 nutrient effluent goals alternatives included an upgraded wrrf design fig 2 scenario a and bioextractive seaweed aquaculture with three different end uses of produced seaweed fig 2 scenarios b c and d it is important to first contextualize the nutrient trading aspects of this research nutrient trading programs are only emerging in the u s kim et al 2014 the rules under which a municipal wrrf might trade their nutrient discharges in the study region in the future remain undefined at present here we provide an analysis regarding the environmental and economic trade offs of such an approach which could be useful to inform the formation of such nutrient trading programs in this specific context of obvious interest is whether the activity would require seaweed aquaculture to be placed within the outfall plume or whether it could be distributed such that regional licensed seaweed farms could take advantage of the added nutrient trading credits as an added revenue that encourages the growing seaweed aquaculture industry it is reasonable to expect that this may be wrrf specific some wrrfs discharge to coastal areas that experience significant mixing while others may be prone to more localized nutrient discharge effects booth bay harbor itself experiences strong semi diurnal tidal mixing with offshore gulf of maine coastal waters regardless we do not specify in our analysis any specific requirement for spatial co location to the wrrf outfall further we do not speculate any increase in seaweed growth rates that may occur when grown under nitrogen enrichment broch et al 2013 for example in a wrrf effluent plume with low mixing rather we assume growth rates equivalent to that measured locally outside the region of the wrrf outfall but potentially under the influence of the outfall plume contextually it is also important to note that regulations regarding sea vegetable safety for human consumption have yet to emerge in the u s there remains no guidance regarding safe growing areas for seaweeds or acceptable levels of human pathogens on sea vegetables as pointed out by barberi et al 2020 the u s food and drug administration only addresses sea vegetables through approval of dried macroalgal species for use as seasonings spices and flavorings not yet regulating their quality as produce u s fda 2018 studies on the microbiological safety of seaweed indicate relationships between water quality in seaweed growing areas and microbial load on seaweed products but the risks associated with their consumption are less well understood løvdal et al 2021 globally asian e g china and korea and european e g france and denmark countries have established standards for microbial load on ready to eat seaweed products as summarized by løvdal et al 2021 as indicated by these authors it is doubtful whether legislation from one part of the world can be transferred to other areas as well without taking several factors into account e g biological environmental social etc other factors such as setback distances or wastewater disinfection may also influence microbial load of fresh seaweed products when grown near wrrf outfalls but have yet to be studied considering the above we have assumed in this work heat dried seaweeds for market as sea vegetables and reserve investigation of fresh seaweed food products for a later time drying by thermal processing is known to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms and inhibit their growth on finished seaweed products intended for human consumption løvdal et al 2021 we do recognize that it is possible this may not be adequate to address future requirements regarding safe growing areas processing or microbial load however owing we cannot predict these requirements caveat emptor notably we also report results of alternative dispositions of interest that are not connected to the human food chain in our analysis the results of our study indicate that to trade the 1 79 mg l 1 total nitrogen that would be removed by an upgrade of the bhsd wrrf scenario a 5 4 hectares of seaweed cultivation would be required scenarios b c and d the harvested biomass of s latissima from the longline cultivation system of this study was estimated to be 18 1 kg fw m 1 based on prior measurements in boothbay harbor and was within the 3 0 to 28 4 kg fw m 1 reported preciously see table si 2 there are other systems such as dual layer deployment and net systems used for seaweed cultivation that have been reported to yield greater harvested biomass per cultivation area sharma et al 2018 such increased biomass density associated with advanced cultivation methods could significantly reduce the farm size requirements for nutrient trading and reduce costs over that reported in this study the standard seaweed farm lease issued by the maine department of marine resources dmr can be applied for seaweed farms up to 100 acres 40 5 ha and 20 years piconi et al 2020 even so total seaweed cultivation in maine accounted for only 26 ha in 2019 large scale seaweed cultivation sites in the us are limited large 50 200 m longline cultivation sites for seaweeds exist in asia and europe and the development of the maine farmed edible seaweed market is promising campbell et al 2019 piconi et al 2020 considering present scale of seaweed aquaculture operations in the u s together with the fact that small wrrfs have higher unit costs of wastewater treatment than larger ones use of nutrient bioextractive aquaculture as a supplement or alternative to wrrf upgrade favors small to mid sized wrrfs that is not to say this limits potential utility for reducing coastal nutrient mass flux from wrrf sources there are far greater small to medium sized wrrfs than large discharging nutrients to coastal areas for example fig si 5 presents a map of wrrfs located within 10 km of the coastline of maine only three of 54 of these wrrfs have an average discharge greater than 5 mgd 33 have an average flow rate of 0 5 mgd u s epa 2018 beyond favorable economics for many small to mid sized wrrfs such as that at bhsd the requisite added land use for wrrf upgrade may not be feasible while macroalgae cultivation requires very little terrestrial land interestingly impacts on marine eutrophication an impact category of primary interest was reduced approximately equally among all scenarios bhsd wrrf upgrade and bioextractive seaweed aquaculture over the do nothing approach the standout was sale of seaweed as sea vegetables to displace land based lettuce production this scenario also resulted in the lowest potential for freshwater eutrophication among the scenarios investigated for practical reasons this study assumed steady state year round nutrient bioextraction by macroalgae while we assumed alternating macroalgae deployments of g tikvahiae and s latissima to improve year round bioextraction it is worthwhile to note that there are gaps in coverage considering typical growing seasons there are also differences in bioextraction efficacy between these two organisms that would play out seasonally with reduced bioextraction during g tikvahiae cultivation in the summer versus s latissima during winter months further we fully expect periods of slower and accelerated bioextraction during the natural growth cycle of these macroalgae however these are ill defined in the literature and thus where not captured within our study lowered precision in the timing of bioextraction in this study may have implications among modeled environmental impacts and are worthy of follow up investigation considering wastewater treatment we have greater precision in our model of nutrient loading dynamics the bhsd has greater discharge flowrate during the tourist season in summer months than the rest of the year which could exacerbate potential seasonal imbalance of nutrient discharge versus bioextraction in boothbay harbor on the other hand monthly average bhsd simulation results presented in fig 3 show the sbr process has improved nitrogen removal performance in the summer with increased wastewater temperatures that may temper in part the imbalance one strategy to improve precision nutrient bioextraction could be to diversify macroalgae cultivars throughout the year and control of the scale of grow out within the licensed farm site to meet more specifically nutrient trading goals table si 8 presents a calendar for grow out of select macroalgae that can be cultivated in maine cultivation of seaweed in this study was estimated to cost 7 66 per kilogram dry weight 2020u s dollars this is lower than previously reported nursery and farm costs of kelp cultivation of 12 30 to 12 90 per kilogram dry weight assuming 10 solid content van dijk et al 2015 yarish et al 2017 in our work we assume an existing nursery lower capital construction and equipment costs which may account for 3 05 of the difference based upon the study of yarish et al 2017 hatchery stage costs of s latissima and g tikvahiae in our study were 6 03 per spool close to the 7 14 to 10 00 spool price as delivered from our own facilities at bigelow laboratory for ocean sciences in boothbay harbor and other nurseries in maine there has been keen interest in the production of seaweed as a biofuel feedstock here we demonstrate that use of harvested macroalgae as anaerobic digestion feedstock to produce biogas with land application of ad residuals to displace chemical fertilizer largely decreases the economic value of cultivated macroalgae based upon the experience of industry who prefer to sell seaweeds as food this is not surprising the feasibility of using seaweed to produce biofuel by anaerobic digestion has been previously investigated and reported to be feasible dave et al 2013 soleymani and rosentrater 2017 the breakeven electricity selling prices were estimated at 0 16 to 0 24 per kwh about 23 1 to 84 6 higher than the average u s electricity price in 2020 however estimated macroalgae cultivation costs were more than two orders of magnitude lower in these studies e g 0 05 per kg dry weight in dave et al 2013 than our estimate in this study and others recently reported van dijk et al 2015 yarish et al 2017 significant technological advancement is needed to reduce production costs before this option will be economically viable it is worthwhile to note that bioextractive seaweed aquaculture with use of seaweed as a feedstock for anaerobic digestion resulted in improved environmental performance in all impact categories except for marine eutrophication when compared to the existing or upgraded bhsd wrrf an important outcome of this work is that bioextractive seaweed aquaculture as an alternative to wrrf tertiary treatment upgrade to achieve level 2 effluent nitrogen goals could facilitate nutrient management at wrrfs with net positive revenue if harvested seaweeds were sold as sea vegetables if sold as commercial seaweed fertilizer the costs of nutrient management may also be favorable over wrrf upgrade although not revenue generating aside from an increase in fossil resource scarcity and slight increase in global warming and human carcinogenic toxicity the environmental tradeoffs were favorable for bioextractive seaweed aquaculture to produce dried sea vegetables over the bhsd wrrf upgrade provided displacement of land based lettuce production on the other hand bioextractive seaweed aquaculture with sale of dried and milled seaweed as commercial fertilizer led to increased environmental impacts on all the categories except for marine eutrophication when compared to upgrade of the bhsd wrrf to manage nutrients whether for food or fertilizer the drying process was the most significant contributor to the increased environmental impacts on all the categories except for marine eutrophication this agreed with results of van oirschot et al 2017 the lci of this study assumed the use of electricity and natural gas for seaweed drying alterative and more sustainable drying schemes that do not use fossil energy could significantly reduce impacts for example thomas et al 2020 conducted a life cycle assessment and compared the environmental impacts of alternative seaweed preservation methods their results indicate that outdoor hang drying dramatically improved the environmental performance over thermal drying seaweed freezing led to the greatest impacts among seaweed preservation methods in our own work drying near the aquaculture site reduced transportation costs by a factor of 4 5 from 0 000015 km 1 m 3 to 0 00007 km 1 m 3 wastewater treated and reduced net environmental impacts based on the lcia fig 4 however the importance of transportation was limited among all drivers of environmental impacts the discussion above lends that under the correct conditions nutrient trading schemes could be constructed for bioextractive aquaculture that would be economically and environmentally advantageous over tertiary treatment upgrades at wrrfs these trading programs could supplement the emerging seaweed aquaculture industry in the u s an industry that often operates with thin margins the work contemplates avenues of further investigation for example the usda nop national organic program ruled that organic sea vegetables cultivated from maine s coastal waters should be at least 4 8 km three miles distant wrrf discharge considering we used the lower non organic seaweed price as sea vegetables in our study piconi et al 2020 nutrient trading schemes where seaweeds are grown closer to wrrf discharge may offset differences in the value of organic versus non organic sea vegetables expanding profitable grow out locations for aquaculture site licensing to facilitate that possibility further research is needed regarding safe setback distances for sea vegetable cultivation from wastewater treatment plant outfalls for a land based analog for lettuce production see our prior work jahne et al 2016 willingness to buy should also be investigated as it may impact the macroalgae price 5 conclusion bioprocess upgrade of bhsd wrrf doubling existing sbr tankage to facilitate nitrification denitrification achieved a werf level 2 nitrogen effluent goal of 3 mg n l 1 nutrient bioextractive aquaculture 5 4 hectares of s latissima and g tikvahiae seasonal crop rotation could achieve equivalent nitrogen effluent goals with 0 09 mg p l 1 greater phosphorus removal than the bhsd wrrf upgrade could achieve costs of bioextractive aquaculture with the use of seaweeds as high value fertilizers 0 26 m 3 wastewater treated was competitive to wrrf upgrade costs 0 31 m 3 wastewater treated if seaweeds were dried and sold as sea vegetables nutrient removal could be achieved with a revenue of as much as 0 72 m 3 wastewater treated bhsd wrrf upgrade could reduce marine eutrophication potential but would result in increased environmental impacts in all remaining categories explored nutrient bioextractive aquaculture resulted in mixed trade offs dependent on the use of harvested seaweed biomass and products displaced some of which drove environmental benefits bioextractive aquaculture with harvested seaweed used as biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digestion or sea

16285,advanced nutrient removal in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs can reduce coastal eutrophication but can increase economic costs and indirect environmental impacts associated with energy and materials usage for wrrf construction and operation a strategy of interest to reduce coastal eutrophication is the cultivation of seaweeds in proximity to wrrf discharge plumes to bioextract nutrients from coastal waters we report economic and environmental trade offs of this proposed strategy for a 1 170 m3 d 1 0 31 mgd wrrf in boothbay harbor maine targeting a water environment research federation werf level 2 effluent nitrogen goal of 3 mg n l 1 the scenarios investigated include wrrf upgrade and year round nutrient bioextractive aquaculture saccharina latissima and gracilaria tikvahiae cultivation with end uses of bioenergy feedstock fertilizer or food based on biomass production characteristics and tissue nitrogen contents in boothbay harbor an aquaculture site of 5 4 hectares would bioextract equivalent nitrogen mass as wrrf upgrade to meet level 2 nitrogen effluent goals using a techno economic analysis the cost of a wrrf upgrade was estimated to be 0 31 m 3 wastewater treated the cost of bioextractive seaweed aquaculture depended on beneficial use of seaweed if dried and sold as sea vegetables for human consumption a net revenue of 0 72 m 3 wastewater treated could be generated if dried and sold as commercial fertilizer the net cost of nutrient removal would be 0 26 m 3 wastewater treated less than the wrrf upgrade however if anaerobically digested to produce biogas the net cost of treatment was estimated to be 0 499 m 3 wastewater treated wrrf upgrade and bioextractive aquaculture significantly reduced marine eutrophication bioextractive aquaculture with use as biofuel feedstock had the best performance on human carcinogenic toxicity global warming and fossil resource scarcity marine ecotoxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity use of seaweed product as sea vegetables was favorable considering human non carcinogenic toxicity marine eutrophication freshwater eutrophication and terrestrial ecotoxicity the study results imply that nutrient bioextraction by seaweed aquaculture may be attractive as an alternative to advanced nutrient removal technologies in small coastal wrrfs providing potential economic and environmental benefits for nutrient management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment macroalgae nutrient management bioextraction life cycle assessment techno economic analysis 1 introduction coastal water bodies have multiple nutrient inputs that include point source discharges e g water resource recovery facility wrrf discharges and nonpoint sources such as runoff from agricultural operations lawn fertilization and urban runoff howarth 2008 kim et al 2014 scavia and bricker 2007 agricultural runoff is considered the primary contributor of nutrients to rivers streams and estuaries in the u s which lead to coastal eutrophication nevertheless wrrf effluents remain significant sources of nutrient inputs to coastal waters and have remained a priority for reduction of coastal eutrophication kim et al 2014 while advanced nutrient removal technologies in wrrfs can improve effluent water quality they also incur economic costs and indirect environmental impacts associated with energy and materials resources for construction and operation especially for small plants the sum of which along a coastline can be significant nutrient contributors foley et al 2010 rahman et al 2016 cultivated macroalgae grow rapidly and extract nutrients incorporated in their tissues from coastal waters upon harvest their environmental benefits including those to integrated multitrophic aquaculture are well reported kim et al 2014 klinger and naylor 2012 macroalgae are valued for human food animal feed fertilizer and as biofeedstocks for materials and energy production ghadiryanfar et al 2016 johnson et al 2014 mchugh 2003 global production of farmed aquatic algae dominated by seaweeds reached 32 4 million metric tons in 2018 and the seaweed market in the united states is increasing rapidly fao 2020 piconi et al 2020 while production is dominated by asian countries where the labor costs are lower technical advancements in the last 10 15 years have led to expanding production in europe and the u s fao 2020 mchugh 2003 although use of macroalgae cultivation to bioextract nutrients from coastal water bodies has been proposed research has yet to appropriately consider relationships between the elements of the food energy and water few security nexus including economic and environmental trade offs between civil infrastructure and operational demands aquaculture versus advanced wastewater treatment new information about these relationships is needed to assure appropriate decision making in the future improvement in one area of few security may impact others in unintended ways kim et al 2014 lindahl and kollberg 2009 this study evaluates environmental and economic trade offs associated with two options to reduce nutrients in coastal waters expansion of bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture or wrrf infrastructure upgrades to support life cycle assessment lca and technoeconomic analysis tea we use data from the boothbay harbor sewer district bhsd boothbay harbor maine where we have complementary data on long line cultivated macroalgae biomass growth rates and characteristics wrrf upgrades used in the model were consistent with existing infrastructure and site constraints for the bhsd and designed to meet a level 2 effluent nitrogen goal of 3 mg n l 1 wef 2010 bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture was designed to achieve the same nutrient removal by nitrogen mass based upon three potential end uses of cultivated macroalgae lca and tea explored environmental and economic trade offs of four scenarios to meet equivalent level 2 nitrogen effluent goals option 1 scenario a upgraded wrrf option 2 existing wrrf bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture with end use of seaweed as scenario b anaerobic digester ad biomass feedstock for combined heat and power with land application of ad effluent to offset chemical fertilizer scenario c dry seaweed fertilizer commercial product to offset chemical fertilizer scenario d dry seaweed commercial product for sale as human food sea vegetables 2 methods 2 1 bhsd wrrf simulation bhsd is a secondary municipal water resource recovery facility wrrf with an annual average flowrate of 1170 m3 d 1 0 31 mgd and design peak flowrate of 4540 m3 d 1 1 2 mgd it receives primarily municipal wastewater with heavier flows from restaurants associated with tourism during the summer months discharge in the summer months during peak tourism season average 1325 m3 d 1 0 35 mgd and during the winter off season average 1098 m3 d 1 0 29 mgd the wrrf operates with two sequencing batch reactor sbr tanks providing sedimentation and biological treatment following centrifugation for grit removal chlorine disinfection is practiced between mid may to the end of september before discharge to boothbay harbor a centrifuge is used for sludge dewatering prior to biosolids composting and land application both of which occur off site fig si 1 presents the layout of the bhsd wrrf gps x pro hydromantis environmental software solutions inc ontario canada was used to simulate bhsd wrrf performance and predict performance after upgrade influent characteristics listed in table 1 were based upon measured data provided by bhsd january 2014 through october 2018 recommended design parameters metcalf and eddy 2014 wef 2010 and when necessary gps x pro default parameters structural and operational parameters of the current processes were from the blueprint and operational files of the bhsd the upgrade design was constructed with minimal infrastructure alteration to meet water environment research federation werf recommendations for a level 2 nitrogen effluent goal of 3 0 mg n l 1 wef 2010 this was achieved by increasing the existing sbr tank number from two to four facilitating extended aeration and denitrification rashid et al 2020 added infrastructure requirements to achieve a werf level 2 phosphorus removal goal 0 10 mg p l 1 was site and cost prohibitive simulations were used to evaluate wastewater treatment performance in steady state additionally a monthly simulation for each design was completed using monthly average parameters to estimate the impact of seasonal changes on the bhsd and upgraded design performance influent characteristics and model coefficients by month are presented in table si 1 2 2 bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture simulation macroalgae considered for bioextractive aquaculture in this study included saccharina latissima and gracilaria tikvahiae s latissima is a winter crop typically grown in maine between late october and may g tikvahiae is a summer crop typically cultivated between july and october bioextractive macroalgae aquaculture was sized to achieve total nitrogen removal equivalent to that of the simulated bhsd wrrf upgrade based upon tissue elemental nitrogen contents and produced biomass at the time of harvest macroalgae absorb and fix nutrients during their growth phase and may store nutrients internally that are not incorporated into plant tissues increased environmental nutrient concentration may also increase biomass density and tissue nutrient contents however as a conservative estimate the potential impacts on biomass yield and tissue nutrient contents were excluded and it was assumed that only nutrients contained in the plant tissues at the time of harvest were removed data regarding s latissima biomass production characteristics biomass composition and nutrient uptake from coastal waters were previously collected from field trials in boothbay harbor maine and summarized from reported scientific literature from cultivation sites globally median values for g tikvahiae are used in this study and come from literature long line cultivation of s latissima and g tikvahiae were assumed for this study a section view and plan view of the seaweed farm site design is presented in fig si 2 briefly in each one hectare farm there are ten 248 m longlines with four meters of spacing between longlines we assumed a long narrow seaweed farm configuration based on flavin et al 2013 which reduces material required for construction and makes the aquaculture operation more convenient the space between longlines considered typical barge width for harvest and to reduce potential for crossed longlines during the growing season flavin et al 2013 peteiro and freire 2013 post harvested seaweed products considered include dry commercial fertilizer product biogas for combined heat and power via anaerobic digestion ad with land application of ad residuals and commercial dried food product biomethane potential of s latissima harvested from grow out in boothbay harbor was previously characterized in our laboratory using a biomethane potential test system ii yang 2014 additional reports of biogas production characteristics for s latissima and g tikvahiae were summarized from reported scientific literature to provide a range of expected characteristics biomass production rates and tissue characteristics of s latissima and g tikvahiae are reported in table si 2 2 3 cost analysis capital and operational costs associated with wrrf nutrient removal processes were estimated using capdetworks hydromantis environmental software solutions inc ontario canada which is based upon the computer assisted procedure for design and evaluation of wastewater treatment capdet model developed by the u s epa harris et al 1982 the estimated lifetime of the wrrf was 25 years glumrb 2014 solid waste from bhsd is composted and then land applied as fertilizer for grain which requires 120 km of transportation thus transportation distances assumed for this study were equivalent input parameters to capdetworks were populated from existing bhsd wrrf data and wrrf simulations produced in gps x pro as a quality check estimated bhsd capital cost for the existing wrrf simulated by capdetworks was compared with actual bhsd capital cost from 1995 both adjusted to 2020u s dollars similarly cost estimates of current bhsd operation from capdetworks was compared with actual 2018 bhsd operating cost data after adjustment to 2020u s dollars the costs of infrastructure upgrade for nutrient management were estimated based upon the difference between capital costs between new and existing wrrf construction which we assumed would balance upgrade costs considering reuse of some materials and demolition and reorganization of others macroalgae aquaculture cost estimates assume macroalgae can be sourced from existing hatcheries which is often done commercially at present thus capital costs of a macroalgae hatchery were not included as they would be encompassed in the purchase price of the sporelings operational costs associated with sufficient production of macroalgae in nurseries as well as capital and operational costs associated with deployment harvest further processing to products and the economic values of various seaweed products were included the lifespan of the seaweed farm site was assumed as 25 years to be equivalent to that of the wrrf with appropriate operation and maintenance requirements as reported below the production chain of s latissima aquaculture is presented in fig 1 data regarding macroalgae cultivation facility setup material use and labor costs were sourced from various scientific and technical publications flavin et al 2013 greene 2019 peteiro and freire 2013 piconi et al 2020 van oirschot et al 2017 and through interviews with owners of macroalgae nurseries and seaweed farms in maine olsen and piconi 2020 prices of materials were conservatively sourced from local or online stores actual costs for large sea farms are likely to benefit from scale standard procedures in capdetworks were used for calculation of wrrf amortization costs assuming an interest rate of 8 see si 1 for details the annual insurance and maintenance costs for macroalgae aquaculture were assumed to be 3 and 5 of capital costs respectively greene 2019 use of seaweed as ad biofuel feedstock was assumed to occur offsite as a co digestate in an existing anaerobic digester owing the lack of an existing anaerobic digester at the bhsd we assumed 120 km transportation distance of fresh biomass for co digestion in an agricultural anaerobic digester consistent with transportation distance for current land application of composted sewage sludge residuals for seaweed used as saleable commercial fertilizer the cultivated seaweed was assumed to be dried and ground before transportation for sea vegetables the seaweed was assumed to be dried before transportation but not ground for each case transportation distance was assumed to average 120 km although we also explored the effect of this distance on cost and environmental impact through sensitivity analysis in our models the capital cost of the seaweed dryer and grinder were excluded from our analyses assuming existing infrastructure equipment rental costs for seaweed drying and custom costs of seaweed grinding were acquired from government of saskatchewan 2020 and included equipment rental power units fuel and labor energy use of the dryer was from the life cycle inventory 2 4 life cycle assessment 2 4 1 goal and scope definitions the goal of the life cycle assessment was to evaluate the environmental impacts of tertiary treatment upgrade of the bhsd wrrf to achieve level 2 nutrient effluent goals of 3 mg n l 1 and 0 1 mg p l 1 versus bioextraction of an equivalent nutrient mass by seaweed with different seaweed end uses as a supplement to the current secondary bhsd wrrf design the functional unit was the environmental impact of treating 1 m3 of wastewater plant maintenance and decommissioning after the 25 year design lifespan were excluded the system boundary for the lca is presented in fig 2 the lca considered both the construction and operation phases for wastewater treatment and macroalgae aquaculture and processing as well as different end uses of harvested seaweed the products displaced by seaweed end production were included in the lca as a credit processes associated with the end life phase were ignored since they are negligible compared to the construction and operation phases rahman et al 2016 2 4 2 life cycle inventory the life cycle inventory lci for the wrrf includes use of concrete steel electricity and chemicals as well as greenhouse gas emissions during biological nutrient removal processes process unit sizes energy and chemical use and direct greenhouse gas emissions were acquired from bhsd carbon footprint models were developed in gps x pro the use of concrete and steel was proportional to the designed unit sizes usage was estimated from capdetworks simulations and the data reported by rahman et al 2016 the lci of existing and upgraded wrrf are presented in table si 3 to incorporate the use of biosolids as fertilizer they were assumed to substitute diammonium phosphate dap fertilizer based upon the phosphorus content itemization of the lci for macroalgae cultivation followed the inventory used for the cost analysis and is presented in table si 4 the avoided materials and energy were included in the lcis as a credit based on standard lcis in the uslci and ecoinvent 3 7 databases sea vegetables dry seaweed were assumed to be an alternative to land based vegetables fresh lettuce based upon fresh weight seaweed used as fertilizer was assumed to substitute for dap and urea fertilizer the produced biogas from anaerobic digestion with seaweed feedstock was assumed to displace biogas from anaerobic digestion with grass feedstock 2 4 3 life cycle impact assessment and interpretation life cycle impact assessment lcia was conducted with openlca recipe hierarchist a widely used midpoint lcia methodology owing its base upon the most common policy principles impact categories included human carcinogenic toxicity human non carcinogenic toxicity global warming marine eutrophication freshwater eutrophication fossil resource scarcity marine ecotoxicity freshwater ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity we note that impacts of land use and sea use were not included in our lcia in the context of this study land use and sea use are one sided impact categories that do not add value to the analysis sea use impacts are heavily weighted towards macroalgae aquaculture while land use impacts are heavily weighted towards expansion of wrrf infrastructure and lettuce growing as a trade off for sea vegetables methods for sea use impact assessment are only emerging and largely incomplete relative to land use langlois et al 2015 indeed a sea use impact category is not included in the recipe method or other major lcia methodologies as of the time of this research e g cml 2001 impact 2002 and traci considering any predicted impacts of land use or sea use could not be normalized to compare to one another it is worthwhile to further note that for this study the environmental impact on land use was minor compared to the impacts among other categories listed above less than 1 5 of the total environmental impacts according to normalization while we recognize that conflicts may arise regarding sea use for macroalgae aquaculture with other activities of interest e g lobster fishing we assume these activities will be appropriately negotiated and licensed 3 results 3 1 scenario design the gps x pro model frameworks based upon the existing bhsd wrrf and an upgraded design for additional nutrient removal to achieve the werf level 2 effluent nitrogen goal 3 mg l 1 are presented in fig si 3 table 2 presents the five year annual average effluent quality for the bhsd wrrf alongside steady state gps x pro simulation results for the existing wrrf and upgraded design the detailed sbr design and operational parameters in the existing and upgraded wrrf simulations are presented in table si 5 the existing wrrf has two sbr tanks with a four hour total cycle time including two hours of aeration and 0 83 h of sedimentation the short total cycle time limits nitrification and denitrification thus limits nitrogen removal the upgraded design doubled the sbr tanks to four doubling the total cycle time including aeration and settling phases this facilitated nitrogen removal to meet on annual average the werf level 2 effluent nitrogen effluent goal of 3 mg n l 1 table 2 the proposed upgrade could only achieve an effluent quality of 0 23 mg p l 1 compared to 0 30 mg p l 1 for the present wrrf falling short of the werf level 2 phosphorus goal 0 1 mg p l 1 however site constraints limited further technology interventions boothbay harbor experiences heavy summer tourism that results in variable wastewater flow and quality between summer and winter seasons we accounted for these variations in our simulation on a month by month basis to yield more realistic results than an annual average would provide simulation results presented in fig 3 demonstrate reasonable fit between the gps x pro simulation and measured water quality data of the existing bhsd wrrf the upgraded wrrf simulation predicted decreased monthly discharge of tss between 56 and 63 reduction and bod between 45 and 86 reduction relative to the existing bhsd wrrf effluents it is worthwhile to note that the discharge of these pollutants from the existing bhsd wrrf are below permitted effluent limitations and thus not a required performance criterion of any potential upgrade total nitrogen effluent concentrations were also predicted to decrease 15 8 43 3 reduction except in march when the simulations predicted no more than 1 0 difference differences between the predicted effluent phosphorus concentrations of the existing bhsd wrrf and upgraded wrrf design remained marginal to the greatest extent possible actual data on bhsd influent quality were used in the simulations however lacking nutrient data the us average total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in raw wastewater were used this may have led to some differences between the simulated and actual effluent total nitrogen concentrations in fig 3 additionally since there are only five effluent nutrient concentration measurements reported by maine dep there is some added uncertainty provided rotational s latissima and g tikvahiae cultivation single grow out each a 5 4 hectare aquaculture site 0 126 m2 m 3 wastewater treated would be required to bioextract 1 79 mg n l 1 767 kg n yr 1 from the existing bhsd wrrf effluent to meet level 2 nitrogen effluent goals 3 mg l 1 phosphorus bioextraction would be 0 16 mg p l 1 70 kg p yr 1 yielding an equivalent effluent quality of 0 14 mg p l 1 while not achieving a level 2 phosphorus effluent goal 0 1 mg p l 1 it is 0 09 mg p l 1 less than the bhsd wrrf upgrade design s latissima cultivation accounted for bioextraction of 87 9 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 8 3 kg p ha 1 yr 1 while rotational g tikvahiae cultivation could increase bioextraction by an additional 54 2 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 4 7 kg p ha 1 yr 1 notably increasing the aquaculture site size to 6 6 hectares 0 154 m2 m 3 wastewater treated would result in sufficient bioextraction of phosphorus to achieve level 2 phosphorus removal goals fig si 4 presents for wrrfs of different

estimates for the existing and upgraded wrrf are presented in table 3 along with actual costs from the bhsd wrrf as a reference the capital cost estimated by capdetworks 4490000 was 27 6 lower than the actual capital cost the difference was attributable to capdetworks use of the hydromantis 2014 database based upon u s average cost increased construction costs for the bhsd wrrf were associated with relatively the remote location simulated o m costs were only 2 6 higher than the actual costs at bhsd but there were larger differences in selected cost categories notably simulated labor costs were 13 1 higher than the actual labor costs reflecting lower regional labor rates and less than typical staffing of the bhsd wrrf labor costs reflect approximately 76 of the total annual o m costs on the other hand actual bhsd wrrf whole plant energy costs were nearly three times greater than the those estimated by capdetworks the difference may be attributable to the regional costs of energy versus nationwide average and that capdetworks estimates energy cost based upon energy requirements of the simulated unit operations and processes rather than whole plant energy requirements this study conservatively ignored added sludge produced by the upgraded wrrf which favors the wrrf upgrade approach over bioextraction based upon our simulations the project cost of treating one cubic meter of wastewater was 2 16 for the existing bhsd wrrf and 2 47 for the upgraded design thus 0 31 m 3 wastewater treated would be required to achieve werf level 2 effluent nitrogen goals by the wrrf plant upgrade described above costs estimated for s latissima and g tikvahiae bioextractive aquaculture are presented in table 4 with a more detailed cost inventory presented in table si 6 the total annual project cost of s latissima and g tikvahiae cultivation was estimated to be 259 250 assuming shared long line infrastructure for the cultivation of both species based upon tissue elemental nitrogen contents of the sum of annual grow out the cultivation costs of bioextractive aquaculture would be 0 50 m 3 wastewater treated costs of s latissima and g tikvahiae transportation and processing plus the seaweed selling price are reported in table 5 macroalgae had the greatest economic value when dried and sold as sea vegetables net revenues were estimated at 0 72 m 3 wastewater treated using a value of dry edible seaweed products of 15 43 kg 1 piconi et al 2020 notably bioextractive aquaculture would avoid costs of bhds wrrf upgrade of 0 31 m 3 wastewater treated producing greater economic incentive even though sale of dry and ground seaweeds as commercial fertilizer product would result in a net cost of 0 26 m 3 wastewater treated these costs would still compete favorably to bhsd wrrf upgrade net cost of 0 31 m 3 wastewater treated use of seaweed as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digestion on the other hand would have a net cost 0 499 m 3 wastewater treated favoring upgrade of the bhsd wrrf over this scenario from a cost perspective 3 3 life cycle impact assessment a comparison of the impacts of the existing bhsd wrrf and bioextraction scenarios a b c and d to achieve werf level 2 effluent nitrogen goals are shown in table si 7 and fig 4 positive values indicate environmental impact and negative values indicate environmental services

was reinforcing steel production for the existing bhsd wrrf wrrf upgrade scenario a and bioextractive aquaculture with seaweed used as ad feedstock scenario b the major contributions of bioextractive aquaculture with commercial fertilizer production scenario c or sale as sea vegetables scenario d to these impact categories was seaweed drying for human non carcinogenic toxicity and freshwater eutrophication the best performing scenario was d mainly due to the substitution of lettuce with dry edible seaweed electricity use in the existing bhsd wrrf and scenario b bioextractive aquaculture with production of commercial fertilizer contributed most to global warming impacts fig 4 c greenhouse gas emissions from the sbr tanks of an upgraded wrrf were the greatest contributor to global warming impacts of scenario a seaweed drying scenarios c and d had significant influence on global warming impacts as the process was energy intensive sale of fresh sea vegetables may reduce needed drying but would increase refrigeration requirements almost certainly resulting in greater impacts use of farmed seaweed as ad feedstock scenario b had the lowest global warming impact 0 15 kg co2 eq

bioextractive aquaculture with use of seaweed as sea vegetables scenario d primarily owing to displacement of land based lettuce production 4 discussion this study investigated life cycle environmental and economic tradeoffs of nutrient management alternatives for the bhsd wrrf to achieve the werf level 2 nutrient effluent goals alternatives included an upgraded wrrf design fig 2 scenario a and bioextractive seaweed aquaculture with three different end uses of produced seaweed fig 2 scenarios b c and d it is important to first contextualize the nutrient trading aspects of this research nutrient trading programs are only emerging in the u s kim et al 2014 the rules under which a municipal wrrf might trade their nutrient discharges in the study region in the future remain undefined at present here we provide an analysis regarding the environmental and economic trade offs of such an approach which could be useful to inform the formation of such nutrient trading programs in this specific context of obvious interest is whether the activity would require seaweed aquaculture to be placed within the outfall plume or whether it could be distributed such that regional licensed seaweed farms could take advantage of the added nutrient trading credits as an added revenue that encourages the growing seaweed aquaculture industry it is reasonable to expect that this may be wrrf specific some wrrfs discharge to coastal areas that experience significant mixing while others may be prone to more localized nutrient discharge effects booth bay harbor itself experiences strong semi diurnal tidal mixing with offshore gulf of maine coastal waters regardless we do not specify in our analysis any specific requirement for spatial co location to the wrrf outfall further we do not speculate any increase in seaweed growth rates that may occur when grown under nitrogen enrichment broch et al 2013 for example in a wrrf effluent plume with low mixing rather we assume growth rates equivalent to that measured locally outside the region of the wrrf outfall but potentially under the influence of the outfall plume contextually it is also important to note that regulations regarding sea vegetable safety for human consumption have yet to emerge in the u s there remains no guidance regarding safe growing areas for seaweeds or acceptable levels of human pathogens on sea vegetables as pointed out by barberi et al 2020 the u s food and drug administration only addresses sea vegetables through approval of dried macroalgal species for use as seasonings spices and flavorings not yet regulating their quality as produce u s fda 2018 studies on the microbiological safety of seaweed indicate relationships between water quality in seaweed growing areas and microbial load on seaweed products but the risks associated with their consumption are less well understood løvdal et al 2021 globally asian e g china and korea and european e g france and denmark countries have established standards for microbial load on ready to eat seaweed products as summarized by løvdal et al 2021 as indicated by these authors it is doubtful whether legislation from one part of the world can be transferred to other areas as well without taking several factors into account e g biological environmental social etc other factors such as setback distances or wastewater disinfection may also influence microbial load of fresh seaweed products when grown near wrrf outfalls but have yet to be studied considering the above we have assumed in this work heat dried seaweeds for market as sea vegetables and reserve investigation of fresh seaweed food products for a later time drying by thermal processing is known to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms and inhibit their growth on finished seaweed products intended for human consumption løvdal et al 2021 we do recognize that it is possible this may not be adequate to address future requirements regarding safe growing areas processing or microbial load however owing we cannot predict these requirements caveat emptor notably we also report results of alternative dispositions of interest that are not connected to the human food chain in our analysis the results of our study indicate that to trade the 1 79 mg l 1 total nitrogen that would be removed by an upgrade of the bhsd wrrf scenario a 5 4 hectares of seaweed cultivation would be required scenarios b c and d the harvested biomass of s latissima from the longline cultivation system of this study was estimated to be 18 1 kg fw m 1 based on prior measurements in boothbay harbor and was within the 3 0 to 28 4 kg fw m 1 reported preciously see table si 2 there are other systems such as dual layer deployment and net systems used for seaweed cultivation that have been reported to yield greater harvested biomass per cultivation area sharma et al 2018 such increased biomass density associated with advanced cultivation methods could significantly reduce the farm size requirements for nutrient trading and reduce costs over that reported in this study the standard seaweed farm lease issued by the maine department of marine resources dmr can be applied for seaweed farms up to 100 acres 40 5 ha and 20 years piconi et al 2020 even so total seaweed cultivation in maine accounted for only 26 ha in 2019 large scale seaweed cultivation sites in the us are limited large 50 200 m longline cultivation sites for seaweeds exist in asia and europe and the development of the maine farmed edible seaweed market is promising campbell et al 2019 piconi et al 2020 considering present scale of seaweed aquaculture operations in the u s together with the fact that small wrrfs have higher unit costs of wastewater treatment than larger ones use of nutrient bioextractive aquaculture as a supplement or alternative to wrrf upgrade favors small to mid sized wrrfs that is not to say this limits potential utility for reducing coastal nutrient mass flux from wrrf sources there are far greater small to medium sized wrrfs than large discharging nutrients to coastal areas for example fig si 5 presents a map of wrrfs located within 10 km of the coastline of maine only three of 54 of these wrrfs have an average discharge greater than 5 mgd 33 have an average flow rate of 0 5 mgd u s epa 2018 beyond favorable economics for many small to mid sized wrrfs such as that at bhsd the requisite added land use for wrrf upgrade may not be feasible while macroalgae cultivation requires very little terrestrial land interestingly impacts on marine eutrophication an impact category of primary interest was reduced approximately equally among all scenarios bhsd wrrf upgrade and bioextractive seaweed aquaculture over the do nothing approach the standout was sale of seaweed as sea vegetables to displace land based lettuce production this scenario also resulted in the lowest potential for freshwater eutrophication among the scenarios investigated for practical reasons this study assumed steady state year round nutrient bioextraction by macroalgae while we assumed alternating macroalgae deployments of g tikvahiae and s latissima to improve year round bioextraction it is worthwhile to note that there are gaps in coverage considering typical growing seasons there are also differences in bioextraction efficacy between these two organisms that would play out seasonally with reduced bioextraction during g tikvahiae cultivation in the summer versus s latissima during winter months further we fully expect periods of slower and accelerated bioextraction during the natural growth cycle of these macroalgae however these are ill defined in the literature and thus where not captured within our study lowered precision in the timing of bioextraction in this study may have implications among modeled environmental impacts and are worthy of follow up investigation considering wastewater treatment we have greater precision in our model of nutrient loading dynamics the bhsd has greater discharge flowrate during the tourist season in summer months than the rest of the year which could exacerbate potential seasonal imbalance of nutrient discharge versus bioextraction in boothbay harbor on the other hand monthly average bhsd simulation results presented in fig 3 show the sbr process has improved nitrogen removal performance in the summer with increased wastewater temperatures that may temper in part the imbalance one strategy to improve precision nutrient bioextraction could be to diversify macroalgae cultivars throughout the year and control of the scale of grow out within the licensed farm site to meet more specifically nutrient trading goals table si 8 presents a calendar for grow out of select macroalgae that can be cultivated in maine cultivation of seaweed in this study was estimated to cost 7 66 per kilogram dry weight 2020u s dollars this is lower than previously reported nursery and farm costs of kelp cultivation of 12 30 to 12 90 per kilogram dry weight assuming 10 solid content van dijk et al 2015 yarish et al 2017 in our work we assume an existing nursery lower capital construction and equipment costs which may account for 3 05 of the difference based upon the study of yarish et al 2017 hatchery stage costs of s latissima and g tikvahiae in our study were 6 03 per spool close to the 7 14 to 10 00 spool price as delivered from our own facilities at bigelow laboratory for ocean sciences in boothbay harbor and other nurseries in maine there has been keen interest in the production of seaweed as a biofuel feedstock here we demonstrate that use of harvested macroalgae as anaerobic digestion feedstock to produce biogas with land application of ad residuals to displace chemical fertilizer largely decreases the economic value of cultivated macroalgae based upon the experience of industry who prefer to sell seaweeds as food this is not surprising the feasibility of using seaweed to produce biofuel by anaerobic digestion has been previously investigated and reported to be feasible dave et al 2013 soleymani and rosentrater 2017 the breakeven electricity selling prices were estimated at 0 16 to 0 24 per kwh about 23 1 to 84 6 higher than the average u s electricity price in 2020 however estimated macroalgae cultivation costs were more than two orders of magnitude lower in these studies e g 0 05 per kg dry weight in dave et al 2013 than our estimate in this study and others recently reported van dijk et al 2015 yarish et al 2017 significant technological advancement is needed to reduce production costs before this option will be economically viable it is worthwhile to note that bioextractive seaweed aquaculture with use of seaweed as a feedstock for anaerobic digestion resulted in improved environmental performance in all impact categories except for marine eutrophication when compared to the existing or upgraded bhsd wrrf an important outcome of this work is that bioextractive seaweed aquaculture as an alternative to wrrf tertiary treatment upgrade to achieve level 2 effluent nitrogen goals could facilitate nutrient management at wrrfs with net positive revenue if harvested seaweeds were sold as sea vegetables if sold as commercial seaweed fertilizer the costs of nutrient management may also be favorable over wrrf upgrade although not revenue generating aside from an increase in fossil resource scarcity and slight increase in global warming and human carcinogenic toxicity the environmental tradeoffs were favorable for bioextractive seaweed aquaculture to produce dried sea vegetables over the bhsd wrrf upgrade provided displacement of land based lettuce production on the other hand bioextractive seaweed aquaculture with sale of dried and milled seaweed as commercial fertilizer led to increased environmental impacts on all the categories except for marine eutrophication when compared to upgrade of the bhsd wrrf to manage nutrients whether for food or fertilizer the drying process was the most significant contributor to the increased environmental impacts on all the categories except for marine eutrophication this agreed with results of van oirschot et al 2017 the lci of this study assumed the use of electricity and natural gas for seaweed drying alterative and more sustainable drying schemes that do not use fossil energy could significantly reduce impacts for example thomas et al 2020 conducted a life cycle assessment and compared the environmental impacts of alternative seaweed preservation methods their results indicate that outdoor hang drying dramatically improved the environmental performance over thermal drying seaweed freezing led to the greatest impacts among seaweed preservation methods in our own work drying near the aquaculture site reduced transportation costs by a factor of 4 5 from 0 000015 km 1 m 3 to 0 00007 km 1 m 3 wastewater treated and reduced net environmental impacts based on the lcia fig 4 however the importance of transportation was limited among all drivers of environmental impacts the discussion above lends that under the correct conditions nutrient trading schemes could be constructed for bioextractive aquaculture that would be economically and environmentally advantageous over tertiary treatment upgrades at wrrfs these trading programs could supplement the emerging seaweed aquaculture industry in the u s an industry that often operates with thin margins the work contemplates avenues of further investigation for example the usda nop national organic program ruled that organic sea vegetables cultivated from maine s coastal waters should be at least 4 8 km three miles distant wrrf discharge considering we used the lower non organic seaweed price as sea vegetables in our study piconi et al 2020 nutrient trading schemes where seaweeds are grown closer to wrrf discharge may offset differences in the value of organic versus non organic sea vegetables expanding profitable grow out locations for aquaculture site licensing to facilitate that possibility further research is needed regarding safe setback distances for sea vegetable cultivation from wastewater treatment plant outfalls for a land based analog for lettuce production see our prior work jahne et al 2016 willingness to buy should also be investigated as it may impact the macroalgae price 5 conclusion bioprocess upgrade of bhsd wrrf doubling existing sbr tankage to facilitate nitrification denitrification achieved a werf level 2 nitrogen effluent goal of 3 mg n l 1 nutrient bioextractive aquaculture 5 4 hectares of s latissima and g tikvahiae seasonal crop rotation could achieve equivalent nitrogen effluent goals with 0 09 mg p l 1 greater phosphorus removal than the bhsd wrrf upgrade could achieve costs of bioextractive aquaculture with the use of seaweeds as high value fertilizers 0 26 m 3 wastewater treated was competitive to wrrf upgrade costs 0 31 m 3 wastewater treated if seaweeds were dried and sold as sea vegetables nutrient removal could be achieved with a revenue of as much as 0 72 m 3 wastewater treated bhsd wrrf upgrade could reduce marine eutrophication potential but would result in increased environmental impacts in all remaining categories explored nutrient bioextractive aquaculture resulted in mixed trade offs dependent on the use of harvested seaweed biomass and products displaced some of which drove environmental benefits bioextractive aquaculture with harvested seaweed used as biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digestion or sea

16286,cyanobacterial blooms that produce toxins occur in freshwaters worldwide and yet the occurrence and distribution patterns of many cyanobacterial secondary metabolites particularly in tropical

studied water body with mc rr and cyn being the most frequently occurring intracellularly and extracellularly apta and aptb were detected for the first time in tropical freshwaters at low concentrations the metabolite profiles were highly variable at both temporal and spatial scales in line with spatially different phytoplankton assemblages notably mcs decreased with the increase of cyn possibly revealing interspecific competition of cyanobacteria the rapid rf prediction models for mcs and cyn were successfully developed using 4 identified drivers i e chlorophyll a total carbon rainfall and ammonium for mcs prediction and chloride total carbon rainfall and nitrate for cyn prediction the established models can help to better understand the potential relationships between cyanotoxins and environmental variables as well as provide useful information for making policy decisions image graphical abstract keywords microcystin anabaenopeptin cylindrospermospin anatoxin random forest model environmental drivers 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms are a significant and increasing threat to freshwater resources throughout the world chorus and welker 2021 of particular concern are bloom forming cyanobacteria that produce potent and potentially lethal toxins as well as various metabolites of diverse and mostly unknown function beversdorf et al 2018 a number of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites show similar structures and functional properties and thus can be categorized into specific classes chlipala et al 2011 peptides and alkaloids are the two most widespread by structural class over 600 diverse peptides or peptidic metabolites have been isolated from cyanobacteria kust et al 2020 welker and von döhren 2006 of these the most notable peptides are microcystins mcs which are known to be hepatotoxic to date more than 240 mc variants have been identified christophoridis et al 2018 they are mainly produced by freshwater cyanobacteria such as microcystis anabaena nodularia planktothrix and nostoc buratti et al 2017 in the peptide class bloom forming cyanobacteria in freshwaters also produce many of the other less studied compounds such as anabaenopeptins apts aeruginosins cyanopeptolins and microginins that may be toxic or otherwise bioactive beversdorf et al 2018 cylindrospermopsin cyn is an alkaloid cyanotoxin of increasing concern because of its widespread occurrence environmental persistence multiple toxicity endpoints and severity of health impacts rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 it is a hepatotoxin mainly produced by raphidiopsis spp other commonly detected alkaloids include anatoxin a atx a and home anatoxin a hatx a to date the levels of mcs cyn and atxs in waters used for drinking sources and recreational purposes have been regulated by many countries to tackle problems of human exposure as well as to lower the risks of adverse health effects following recommendations by organizations such as the world health organization who who 2020a 2020b 2020c the united states environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2019 and the oregon health authority oha farrer et al 2015 in singapore the national water agency pub and national environment agency nea have established recreational water quality guidelines consisting of an alert level of 50 µg l for chlorophyll a or 5000 cells ml for microcystis counts corresponding to the who provisional guideline of 1 µg l for mc lr in drinking water for the management of cyanobacteria and toxins in singapore reservoirs lim et al 2020 during the last two decades more and more researchers worldwide have focused on the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria and their secondary metabolites in freshwaters mowe et al 2015 oh et al 2001 te and gin 2011 te et al 2017 compared to studies in temperate regions beversdorf et al 2017 chan et al 2007 oh et al 2001 park et al 1998 rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 sabart et al 2015 information on the spatiotemporal distributions of cyanobacterial metabolites in tropical locations is scarce in tropical freshwater systems toxic cyanobacterial blooms are more likely to be a major issue as warm temperatures usually favor the growth of toxic cyanobacteria to date the occurrence of mcs and other cyanotoxins including cyn atxs and saxitoxin has been widely documented in tropical asia africa america and australia as summarized by a previous review mowe et al 2015 microcystis and mcs are the most prevalent bloom forming cyanobacteria and toxins across the tropics respectively mowe et al 2015 while higher frequency recorded of raphidiopsis spp blooms in tropical australia probably contributed to the frequent occurrence of cyn griffiths and saker 2003 interestingly raphidiopsis spp was not convincingly traced as the producer of cyn in the temperate zone falfushynska et al 2021 a documented raphidiopsis spp bloom that caused a massive fish mortality in aleksandrovac lake serbia showed no detection of cyanotoxins such as mcs cyn and saxitoxin svirčev et al 2016 studies have also shown that the cyanobacterial strains aphanizomenon gracile and raphidiopsis spp from central europe reveal toxicities despite a lack of synthesis of classically studied cyanotoxins possibly due to the production of apts falfushynska et al 2021 these evidence indicate a high geographical diversity in strain specific production of metabolites so far most previous studies in the tropics have concentrated on cyanotoxins within a single class however in reality these may act as a component of a mixture of various metabolites with antagonistic or synergistic interactions between them for example most of the bioactive peptides e g apts have been previously labelled as non toxic although they reveal toxicity when present in an enriched chemical matrix lenz et al 2019 moreover various species can produce more than just one compound considered toxic buratti et al 2017 gin et al 2021 there is still limited information on the distribution of multi classes of cyanobacterial metabolites including emerging toxins and other bioactive compounds in tropical surface water bodies moreover it is not clear how these multi class metabolites interact with each other as well as with environmental variables that potentially drive the blooms the prevalence of mcs in singapore reservoirs has been reported since 2010 lim et al 2020 porojan et al 2020 te and gin 2011 te et al 2017 tran et al 2020b subsequent studies expanded investigations to the detection and occurrence of cyn and atxs abbas et al 2020 tran et al 2020a high levels of mc rr up to 22 8 µg l in 2012 lim et al 2020 and cyn up to 24 6 µg l in 2019 tran et al 2020a were frequently documented during the year of surveillance these studies emphasize the need to conduct regular monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms and their diverse secondary metabolites in order to secure water sources as well as to comprehensively study the distribution patterns of these metabolites and underlying mechanisms that drive their fluctuations normally liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms analysis is employed for the detection and quantitation of cyanotoxins in waters haddad et al 2019 although this approach is sensitive and specific it is time and labor intensive requiring skilled personnel and expensive analytical equipment thus it is not always feasible to have high frequency field data of cyanotoxins compared to the more easily accessible water quality indicators wqis e g nutrients and turbidity for this reason models can be useful tools for supplementing monitored field data in recent years data driven models such as the random forest rf are increasingly utilized to model and understand environmental systems harley et al 2020 liu et al 2019 searcy and boehm 2021 rf has been demonstrated to be a particularly useful tool for the rapid prediction of water quality and identification of important drivers for instance harley et al 2020 aggregated publicly available environmental data such as sea surface temperature salinity freshwater discharge and air temperature to model and predict trends of saxitoxin in southeast alaska via rf a study in china has reinforced the efficacy of machine learning to evaluate the predictability of harmful algal blooms and determine key drivers liu et al 2019 abbas et al 2020 and porojan et al 2020 employed the rf model to explore non linear relationships between mc cyn and 8 explanatory environmental variables in singapore s reservoirs their results indicated that rainfall and total nitrogen were the important predictors of intracellular mc concentrations while total nitrogen nitrate and total phosphorus were important for intracellular cyn concentrations although the dataset they used covered 17 reservoirs the limited data only 12 data points in each reservoir may pose large uncertainties for establishing a data driven model to represent realistic interpretations of the toxins distribution in specific reservoirs besides limited sampling locations in each reservoir may not give a sufficiently holistic picture of toxin levels in the specific water body as the distribution of cyanotoxins frequently show large spatiotemporal dynamics christophoridis et al 2018 more importantly there is no documentation of using a comprehensive set of physio chemical water quality data to develop predictive models for cyanotoxins such an approach is advantageous because it draws out the most important predictors that may be easily overlooked otherwise our objectives were 1 to determine for the first time the extracellular and intracellular concentrations of 18 well known and less studied cyanobacterial metabolites with multiple classes in a frequent bloom occurring tropical lake 2 to investigate their spatiotemporal distribution patterns as well as compare their abundance with various recreational water quality guidelines and 3 to develop rapid prediction models for cyanotoxins using a set of extensively measured physio chemical variables and identifying the key drivers by means of rf algorithms the results of the rf model study help to deepen the understanding of potential relationships between general water quality indicators and cyanotoxins more importantly the rapid predictive rf models can assist water regulators in developing strategies to reduce algal bloom frequency and severity and guide remedial actions to reduce the adverse impacts caused by cyanotoxins 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents standards of

discussion 3 1 diversity of cyanobacterial metabolites a wide variety of cyanobacterial metabolites was identified in water samples collected from the tropical water body as presented in table 1 the analysis of filtered water revealed the presence of extracellular cyn atx a 9 mcs mc rr dm rr mc lr dm lr mc yr mc hilr mc wr mc la and mc ly as well as apta and aptb the most frequently detected extracellular cyanotoxins were cyn and mc rr 100 detection frequency free cyn was found to be the most abundant toxin with a median level of 1 22 µg l and reaching up to 6 46 µg l as expected higher concentrations of the analytes were observed in water samples subjected to freeze thaw to release cell bound intercellular components the level of intracellular toxin expressed as µg of cell bound toxins per volume l of water was then derived by subtracting the extracellular toxin level from the total concentration table 1 an even wider variety of intracellular toxins and metabolites were found including 11 mcs cyn atx a hatx a apta and aptb cell bound atx a hatx a mcs apta and aptb were detected more frequently and in higher proportion compared to extracellular free water soluble ones hatx a mc htyr and mc lf were solely found intracellularly it has been widely reported that mc variants were found intracellularly in the cytoplasm most of the time during the growth stages of a bloom jones and orr 1994 watanabe et al 1992 release of these cyanotoxins from cells occurs almost exclusively during senescence death and the decomposition periods of cells however atx a may also leak out of cells during the growth phase especially in low light environments chorus and welker 2021 our results showed that atx a was detected more often in cells df 100 than in water df 34 7 but frequent higher extracellular concentrations were also observed apta and aptb are biologically active and potentially toxic cyclic peptides which could be biosynthesized by the common mc producing cyanobacteria microcystis sp planktothrix rubescens and planktothrix agardhii kurmayer et al 2016 otten et al 2017 after being produced they are probably retained within intact cells as mcs aptb was detected more frequently than apta occurring in 55 7 of filtered water samples and 99 intracellularly with a median level of 0 009 µg l this is the first time that the presence of extracellular and intracellular apta and aptb has been reported in a tropical watershed in contrast a significant amount of cyn could be naturally released to the water by live cyanobacterial cells indicating that cyn s ecological role is played outside the cell rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 the ratio discovered in this study was around 79 extracellular and 21 intracellular mc lw and nod were not detected both extracellularly and intracellularly 3 2 occurrence patterns of cyanobacterial metabolites fig 1 depicts the profile of cyanobacterial metabolites identified during different sampling dates and locations similar patterns were observed in r1 r3 during the period of sampling while the toxin variants fluctuated differently in r4 which had the shallowest mean depth of 1 6 m and was further upstream possibly closer to tributary source contamination from 1 august to 11 september typical inter monsoon period mcs particularly mc wr dominated at all the sampling locations subsequently cyn was the most dominant toxin followed by atx a and hatx a on 27 november mc rr and dm rr were the main toxin constituents particularly at site r4 this phenomenon could be probably explained by community succession of different toxin producing cyanobacteria at different stages of the algal bloom li et al 2020 to explore the contribution of cyanobacterial types on cyanotoxin occurrence we analyzed the phytoplankton composition in the studied lake using partial 16s rrna gene sequencing te et al 2017 microcystis nodosilinea leptolyngbyaceae raphidiopsis planktothricoides and synechococcus contributed to 85 5 of the entire community spatially different phytoplankton assemblages were discovered fig s4a r1 r3 showed more similar assemblages characterized by mixed communities compared to r4 which was dominated by microcystis and synechococcus fig s4b this is in line with the temporal toxin profiles found for different sites fig 1 co existence or shift in various members of the cyanobacterial community and genotype composition resulted in the production of different toxin variants throughout the cyanobacterial bloom in a study of lake aydat in france sabart et al 2015 atx a occurred concomitantly with mcs during an anabaena and aphanizomernon co dominated bloom early during the survey in the latter part of the bloom only atx a occurred when ananbaena dominated the cyanobacterial community alone and mcs disappeared mc production could also be related to the size of microcystis colonies as shown by an investigation in lake taihu which revealed that colonies of size 50 μm produced the highest proportion of mc rr while colonies of size 100 μm showed a higher proportion of the most toxic mc congener mc lr wang et al 2013 this implicates the role of mc in promoting and maintaining bloom forming cell aggregates a strategy that confronts the environmental stress gan et al 2012 rzymski et al 2020 furthermore we observed a decrease in mcs accompanied by an increase in cyn during september in both surface and bottom waters of r1 r3 fig 2 the data of surface layer was shown this observation suggests that the increase in cyn content could potentially reduce the level of mcs but targeted experiments are needed to understand this phenomenon more closely a previous study investigated the effect of cyn and raphidiopsis spp on the growth and metabolism of microcystis aeruginosa and disclosed that cyn can contribute to interspecific competition by inducing microcystis aeruginosa growth inhibition and decreasing mc lr production rzymski et al 2014 co culturing of these two species resulted in an increase of raphidiopsis spp contribution at the expense of microcystis aeruginosa rzymski et al 2014 these results support the field observations made in our study compared to the detected multi class cyanotoxins the bioactive metabolites apta and aptb only took up a small proportion to date few studies have quantified the absolute concentrations of cyanopeptides beyond mcs and nod two recent studies quantified 4 mcs and 6 other cyanopeptides including aptb and aptf in samples from eutrophic lakes in the united states beversdorf et al 2018 beversdorf et al 2017 their results showed that apts mean levels 0 14 µg l were detected at lower concentrations compared to mcs mean levels 3 9 µg l in raw water for drinking water treatment plants and significantly correlated with chlorophyll a microcystis cell density uv absorbance and turbidity beversdorf et al 2018 however another study investigated the extracellular concentrations of 5 apts 1 cyanopeptolin and 10 mcs in european lakes using self produced analytical standards from biomass extracts and showed that apts and cyanopeptolin were present overwhelmingly compared to mcs chorus et al 2006 as suggested cyanobacterial peptides beyond mcs deserve more attention and comprehensive monitoring studies ought to be conducted to ensure more accurate risk assessments in two recent studies in the same tropical lake tran et al 2020a 2020b cyn and mcs were detected frequently at higher levels fig 3 while atx and hatx a were of similar magnitude to the current study in addition the cyanotoxin levels in surface waters in the present study tended to be higher than those in bottom waters which is consistent with previous findings tran et al 2020a 2020b porojan et al 2020 and abbas et al 2020 undertook a survey of 6 mcs lr rr ly lw lf and wr cyn and atx a over a 12 month period in 17 water bodies in singapore from november 2012 to october 2013 they found that cyn and mc lr were the most prevalent toxins with a maximum level of 1 1 µg l and 0 79 µg l respectively the higher concentrations of cyn maximum level 8 36 µg l detected in the present study could be related to raphidiopsis spp which had higher abundance in the r1 r3 type cyanobacterial communities and was positively correlated with the cyn concentration fig s4a high toxin production capabilities 54 5 fg cell of a raphidiopsis spp isolated from the same water body have been previously illustrated gin et al 2021 which were highly dependent on their physiological responses and acclimation to the environment mohamed nor et al 2019 moreover discovery of the novel cyn and atx producing synechococcus spp suggests possible alternative origins of these compounds gin et al 2021 further studies on the cyanobacterial community as well as its relationships with cyanotoxins and environmental factors are recommended 3 3 comparison with the recreational water quality guidelines although the studied water body is not open for recreational use including non contact recreation we nevertheless benchmarked the cyanotoxin concentrations against various international standards for recreational water to give some idea of the baseline levels in tropical urban lakes the world health organization who has recently set guideline values of 24 6 and 58 8 µg l for mcs cyn and atx present in waters used for recreational purposes respectively who 2020a 2020b 2020c as summarized in table s6 recommendations have also been issued by the united states environmental protection agency usepa for recreational water quality criteria for mcs and cyn with the suggested threshold of 8 and 15 µg l respectively usepa 2019 fig 3 shows the temporal changes of total mcs and cyn in the studied water body collected in this study and previous studies tran et al 2020a 2020b as well as a comparison with the established who and usepa recreational water quality guidelines samples collected at the surface layer of r4 from february to april sporadically 2 of total observations contained mcs at a concentration that exceeded the who guidelines of 24 µg l while about 9 of samples had mc concentrations higher than 8 g l the usepa criteria in terms of cyn 2 9 and 10 of samples collected had higher levels of cyn than the usepa 15 µg l and who 6 µg l guidelines respectively in contrast atxs atx a plus hatx a concentrations in the studied water body were always lower than both the who 58 8 µg l and oregon health authority oha 20 µg l guidelines these data support our recommendation that levels of mcs and cyn should be included in singapore s recreational water quality guidelines 3 4 real time prediction and identification of important drivers considering the frequent high levels of mcs and cyn we developed two types of models for rapid prediction of their concentrations in the studied water body via random forest based on 1 22 physical and chemical water parameters i e models 1 2 and 2 the important parameters selected from 1 i e models 3 4 as illustrated in fig 4 high r 2 0 8 and low rmse 0 7 values of models 1 and 2 reflected good performance in predicting mcs and cyn respectively the individual variable importance to the modeled mcs and cyn was determined as well in models 1 and 2 respectively and the results are shown in fig 5 four variables including chl a tc rainfall and nh4 in model 1 while cl tc rainfall and no3 in model 2 had importance values higher than 1 5 times the mean importance they were subsequently chosen as the important drivers to assess the predictability of mcs and cyn for models 3 and 4 respectively results showed that models 3 and 4 fit the data as well as models 1 and 2 figs 4 and s3 this finding indicates that the 4 selected drivers can satisfactorily explain the toxin fluctuations and other variables may play comparatively smaller roles specifically chl a level appeared to be the most important driving variable for the prediction of mcs fig 5 in previous studies boyer et al 2009 tomlinson et al 2016 chl a concentration has been recommended as an indicator to estimate cyanobacterial blooms and mc levels in water bodies and it has also served as a criterion in the who guideline to predict health risks induced by mc who 2003 however other studies found that application of chl a to indicate the cyanotoxin levels was limited by the toxicity of blooms ha et al 2011 species genotype composition davis et al 2009 water systems specialty rogalus and watzin 2008 and n p ratio oh et al 2001 our spearman correlation analysis table s7 revealed significantly positive association between mcs and chl a ρ 0 55 suggesting partially similar origins the importance of tc to predict mcs and the importance of cl and tc to predict cyn were identified under the rf models fig 5 cl and tc dynamics in freshwater systems could be associated with anthropogenic activity cl loading has been proposed as an indicator of anthropogenic impact in groundwater zahn and grimm 1993 cl in water systems may be derived from pollution sources such as domestic and industrial effluents fertilizers and septic tanks khatri and tyagi 2015 as well as from the use of de icing salts on road although this is not practiced in tropical areas kelly et al 2008 markich and brown 1998 showed that high levels of nutrients and organic carbon in a freshwater river of australia originated from anthropogenic sources particularly the effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants and diffuse urban runoff during storm events in addition cl and other major ions increased as a consequence of saline groundwater seepage the water body in the present study is surrounded by high density residential areas and thus anthropogenic inputs may have significantly promoted cyanobacterial blooms particularly cyn producers rainfall was identified as a strong predictor of both mcs and cyn in the studied water body fig 5 the potential impact of rainfall on toxic cyanobacterial blooms is contradictory complex and strongly depends on site specific dynamics cyanobacterial species composition and strain succession reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 the frequent occurrence of heavy rainfall events has been reported to cause either a disruption of the bloom or a decrease in cyanobacterial mass due to de stratification increased turbidity high turbulence low irradiance dilution and flushing consequently resulting in a decrease in cyanotoxin production chan et al 2007 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 in contrast prolonged rainfall and intense rainfall events may favor cyanobacteria via increased nutrient input into the inland waterbodies wood et al 2017 precipitation in singapore is plentiful and frequent and the sampling sites had measurable precipitation maximum weekly rainfall up to 102 6 mm table s2 on more than 57 of the dates sampled in this study bivariate correlation analysis table s7 revealed that rainfall had a significantly negative impact on both mcs and cyn concentrations in the studied watershed probably as a consequence of dilution and unfavorable conditions for cyanobacteria growth the other important drivers identified in rf models for mcs and cyn were nh4 and no3 respectively the impact of nitrogen sources on cyanotoxin production has been well documented amé and wunderlin 2005 chen et al 2019 rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 a previous study amé and wunderlin 2005 has demonstrated that mcs per cell decreased by 3 fold when n ammonium increased from 0 to 0 756 mg n l highlighting the negative effect of microcystis aeruginosa on mc production in the presence of ammonium this supports our finding of the negative correlation between mcs and n nh4 where the level of nh4 ranged from 0 03 to 1 16 mg n l table s7 in contrast chen et al 2019 found that intracellular mcs levels were enhanced by an increase in nh4 concentrations from 0 5 to 7 mg n l they explained that this phenomenon was possibly caused by i higher levels of mc synthesis associated amino acids in cells that may provide adequate precursors for mc synthesis ii higher nitrogen uptake rate that positively modulated the mc contents in cells and iii the increase in transcripts of mcyb gene that performed the incorporation of mc synthesis associated amino acids in the 7 mg n l ammonium treatment we suggest that mc synthesis can be suppressed at low nh4 levels while subsequently enhanced at high nh4 levels although further investigation is needed cyn levels in the present study appeared to be negatively correlated with dissolved nitrogen content including no3 no2 and nh4 table s7 it has been observed that raphidiopsis spp strains produced more cyn in cultures depleted with a fixed nitrogen source than cultures supplied with no3 and nh4 saker and neilan 2001 on the other hand another study found that when nitrogen limitation started cyn contents in aphanizomenon ovalisporum cells significantly decreased and soon resumed rapidly as the heterocyst and nitrogenase formation appeared vasas et al 2013 recently thresholds of 0 3 ug chl a per ug tp and 0 042 ug chl a per ug tn were applied to roughly estimate p or n limitation maberly et al 2020 in the studied lake the observed ratio of chl a to tp i e 1 2 ug chl a per ug tp and 0 04 ug chl a per ug tn suggested a potential p limitation previous studies bar yosef et al 2010 lu et al 2021 have found that cyn can act as an infochemical to trigger other phytoplankton species to secrete alkaline phosphatase leading to an increase in bioavailable p concentration and thus help ameliorate the p deficient situation and support the dominance of cyn producers as concluded by rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 cyn production could be triggered when cyanobacteria deal with physiological stress or adapt to unfavorable environmental conditions e g limitation of nutrients 3 5 limitations and future perspectives our well calibrated and validated rf model framework can be used to quickly predict cyanotoxins in freshwater lakes when general and easily obtained wqis are available such a rapid predictive tool can circumvent the need for field surveys and laboratory measurements of cyanotoxins that are limited by budget time and skilled personnel however major challenges and limitations in this study still lie in the sparsely measured data for the model calibration and validation we expect high frequency data e g real time water quality sensor data in future to supplement the current models hence immensely improving the model performance prediction of cyanotoxins by using easily obtained wqis is recommended particularly when integrated with real time sensors which provides a strategy for developing a real time cyanotoxin forecasting system that can assist regulators to protect water resources shively et al 2016 moreover the rf models have shown advantages in discovering the non linear relationships between cyanotoxins and environmental variables as well as identifying key drivers through the feature importance our model framework can be further explored to quantify the dynamics of cyanotoxin production affected by changes in environmental drivers e g nutrient content which will be included in our future work although this work focuses on mcs and cyn models based on a specific tropical lake we believe our framework can be applied to other contaminants of concern furthermore our findings also show general relevance for nutrient rich tropical water bodies 4 conclusions in this study the occurrence and distribution of 18 multi class cyanobacterial secondary metabolites in a frequent bloom occurring tropical lake were investigated it was found that a wide variety of cyanobacterial metabolites was detected in the waters including 11 mcs mc rr dm rr mc lr dm lr mc yr mc hilr mc wr mc la mc ly mc htyr mc lf cyn atx a hatx a apta and aptb and therein hatx a mc htyr and mc lf were solely found intracellularly intracellular mcs atxs and apts were detected at higher levels and frequencies than extracellular ones while cyn showed contrary results the composition of the studied cyanobacterial metabolites in accordance with phytoplankton community structures varied at different sites during the sampling periods notably the increase in cyn would potentially induce a reduction in mcs as a consequence of interspecific competition between different species we developed rf models that provide rapid prediction of mcs and cyn by using water quality indicators 4 out of 22 water quality variables i e chl a tc rainfall and nh4 were determined to be the most important predictors of mcs the trends in cyn concentration were mainly driven by cl tc rainfall and no3 these results obtained from the field survey

16286,cyanobacterial blooms that produce toxins occur in freshwaters worldwide and yet the occurrence and distribution patterns of many cyanobacterial secondary metabolites particularly in tropical regions are still not fully understood moreover predictive models for these metabolites by using easily accessible water quality indicators are rarely discussed in this study we investigated the co occurrence and spatiotemporal trends of 18 well known and less studied cyanobacterial metabolites including d asp3 microcystin lr dm lr d asp3 microcystin rr dm rr microcystin hilr mc hilr microcystin

a cylindrospermospin cyn nodularin nod anabaenopeptin a apta and anabaenopeptin b aptb in a tropical freshwater lake often plagued with blooms random forest rf models were developed to predict mcs and cyn and assess the relative importance of 22 potential predictors that determined their concentrations the results showed that 11 mcs cyn atx a hatx a apta and aptb were found at least once in the studied water body with mc rr and cyn being the most frequently occurring intracellularly and extracellularly apta and aptb were detected for the first time in tropical freshwaters at low concentrations the metabolite profiles were highly variable at both temporal and spatial scales in line with spatially different phytoplankton assemblages notably mcs decreased with the increase of cyn possibly revealing interspecific competition of cyanobacteria the rapid rf prediction models for mcs and cyn were successfully developed using 4 identified drivers i e chlorophyll a total carbon rainfall and ammonium for mcs prediction and chloride total carbon rainfall and nitrate for cyn prediction the established models can help to better understand the potential relationships between cyanotoxins and environmental variables as well as provide useful information for making policy decisions image graphical abstract keywords microcystin anabaenopeptin cylindrospermospin anatoxin random forest model environmental drivers 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms are a significant and increasing threat to freshwater resources throughout the world chorus and welker 2021 of particular concern are bloom forming cyanobacteria that produce potent and potentially lethal toxins as well as various metabolites of diverse and mostly unknown function beversdorf et al 2018 a number of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites show similar structures and functional properties and thus can be categorized into specific classes chlipala et al 2011 peptides and alkaloids are the two most widespread by structural class over 600 diverse peptides or peptidic metabolites have been isolated from cyanobacteria kust et al 2020 welker and von döhren 2006 of these the most notable peptides are microcystins mcs which are known to be hepatotoxic to date more than 240 mc variants have been identified christophoridis et al 2018 they are mainly produced by freshwater cyanobacteria such as microcystis anabaena nodularia planktothrix and nostoc buratti et al 2017 in the peptide class bloom forming cyanobacteria in freshwaters also produce many of the other less studied compounds such as anabaenopeptins apts aeruginosins cyanopeptolins and microginins that may be toxic or otherwise bioactive beversdorf et al 2018 cylindrospermopsin cyn is an alkaloid cyanotoxin of increasing concern because of its widespread occurrence environmental persistence multiple toxicity endpoints and severity of health impacts rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 it is a hepatotoxin mainly produced by raphidiopsis spp other commonly detected alkaloids include anatoxin a atx a and home anatoxin a hatx a to date the levels of mcs cyn and atxs in waters used for drinking sources and recreational purposes have been regulated by many countries to tackle problems of human exposure as well as to lower the risks of adverse health effects following recommendations by organizations such as the world health organization who who 2020a 2020b 2020c the united states environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2019 and the oregon health authority oha farrer et al 2015 in singapore the national water agency pub and national environment agency nea have established recreational water quality guidelines consisting of an alert level of 50 µg l for chlorophyll a or 5000 cells ml for microcystis counts corresponding to the who provisional guideline of 1 µg l for mc lr in drinking water for the management of cyanobacteria and toxins in singapore reservoirs lim et al 2020 during the last two decades more and more researchers worldwide have focused on the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria and their secondary metabolites in freshwaters mowe et al 2015 oh et al 2001 te and gin 2011 te et al 2017 compared to studies in temperate regions beversdorf et al 2017 chan et al 2007 oh et al 2001 park et al 1998 rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 sabart et al 2015 information on the spatiotemporal distributions of cyanobacterial metabolites in tropical locations is scarce in tropical freshwater systems toxic cyanobacterial blooms are more likely to be a major issue as warm temperatures usually favor the growth of toxic cyanobacteria to date the occurrence of mcs and other cyanotoxins including cyn atxs and saxitoxin has been widely documented in tropical asia africa america and australia as summarized by a previous review mowe et al 2015 microcystis and mcs are the most prevalent bloom forming cyanobacteria and toxins across the tropics respectively mowe et al 2015 while higher frequency recorded of raphidiopsis spp blooms in tropical australia probably contributed to the frequent occurrence of cyn griffiths and saker 2003 interestingly raphidiopsis spp was not convincingly traced as the producer of cyn in the temperate zone falfushynska et al 2021 a documented raphidiopsis spp bloom that caused a massive fish mortality in aleksandrovac lake serbia showed no detection of cyanotoxins such as mcs cyn and saxitoxin svirčev et al 2016 studies have also shown that the cyanobacterial strains aphanizomenon gracile and raphidiopsis spp from central europe reveal toxicities despite a lack of synthesis of classically studied cyanotoxins possibly due to the production of apts falfushynska et al 2021 these evidence indicate a high geographical diversity in strain specific production of metabolites so far most previous studies in the tropics have concentrated on cyanotoxins within a single class however in reality these may act as a component of a mixture of various metabolites with antagonistic or synergistic interactions between them for example most of the bioactive peptides e g apts have been previously labelled as non toxic although they reveal toxicity when present in an enriched chemical matrix lenz et al 2019 moreover various species can produce more than just one compound considered toxic buratti et al 2017 gin et al 2021 there is still limited information on the distribution of multi classes of cyanobacterial metabolites including emerging toxins and other bioactive compounds in tropical surface water bodies moreover it is not clear how these multi class metabolites interact with each other as well as with environmental variables that potentially drive the blooms the prevalence of mcs in singapore reservoirs has been reported since 2010 lim et al 2020 porojan et al 2020 te and gin 2011 te et al 2017 tran et al 2020b subsequent studies expanded investigations to the detection and occurrence of cyn and atxs abbas et al 2020 tran et al 2020a high levels of mc rr up to 22 8 µg l in 2012 lim et al 2020 and cyn up to 24 6 µg l in 2019 tran et al 2020a were frequently documented during the year of surveillance these studies emphasize the need to conduct regular monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms and their diverse secondary metabolites in order to secure water sources as well as to comprehensively study the distribution patterns of these metabolites and underlying mechanisms that drive their fluctuations normally liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms analysis is employed for the detection and quantitation of cyanotoxins in waters haddad et al 2019 although this approach is sensitive and specific it is time and labor intensive requiring skilled personnel and expensive analytical equipment thus it is not always feasible to have high frequency field data of cyanotoxins compared to the more easily accessible water quality indicators wqis e g nutrients and turbidity for this reason models can be useful tools for supplementing monitored field data in recent years data driven models such as the random forest rf are increasingly utilized to model and understand environmental systems harley et al 2020 liu et al 2019 searcy and boehm 2021 rf has been demonstrated to be a particularly useful tool for the rapid prediction of water quality and identification of important drivers for instance harley et al 2020 aggregated publicly available environmental data such as sea surface temperature salinity freshwater discharge and air temperature to model and predict trends of saxitoxin in southeast alaska via rf a study in china has reinforced the efficacy of machine learning to evaluate the predictability of harmful algal blooms and determine key drivers liu et al 2019 abbas et al 2020 and porojan et al 2020 employed the rf model to explore non linear relationships between mc cyn and 8 explanatory environmental variables in singapore s reservoirs their results indicated that rainfall and total nitrogen were the important predictors of intracellular mc concentrations while total nitrogen nitrate and total phosphorus were important for intracellular cyn concentrations although the dataset they used covered 17 reservoirs the limited data only 12 data points in each reservoir may pose large uncertainties for establishing a data driven model to represent realistic interpretations of the toxins distribution in specific reservoirs besides limited sampling locations in each reservoir may not give a sufficiently holistic picture of toxin levels in the specific water body as the distribution of cyanotoxins frequently show large spatiotemporal dynamics christophoridis et al 2018 more importantly there is no documentation of using a comprehensive set of physio chemical water quality data to develop predictive models for cyanotoxins such an approach is advantageous because it draws out the most important predictors that may be easily overlooked otherwise our objectives were 1 to determine for the first time the extracellular and intracellular concentrations of 18 well known and less studied cyanobacterial metabolites with multiple classes in a frequent bloom occurring tropical lake 2 to investigate their spatiotemporal distribution patterns as well as compare their abundance with various recreational water quality guidelines and 3 to develop rapid prediction models for cyanotoxins using a set of extensively measured physio chemical variables and identifying the key drivers by means of rf algorithms the results of the rf model study help to deepen the understanding of potential relationships between general water quality indicators and cyanotoxins more importantly the rapid predictive rf models can assist water regulators in developing strategies to reduce algal bloom frequency and severity and guide remedial actions to reduce the adverse impacts caused by cyanotoxins 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents standards of

green areas one side of the lake is adjacent to a capped former landfill which is sealed from the water body by a cutoff wall it is noted that any recreational activities including swimming fishing

are approximately 4 5 5 3 and 4 m respectively while r4 is located closed to the confluence of two narrow upstream canals with water depth of about 1 6 m to capture the bloom events water samples were

importance of the rf representing the least important variable searcy and boehm 2021 in models 1 and 2 were selected as the input parameters for models 3 and 4 respectively the scale of importance values is relative within a single model and a higher importance value indicated a better predictor of cyanotoxin concentrations we randomly subsampled 80 of the dataset as a training dataset and tested the performance of the models i e validation using the remaining 20 observations model performance was assessed by comparing actual and modeled cyanotoxin concentrations within the training and

discussion 3 1 diversity of cyanobacterial metabolites a wide variety of cyanobacterial metabolites was identified in water samples collected from the tropical water body as presented in table 1 the

extracellular cyanotoxins were cyn and mc rr 100 detection frequency free cyn was found to be the most abundant toxin with a median level of 1 22 µg l and reaching up to 6 46 µg l as expected higher concentrations of the analytes were observed in water samples subjected to freeze thaw to release cell bound intercellular components the level of intracellular toxin expressed as µg of cell bound toxins per volume l of water was then derived by subtracting the extracellular toxin level from the total concentration table 1 an even wider variety of intracellular toxins and metabolites were found including 11 mcs cyn atx a hatx a apta and aptb cell bound atx a hatx a mcs apta and aptb were detected more frequently and in higher proportion compared to extracellular free water soluble ones hatx a mc htyr and mc lf were solely found intracellularly it has been widely reported that mc variants were found intracellularly in the cytoplasm most of the time during the growth stages of a bloom jones and orr 1994 watanabe et al 1992 release of these cyanotoxins from cells occurs almost exclusively during senescence death and the decomposition periods of cells however atx a may also leak out of cells during the growth phase especially in low light environments chorus and welker 2021 our results showed that atx a was detected more often in cells df 100 than in water df 34 7 but frequent higher extracellular concentrations were also observed apta and aptb are biologically active and potentially toxic cyclic peptides which could be biosynthesized by the common mc producing cyanobacteria microcystis sp planktothrix rubescens and planktothrix agardhii kurmayer et al 2016 otten et al 2017 after being produced they are probably retained within intact cells as mcs aptb was detected more frequently than apta occurring in 55 7 of filtered water samples and 99 intracellularly with a median level of 0 009 µg l this is the first time that the presence of extracellular and intracellular apta and aptb has been reported in a tropical watershed in contrast a significant amount of cyn could be naturally released to the water by live cyanobacterial cells indicating that cyn s ecological role is played outside the cell rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 the ratio discovered in this study was around 79 extracellular and 21 intracellular mc lw and nod were not detected both extracellularly and intracellularly 3 2 occurrence patterns of cyanobacterial metabolites fig 1 depicts the profile of cyanobacterial metabolites identified during different sampling dates and locations similar patterns were observed in r1 r3 during the period of sampling while the toxin variants fluctuated differently in r4 which had the shallowest mean depth of 1 6 m and was further upstream possibly closer to tributary source contamination from 1 august to 11 september typical inter monsoon period mcs particularly mc wr dominated at all the sampling locations subsequently cyn was the most dominant toxin followed by atx a and hatx a on 27 november mc rr and dm rr were the main toxin constituents particularly at site r4 this phenomenon could be probably explained by community succession of different toxin producing cyanobacteria at different stages of the algal bloom li et al 2020 to explore the contribution of cyanobacterial types on cyanotoxin occurrence we analyzed the phytoplankton composition in the studied lake using partial 16s rrna gene sequencing te et al 2017 microcystis nodosilinea leptolyngbyaceae raphidiopsis planktothricoides and synechococcus contributed to 85 5 of the entire community spatially different phytoplankton assemblages were discovered fig s4a r1 r3 showed more similar assemblages characterized by mixed communities compared to r4 which was dominated by microcystis and synechococcus fig s4b this is in line with the temporal toxin profiles found for different sites fig 1 co existence or shift in various members of the cyanobacterial community and genotype composition resulted in the production of different toxin variants throughout the cyanobacterial bloom in a study of lake aydat in france sabart et al 2015 atx a occurred concomitantly with mcs during an anabaena and aphanizomernon co dominated bloom early during the survey in the latter part of the bloom only atx a occurred when ananbaena dominated the cyanobacterial community alone and mcs disappeared mc production could also be related to the size of microcystis colonies as shown by an investigation in lake taihu which revealed that colonies of size 50 μm produced the highest proportion of mc rr while colonies of size 100 μm showed a higher proportion of the most toxic mc congener mc lr wang et al 2013 this implicates the role of mc in promoting and maintaining bloom forming cell aggregates a strategy that confronts the environmental stress gan et al 2012 rzymski et al 2020 furthermore we observed a decrease in mcs accompanied by an increase in cyn during september in both surface and bottom waters of r1 r3 fig 2 the data of surface layer was shown this observation suggests that the increase in cyn content could potentially reduce the level of mcs but targeted experiments are needed to understand this phenomenon more closely a previous study investigated the effect of cyn and raphidiopsis spp on the growth and metabolism of microcystis aeruginosa and disclosed that cyn can contribute to interspecific competition by inducing microcystis aeruginosa growth inhibition and decreasing mc lr production rzymski et al 2014 co culturing of these two species resulted in an increase of raphidiopsis spp contribution at the expense of microcystis aeruginosa rzymski et al 2014 these results support the field observations made in our study compared to the detected multi class cyanotoxins the bioactive metabolites apta and aptb only took up a small proportion to date few studies have quantified the absolute concentrations of cyanopeptides beyond mcs and nod two recent studies quantified 4 mcs and 6 other cyanopeptides including aptb and aptf in samples from eutrophic lakes in the united states beversdorf et al 2018 beversdorf et al 2017 their results showed that apts mean levels 0 14 µg l were detected at lower concentrations compared to mcs mean levels 3 9 µg l in raw water for drinking water treatment plants and significantly correlated with chlorophyll a microcystis cell density uv absorbance and turbidity beversdorf et al 2018 however another study investigated the extracellular concentrations of 5 apts 1 cyanopeptolin and 10 mcs in european lakes using self produced analytical standards from biomass extracts and showed that apts and cyanopeptolin were present overwhelmingly compared to mcs chorus et al 2006 as suggested cyanobacterial peptides beyond mcs deserve more attention and comprehensive monitoring studies ought to be conducted to ensure more accurate risk assessments in two recent studies in the same tropical lake tran et al 2020a 2020b cyn and mcs were detected frequently at higher levels fig 3 while atx and hatx a were of similar magnitude to the current study in addition the cyanotoxin levels in surface waters in the present study tended to be higher than those in bottom waters which is consistent with previous findings tran et al 2020a 2020b porojan et al 2020 and abbas et al 2020 undertook a survey of 6 mcs lr rr ly lw lf and wr cyn and atx a over a 12 month period in 17 water bodies in singapore from november 2012 to october 2013 they found that cyn and mc lr were the most prevalent toxins with a maximum level of 1 1 µg l and 0 79 µg l respectively the higher concentrations of cyn maximum level 8 36 µg l detected in the present study could be related to raphidiopsis spp which had higher abundance in the r1 r3 type cyanobacterial communities and was positively correlated with the cyn concentration fig s4a high toxin production capabilities 54 5 fg cell of a raphidiopsis spp isolated from the same water body have been previously illustrated gin et al 2021 which were highly dependent on their physiological responses and acclimation to the environment mohamed nor et al 2019 moreover discovery of the novel cyn and atx producing synechococcus spp suggests possible alternative origins of these compounds gin et al 2021 further studies on the cyanobacterial community as well as its relationships with cyanotoxins and environmental factors are recommended 3 3 comparison with the recreational water quality guidelines although the studied water body is not open for recreational use including non contact recreation we nevertheless benchmarked the cyanotoxin concentrations against various international standards for recreational water to give some idea of the baseline levels in tropical urban lakes the world health organization who has recently set guideline values of 24 6 and 58 8 µg l for mcs cyn and atx present in waters used for recreational purposes respectively who 2020a 2020b 2020c as summarized in table s6 recommendations have also been issued by the united states environmental protection agency usepa for recreational water quality criteria for mcs and cyn with the suggested threshold of 8 and 15 µg l respectively usepa 2019 fig 3 shows the temporal changes of total mcs and cyn in the studied water body collected in this study and previous studies tran et al 2020a 2020b as well as a comparison with the established who and usepa recreational water quality guidelines samples collected at the surface layer of r4 from february to april sporadically 2 of total observations contained mcs at a concentration that exceeded the who guidelines of 24 µg l while about 9 of samples had mc concentrations higher than 8 g l the usepa criteria in terms of cyn 2 9 and 10 of samples collected had higher levels of cyn than the usepa 15 µg l and who 6 µg l guidelines respectively in contrast atxs atx a plus hatx a concentrations in the studied water body were always lower than both the who 58 8 µg l and oregon health authority oha 20 µg l guidelines these data support our recommendation that levels of mcs and cyn should be included in singapore s recreational water quality guidelines 3 4 real time prediction and identification of important drivers considering the frequent high levels of mcs and cyn we developed two types of models for rapid prediction of their concentrations in the studied water body via random forest based on 1 22 physical and chemical water parameters i e models 1 2 and 2 the important parameters selected from 1 i e models 3 4 as illustrated in fig 4 high r 2 0 8 and low rmse 0 7 values of models 1 and 2 reflected good performance in predicting mcs and cyn respectively the individual variable importance to the modeled mcs and cyn was determined as well in models 1 and 2 respectively and the results are shown in fig 5 four variables including chl a tc rainfall and nh4 in model 1 while cl tc rainfall and no3 in model 2 had importance values higher than 1 5 times the mean importance they were subsequently chosen as the important drivers to assess the predictability of mcs and cyn for models 3 and 4 respectively results showed that models 3 and 4 fit the data as well as models 1 and 2 figs 4 and s3 this finding indicates that the 4 selected drivers can satisfactorily explain the toxin fluctuations and other variables may play comparatively smaller roles specifically chl a level appeared to be the most important driving variable for the prediction of mcs fig 5 in previous studies boyer et al 2009 tomlinson et al 2016 chl a concentration has been recommended as an indicator to estimate cyanobacterial blooms and mc levels in water bodies and it has also served as a criterion in the who guideline to predict health risks induced by mc who 2003 however other studies found that application of chl a to indicate the cyanotoxin levels was limited by the toxicity of blooms ha et al 2011 species genotype composition davis et al 2009 water systems specialty rogalus and watzin 2008 and n p ratio oh et al 2001 our spearman correlation analysis table s7 revealed significantly positive association between mcs and chl a ρ 0 55 suggesting partially similar origins the importance of tc to predict mcs and the importance of cl and tc to predict cyn were identified under the rf models fig 5 cl and tc dynamics in freshwater systems could be associated with anthropogenic activity cl loading has been proposed as an indicator of anthropogenic impact in groundwater zahn and grimm 1993 cl in water systems may be derived from pollution sources such as domestic and industrial effluents fertilizers and septic tanks khatri and tyagi 2015 as well as from the use of de icing salts on road although this is not practiced in tropical areas kelly et al 2008 markich and brown 1998 showed that high levels of nutrients and organic carbon in a freshwater river of australia originated from anthropogenic sources particularly the effluent discharges from wastewater treatment plants and diffuse urban runoff during storm events in addition cl and other major ions increased as a consequence of saline groundwater seepage the water body in the present study is surrounded by high density residential areas and thus anthropogenic inputs may have significantly promoted cyanobacterial blooms particularly cyn producers rainfall was identified as a strong predictor of both mcs and cyn in the studied water body fig 5 the potential impact of rainfall on toxic cyanobacterial blooms is contradictory complex and strongly depends on site specific dynamics cyanobacterial species composition and strain succession reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 the frequent occurrence of heavy rainfall events has been reported to cause either a disruption of the bloom or a decrease in cyanobacterial mass due to de stratification increased turbidity high turbulence low irradiance dilution and flushing consequently resulting in a decrease in cyanotoxin production chan et al 2007 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 in contrast prolonged rainfall and intense rainfall events may favor cyanobacteria via increased nutrient input into the inland waterbodies wood et al 2017 precipitation in singapore is plentiful and frequent and the sampling sites had measurable precipitation maximum weekly rainfall up to 102 6 mm table s2 on more than 57 of the dates sampled in this study bivariate correlation analysis table s7 revealed that rainfall had a significantly negative impact on both mcs and cyn concentrations in the studied watershed probably as a consequence of dilution and unfavorable conditions for cyanobacteria growth the other important drivers identified in rf models for mcs and cyn were nh4 and no3 respectively the impact of nitrogen sources on cyanotoxin production has been well documented amé and wunderlin 2005 chen et al 2019 rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 a previous study amé and wunderlin 2005 has demonstrated that mcs per cell decreased by 3 fold when n ammonium increased from 0 to 0 756 mg n l highlighting the negative effect of microcystis aeruginosa on mc production in the presence of ammonium this supports our finding of the negative correlation between mcs and n nh4 where the level of nh4 ranged from 0 03 to 1 16 mg n l table s7 in contrast chen et al 2019 found that intracellular mcs levels were enhanced by an increase in nh4 concentrations from 0 5 to 7 mg n l they explained that this phenomenon was possibly caused by i higher levels of mc synthesis associated amino acids in cells that may provide adequate precursors for mc synthesis ii higher nitrogen uptake rate that positively modulated the mc contents in cells and iii the increase in transcripts of mcyb gene that performed the incorporation of mc synthesis associated amino acids in the 7 mg n l ammonium treatment we suggest that mc synthesis can be suppressed at low nh4 levels while subsequently enhanced at high nh4 levels although further investigation is needed cyn levels in the present study appeared to be negatively correlated with dissolved nitrogen content including no3 no2 and nh4 table s7 it has been observed that raphidiopsis spp strains produced more cyn in cultures depleted with a fixed nitrogen source than cultures supplied with no3 and nh4 saker and neilan 2001 on the other hand another study found that when nitrogen limitation started cyn contents in aphanizomenon ovalisporum cells significantly decreased and soon resumed rapidly as the heterocyst and nitrogenase formation appeared vasas et al 2013 recently thresholds of 0 3 ug chl a per ug tp and 0 042 ug chl a per ug tn were applied to roughly estimate p or n limitation maberly et al 2020 in the studied lake the observed ratio of chl a to tp i e 1 2 ug chl a per ug tp and 0 04 ug chl a per ug tn suggested a potential p limitation previous studies bar yosef et al 2010 lu et al 2021 have found that cyn can act as an infochemical to trigger other phytoplankton species to secrete alkaline phosphatase leading to an increase in bioavailable p concentration and thus help ameliorate the p deficient situation and support the dominance of cyn producers as concluded by rzymski and poniedziałek 2014 cyn production could be triggered when cyanobacteria deal with physiological stress or adapt to unfavorable environmental conditions e g limitation of nutrients 3 5 limitations and future perspectives our well calibrated and validated rf model framework can be used to quickly predict cyanotoxins in freshwater lakes when general and easily obtained wqis are available such a rapid predictive tool can circumvent the need for field surveys and laboratory measurements of cyanotoxins that are limited by budget time and skilled personnel however major challenges and limitations in this study still lie in the sparsely measured data for the model calibration and validation we expect high frequency data e g real time water quality sensor data in future to supplement the current models hence immensely improving the model performance prediction of cyanotoxins by using easily obtained wqis is recommended particularly when integrated with real time sensors which provides a strategy for developing a real time cyanotoxin forecasting system that can assist regulators to protect water resources shively et al 2016 moreover the rf models have shown advantages in discovering the non linear relationships between cyanotoxins and environmental variables as well as identifying key drivers through the feature importance our model framework can be further explored to quantify the dynamics of cyanotoxin production affected by changes in environmental drivers e g nutrient content which will be included in our future work although this work focuses on mcs and cyn models based on a specific tropical lake we believe our framework can be applied to other contaminants of concern furthermore our findings also show general relevance for nutrient rich tropical water bodies 4 conclusions in this study the occurrence and distribution of 18 multi class cyanobacterial secondary metabolites in a frequent bloom occurring tropical lake were investigated it was found that a wide variety of cyanobacterial metabolites was detected in the waters including 11 mcs mc rr dm rr mc lr dm lr mc yr mc hilr mc wr mc la mc ly mc htyr mc lf cyn atx a hatx a apta and aptb and therein hatx a mc htyr and mc lf were solely found intracellularly intracellular mcs atxs and apts were detected at higher levels and frequencies than extracellular ones while cyn showed contrary results the composition of the studied cyanobacterial metabolites in accordance with phytoplankton community structures varied at different sites during the sampling periods notably the increase in cyn would potentially induce a reduction in mcs as a consequence of interspecific competition between different species we developed rf models that provide rapid prediction of mcs and cyn by using water quality indicators 4 out of 22 water quality variables i e chl a tc rainfall and nh4 were determined to be the most important predictors of mcs the trends in cyn concentration were mainly driven by cl tc rainfall and no3 these results obtained from the field survey

16287,lignin a biological resource with great potential can be as high as 16 of the total organics in the waste activated sludge was this work therefore aims to fill the knowledge gap about the effect of lignin on short chain fatty acids scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of sludge experimental results showed that lignin promoted rather than inhibited scfas production specifically the presence of 15 lignin promoted the scfas production from 129 1 6 5 to 223 14 7 8 mg cod g vss compared with the control and the proportion of acetic increased by 61 8 while that of propionic decreased by 44 9 mechanism exploration revealed that lignin improved the solubilization of biodegradable substrates due to its hydrophobic characteristics in addition lignin enhanced the acidogenesis process possibly by perfecting the electron transfer chain in the fermentation system and the quinone structure in lignin may compete electrons with methanogens to inhibit the consumption of scfas microbiological analysis showed that the abundance of microorganisms related to acidogenesi especially the acetogenesis including proteiniclasticum sp acetoanaerobium sp in the fermenter with lignin increased which caused the community to shift towards specialized and diverse scfas production image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic fermentation lignin waste activated sludge refractory organics short chain fatty acids production 1 introduction the rapid development of urbanization promoted the upgrading of the scale and process of wastewater treatment plants wwtps at present activated sludge process has been extensively adopted in most wwtps as main treatment process which inevitably led to the mass production of was as a by product fan et al 2019 among various sludge treatment technologies anaerobic fermentation has attracted widespread attention because of its ability to convert organics in sludge into energy products such as scfas and hydrogen to realize sludge energy conversion abelleira pereira et al 2015 raheem et al 2018 nie et al 2020 it is worth noting that scfa can be used as a high quality carbon source to replace commercial carbon sources in wwtps to supplement the wastewater pollutant removal process filling the shortcomings of insufficient carbon sources in this process jiang et al 2009 in addition scfa is the best raw material for biodegradable plastics mino et al 1998 anaerobic fermentation was a process in which anaerobic bacteria and archaea used the organics in the sludge as a substrate for a series of biochemical reactions and finally obtained scfas h2 and co2 he et al 2021a among them in order to improve the conversion efficiency of biodegradable organics e g protein carbohydrate and polyhydroxyalkanoates in the sludge a large number of pretreatment measures have been studied in an attempt to try to get rid of the extracellular polymeric substances and cell wall and or membrane of sludge flocs the binding of organics in the cell liu et al 2021b fu et al 2022 for example wang et al 2013 found that the concentration of carbohydrate and protein increased from 0 003 mg mg vs and 0 002 mg mg vs to 0 034 mg mg vs and 0 021 mg under 2 13 mg n l free nitrous acid treatment compared with untreated was recent studies have shown that prolonging the aeration time about 1 h can be observed the increase of polyhydroxyalkanoates in was from 25 to 116 mg g vss which in turn reduced the fermentation time from 8 days to 4 days the corresponding scfas yields were 231 0 mg cod g vss and 304 6 mg cod g vss wang et al 2015 on the other hand the potentially toxic substances in was such as flocculants drugs and heavy metals have been shown to have an impact on anaerobic fermentation wang et al 2022 liu et al 2021a our published research shown that the presence of cationic polyacrylamide not only significantly reduced the accumulation of scfas but also affected the composition of scfas liu et al 2019 xu et al 2017 indicated that cadmium of 10 mg g vss caused 68 1 inhibition of scfas production but when the content of triclocarban in the sludge increased from 26 7 5 3 to 520 5 12 6 mg kg tss the concentration of scfas increased from 32 6 2 5 to 228 2 3 6 mg cod g vss wang et al 2017 in addition to the above substances was also contained massive refractory organics such as humus and lignocellulose it has been revealed that the content of humus accounted for 30 of the total organics in was while the content of lignocellulose was 40 wilen et al 2003 these substances were difficult to be decomposed and transformed by microorganisms in the was anaerobic fermentation process due to their complex and stable chemical structure moreover their presence has been reported to negatively affect anaerobic fermentation for example humic acid the major form of humus binned to key enzymes to hinder the hydrolysis of carbohydrates and lipids which greatly inhibited the fermentation production of acetate by 98 carbon dioxide by 49 hydrogen by 90 and ch4 production by 86 ye et al 2016 lignin derived from the residues of exogenous materials e g toilet tissue vegetable remnants leaves in the wastewater streams was a complex amorphous three dimensional long chain multi phase high molecular weight 6 105 15 106 kg km 1 aromatic polymers its presence in sludge was usually connected with cellulose and hemicellulose through different kinds of bonds hu et al 2016 lignin exhibited low biodegradability in anaerobic treatment due to its high resistance to chemical or biological depolymerization pore et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 therefore the current research mainly focuses on optimizing pretreatment such as microwave oxidation and alkaline to reduce the resistance of lignin to deconstruction piepenschneider et al 2016 yu et al 2019 sun et al 2017 for example gould 1984 proved that about half of the lignin was dissolved in the h2o2 concentration of 1 and the ph value of 11 5 for 18 24 h in addition lignin is the only type of heterogeneous phenylpropane polymer composed of aromatic monomers in large quantities pandey and kim 2011 due to the presence of phenylpropane polymer and a series of functional groups namely methoxy aliphatic aromatic hydroxyl benzyl alcohol ether acyclic benzyl ether and carbonyl group the influence of lignin on the bio processes microbial activity and community succession of sludge anaerobic fermentation may be different from that of humic acid however so far this difference has been overlooked in previous studies therefore the purpose of this work was to investigate the details of whether and how lignin affected the anaerobic fermentation of sludge based on the above unknows for a comprehensive understanding firstly scfas production of was alkaline fermentation ph 9 with the presence of lignin at different levels was compared because it was reported that the alkaline condition contributed to the accumulation of scfas huang et al 2017 then the mechanism by which lignin affected anaerobic fermentation was revealed the insights gained from this work will provide references for future research on the effective bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into renewable energy 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge and lignin the activated sludge used in the this and flowing test was taken from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtp in changsha china the retrieved activated sludge was filtered through a 1 l mm sieve then it will naturally settle for 24 h discard the supernatant and store the concentrated sludge in a refrigerator at 4 c for later use li et al 2018 its main properties are shown in table 1 in this study the commercial alkaline lignin purity over 95 cas 9005 53 2 purchased from hefei bomei chemical industrial park was regarded as modal lignin replacing the real lignin contained in was 2 2 chemical and biodegradable properties of lignin in order to explore whether alkaline lignin can be biodegradable and whether it can be used as a carbon source for producing scfas from anaerobic fermentation the following test was carried out three fermenters fermenter i fermenter ii and fermenter iii were respectively added with 300 ml pure water and then inoculated with 30 ml sludge fermenter i was set as the control for scfa analysis and 1 g alkaline lignin and 1 g alkaline lignin 50 mm sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonate was respectively added to fermenter ii and fermenter iii fermenter iii was used as a control for the fluorescence determination of alkaline lignin because sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonate was reported to inhibit methane microbial activity gajaraj et al 2017 finally all ferments were blown off with nitrogen for 5 min to remove oxygen then plugged with rubber plugs and placed in an air bath shaker with 25 c and 150 r min for fermentation the fermentation time was controlled at 7 days in this process the scfa contents in fermenter i and ii were detected daily and the supernatants of fermenter ii and iii were subjected to fluorescence measurement at the start and end of fermentation 2 3 scfa production from was anaerobic fermentation in the presence of lignin at different levels this batch experiment used 3 l was and five 1 l fermenters for anaerobic fermentation and each fermenter was filled with 600 ml was lignin at different dosages of 0 0 4761 0 9522 1 4283 and 1 9044 g were then added into these fermenters to attain the desired lignin level lignin vss of 0 5 10 15 and 20 since alkaline condition was reported to be beneficial to scfa production the initial ph value in all fermenters was maintained at 9 0 0 1 with 4 0 m hcl solution or 4 0 m naoh solution at the beginning of the fermentation chen et al 2007 all other operations were the same as those described in the section chemical and biodegradable properties of lignin the samples taken out regularly were centrifuged and filtered to measure the scfa proteins scod and other chemical indicators in the supernatant 2 4 influence of lignin on the key biological process of was anaerobic fermentation in the following experiment ten fermenters similar to the above were set up which were divided into five groups with two in each group model substrates were used to replace was as fermentation substrates to evaluate the effects of lignin on key biological processes of anaerobic fermentation such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis appels et al 2008 hydrolysis group this experiment mainly characterized the effect of lignin on the hydrolysis of sludge after the organic matter in sludge was released it entered the hydrolysis stage therefore the synthetic wastewater contained 3 5 g l bovine serum albumin bsa protein model substance was used as the fermentation substrate for simulation the specific operation was that two reactors received 270 ml of synthetic wastewater and 30 ml of inoculum contained 0 or 2 38 g l lignin these concentrations were equal to the amount of the 0 and 15 fermenters in section scfa production from was fermentation in the presence of lignin at different levels other fermentation conditions were the same as described in the section chemical and biodegradable properties of lignin the effect of lignin on the hydrolysis stage of sludge anaerobic fermentation was clarified by detecting and analyzing the degradation rate of bsa and cod in each reactor acidogenesis group the procedure of this experiment was the same as that of hydrolysis group except that glucose was used as the fermentation substrate in the acidogenesis stage instead of bsa the effect of lignin on the acidogenesis stage of anaerobic fermentation was determined by comparing the contents of scfas and cod acetogenesis group the synthetic wastewater in this experiment was composed of 3 5 g l propionate except for the different component in the synthetic wastewater the remaining operating conditions were the same as those in the hydrolysis group experiment the contents of scfas and methane were measured and the influence of lignin on the acetogenesis stage of sludge anaerobic fermentation was analyzed homoacetogenesis group the two reactors were respectively inoculated with 270 ml of distilled water and 30 ml of lignin containing sludge the concentrations of which were consistent with the hydrolysis group experiment subsequently the mixed gas was exposed to the reactor for five minutes sealed and anaerobic fermentation was carried out under the same conditions as above the mixed gas was composed of 40 h2 10 co2 and 50 n2 by analyzing the difference of h2 and ch4 contents in each reactor the effect of lignin on the homoacetogenesis of sludge anaerobic fermentation was evaluated methonogenesis group this experiment uses acetate instead of bsa as the fermentation substrate in the methonogenesis stage and other operations and conditions were the same as the hydrolysis group experiment the effect of lignin on methonogenesis of anaerobic fermentation was evaluated by comparing the reduction of acetate and the production of methane 2 5 effect of lignin on the microbial community of was anaerobic fermentation in this test two long term semi continuous reactors each with a working volume of 1000 ml were operated to investigate the effect of lignin on the changes in the microbial community structure of the was anaerobic fermentation based on the result of the batch fermentation in section scfa production from was fermentation in the presence of lignin at different levels the maximum scfas production was obtained in 4 d two reactors were fed with 600 ml of alkaline treated sludge then lignin was added to the two reactors to control its concentration to 0 control and 15 experimental as described above 150 ml of the fermentation mixture was daily taken out from each reactor and then the same amounts of new alkaline treated sludge with or without lignin were supplemented into reactors in other words the sludge retention time for those reactors was controlled to 4 days all other fermentation conditions were the same as described in the section chemical and biodegradable properties of lignin after 60 days operation the scfas production and scod concentration in the two reactors did not change significantly with time fig s1 and then the microbial community determination was performed 2 6 assessment method 2 6 1 model assessment the effect of lignin on the degradation of model substrates in synthetic wastewater is

gc equipped with a hydrogen flame ion detector while the contents of hydrogen and methane are measured by a gas chromatograph gc112a china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector he et al 2021b the 3 d excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize the biodegradability of the commercial lignin i e alkaline lignin used in this work with the operation being detailed in supporting information test s1 in order to clarify the difference in chemical properties between alkaline lignin and the real lignin contained in the sludge ftir was employed the samples preparation and parameter settings were detailed in supporting information test s2 illumina miseq sequencing analysis was used to evaluate the diversity of microbial communities in two long term semi continuous fermenters during stable operation the fermentation samples were taken out of each fermentors and the solid phase was placed in a refrigerator at 20 c after centrifugation then the samples were sequentially subjected to dna extraction pcr amplification electrophoresis detection product purification and platform sequencing finally the diversity of the microbial community was analyzed on the miseq pe300 sequencing platform the sequencing type was bacterial 16s rrna the primer was 338e 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 8068 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 v3 v4 region and the length of the amplified product was 468 bp 2 8 statistical analysis all batch experiments were performed in triplicate analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate the significance of results software spss 22 0 and p 0 05 was indicated as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical and biodegradable properties of lignin fitr and fluorescence are widely recognized spectroscopic measurement methods in the literature that can characterize the chemical properties of organic substances liu et al 2015 since different chemical bonds or functional groups have different absorption frequencies fitr technology can be used to obtain information about what chemical bonds or functional groups are contained in the molecule fig 1 presented the fitr spectra of the lignin extracted from the sludge the extraction method was described in supporting information and the commercial lignin selected in this study it can be seen from the fig 1 that there were some differences between the two types of lignin but they still had a high similarity for example high intensity peak at the 3400 cm 1 band appeared in both lignin which was believed to be caused by the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group in the lignin and the existence of hydrogen bonds while the absorption band at 2940 cm 1 originated stretching of methyl and methylene in lignin wen et al 2013 the peaks at 1600 1550 and 1460 cm 1 in the spectrum were respectively attributed to the stretching vibration of the benzene ring carbonyl group and ether bond in the lignin which were characteristic peaks of lignin hossain et al 2019 in short both types of lignin contain functional group structures e g hydroxyl carbonyl groups the fluorescence spectra of the fermenter ii and fermenter iii before and after the 7 day fermentation test was shown in fig 2 it can be observed that two obvious fluorescence peaks were detected in all spectra and the fluorescence intensities at the two fluorescence peaks of the two fermenters were also similar it has been reported that the fluorescence intensity of the peak a at the longer wavelength ex 270 nm em 340 nm can characterize the connection and arrangement of the aromatic ring and other unsaturated structures in the macromolecular aromatic compound while peak b at the shorter wavelength ex 220 nm em 350 nm can indicate the presence of simple structures such as small molecular organics low aromatic compounds and conjugated chromophores chen et al 2002 chai et al 2012 this illustrated that the molecular structure and chemical function of the lignin used in this study did not change significantly before and after fermentation on the other hand the scfas production of fermenter i and fermenter ii table s1 also verified that this lignin could not be used as a fermentation substrate by microorganisms 3 2 effect of lignin on scfas production fig 3 demonstrated the effect of the presence of lignin at different levels in alkaline condition ph 9 0 on the scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation for 10 days it can be found that the scfas production in each fermenter maintained the similar trend that was it increases rapidly in the early stage of fermentation and then decreased it can also be observed from fig 3 that the scfas production in all five fermenters reached maximum on the 4th day the maximum scfas production from blank 0 was 129 1 6 5 mg cod g vss when the lignin contents were 5 10 15 and 20 the corresponding scfas productions were 150 2 6 1 190 8 10 0 223 1 7 8 and 207 6 8 0 mg cod g vss respectively the result of the analysis of variance table s2 declared that the increase of scfas production in the fermenters with lignin was significant further analysis found that lignin had only a slight effect on the composition ratio of isobutyric n butyric isovaleric acid and n valeric in scfas produced from was anaerobic fermentation however the addition of lignin caused an incident change in the percentages of acetic and propionic in the total scfas production compared with the fermenter without lignin the percentage of acetic in lignin fermenters with 5 10 15 and 20 increased by 33 4 51 0 61 8 and 54 1 respectively while the percentage of propionic decreased by 24 1 35 5 44 9 and 33 1 the above results clearly indicated that the presence of lignin could affect the scfas production especially acetic and propionic 3 3 mechanism of how lignin promotes the scfas production fig 4 a showed the effect of lignin level on the soluble cod content it can be seen that the soluble cod content in a fermenter without lignin i e 0 first increased and then decreased with the increase of fermentation time compared with alkaline treatment only i e 0 the maximum soluble cod of 1301 58 6 mg l was achieved at 4 days the presence of lignin greatly increased the cod content that was as the lignin concentration increased from 5 to 20 the maximum concentration of soluble cod increased from 1621 0 60 7 to 3039 9 41 2 mg l according to the previous test results the lignin used in this test was not biodegradable indicating that the increase of soluble cod in the fermenter with lignin was not due to the addition of lignin that was lignin accelerated the release of organics in was proteins and carbohydrates were the main biodegradable organic substrates so their concentrations in the fermenter were also commonly used to characterize the degree of sludge dissolution fig 4b and c exhibited the contents of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in each fermenter during the initial 6 days of fermentation when the lignin level was in the range of 0 to 20 the change trends of proteins and carbohydrates were consistent with scod according to reports the presence of humic acid one of the main refractory organics in the sludge can increase the soluble protein and carbohydrates in the fermenter by 150 compared to the control liu et al 2015 and similar results were found for lignin in this work in particular the presence of lignin respectively increased the soluble protein and carbohydrate concentrations in the system by 1 3 to 2 4 times and 1 2 to 1 7 times compared with the 0 in addition to scfas hydrogen was another valuable metabolite of sludge anaerobic fermentation which can be used as a clean energy source the hydrogen production can indicate the efficiency of anaerobic fermentation from another angle as shown in fig 4d the cumulative hydrogen production in the fermenter without lignin added was at the lowest level 7 1 0 3 ml g vss the cumulative production of hydrogen from fermenters with lignin added increased with the increase of lignin dosage and the main cumulative process of hydrogen occurred in the first 4 days and no significant increase in production was observed after 5 days it was reported that the functional groups such as phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in alkali lignin can be ionized under alkaline conditions showing the characteristics of anionic polyelectrolytes and the presence of hydrophilic functional groups and three dimensional aromatic ring skeletons caused lignin to exhibit some of the properties of surfactants fernando et al 2012 based on this characteristic lignin can be adsorbed to the surface of sludge flocs through electrostatic effect covalent bond and hydrophobicity fig 4e and improve the dispersion performance in the reactor through its own electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance ouyang et al 2011 in addition studies have shown that hydrophobic substances were easier to assemble freely in a larger hydrodynamic dimension which leaded to a significant drop in the total free energy of the system šmejkalová et al 2016 therefore the possible reason for the increased solubilization of sludge observed in this test was that the presence of lignin promoted the contact of sludge flocs with water in the fermenter after the organics were released through the solubilization process it will immediately participate in the hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis processes table 2 showed the degradation rate and inhibition constant of model substrates in the presence or absence of lignin according to the reported method he et al 2021a the presence of lignin led to a depression of the activity of microorganisms related to hydrolysis and methanogenesis by 46 4 and 65 7 respectively the results of inhibition kinetic analysis put on show that the inhibitory constant ks i of lignin on the degradation of acetate was the minimum value in that to the other substrates which indicated that the methanogenesis process was more susceptible to the negative influence of lignin than the hydrolysis processes in addition it can be found from table 2 that the microbial activity related to acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis increased from 12 72 0 45 to 18 97 0 73 mg g vss h 4 09 0 18 to 7 63 0 31 and 0 37 0 02 to 0 89 0 05 mg g vss h with an increase of 49 1 86 6 and 140 5 on the whole the presence of lignin reduced the hydrolysis efficiency of the substrate obtained by eq 3 but it significantly promoted the acidogenesis efficiency and severely inhibited the efficiency of the scfas consumption process i e methanogenesis fig s2 eq 4 and 5 which may be the potential factor for lignin to increase the scfas production from sludge anaerobic fermentation the reported inhibition mechanism of lignin on the hydrolysis process mainly involved that lignin can be combined with hydrolytic enzymes to form a physical barrier and irreversibly affected the protein structure of enzymes huang et al 2017 djajadi et al 2018 in general one of the key obstacles to scfas production was the lack of a complete electron transfer chain in the fermentation system however lignin as a large aromatic compound composed of three monomers namely coniferous alcohol coumarol and juncea alcohol contained many quinone structures cervantes et al 2000 lou et al 2015 this functional group structure can act as an active terminal electron acceptor to receive the remaining electrons in the system during the fermentation process as shown in fig 5 thereby stimulating the rate of scfas formation reaction liu et al al 2015 he et al 2021a in addition it was precisely because of the function of lignin which was similar to an electron transfer agent that it can prevent the conversion of acetate to methane leading to the accumulation of scfas li et al 2018 the scfas produced from sludge anaerobic fermentation was mainly the result of different microorganisms the presence of different levels of lignin may induce changes in the evolution of the microbial community in the sludge fermentation system thereby affecting the scfas production therefore in order to more clearly reveal the mechanism of lignin on the anaerobic fermentation of the was the implement of semi continuous experiments will reveal the response mechanism of anaerobic microorganisms to the lignin addition from the level of community evolution rarefaction curves were usually used to compare the abundance of species in sequencing samples and also to illustrate the rationality of the sequencing data of the samples wei et al 2020 as can be seen from fig 6 a the ends of the two curves tended to be flat indicating that the amount of sequencing data were reliable and the abundance of microorganisms in the lignin reactor i e experimental was higher than that in the reactor without lignin i e control further analysis of the venn diagram of the otus microbial community based on 97 similarity can reveal the differences between core variable microorganisms in the samples during anaerobic fermentation fig 6b it can be found that there was obvious intersection of otus 440 in the two reactors which may be the core microbial unit of sludge anaerobic fermentation in addition as the lignin content increased from 0 control to 15 experiment the number of unique otus in the reactors increased from 24 to 81 indicating that lignin may create a new type of fermentation environment the distribution of the microbial abundance in the two reactors on the phylum classification level was shown in fig 6c firmicutes actinobacteriota proteobacteria and chloroflexi were the dominant microbial populations in the two reactors these types of microorganisms were primarily responsible for the breakdown of macromolecular organics such as carbohydrates and proteins in the fermentation system duan et al 2018 ariesyady et al 2007 the addition of lignin caused a decrease in the abundance of these phylums in the reactor from 80 9 to 74 9 fig s3 however the abundances of bacteroidota and acidobacteriota which were mainly involved in the degradation of refractory organics increased zheng et al 2013 in particular acidobacteriota has been reported to use organics e g cellulose and hemicellulose cross linked with lignin through physical or chemical action as a substrate for the production of acetic pankratov et al 2012 2011 fig 7 displayed the heatmap of the microorganisms related to the scfas production at genus level in long term semi continuous fermenters without or with lignin although the presence of related microorganisms was detected in the two fermenters there was distinct difference in the abundance of microorganisms specifically norank f caldilineaceae sp romboutsia sp unclassified f rhodobacteraceae sp proteocatella sp have been proved to be the key microorganisms in the hydrolysis process while their abundance decreased with different degrees in the experimental fermenter jiang et al 2021 kim et al 2013 luo et al 2021 among them the decline of proteocatella sp was the largest up to 70 8 this fact was consistent with the conclusion of table 1 indicating that the introduction of lignin will negatively affect the hydrolysis efficiency of sludge anaerobic fermentation however the abundances of proteiniclasticum sp christensenellaceae r 7 group sp this genus of microorganisms can acidize organic substrates into scfas with acetic as the main product in experimental fermenters increased from 2 29 to 8 81 and 1 29 to 2 77 compared with control zhang et al 2010 2021 in addition the abundance of acetoanaerobium sp a rare homoacetogen in the sludge fermentation system in experimental fermenters was 2 6 times that of control sleat et al 1985 3 5 implication lignin a rich and renewable biomass resource can be produced by plant growth alone up to 150 billion tons every year and it is also an important component of the available organics in was rajdev et al 2015 in traditional cognition the presence of lignin in sludge leaded to low energy conversion efficiency of sludge therefore current research focused on how to strip and degrade lignin from lignocellulose to reduce its negative effects this was the first time to reveal the independent effect of lignin on the scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of sludge filling this theoretical gap and providing engineers with a technical reserve for the future operation of wwtps through experimental implementation and chemical or biological analysis it was found that the lignin in the sludge had the potential to promote rather than inhibit the scfas production which subverted the stereotype of lignin on anaerobic treatment of sludge it was worth noting that lignin can promote processes related to scfas production such as solubilization acidogenesis and homoacetogenesis but severely inhibited methonogenesis therefore in sludge or other organic solid waste with high lignin levels anaerobic fermentation for scfas production seemed to be a more preferred measure for anaerobic treatment than anaerobic digestion for methane production otherwise engineers were recommended to take additional measures to reduce the toxicity of lignin to methanogens however this batch test only studied one type which had similar properties to the lignin in sludge and whether the lignin in other wastes e g straw can be applied to the conclusion of this work needed further research to confirm in the future eqs 4 and 5 4 conclusion this work revealed for the first time the individual effect and underlying mechanism of lignin on the scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation the main conclusions were as follows 1 the presence of lignin enhanced rather than inhibited the scfas production especially acetic acid 2 the maximum scfas production of 223 14 7 82 mg cod g vss can be obtained from the fermenter with 15 lignin for four day alkaline fermentation 3 the main mechanism for the increase of scfas production in the fermenter with lignin was that lignin promoted the processes related to the production of scfas in anaerobic fermentation such as solubilization acidogenesis and acetification and severely inhibited the consumption of scfas on the other 4 lignin improved the abundance of proteiniclasticum sp christensenellaceae r 7 group sp acetoanaerobium sp which were considered scfas producers supporting information this file contains additional analytical methods text s1 s3 tables s1 s2 and figs s1

16287,lignin a biological resource with great potential can be as high as 16 of the total organics in the waste activated sludge was this work therefore aims to fill the knowledge gap about the effect of lignin on short chain fatty acids scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of sludge experimental results showed that lignin promoted rather than inhibited scfas production specifically the presence of 15 lignin promoted the scfas production from 129 1 6 5 to 223 14 7 8 mg cod g vss compared with the control and the proportion of acetic increased by 61 8 while that of propionic decreased by 44 9 mechanism exploration revealed that lignin improved the solubilization of biodegradable substrates due to its hydrophobic characteristics in addition lignin enhanced the acidogenesis process possibly by perfecting the electron transfer chain in the fermentation system and the quinone structure in lignin may compete electrons with methanogens to inhibit the consumption of scfas microbiological analysis showed that the abundance of microorganisms related to acidogenesi especially the acetogenesis including proteiniclasticum sp acetoanaerobium sp in the fermenter with lignin increased which caused the community to shift towards specialized and diverse scfas production image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic fermentation lignin waste activated sludge refractory organics short chain fatty acids production 1 introduction the rapid development of urbanization promoted the upgrading of the scale and process of wastewater treatment plants wwtps at present activated sludge process has been extensively adopted in most wwtps as main treatment process which inevitably led to the mass production of was as a by product fan et al 2019 among various sludge treatment technologies anaerobic fermentation has attracted widespread attention because of its ability to convert organics in sludge into energy products such as scfas and hydrogen to realize sludge energy conversion abelleira pereira et al 2015 raheem et al 2018 nie et al 2020 it is worth noting that scfa can be used as a high quality carbon source to replace commercial carbon sources in wwtps to supplement the wastewater pollutant removal process filling the shortcomings of insufficient carbon sources in this process jiang et al 2009 in addition scfa is the best raw material for biodegradable plastics mino et al 1998 anaerobic fermentation was a process in which anaerobic bacteria and archaea used the organics in the sludge as a substrate for a series of biochemical reactions and finally obtained scfas h2 and co2 he et al 2021a among them in order to improve the conversion efficiency of biodegradable organics e g protein carbohydrate and polyhydroxyalkanoates in the sludge a large number of pretreatment measures have been studied in an attempt to try to get rid of the extracellular polymeric substances and cell wall and or membrane of sludge flocs the binding of organics in the cell liu et al 2021b fu et al 2022 for example wang et al 2013 found that the concentration of carbohydrate and protein increased from 0 003 mg mg vs and 0 002 mg mg vs to 0 034 mg mg vs and 0 021 mg under 2 13 mg n l free nitrous acid treatment compared with untreated was recent studies have shown that prolonging the aeration time about 1 h can be observed the increase of polyhydroxyalkanoates in was from 25 to 116 mg g vss which in turn reduced the fermentation time from 8 days to 4 days the corresponding scfas yields were 231 0 mg cod g vss and 304 6 mg cod g vss wang et al 2015 on the other hand the potentially toxic substances in was such as flocculants drugs and heavy metals have been shown to have an impact on anaerobic fermentation wang et al 2022 liu et al 2021a our published research shown that the presence of cationic polyacrylamide not only significantly reduced the accumulation of scfas but also affected the composition of scfas liu et al 2019 xu et al 2017 indicated that cadmium of 10 mg g vss caused 68 1 inhibition of scfas production but when the content of triclocarban in the sludge increased from 26 7 5 3 to 520 5 12 6 mg kg tss the concentration of scfas increased from 32 6 2 5 to 228 2 3 6 mg cod g vss wang et al 2017 in addition to the above substances was also contained massive refractory organics such as humus and lignocellulose it has been revealed that the content of humus accounted for 30 of the total organics in was while the content of lignocellulose was 40 wilen et al 2003 these substances were difficult to be decomposed and transformed by microorganisms in the was anaerobic fermentation process due to their complex and stable chemical structure moreover their presence has been reported to negatively affect anaerobic fermentation for example humic acid the major form of humus binned to key enzymes to hinder the hydrolysis of carbohydrates and lipids which greatly inhibited the fermentation production of acetate by 98 carbon dioxide by 49 hydrogen by 90 and ch4 production by 86 ye et al 2016 lignin derived from the residues of exogenous materials e g toilet tissue vegetable remnants leaves in the wastewater streams was a complex amorphous three dimensional long chain multi phase high molecular weight 6 105 15 106 kg km 1 aromatic polymers its presence in sludge was usually connected with cellulose and hemicellulose through different kinds of bonds hu et al 2016 lignin exhibited low biodegradability in anaerobic treatment due to its high resistance to chemical or biological depolymerization pore et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 therefore the current research mainly focuses on optimizing pretreatment such as microwave oxidation and alkaline to reduce the resistance of lignin to deconstruction piepenschneider et al 2016 yu et al 2019 sun et al 2017 for example gould 1984 proved that about half of the lignin was dissolved in the h2o2 concentration of 1 and the ph value of 11 5 for 18 24 h in addition lignin is the only type of heterogeneous phenylpropane polymer composed of aromatic monomers in large quantities pandey and kim 2011 due to the presence of phenylpropane polymer and a series of functional groups namely methoxy aliphatic aromatic hydroxyl benzyl alcohol ether acyclic benzyl ether and carbonyl group the influence of lignin on the bio processes microbial activity and community succession of sludge anaerobic fermentation may be different from that of humic acid however so far this difference has been overlooked in previous studies therefore the purpose of this work was to investigate the details of whether and how lignin affected the anaerobic fermentation of sludge based on the above unknows for a comprehensive understanding firstly scfas production of was alkaline fermentation ph 9 with the presence of lignin at different levels was compared because it was reported that the alkaline condition contributed to the accumulation of scfas huang et al 2017 then the mechanism by which lignin affected anaerobic fermentation was revealed the insights gained from this work will provide references for future research on the effective bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into renewable energy 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge and lignin the activated sludge used in the this and flowing test was taken from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtp in changsha china the retrieved activated sludge was filtered through a 1 l mm sieve then it will naturally settle for 24 h discard the supernatant and store the concentrated sludge in a refrigerator at 4 c for later use li et al 2018 its main properties are shown in table 1 in this study the commercial alkaline lignin purity over 95 cas 9005 53 2 purchased from hefei bomei chemical industrial park was regarded as modal lignin replacing the real lignin contained in was 2 2 chemical and biodegradable properties of lignin in order to explore whether alkaline lignin can be biodegradable and whether it can be used as a carbon source for producing scfas from anaerobic fermentation the following test was carried out three fermenters fermenter i fermenter ii and fermenter iii were respectively added with 300 ml pure water and then inoculated with 30 ml sludge fermenter i was set as the control for scfa analysis and 1 g alkaline lignin and 1 g alkaline lignin 50 mm sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonate was respectively added to fermenter ii and fermenter iii fermenter iii was used as a control for the fluorescence determination of alkaline lignin because sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonate was reported to inhibit methane microbial activity gajaraj et al 2017 finally all ferments were blown off with nitrogen for 5 min to remove oxygen then plugged with rubber plugs and placed in an air bath shaker with 25 c and 150 r min for fermentation the fermentation time was controlled at 7 days in this process the scfa contents in fermenter i and ii were detected daily and the supernatants of fermenter ii and iii were subjected to fluorescence measurement at the start and end of fermentation 2 3 scfa production from was anaerobic fermentation in the presence of lignin at different levels this batch experiment used 3 l was and five 1 l fermenters for anaerobic fermentation and each fermenter was filled with 600 ml was lignin at different dosages of 0 0 4761 0 9522 1 4283 and 1 9044 g were then added into these fermenters to attain the desired lignin level lignin vss of 0 5 10 15 and 20 since alkaline condition was reported to be beneficial to scfa production the initial ph value in all fermenters was maintained at 9 0 0 1 with 4 0 m hcl solution or 4 0 m naoh solution at the beginning of the fermentation chen et al 2007 all other operations were the same as those described in the section chemical and biodegradable properties of lignin the samples taken out regularly were centrifuged and filtered to measure the scfa proteins scod and other chemical indicators in the supernatant 2 4 influence of lignin on the key biological process of was anaerobic fermentation in the following experiment ten fermenters similar to the above were set up which were divided into five groups with two in each group model substrates were used to replace was as fermentation substrates to evaluate the effects of lignin on key biological processes of anaerobic fermentation such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis appels et al 2008 hydrolysis group this experiment mainly characterized the effect of lignin on the hydrolysis of sludge after the organic matter in sludge was released it entered the hydrolysis stage therefore the synthetic wastewater contained 3 5 g l bovine serum albumin bsa protein model substance was used as the fermentation substrate for simulation the specific operation was that two reactors received 270 ml of synthetic wastewater and 30 ml of inoculum contained 0 or 2 38 g l lignin these concentrations were equal to the amount of the 0 and 15 fermenters in section scfa production from was fermentation in the presence of lignin at different levels other fermentation conditions were the same as described in the section chemical and biodegradable properties of lignin the effect of lignin on the hydrolysis stage of sludge anaerobic fermentation was clarified by detecting and analyzing the degradation rate of bsa and cod in each reactor acidogenesis group the procedure of this experiment was the same as that of hydrolysis group except that glucose was used as the fermentation substrate in the acidogenesis stage instead of bsa the effect of lignin on the acidogenesis stage of anaerobic fermentation was determined by comparing the contents of scfas and cod acetogenesis group the synthetic wastewater in this experiment was composed of 3 5 g l propionate except for the different component in the synthetic wastewater the remaining operating conditions were the same as those in the hydrolysis group experiment the contents of scfas and methane were measured and the influence of lignin on the acetogenesis stage of sludge anaerobic fermentation was analyzed homoacetogenesis group the two reactors were respectively inoculated with 270 ml of distilled water and 30 ml of lignin containing sludge the concentrations of which were consistent with the hydrolysis group experiment subsequently the mixed gas was exposed to the reactor for five minutes sealed and anaerobic fermentation was carried out under the same conditions as above the mixed gas was composed of 40 h2 10 co2 and 50 n2 by analyzing the difference of h2 and ch4 contents in each reactor the effect of lignin on the homoacetogenesis of sludge anaerobic fermentation was evaluated methonogenesis group this experiment uses acetate instead of bsa as the fermentation substrate in the methonogenesis stage and other operations and conditions were the same as the hydrolysis group experiment the effect of lignin on methonogenesis of anaerobic fermentation was evaluated by comparing the reduction of acetate and the production of methane 2 5 effect of lignin on the microbial community of was anaerobic fermentation in this test two long term semi continuous reactors each with a working volume of 1000 ml were operated to investigate the effect of lignin on the changes in the microbial community structure of the was anaerobic fermentation based on the result of the batch fermentation in section scfa production from was fermentation in the presence of lignin at different levels the maximum scfas production was obtained in 4 d two reactors were fed with 600 ml of alkaline treated sludge then lignin was added to the two reactors to control its concentration to 0 control and 15 experimental as described above 150 ml of the fermentation mixture was daily taken out from each reactor and then the same amounts of new alkaline treated sludge with or without lignin were supplemented into reactors in other words the sludge retention time for those reactors was controlled to 4 days all other fermentation conditions were the same as described in the section chemical and biodegradable properties of lignin after 60 days operation the scfas production and scod concentration in the two reactors did not change significantly with time fig s1 and then the microbial community determination was performed 2 6 assessment method 2 6 1 model assessment the effect of lignin on the degradation of model substrates in synthetic wastewater is

gc equipped with a hydrogen flame ion detector while the contents of hydrogen and methane are measured by a gas chromatograph gc112a china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector he et al 2021b the 3 d excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize the biodegradability of the commercial lignin i e alkaline lignin used in this work with the operation being detailed in supporting information test s1 in order to clarify the difference in chemical properties between alkaline lignin and the real lignin contained in the sludge ftir was employed the samples preparation and parameter settings were detailed in supporting information test s2 illumina miseq sequencing analysis was used to evaluate the diversity of microbial communities in two long term semi continuous fermenters during stable operation the fermentation samples were taken out of each fermentors and the solid phase was placed in a refrigerator at 20 c after centrifugation then the samples were sequentially subjected to dna extraction pcr amplification electrophoresis detection product purification and platform sequencing finally the diversity of the microbial community was analyzed on the miseq pe300 sequencing platform the sequencing type was bacterial 16s rrna the primer was 338e 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 8068 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 v3 v4 region and the length of the amplified product was 468 bp 2 8 statistical analysis all batch experiments were performed in triplicate analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate the significance of results software spss 22 0 and p 0 05 was indicated as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical and biodegradable properties of lignin fitr and fluorescence are widely recognized spectroscopic measurement methods in the literature that can characterize the chemical properties of organic substances liu et al 2015 since different chemical bonds or functional groups have different absorption frequencies fitr technology can be used to obtain information about what chemical bonds or functional groups are contained in the molecule fig 1 presented the fitr spectra of the lignin extracted from the sludge the extraction method was described in supporting information and the commercial lignin selected in this study it can be seen from the fig 1 that there were some differences between the two types of lignin but they still had a high similarity for example high intensity peak at the 3400 cm 1 band appeared in both lignin which was believed to be caused by the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group in the lignin and the existence of hydrogen bonds while the absorption band at 2940 cm 1 originated stretching of methyl and methylene in lignin wen et al 2013 the peaks at 1600 1550 and 1460 cm 1 in the spectrum were respectively attributed to the stretching vibration of the benzene ring carbonyl group and ether bond in the lignin which were characteristic peaks of lignin hossain et al 2019 in short both types of lignin contain functional group structures e g hydroxyl carbonyl groups the fluorescence spectra of the fermenter ii and fermenter iii before and after the 7 day fermentation test was shown in fig 2 it can be observed that two obvious fluorescence peaks were detected in all spectra and the fluorescence intensities at the two fluorescence peaks of the two fermenters were also similar it has been reported that the fluorescence intensity of the peak a at the longer wavelength ex 270 nm em 340 nm can characterize the connection and arrangement of the aromatic ring and other unsaturated structures in the macromolecular aromatic compound while peak b at the shorter wavelength ex 220 nm em 350 nm can indicate the presence of simple structures such as small molecular organics low aromatic compounds and conjugated chromophores chen et al 2002 chai et al 2012 this illustrated that the molecular structure and chemical function of the lignin used in this study did not change significantly before and after fermentation on the other hand the scfas production of fermenter i and fermenter ii table s1 also verified that this lignin could not be used as a fermentation substrate by microorganisms 3 2 effect of lignin on scfas production fig 3 demonstrated the effect of the presence of lignin at different levels in alkaline condition ph 9 0 on the scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation for 10 days it can be found that the scfas production in each fermenter maintained the similar trend that was it increases rapidly in the early stage of fermentation and then decreased it can also be observed from fig 3 that the scfas production in all five fermenters reached maximum on the 4th day the maximum scfas production from blank 0 was 129 1 6 5 mg cod g vss when the lignin contents were 5 10 15 and 20 the corresponding scfas productions were 150 2 6 1 190 8 10 0 223 1 7 8 and 207 6 8 0 mg cod g vss respectively the result of the analysis of variance table s2 declared that the increase of scfas production in the fermenters with lignin was significant further analysis found that lignin had only a slight effect on the composition ratio of isobutyric n butyric isovaleric acid and n valeric in scfas produced from was anaerobic fermentation however the addition of lignin caused an incident change in the percentages of acetic and propionic in the total scfas production compared with the fermenter without lignin the percentage of acetic in lignin fermenters with 5 10 15 and 20 increased by 33 4 51 0 61 8 and 54 1 respectively while the percentage of propionic decreased by 24 1 35 5 44 9 and 33 1 the above results clearly indicated that the presence of lignin could affect the scfas production especially acetic and propionic 3 3 mechanism of how lignin promotes the scfas production fig 4 a showed the effect of lignin level on the soluble cod content it can be seen that the soluble cod content in a fermenter without lignin i e 0 first increased and then decreased with the increase of fermentation time compared with alkaline treatment only i e 0 the maximum soluble cod of 1301 58 6 mg l was achieved at 4 days the presence of lignin greatly increased the cod content that was as the lignin concentration increased from 5 to 20 the maximum concentration of soluble cod increased from 1621 0 60 7 to 3039 9 41 2 mg l according to the previous test results the lignin used in this test was not biodegradable indicating that the increase of soluble cod in the fermenter with lignin was not due to the addition of lignin that was lignin accelerated the release of organics in was proteins and carbohydrates were the main biodegradable organic substrates so their concentrations in the fermenter were also commonly used to characterize the degree of sludge dissolution fig 4b and c exhibited the contents of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in each fermenter during the initial 6 days of fermentation when the lignin level was in the range of 0 to 20 the change trends of proteins and carbohydrates were consistent with scod according to reports the presence of humic acid one of the main refractory organics in the sludge can increase the soluble protein and carbohydrates in the fermenter by 150 compared to the control liu et al 2015 and similar results were found for lignin in this work in particular the presence of lignin respectively increased the soluble protein and carbohydrate concentrations in the system by 1 3 to 2 4 times and 1 2 to 1 7 times compared with the 0 in addition to scfas hydrogen was another valuable metabolite of sludge anaerobic fermentation which can be used as a clean energy source the hydrogen production can indicate the efficiency of anaerobic fermentation from another angle as shown in fig 4d the cumulative hydrogen production in the fermenter without lignin added was at the lowest level 7 1 0 3 ml g vss the cumulative production of hydrogen from fermenters with lignin added increased with the increase of lignin dosage and the main cumulative process of hydrogen occurred in the first 4 days and no significant increase in production was observed after 5 days it was reported that the functional groups such as phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in alkali lignin can be ionized under alkaline conditions showing the characteristics of anionic polyelectrolytes and the presence of hydrophilic functional groups and three dimensional aromatic ring skeletons caused lignin to exhibit some of the properties of surfactants fernando et al 2012 based on this characteristic lignin can be adsorbed to the surface of sludge flocs through electrostatic effect covalent bond and hydrophobicity fig 4e and improve the dispersion performance in the reactor through its own electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance ouyang et al 2011 in addition studies have shown that hydrophobic substances were easier to assemble freely in a larger hydrodynamic dimension which leaded to a significant drop in the total free energy of the system šmejkalová et al 2016 therefore the possible reason for the increased solubilization of sludge observed in this test was that the presence of lignin promoted the contact of sludge flocs with water in the fermenter after the organics were released through the solubilization process it will immediately participate in the hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis processes table 2 showed the degradation rate and inhibition constant of model substrates in the presence or absence of lignin according to the reported method he et al 2021a the presence of lignin led to a depression of the activity of microorganisms related to hydrolysis and methanogenesis by 46 4 and 65 7 respectively the results of inhibition kinetic analysis put on show that the inhibitory constant ks i of lignin on the degradation of acetate was the minimum value in that to the other substrates which indicated that the methanogenesis process was more susceptible to the negative influence of lignin than the hydrolysis processes in addition it can be found from table 2 that the microbial activity related to acidogenesis acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis increased from 12 72 0 45 to 18 97 0 73 mg g vss h 4 09 0 18 to 7 63 0 31 and 0 37 0 02 to 0 89 0 05 mg g vss h with an increase of 49 1 86 6 and 140 5 on the whole the presence of lignin reduced the hydrolysis efficiency of the substrate obtained by eq 3 but it significantly promoted the acidogenesis efficiency and severely inhibited the efficiency of the scfas consumption process i e methanogenesis fig s2 eq 4 and 5 which may be the potential factor for lignin to increase the scfas production from sludge anaerobic fermentation the reported inhibition mechanism of lignin on the hydrolysis process mainly involved that lignin can be combined with hydrolytic enzymes to form a physical barrier and irreversibly affected the protein structure of enzymes huang et al 2017 djajadi et al 2018 in general one of the key obstacles to scfas production was the lack of a complete electron transfer chain in the fermentation system however lignin as a large aromatic compound composed of three monomers namely coniferous alcohol coumarol and juncea alcohol contained many quinone structures cervantes et al 2000 lou et al 2015 this functional group structure can act as an active terminal electron acceptor to receive the remaining electrons in the system during the fermentation process as shown in fig 5 thereby stimulating the rate of scfas formation reaction liu et al al 2015 he et al 2021a in addition it was precisely because of the function of lignin which was similar to an electron transfer agent that it can prevent the conversion of acetate to methane leading to the accumulation of scfas li et al 2018 the scfas produced from sludge anaerobic fermentation was mainly the result of different microorganisms the presence of different levels of lignin may induce changes in the evolution of the microbial community in the sludge fermentation system thereby affecting the scfas production therefore in order to more clearly reveal the mechanism of lignin on the anaerobic fermentation of the was the implement of semi continuous experiments will reveal the response mechanism of anaerobic microorganisms to the lignin addition from the level of community evolution rarefaction curves were usually used to compare the abundance of species in sequencing samples and also to illustrate the rationality of the sequencing data of the samples wei et al 2020 as can be seen from fig 6 a the ends of the two curves tended to be flat indicating that the amount of sequencing data were reliable and the abundance of microorganisms in the lignin reactor i e experimental was higher than that in the reactor without lignin i e control further analysis of the venn diagram of the otus microbial community based on 97 similarity can reveal the differences between core variable microorganisms in the samples during anaerobic fermentation fig 6b it can be found that there was obvious intersection of otus 440 in the two reactors which may be the core microbial unit of sludge anaerobic fermentation in addition as the lignin content increased from 0 control to 15 experiment the number of unique otus in the reactors increased from 24 to 81 indicating that lignin may create a new type of fermentation environment the distribution of the microbial abundance in the two reactors on the phylum classification level was shown in fig 6c firmicutes actinobacteriota proteobacteria and chloroflexi were the dominant microbial populations in the two reactors these types of microorganisms were primarily responsible for the breakdown of macromolecular organics such as carbohydrates and proteins in the fermentation system duan et al 2018 ariesyady et al 2007 the addition of lignin caused a decrease in the abundance of these phylums in the reactor from 80 9 to 74 9 fig s3 however the abundances of bacteroidota and acidobacteriota which were mainly involved in the degradation of refractory organics increased zheng et al 2013 in particular acidobacteriota has been reported to use organics e g cellulose and hemicellulose cross linked with lignin through physical or chemical action as a substrate for the production of acetic pankratov et al 2012 2011 fig 7 displayed the heatmap of the microorganisms related to the scfas production at genus level in long term semi continuous fermenters without or with lignin although the presence of related microorganisms was detected in the two fermenters there was distinct difference in the abundance of microorganisms specifically norank f caldilineaceae sp romboutsia sp unclassified f rhodobacteraceae sp proteocatella sp have been proved to be the key microorganisms in the hydrolysis process while their abundance decreased with different degrees in the experimental fermenter jiang et al 2021 kim et al 2013 luo et al 2021 among them the decline of proteocatella sp was the largest up to 70 8 this fact was consistent with the conclusion of table 1 indicating that the introduction of lignin will negatively affect the hydrolysis efficiency of sludge anaerobic fermentation however the abundances of proteiniclasticum sp christensenellaceae r 7 group sp this genus of microorganisms can acidize organic substrates into scfas with acetic as the main product in experimental fermenters increased from 2 29 to 8 81 and 1 29 to 2 77 compared with control zhang et al 2010 2021 in addition the abundance of acetoanaerobium sp a rare homoacetogen in the sludge fermentation system in experimental fermenters was 2 6 times that of control sleat et al 1985 3 5 implication lignin a rich and renewable biomass resource can be produced by plant growth alone up to 150 billion tons every year and it is also an important component of the available organics in was rajdev et al 2015 in traditional cognition the presence of lignin in sludge leaded to low energy conversion efficiency of sludge therefore current research focused on how to strip and degrade lignin from lignocellulose to reduce its negative effects this was the first time to reveal the independent effect of lignin on the scfas production from anaerobic fermentation of sludge filling this theoretical gap and providing engineers with a technical reserve for the future operation of wwtps through experimental implementation and chemical or biological analysis it was found that the lignin in the sludge had the potential to promote rather than inhibit the scfas production which subverted the stereotype of lignin on anaerobic treatment of sludge it was worth noting that lignin can promote processes related to scfas production such as solubilization acidogenesis and homoacetogenesis but severely inhibited methonogenesis therefore in sludge or other organic solid waste with high lignin levels anaerobic fermentation for scfas production seemed to be a more preferred measure for anaerobic treatment than anaerobic digestion for methane production otherwise engineers were recommended to take additional measures to reduce the toxicity of lignin to methanogens however this batch test only studied one type which had similar properties to the lignin in sludge and whether the lignin in other wastes e g straw can be applied to the conclusion of this work needed further research to confirm in the future eqs 4 and 5 4 conclusion this work revealed for the first time the individual effect and underlying mechanism of lignin on the scfas production from was anaerobic fermentation the main conclusions were as follows 1 the presence of lignin enhanced rather than inhibited the scfas production especially acetic acid 2 the maximum scfas production of 223 14 7 82 mg cod g vss can be obtained from the fermenter with 15 lignin for four day alkaline fermentation 3 the main mechanism for the increase of scfas production in the fermenter with lignin was that lignin promoted the processes related to the production of scfas in anaerobic fermentation such as solubilization acidogenesis and acetification and severely inhibited the consumption of scfas on the other 4 lignin improved the abundance of proteiniclasticum sp christensenellaceae r 7 group sp acetoanaerobium sp which were considered scfas producers supporting information this file contains additional analytical methods text s1 s3 tables s1 s2 and figs s1

16288,phosphorus p is an essential resource for food production and chemical industry phosphorus use has to become more sustainable and should include phosphorus recycling from secondary sources about 20 of p ends up in sewage sludge making this a substantial secondary p source there is currently a technological gap to recover p from sludge locally at wastewater treatment plants wwtp that remove p by dosing iron vivianite fe3 po4 2 8 h2o is the main iron phosphate mineral that forms during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge provided that enough iron is present vivianite is paramagnetic and can be recovered using a magnetic separator in this study we have scaled up vivianite separation from lab scale to bench and pilot scale bench scale tests showed good separation of vivianite from digested sewage sludge and that a pulsation force is crucial for obtaining a concentrate with a high p grade a pilot scale magnetic separator capacity 1 0 m3 h was used to recover vivianite from digested sewage sludge at a wwtp recirculating and reprocessing sludge allows over 80 vivianite recovery within three passes a concentrated p product was produced with a vivianite content of up to 800 mg g and a p content of 98 mg g p recovery is limited by the amount of p bound in vivianite and can be increased by increased iron dosing with sufficient iron dosing the vivianite content can be increased and subsequently more p can be recovered this would allow compliance with existing german legislation which requires a p recovery larger than 50 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vivianite phosphorus recovery magnetic separation pilot scale operation hgms 1 introduction 1 1 incentive for recovery phosphorus p is an essential resource for food production and chemical industry the primary source of phosphorus is phosphate rock about 80 of mined phosphate rock ca10 po4 6 oh 2 is used in the fertilizer industry van vuuren et al 2010 phosphate rock is a finite resource and reserves are concentrated in a few countries usgs 2020 the eu has almost no phosphate rock reserves and depends therefore almost entirely on import from other countries this means there is a supply risk of phosphorus for the eu consequently this is why the eu added phosphate rock and phosphorus to the list of critical raw materials in 2014 and 2017 respectively european commission 2017 2014 hence phosphorus use has to become more sustainable and should include phosphorus recycling from secondary sources in 2005 the primary p import of the eu 27 was 1777 kton van dijk et al 2016 europe s urban waste water treatment plants annually remove approximately 370 kton p by immobilization in the sewage sludge van dijk et al 2016 therefore about 20 of imported p ends up in sewage sludge making this a substantial secondary source of p and one of the largest secondary sources after animal manure cordell and white 2013 in 2015 switzerland implemented legislation demanding p recovery from sewage sludge by 2026 followed by germany demanding 50 recovery in 2017 bafu 2015 bmuv 2017 1 2 technological gap for decentralized p recovery at iron dosing wwtps land application of sewage sludge is the most straightforward and low cost option to reuse phosphorus besides rising concerns about impurities in sludge such as micropollutants pathogens and heavy metals the biggest challenge with direct land application of sewage sludge is the geographic imbalance of p there are areas for example in west europe where there is a p surplus due to manure from livestock farming macdonald et al 2011 transporting sludge to areas with a p deficit is economically and environmentally unthinkable due to transport costs and emissions it is therefore desirable to recover a more concentrated phosphorus product towards this end phosphorus can be recovered in a centralized manner by incineration of the sludge followed by chemical leaching of p from the ash phosphorus recovery from sludge incineration ash has an advantage due to economy of scale and high recovery efficiency korving et al 2019 however these technologies rely on expensive and strongly centralized infrastructure compliance with phosphorus recovery legislation alone will not be a sufficient reason to build sludge incinerators alternatively phosphorus can be recovered at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp by the separation of p bearing minerals from the sludge i e struvite doyle and parsons 2002 p recovery at the wwtp level has been shown to be environmentally more beneficial than sludge incineration although less phosphorus can be recovered stowa 2016 in municipal wastewater treatment the most favored advanced phosphorus removal technologies are chemical phosphorus removal cpr using iron or aluminum salts and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr ebpr plants have the option to recover a small fraction 10 30 of the p from the sludge as struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o or calcium phosphate egle et al 2016 for cpr plants there is currently a technological gap to recover p from the sludge locally at the wwtp 1 3 vivianite recovery the majority of wwtp in europe utilize cpr korving et al 2019 if iron salts are dosed for cpr phosphorus precipitates as iron phosphate minerals and is immobilized in the produced sludge this sludge is then often anaerobically digested for hygienisation and energy recovery via methane production iron can also be added in the treatment process as a coagulant to enhance primary sedimentation and thus biogas production or to prevent hydrogen sulfide emissions charles et al 2006 ge et al 2013 recently research has shown that vivianite fe3 po4 2 8 h2o is the main iron phosphate mineral that forms during digestion of sewage sludge and that up to 80 90 of all phosphorus in digested sludge can be present as vivianite provided that enough iron is present wilfert 2018 unwanted vivianite scaling and accumulation in wwtps can result in the blockage of pipes which leads to an increased need for maintenance prot et al 2021 the authors also describe simple mitigation strategies i e design and operational considerations to prevent vivianite scaling vivianite can be used as an iron fertilizer to prevent iron chlorosis of crops like strawberries olive trees lupin kiwi grapevines peach trees and citrus trees growing on calcareous soils caballero et al 2009 de santiago et al 2013 de santiago and delgado 2010 domenico rombolà et al 2003 eynard et al 1992 rosado et al 2002 furthermore vivianite can also be split via an alkaline treatment into a liquid phosphate fertilizer and an iron oxide precipitate prot et al 2019 which potentially can be reused as a raw material to produce iron salts for phosphate binding in sewage treatment plants thus creating circular use of the dosed iron vivianite recovery receives increasing interest as a novel approach to phosphorus recovery however recovery of vivianite from sewage sludge presents a separation challenge as the vivianite particles are typically small ranging from 10 to 200 µm vivianite is paramagnetic and therefore a magnetic separation approach has been suggested and demonstrated at lab scale prot et al 2019 in this context the application of industrial mining separators i e high gradient magnetic separator which are designed for extraction of paramagnetic minerals wills and finch 2016 allows for a clear pathway for upscaling of the vivianite recovery from digested sewage sludge the slon vertically pulsating high gradient magnetic separator vphgms is widely used in the mining industry for ore concentration among other applications the slon separator has been used to concentrate fine particles such as hematite and ilmenite and for desulfurization and dephosphorization of iron ore feeds prior to steelmaking xiong et al 2015 in a vphgms fig 1 in order to capture paramagnetic particles a strong magnetic field is applied over a steel rod matrix which creates many points of high field gradient these rods in this way attract paramagnetic particles and non magnetic particles are allowed to pass through the separator without being captured pulsation is achieved in the separation zone by an actuated diaphragm to assist in separation by agitating the sludge and keeping particles in a loose state this minimizes the entrapment of particles and maximizes the usable surface area of the steel rods for magnetics collection wills and finch 2016 this study evaluates the application of a vphgms for the separation of vivianite from digested sewage sludge firstly a bench scale vphgms was used for processing 0 5 l samples in batches to show the feasibility of the separation process secondly a vivianite separation was studied at pilot scale vphgms installation at a wwtp in the netherlands able to process 1 m3 h of sludge continuously based on these studies we evaluate the potential and further development of vivianite recovery by magnetic separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale magnetic separator slon 100 a slon 100 unit was provided by outotec for the bench scale tests this machine is located in outotecs r d center in frankfurt germany the slon 100 can process batch samples of 0 5 l the magnetic field intensity is adjustable up to 1 tesla and steel rod matrices with different diameters can be utilized a steady flow of tap water of 4 l h is created over the matrix and pulsation is achieved with a diaphragm acted on by a motor a digested sludge sample of approximately 0 5 l is then fed to the top of the machine and the sludge is carried over the matrix by the water flow the magnetic particles are retained by the magnetic field on the matrix while the non magnetics are carried out at the bottom of the machine table 1 provides an overview of the performed tests using the slon 100 2 2 pilot plant installation the pilot installation consisted of a slon 750 vphgms and auxiliary equipment namely a feed tank 1 m3 tailings treated sludge tank 1 m3 and dortmund type settler unit 1 m3 feed and tailings tanks were stirred worm pumps were used to supply the sludge it was possible to reprocess tailings by cycling them back to the feed tank fig 2 shows a simplified flow scheme diagram of the installation 2 3 wwtp nieuwveer the pilot study took place at wwtp nieuwveer the netherlands from 01 09 2018 to 30 06 2019 the wwtp has a size of 375000 population equivalent p e with an average influent of 75000 m3 day at the wwtp fe ii is added in the aerated primary treatment for p removal sludge from primary and secondary treatment is anaerobically digested for 20 days the digester receives sludge from other wwtps which accounts for about 30 of the total sludge load during the pilot study parallel research on the influence of the fe dosing increase on vivianite formation was performed the quantity of fe ii dosed in the a stage was doubled for 4 months prot et al 2020 the share of phosphorus present as vivianite in the digested sludge increased from 20 to 50 after increasing the fe dosing making more phosphorus available for magnetic separation 2 4 pilot plant separation testing and sampling digested sludge with a dry matter content of typically 4 was tapped off from the main process before dewatering sieved and then fed to the pilot installation separation tests were performed to determine the separation performance with varying operational parameters for each test the parameters were set and the magnetic separator was started the feed was started through the slon and necessary adjustments were made to the outflow valves to maintain a steady slurry level in the separator and to achieve stable operation once this was achieved the starting time was noted and samples were taken every 15 min on average tests lasted 30 min to 1 h with 2 to 4 samples taken for the concentrate and tailings stream the samples for each stream were then combined to decrease minor variations during the testing time 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 microwave digestion and icp oes analysis the dried solid samples were digested in ultrapure hno3 69 in an ethos easy digester from milestone equipped with an sk 15 high pressure rotor the samples were placed in teflon vessels to which 10 ml of the hno3 was added for digested sludge 50 mg of sample was used while for concentrate 30 mg was used the chosen digestion program heats the acid to 200 c in 15 min maintains this temperature for 15 min followed by a cool down period of 1 h the digested samples are then diluted and analysed with inductively coupled plasma perkin elmer type optima 5300 dv equipped with an optical emission spectroscope icp oes a perkin elmer type esi sc 4 dx autosampler was used and the data was processed with perkin elmer winlab32 a solution of 10 mg l yttrium and a 2 hno3 solution were used as an internal standard solution and rinsing solution respectively 2 5 2 mössbauer spectroscopy the sample was put in a plastic ring sealed with kapton foil and epoxy glue and wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent exposure to oxygen and light the sample mass was adjusted with carbon powder to contain a maximum of 17 5 mg of fe cm2 transmission 57fe mössbauer absorption spectra were acquired at a temperature of 300 k with a conventional constant acceleration spectrometer using a 57co rh source velocity calibration was performed using an α fe foil the mössbauer spectra were fitted using the mosswinn 4 0 program klencsár 1997 2 5 3 dry solids to determine dry solids percentage samples were dried in a petri dish in a fumehood at room temperature to prevent loss of crystalline water from the vivianite structures 2 6 measures of separation 2 6 1 grade grade commonly refers to the content of a particular element or mineral in any stream such as the feed and concentrate the grade will be expressed in the weight ratio unit mg g we adapted a method developed by prot et al 2020 to determine the grade of vivianite in the sludge which is based on mössbauer spectroscopy mössbauer spectroscopy can detect and speciate iron minerals very accurately and can determine the part of the total iron in the sludge that is bound in vivianite using the data from prot et al experiment performed during the same time period at the same location the molar fe p ratio can be correlated to the amount of vivianite in the digested sludge which is expressed as the percentage of p bound to vivianite the following equation was derived from the data of prot et al 2020 1 p viv 0 98 fe p 0 53 0 05 where pviv is the fraction of total phosphorus in the sludge that is immobilized in the form of vivianite and fe p is the molar fe to p ratio another but less accurate approach is to estimate the vivianite grade of the concentrate purely based on the p content of the concentrate pure vivianite has a p grade of 12 35 therefore dividing the p grade of the concentrate by this value will give an estimate of the vivianite grade of the concentrate since vivianite is the only p bearing magnetic mineral that is likely to be present this is a reasonable approach although some sludge and other impurities potentially containing p may also be entrained 2 6 2 recovery the recovery is the percentage of the total element or mineral contained in the sludge that is recovered in the concentrate the calculation requires the mass balance of the separation as well as the grades of feed and concentrate 2 r c c f f where c is the grade content of element or mineral in the concentrate f is the grade of the feed c is the mass or flowrate of concentrate and f the mass or flow rate of feed 2 7 response surface analysis a wet magnetic separator has several operational parameters which influence the separation efficiency and their net effect cannot be predicted in advance therefore a response surface analysis was performed to determine the most relevant influences the parameters and their expected effects on vivianite separation are as follows response surface methodology rsm is a collection of statistical techniques useful for developing and optimizing processes response surface equations model how changes in variables affect a response of interest for the performed screening experiment in this study the experimental data are evaluated to fit a statistical model using minitab version 18 1 the experimental data is fitted by using least squares regression 2 7 1 pulsation frequency pulsation agitates the sludge and keeps particles in a loose state which minimizes entrapment of non magnetic particles pulsation also maximizes the area of the steel rods that are used to trap magnetic particles however due to the pulsation drag forces fine vivianite particles may not stay attached to the rods which will decrease recovery the workings of the pulsation mechanism and the effect on fine vivianite particles suggest that there would be an optimum pulsation frequency 2 7 2 rod matrix diameter in the magnetic separator the applied magnetic field creates many points of high field gradient in the steel rod matrix in order to capture the vivianite particles agglomeration of the particles can take place if they are small and or have a high magnetic susceptibility if the field is intense this effect can entrap sludge particles as well as bridge the gaps between magnetic poles reducing the efficiency of separation a smaller rod diameter results in a higher magnetic field gradient which can increase this effect smaller diameter rods also have a smaller distance between them which can increase the bridging effect in general this results in a higher recovery percentage for small rod diameters but a lower vivianite grade of the product as more sludge particles are entrapped 2 7 3 magnetic field intensity the magnetic field intensity should be high enough to make sure that a particle that collides with a matrix rod will remain attached to that rod any further increase of the field intensity will only retain particles with weaker magnetic properties less pure or entrap non magnetic particles by agglomeration another negative effect of high field intensity is that a high field strength can actually decrease the magnetic susceptibility of a particle if this particle shows some degree of magnetic ordering svoboda 1994 the magnetic force on a particle is directly proportional to the magnetic field gradient in the separator as well as the magnetic susceptibility of the particle therefore the net effect of increased field intensity can actually be a decrease in the magnetic force experienced by the particle applying the appropriate magnetic field is therefore crucial for a good separation performance the response surface analysis with different operating parameters was done on the 34 pilot scale separation tests to statistically investigate their effect a custom response surface design was defined using minitabversion 18 as continuous factors were chosen molar fe p ratio of feed matrix rod diameter pulsation frequency magnetic field intensity and feed rate the following levels were specified as low and high table 2 the response surface results were then analysed by plotting normal plots for vivianite grade vivianite recovery p recovery p grade fe recovery and fe grade a normal probability plot shows the standardized effects relative to a distribution fit line for the case when all the effects would be 0 the standardized effects are t tests that test the null hypothesis that the effect is 0 positive effects have an increased response when the setting increases from a low to high value whereas negative effects would have a decreased response to this the greater the magnitude of the effect the further from 0 they are on the x axis 3 results 3 1 bench scale tests good separation of vivianite and pulsation is crucial digested sludge from wwtp nieuwveer was subjected to a bench scale separation test to evaluate the effect of pulsation applied magnetic field strength and matrix rod diameter fig 3 shows the bench scale results with the slon 100 machine in terms of recovery and grade of p the results show that pulsation frequency has a significant effect on separation with pulsation the grade of the vivianite concentrate is significantly higher than without while the recovery decreases pulsation agitates the slurry and keeps particles in a loose state which minimizes entrapment of non magnetic particles pulsation also maximizes the area of the magnetized rods that is used to trap magnetic particles one would expect that pulsation increases the recovery however due to the pulsation drag forces fine vivianite particles will likely not stay attached to the rods which will decrease the recovery the workings of the pulsation mechanism and the effect on fine vivianite particles already suggest that there would be an optimum pulsation frequency too much pulsation will remove fines but not enough pulsation will entrap non magnetic particles another smaller effect that can be observed from the bench scale separation tests is the effect of rod diameter a bigger rod diameter shows an increase in grade and a decrease in recovery with a bigger rod diameter the distance between rods is larger which will decrease the magnetic field gradient the larger distance causes less entrapment by fines and the decrease in field gradient will separate the more susceptible and purer vivianite which will increase the concentrate grade the theoretical maximum phosphorus grade that can be reached is 123 5 mg g which is pure vivianite the bench scale separation tests showed promising results that vivianite can be recovered from sludge with a relatively high grade and establishes the potential for this technology on a large scale 3 2 pilot scale separation tests show that over 80 of vivianite can be recovered in three passes pilot testing was performed over a period of 9 months the vivianite content of the sludge during the pilot testing varied between 44 and 148 mg g which immobilizes 18 to 54 of the phosphorus in the sludge in the form of vivianite respectively the variation in the vivianite content is due to the experimental increase and decrease of iron salt dosing during the same period as discussed in prot et al 2020 during the operational period 34 separation tests were performed with different operational parameters and varying vivianite content of the feed sludge the results of all the separation tests are plotted in fig 4 table 3 shows additional detailed information for selected results with calculated vivianite recoveries and grades full results are available in the supporting information 3 3 recirculation increased the vivianite recovery to over 80 from separation testing it was apparent that a 3 mm rod matrix performed better over time small diameter rods are more prone to bend and break under the influence of the strong magnetic field in fact a 1 mm diameter rod matrix is not recommended for industrial use by the machine supplier due to this reason personal communication outotec furthermore a fine rod matrix is prone to blocking by coarse material which was experienced during pilot testing additionally a high grade concentrate is desirable due to transport costs of concentrate this suggests using a big diameter rod matrix therefore a 3 mm rod matrix is the best choice for industrial application of this technology for vivianite recovery however a 3 mm rod matrix has a low vivianite recovery only about 30 of the vivianite in the sludge is recovered in one pass to increase the recovery tests were performed where sludge was processed by the magnetic separator in three separate passes increasing the recovery with each pass the results are shown in table 4 with enough iron dosing more than 80 of the p in the sludge can be immobilized in the form of vivianite wilfert et al 2018 if 80 of the vivianite is recovered the total p recovery from sludge will be over 64 this recovery potential is higher than that of struvite which reaches typically only 10 30 of the total p load cornel and schaum 2009 egle et al 2016 lodder et al 2011 and complies with existing legislation in switzerland and germany where 50 of p recovery from sludge is demanded despite its occurrence in wwtps dosing iron no vivianite scaling was observed in the magnetic separator unit over several months of operation this is in line with the findings of prot et al 2021 who suggest that occurrence of vivianite scaling after digestion is unlikely prot et al 2021 3 4 the effect of parameters and their interaction is complex and can be optimized by response surface methodology as discussed in the materials and methods section the following operational parameters are expected to influence the separation efficiency pulsation frequency rod matrix diameter magnetic field intensity a response surface analysis was done on the 34 pilot scale separation tests to statistically investigate the effect of each of the operational parameters normal plots for the standardized effect are given for the vivianite recovery in fig 5 and vivianite grade in fig 6 below the normal plots show that the pulsation frequency has the biggest effect on recovery followed by the matrix rod diameter the parameters or combinations thereof that have a significant effect on the vivianite grade of the concentrate in order of magnitude are pulsation frequency combination pulsation frequency and magnetic field combination pulsation frequency and matrix rod diameter and the combination of fe p ratio and magnetic field the significance of the combination of pulsation frequency with the other parameters shows that the effect of pulsation is dependent on other parameters for example magnetic field and could be optimized using response surface methodology an interesting observation from the response surface analysis is the significant negative effect of the combination of fe p ratio and magnetic field this means that if the fe p ratio increased and magnetic field strength increased the vivianite grade of the concentrate decreased the fe p ratio is increased by additional iron dosing the newly formed vivianite from additional dosing could be present as finer particles which can form flocs that entrap organics lowering the concentrate vivianite grade another explanation that could add to this effect is that other fe minerals are formed which are recovered in the magnetic fraction 3 5 a concentrated phosphorus product was produced by magnetic separation mössbauer spectroscopy was performed on a sample of mixed concentrate from the pilot installation the results showed that the vivianite grade of the concentrate was 710 40 mg g based on the iron speciation it is known that iron can be replaced by other divalent ions like ca mg and mn in the vivianite structure and therefore it is better to speak of vivianite like structures wilfert 2018 if we assume that the ca mg and mn that we measured in the concentrate is in fact replacing iron sites in the vivianite like structures then the vivianite grade will be higher as this part of the vivianite is not quantified by mössbauer spectroscopy the vivianite content of the concentrate would then be 800 mg g 96 of the phosphorus in the concentrate was bound to vivianite in this case the total carbon content of the concentrate was 10 the total nitrogen content was 1 the phosphorus content of the concentrate is 9 8 p or 22 4 p2o5 equivalent supported by the mass balance calculations see si no p losses or vivianite accumulation have been observed in the pilot installation additionally xrd and sem edx analyses performed by prot et al 2020 on the digested sludge from nieuwveer during the operation time of this pilot experiments revealed the presence of vivianite while struvite was absent prot et al 2020 a complete elemental analyses including heavy metals were performed on the concentrate and reported in the supplemental information heavy metal concentrations were in line and somewhat lower than earlier reported for lab scale magnetic separation tests prot et al 2019 4 discussion the pilot tests were performed with a slon 750 vphgms and were operated with feed flow rates of either 0 5 or 1 m3 h of digested sludge that was tapped of before the final dewatering of the sewage sludge sewage sludge presents a very different matrix when compared to iron ore slurries that are typically treated in this type of separator the treated digested sludge s viscosity was comparable to these sludges see si but had a significantly lower dry matter content ca 4 dry matter for digested sludge compared to 20 40 dry matter for iron ore slurries xiong et al 2015 for this sewage treatment plant raw sewage inflow of 75000 m3 day the total digested sludge production is roughly 16 m3 h upscaling of the pilot system requires an increase in the ring diameter and or the width of the ring vphgms equipment is commercially available in capacities ranging from 10 to 1000 m3 h iron ore slurry input and is therefore more than large enough to treat the full capacity of this or even significantly larger sewage treatment plants also if recirculation is needed to maximize the recovery efficiency a full scale vivimag installation for nieuwveer wwtp would have to treat 16 m3 h of digested sludge an industrial scale slon 1000 has a nominal throughput of 10 20 m3 h and it requires 3 3 kw of electrical power gruening et al 2020 hence the power consumption is approximately 0 5 1 kwh m3 sludge treated assuming three passes to obtained the desired efficiency this is comparable to the energy consumption of a sludge dewatering centrifuge which is 1 0 1 6 kwh m3 dwa 2013 an important aspect in a full scale application is the potential effect of the magnetic separation on the dewaterability of the digested sludge a lower dewaterability would imply higher sludge disposal volumes and associated disposal costs therefore preliminary dewaterability tests were performed both in lab scale experiments and at pilot scale using a decanter centrifuge the results are reported in the supplemental information and show that there was a small negative effect on the dewaterability of the treated sludge this effect will be compensated by the reduction in sludge volume that needs to be dewatered through the removal of vivianite from the sludge further optimization of the selection of the poly electrolyte used for flocculation may further improve the dewatering this study shows that commercially available vphgms equipment can be used to mine this vivianite from the digested sewage sludge typically sewage treatment plants remove 90 of all phosphorus from the sewage influent and concentrate it in the surplus sludge which is often digested in the larger sewage treatment plants to produce biogas if enough iron is dosed either in the main water line and or in the sludge digester then 80 90 of the phosphorus in the sewage sludge is present as vivianite wilfert 2018 the current study shows that a magnetic separation approach can recover 80 of this vivianite overall this means that 60 64 of the phosphorus in the sewage influent can be recovered as vivianite while recovering most of the dosed iron as well such an approach called vivimag makes phosphorus recovery possible for sewage plants that employ chemical phosphorus removal where currently this is not possible the vivimag approach would also have higher recovery efficiencies compared to struvite recovery approaches that are currently being implemented in sewage treatment plants applying enhanced biological phosphorus removal and typically show a recovery potential of 10 40 of the influent phosphorus korving et al 2019 the market potential for this technology is enormous as the majority of wwtps in europe utilize cpr with iron salt addition either as a main phosphorus removal strategy or to support the ebpr technology korving et al 2019 future work should focus on further optimizing the magnetic separation to improve recovery efficiencies and purity of the magnetic concentrate and suggestions were made for the main parameters to focus on also additional purification steps for instance a washing approach can improve the purity of the recovered vivianite further research on alkaline splitting the vivianite into an iron phase and phosphate phase would make it possible to create circular use of iron salts for phosphorus recovery at a wwtp prot et al 2019 5 conclusions vivianite recovery is emerging as a promising approach for phosphorus recovery from sewage treatment plants employing iron salts for phosphorus removal the small particle size of vivianite particles and the complex sludge matrix make an efficient separation challenging magnetic separation equipment commonly used in the mining industry was able to extract the paramagnetic vivianite efficiently from digested sludge thus truly introducing a concept of urban mining with this approach a recovery efficiency from digested sludge of 80 was achieved making it possible to recover over 60 of the influent phosphorus load the recovered magnetic concentrate has a purity of up to 800 mg vivianite per gram 98 mg p g with low concentrations of heavy metals the effect of the operational parameters

16288,phosphorus p is an essential resource for food production and chemical industry phosphorus use has to become more sustainable and should include phosphorus recycling from secondary sources about 20 of p ends up in sewage sludge making this a substantial secondary p source there is currently a technological gap to recover p from sludge locally at wastewater treatment plants wwtp that remove p by dosing iron vivianite fe3 po4 2 8 h2o is the main iron phosphate mineral that forms during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge provided that enough iron is present vivianite is paramagnetic and can be recovered using a magnetic separator in this study we have scaled up vivianite separation from lab scale to bench and pilot scale bench scale tests showed good separation of vivianite from digested sewage sludge and that a pulsation force is crucial for obtaining a concentrate with a high p grade a pilot scale magnetic separator capacity 1 0 m3 h was used to recover vivianite from digested sewage sludge at a wwtp recirculating and reprocessing sludge allows over 80 vivianite recovery within three passes a concentrated p product was produced with a vivianite content of up to 800 mg g and a p content of 98 mg g p recovery is limited by the amount of p bound in vivianite and can be increased by increased iron dosing with sufficient iron dosing the vivianite content can be increased and subsequently more p can be recovered this would allow compliance with existing german legislation which requires a p recovery larger than 50 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vivianite phosphorus recovery magnetic separation pilot scale operation hgms 1 introduction 1 1 incentive for recovery phosphorus p is an essential resource for food production and chemical industry the primary source of phosphorus is phosphate rock about 80 of mined phosphate rock ca10 po4 6 oh 2 is used in the fertilizer industry van vuuren et al 2010 phosphate rock is a finite resource and reserves are concentrated in a few countries usgs 2020 the eu has almost no phosphate rock reserves and depends therefore almost entirely on import from other countries this means there is a supply risk of phosphorus for the eu consequently this is why the eu added phosphate rock and phosphorus to the list of critical raw materials in 2014 and 2017 respectively european commission 2017 2014 hence phosphorus use has to become more sustainable and should include phosphorus recycling from secondary sources in 2005 the primary p import of the eu 27 was 1777 kton van dijk et al 2016 europe s urban waste water treatment plants annually remove approximately 370 kton p by immobilization in the sewage sludge van dijk et al 2016 therefore about 20 of imported p ends up in sewage sludge making this a substantial secondary source of p and one of the largest secondary sources after animal manure cordell and white 2013 in 2015 switzerland implemented legislation demanding p recovery from sewage sludge by 2026 followed by germany demanding 50 recovery in 2017 bafu 2015 bmuv 2017 1 2 technological gap for decentralized p recovery at iron dosing wwtps land application of sewage sludge is the most straightforward and low cost option to reuse phosphorus besides rising concerns about impurities in sludge such as micropollutants pathogens and heavy metals the biggest challenge with direct land application of sewage sludge is the geographic imbalance of p there are areas for example in west europe where there is a p surplus due to manure from livestock farming macdonald et al 2011 transporting sludge to areas with a p deficit is economically and environmentally unthinkable due to transport costs and emissions it is therefore desirable to recover a more concentrated phosphorus product towards this end phosphorus can be recovered in a centralized manner by incineration of the sludge followed by chemical leaching of p from the ash phosphorus recovery from sludge incineration ash has an advantage due to economy of scale and high recovery efficiency korving et al 2019 however these technologies rely on expensive and strongly centralized infrastructure compliance with phosphorus recovery legislation alone will not be a sufficient reason to build sludge incinerators alternatively phosphorus can be recovered at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp by the separation of p bearing minerals from the sludge i e struvite doyle and parsons 2002 p recovery at the wwtp level has been shown to be environmentally more beneficial than sludge incineration although less phosphorus can be recovered stowa 2016 in municipal wastewater treatment the most favored advanced phosphorus removal technologies are chemical phosphorus removal cpr using iron or aluminum salts and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr ebpr plants have the option to recover a small fraction 10 30 of the p from the sludge as struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o or calcium phosphate egle et al 2016 for cpr plants there is currently a technological gap to recover p from the sludge locally at the wwtp 1 3 vivianite recovery the majority of wwtp in europe utilize cpr korving et al 2019 if iron salts are dosed for cpr phosphorus precipitates as iron phosphate minerals and is immobilized in the produced sludge this sludge is then often anaerobically digested for hygienisation and energy recovery via methane production iron can also be added in the treatment process as a coagulant to enhance primary sedimentation and thus biogas production or to prevent hydrogen sulfide emissions charles et al 2006 ge et al 2013 recently research has shown that vivianite fe3 po4 2 8 h2o is the main iron phosphate mineral that forms during digestion of sewage sludge and that up to 80 90 of all phosphorus in digested sludge can be present as vivianite provided that enough iron is present wilfert 2018 unwanted vivianite scaling and accumulation in wwtps can result in the blockage of pipes which leads to an increased need for maintenance prot et al 2021 the authors also describe simple mitigation strategies i e design and operational considerations to prevent vivianite scaling vivianite can be used as an iron fertilizer to prevent iron chlorosis of crops like strawberries olive trees lupin kiwi grapevines peach trees and citrus trees growing on calcareous soils caballero et al 2009 de santiago et al 2013 de santiago and delgado 2010 domenico rombolà et al 2003 eynard et al 1992 rosado et al 2002 furthermore vivianite can also be split via an alkaline treatment into a liquid phosphate fertilizer and an iron oxide precipitate prot et al 2019 which potentially can be reused as a raw material to produce iron salts for phosphate binding in sewage treatment plants thus creating circular use of the dosed iron vivianite recovery receives increasing interest as a novel approach to phosphorus recovery however recovery of vivianite from sewage sludge presents a separation challenge as the vivianite particles are typically small ranging from 10 to 200 µm vivianite is paramagnetic and therefore a magnetic separation approach has been suggested and demonstrated at lab scale prot et al 2019 in this context the application of industrial mining separators i e high gradient magnetic separator which are designed for extraction of paramagnetic minerals wills and finch 2016 allows for a clear pathway for upscaling of the vivianite recovery from digested sewage sludge the slon vertically pulsating high gradient magnetic separator vphgms is widely used in the mining industry for ore concentration among other applications the slon separator has been used to concentrate fine particles such as hematite and ilmenite and for desulfurization and dephosphorization of iron ore feeds prior to steelmaking xiong et al 2015 in a vphgms fig 1 in order to capture paramagnetic particles a strong magnetic field is applied over a steel rod matrix which creates many points of high field gradient these rods in this way attract paramagnetic particles and non magnetic particles are allowed to pass through the separator without being captured pulsation is achieved in the separation zone by an actuated diaphragm to assist in separation by agitating the sludge and keeping particles in a loose state this minimizes the entrapment of particles and maximizes the usable surface area of the steel rods for magnetics collection wills and finch 2016 this study evaluates the application of a vphgms for the separation of vivianite from digested sewage sludge firstly a bench scale vphgms was used for processing 0 5 l samples in batches to show the feasibility of the separation process secondly a vivianite separation was studied at pilot scale vphgms installation at a wwtp in the netherlands able to process 1 m3 h of sludge continuously based on these studies we evaluate the potential and further development of vivianite recovery by magnetic separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale magnetic separator slon 100 a slon 100 unit was provided by outotec for the bench scale tests this machine is located in outotecs r d center in frankfurt germany the slon 100 can process batch samples of 0 5 l the magnetic field intensity is adjustable up to 1 tesla and steel rod matrices with different diameters can be utilized a steady flow of tap water of 4 l h is created over the matrix and pulsation is achieved with a diaphragm acted on by a motor a digested sludge sample of approximately 0 5 l is then fed to the top of the machine and the sludge is carried over the matrix by the water flow the magnetic particles are retained by the magnetic field on the matrix while the non magnetics are carried out at the bottom of the machine table 1 provides an overview of the performed tests using the slon 100 2 2 pilot plant installation the pilot installation consisted of a slon 750 vphgms and auxiliary equipment namely a feed tank 1 m3 tailings treated sludge tank 1 m3 and dortmund type settler unit 1 m3 feed and tailings tanks were stirred worm pumps were used to supply the sludge it was possible to reprocess tailings by cycling them back to the feed tank fig 2 shows a simplified flow scheme diagram of the installation 2 3 wwtp nieuwveer the pilot study took place at wwtp nieuwveer the netherlands from 01 09 2018 to 30 06 2019 the wwtp has a size of 375000 population equivalent p e with an average influent of 75000 m3 day at the wwtp fe ii is added in the aerated primary treatment for p removal sludge from primary and secondary treatment is anaerobically digested for 20 days the digester receives sludge from other wwtps which accounts for about 30 of the total sludge load during the pilot study parallel research on the influence of the fe dosing increase on vivianite formation was performed the quantity of fe ii dosed in the a stage was doubled for 4 months prot et al 2020 the share of phosphorus present as vivianite in the digested sludge increased from 20 to 50 after increasing the fe dosing making more phosphorus available for magnetic separation 2 4 pilot plant separation testing and sampling digested sludge with a dry matter content of typically 4 was tapped off from the main process before dewatering sieved and then fed to the pilot installation separation tests were performed to determine the separation performance with varying operational parameters for each test the parameters were set and the magnetic separator was started the feed was started through the slon and necessary adjustments were made to the outflow valves to maintain a steady slurry level in the separator and to achieve stable operation once this was achieved the starting time was noted and samples were taken every 15 min on average tests lasted 30 min to 1 h with 2 to 4 samples taken for the concentrate and tailings stream the samples for each stream were then combined to decrease minor variations during the testing time 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 microwave digestion and icp oes analysis the dried solid samples were digested in ultrapure hno3 69 in an ethos easy digester from milestone equipped with an sk 15 high pressure rotor the samples were placed in teflon vessels to which 10 ml of the hno3 was added for digested sludge 50 mg of sample was used while for concentrate 30 mg was used the chosen digestion program heats the acid to 200 c in 15 min maintains this temperature for 15 min followed by a cool down period of 1 h the digested samples are then diluted and analysed with inductively coupled plasma perkin elmer type optima 5300 dv equipped with an optical emission spectroscope icp oes a perkin elmer type esi sc 4 dx autosampler was used and the data was processed with perkin elmer winlab32 a solution of 10 mg l yttrium and a 2 hno3 solution were used as an internal standard solution and rinsing solution respectively 2 5 2 mössbauer spectroscopy the sample was put in a plastic ring sealed with kapton foil and epoxy glue and wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent exposure to oxygen and light the sample mass was adjusted with carbon powder to contain a maximum of 17 5 mg of fe cm2 transmission 57fe mössbauer absorption spectra were acquired at a temperature of 300 k with a conventional constant acceleration spectrometer using a 57co rh source velocity calibration was performed using an α fe foil the mössbauer spectra were fitted using the mosswinn 4 0 program klencsár 1997 2 5 3 dry solids to determine dry solids percentage samples were dried in a petri dish in a fumehood at room temperature to prevent loss of crystalline water from the vivianite structures 2 6 measures of separation 2 6 1 grade grade commonly refers to the content of a particular element or mineral in any stream such as the feed and concentrate the grade will be expressed in the weight ratio unit mg g we adapted a method developed by prot et al 2020 to determine the grade of vivianite in the sludge which is based on mössbauer spectroscopy mössbauer spectroscopy can detect and speciate iron minerals very accurately and can determine the part of the total iron in the sludge that is bound in vivianite using the data from prot et al experiment performed during the same time period at the same location the molar fe p ratio can be correlated to the amount of vivianite in the digested sludge which is expressed as the percentage of p bound to vivianite the following equation was derived from the data of prot et al 2020 1 p viv 0 98 fe p 0 53 0 05 where pviv is the fraction of total phosphorus in the sludge that is immobilized in the form of vivianite and fe p is the molar fe to p ratio another but less accurate approach is to estimate the vivianite grade of the concentrate purely based on the p content of the concentrate pure vivianite has a p grade of 12 35 therefore dividing the p grade of the concentrate by this value will give an estimate of the vivianite grade of the concentrate since vivianite is the only p bearing magnetic mineral that is likely to be present this is a reasonable approach although some sludge and other impurities potentially containing p may also be entrained 2 6 2 recovery the recovery is the percentage of the total element or mineral contained in the sludge that is recovered in the concentrate the calculation requires the mass balance of the separation as well as the grades of feed and concentrate 2 r c c f f where c is the grade content of element or mineral in the concentrate f is the grade of the feed c is the mass or flowrate of concentrate and f the mass or flow rate of feed 2 7 response surface analysis a wet magnetic separator has several operational parameters which influence the separation efficiency and their net effect cannot be predicted in advance therefore a response surface analysis was performed to determine the most relevant influences the parameters and their expected effects on vivianite separation are as follows response surface methodology rsm is a collection of statistical techniques useful for developing and optimizing processes response surface equations model how changes in variables affect a response of interest for the performed screening experiment in this study the experimental data are evaluated to fit a statistical model using minitab version 18 1 the experimental data is fitted by using least squares regression 2 7 1 pulsation frequency pulsation agitates the sludge and keeps particles in a loose state which minimizes entrapment of non magnetic particles pulsation also maximizes the area of the steel rods that are used to trap magnetic particles however due to the pulsation drag forces fine vivianite particles may not stay attached to the rods which will decrease recovery the workings of the pulsation mechanism and the effect on fine vivianite particles suggest that there would be an optimum pulsation frequency 2 7 2 rod matrix diameter in the magnetic separator the applied magnetic field creates many points of high field gradient in the steel rod matrix in order to capture the vivianite particles agglomeration of the particles can take place if they are small and or have a high magnetic susceptibility if the field is intense this effect can entrap sludge particles as well as bridge the gaps between magnetic poles reducing the efficiency of separation a smaller rod diameter results in a higher magnetic field gradient which can increase this effect smaller diameter rods also have a smaller distance between them which can increase the bridging effect in general this results in a higher recovery percentage for small rod diameters but a lower vivianite grade of the product as more sludge particles are entrapped 2 7 3 magnetic field intensity the magnetic field intensity should be high enough to make sure that a particle that collides with a matrix rod will remain attached to that rod any further increase of the field intensity will only retain particles with weaker magnetic properties less pure or entrap non magnetic particles by agglomeration another negative effect of high field intensity is that a high field strength can actually decrease the magnetic susceptibility of a particle if this particle shows some degree of magnetic ordering svoboda 1994 the magnetic force on a particle is directly proportional to the magnetic field gradient in the separator as well as the magnetic susceptibility of the particle therefore the net effect of increased field intensity can actually be a decrease in the magnetic force experienced by the particle applying the appropriate magnetic field is therefore crucial for a good separation performance the response surface analysis with different operating parameters was done on the 34 pilot scale separation tests to statistically investigate their effect a custom response surface design was defined using minitabversion 18 as continuous factors were chosen molar fe p ratio of feed matrix rod diameter pulsation frequency magnetic field intensity and feed rate the following levels were specified as low and high table 2 the response surface results were then analysed by plotting normal plots for vivianite grade vivianite recovery p recovery p grade fe recovery and fe grade a normal probability plot shows the standardized effects relative to a distribution fit line for the case when all the effects would be 0 the standardized effects are t tests that test the null hypothesis that the effect is 0 positive effects have an increased response when the setting increases from a low to high value whereas negative effects would have a decreased response to this the greater the magnitude of the effect the further from 0 they are on the x axis 3 results 3 1 bench scale tests good separation of vivianite and pulsation is crucial digested sludge from wwtp nieuwveer was subjected to a bench scale separation test to evaluate the effect of pulsation applied magnetic field strength and matrix rod diameter fig 3 shows the bench scale results with the slon 100 machine in terms of recovery and grade of p the results show that pulsation frequency has a significant effect on separation with pulsation the grade of the vivianite concentrate is significantly higher than without while the recovery decreases pulsation agitates the slurry and keeps particles in a loose state which minimizes entrapment of non magnetic particles pulsation also maximizes the area of the magnetized rods that is used to trap magnetic particles one would expect that pulsation increases the recovery however due to the pulsation drag forces fine vivianite particles will likely not stay attached to the rods which will decrease the recovery the workings of the pulsation mechanism and the effect on fine vivianite particles already suggest that there would be an optimum pulsation frequency too much pulsation will remove fines but not enough pulsation will entrap non magnetic particles another smaller effect that can be observed from the bench scale separation tests is the effect of rod diameter a bigger rod diameter shows an increase in grade and a decrease in recovery with a bigger rod diameter the distance between rods is larger which will decrease the magnetic field gradient the larger distance causes less entrapment by fines and the decrease in field gradient will separate the more susceptible and purer vivianite which will increase the concentrate grade the theoretical maximum phosphorus grade that can be reached is 123 5 mg g which is pure vivianite the bench scale separation tests showed promising results that vivianite can be recovered from sludge with a relatively high grade and establishes the potential for this technology on a large scale 3 2 pilot scale separation tests show that over 80 of vivianite can be recovered in three passes pilot testing was performed over a period of 9 months the vivianite content of the sludge during the pilot testing varied between 44 and 148 mg g which immobilizes 18 to 54 of the phosphorus in the sludge in the form of vivianite respectively the variation in the vivianite content is due to the experimental increase and decrease of iron salt dosing during the same period as discussed in prot et al 2020 during the operational period 34 separation tests were performed with different operational parameters and varying vivianite content of the feed sludge the results of all the separation tests are plotted in fig 4 table 3 shows additional detailed information for selected results with calculated vivianite recoveries and grades full results are available in the supporting information 3 3 recirculation increased the vivianite recovery to over 80 from separation testing it was apparent that a 3 mm rod matrix performed better over time small diameter rods are more prone to bend and break under the influence of the strong magnetic field in fact a 1 mm diameter rod matrix is not recommended for industrial use by the machine supplier due to this reason personal communication outotec furthermore a fine rod matrix is prone to blocking by coarse material which was experienced during pilot testing additionally a high grade concentrate is desirable due to transport costs of concentrate this suggests using a big diameter rod matrix therefore a 3 mm rod matrix is the best choice for industrial application of this technology for vivianite recovery however a 3 mm rod matrix has a low vivianite recovery only about 30 of the vivianite in the sludge is recovered in one pass to increase the recovery tests were performed where sludge was processed by the magnetic separator in three separate passes increasing the recovery with each pass the results are shown in table 4 with enough iron dosing more than 80 of the p in the sludge can be immobilized in the form of vivianite wilfert et al 2018 if 80 of the vivianite is recovered the total p recovery from sludge will be over 64 this recovery potential is higher than that of struvite which reaches typically only 10 30 of the total p load cornel and schaum 2009 egle et al 2016 lodder et al 2011 and complies with existing legislation in switzerland and germany where 50 of p recovery from sludge is demanded despite its occurrence in wwtps dosing iron no vivianite scaling was observed in the magnetic separator unit over several months of operation this is in line with the findings of prot et al 2021 who suggest that occurrence of vivianite scaling after digestion is unlikely prot et al 2021 3 4 the effect of parameters and their interaction is complex and can be optimized by response surface methodology as discussed in the materials and methods section the following operational parameters are expected to influence the separation efficiency pulsation frequency rod matrix diameter magnetic field intensity a response surface analysis was done on the 34 pilot scale separation tests to statistically investigate the effect of each of the operational parameters normal plots for the standardized effect are given for the vivianite recovery in fig 5 and vivianite grade in fig 6 below the normal plots show that the pulsation frequency has the biggest effect on recovery followed by the matrix rod diameter the parameters or combinations thereof that have a significant effect on the vivianite grade of the concentrate in order of magnitude are pulsation frequency combination pulsation frequency and magnetic field combination pulsation frequency and matrix rod diameter and the combination of fe p ratio and magnetic field the significance of the combination of pulsation frequency with the other parameters shows that the effect of pulsation is dependent on other parameters for example magnetic field and could be optimized using response surface methodology an interesting observation from the response surface analysis is the significant negative effect of the combination of fe p ratio and magnetic field this means that if the fe p ratio increased and magnetic field strength increased the vivianite grade of the concentrate decreased the fe p ratio is increased by additional iron dosing the newly formed vivianite from additional dosing could be present as finer particles which can form flocs that entrap organics lowering the concentrate vivianite grade another explanation that could add to this effect is that other fe minerals are formed which are recovered in the magnetic fraction 3 5 a concentrated phosphorus product was produced by magnetic separation mössbauer spectroscopy was performed on a sample of mixed concentrate from the pilot installation the results showed that the vivianite grade of the concentrate was 710 40 mg g based on the iron speciation it is known that iron can be replaced by other divalent ions like ca mg and mn in the vivianite structure and therefore it is better to speak of vivianite like structures wilfert 2018 if we assume that the ca mg and mn that we measured in the concentrate is in fact replacing iron sites in the vivianite like structures then the vivianite grade will be higher as this part of the vivianite is not quantified by mössbauer spectroscopy the vivianite content of the concentrate would then be 800 mg g 96 of the phosphorus in the concentrate was bound to vivianite in this case the total carbon content of the concentrate was 10 the total nitrogen content was 1 the phosphorus content of the concentrate is 9 8 p or 22 4 p2o5 equivalent supported by the mass balance calculations see si no p losses or vivianite accumulation have been observed in the pilot installation additionally xrd and sem edx analyses performed by prot et al 2020 on the digested sludge from nieuwveer during the operation time of this pilot experiments revealed the presence of vivianite while struvite was absent prot et al 2020 a complete elemental analyses including heavy metals were performed on the concentrate and reported in the supplemental information heavy metal concentrations were in line and somewhat lower than earlier reported for lab scale magnetic separation tests prot et al 2019 4 discussion the pilot tests were performed with a slon 750 vphgms and were operated with feed flow rates of either 0 5 or 1 m3 h of digested sludge that was tapped of before the final dewatering of the sewage sludge sewage sludge presents a very different matrix when compared to iron ore slurries that are typically treated in this type of separator the treated digested sludge s viscosity was comparable to these sludges see si but had a significantly lower dry matter content ca 4 dry matter for digested sludge compared to 20 40 dry matter for iron ore slurries xiong et al 2015 for this sewage treatment plant raw sewage inflow of 75000 m3 day the total digested sludge production is roughly 16 m3 h upscaling of the pilot system requires an increase in the ring diameter and or the width of the ring vphgms equipment is commercially available in capacities ranging from 10 to 1000 m3 h iron ore slurry input and is therefore more than large enough to treat the full capacity of this or even significantly larger sewage treatment plants also if recirculation is needed to maximize the recovery efficiency a full scale vivimag installation for nieuwveer wwtp would have to treat 16 m3 h of digested sludge an industrial scale slon 1000 has a nominal throughput of 10 20 m3 h and it requires 3 3 kw of electrical power gruening et al 2020 hence the power consumption is approximately 0 5 1 kwh m3 sludge treated assuming three passes to obtained the desired efficiency this is comparable to the energy consumption of a sludge dewatering centrifuge which is 1 0 1 6 kwh m3 dwa 2013 an important aspect in a full scale application is the potential effect of the magnetic separation on the dewaterability of the digested sludge a lower dewaterability would imply higher sludge disposal volumes and associated disposal costs therefore preliminary dewaterability tests were performed both in lab scale experiments and at pilot scale using a decanter centrifuge the results are reported in the supplemental information and show that there was a small negative effect on the dewaterability of the treated sludge this effect will be compensated by the reduction in sludge volume that needs to be dewatered through the removal of vivianite from the sludge further optimization of the selection of the poly electrolyte used for flocculation may further improve the dewatering this study shows that commercially available vphgms equipment can be used to mine this vivianite from the digested sewage sludge typically sewage treatment plants remove 90 of all phosphorus from the sewage influent and concentrate it in the surplus sludge which is often digested in the larger sewage treatment plants to produce biogas if enough iron is dosed either in the main water line and or in the sludge digester then 80 90 of the phosphorus in the sewage sludge is present as vivianite wilfert 2018 the current study shows that a magnetic separation approach can recover 80 of this vivianite overall this means that 60 64 of the phosphorus in the sewage influent can be recovered as vivianite while recovering most of the dosed iron as well such an approach called vivimag makes phosphorus recovery possible for sewage plants that employ chemical phosphorus removal where currently this is not possible the vivimag approach would also have higher recovery efficiencies compared to struvite recovery approaches that are currently being implemented in sewage treatment plants applying enhanced biological phosphorus removal and typically show a recovery potential of 10 40 of the influent phosphorus korving et al 2019 the market potential for this technology is enormous as the majority of wwtps in europe utilize cpr with iron salt addition either as a main phosphorus removal strategy or to support the ebpr technology korving et al 2019 future work should focus on further optimizing the magnetic separation to improve recovery efficiencies and purity of the magnetic concentrate and suggestions were made for the main parameters to focus on also additional purification steps for instance a washing approach can improve the purity of the recovered vivianite further research on alkaline splitting the vivianite into an iron phase and phosphate phase would make it possible to create circular use of iron salts for phosphorus recovery at a wwtp prot et al 2019 5 conclusions vivianite recovery is emerging as a promising approach for phosphorus recovery from sewage treatment plants employing iron salts for phosphorus removal the small particle size of vivianite particles and the complex sludge matrix make an efficient separation challenging magnetic separation equipment commonly used in the mining industry was able to extract the paramagnetic vivianite efficiently from digested sludge thus truly introducing a concept of urban mining with this approach a recovery efficiency from digested sludge of 80 was achieved making it possible to recover over 60 of the influent phosphorus load the recovered magnetic concentrate has a purity of up to 800 mg vivianite per gram 98 mg p g with low concentrations of heavy metals the effect of the operational parameters

16289,hexavalent chromium cr vi is one of the major concerns for water environment and human health due to its high toxicicity while ferric sludge produced from fenton processes is also a tough nut to crack in this study the synergetic impact of ferric sludge derived from the fenton process on the bioreduction of cr vi in biocathode microbial electrolysis cell was investigated for the first time as a result cr vi reduction efficiency at biocathode increased by 1 1 2 6 times with 50 mg l ferric sludge under different operation conditions besides the cr vi reduction enhancement decreased with the increase of ph and initial cr vi concentration or increased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage correspondingly relatively higher power density 1 027 w m3 with 100 mg l ferric sludge while 0 827 w m3 for control and lower activation energy and resistance were also observed besides the presence of ferric sludge increased biomass protein 1 7 times higher with 100 mg l ferric sludge and cytochrome c 1 4 times higher with 100 mg l ferric sludge the evolution of microbial community structure for a higher abundance of cr vi and fe iii reducing microorganisms were exhibited implying the enhancement of cr vi reduction was due to the formation of fe ii from the reduction of ferric sludge these findings provide insights and theoretical support for developing a viable biotechnology platform to realize waste treatment using waste graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cr vi bioreduction fenton ferric sludge biocathode microbial electrolysis cell mixed bacterial consortium 1 introduction chromium cr presence in water bodies has become a major environmental problem and may seriously threaten human health zhu et al 2019 tan et al 2020 cr vi and cr iii which are the most prevalent species of chromium in nature have entirely different properties zeng et al 2019 cr vi is highly toxic due to its high oxidation potential mobility and permeability while cr iii has far lower toxicity due to the low solubility and mobility in neutral and alkaline conditions wu et al 2019 luo et al 2019 moreover a low concentration of cr iii is an essential nutrient for humans to better uptake protein fat and sugar lin et al 2020 therefore the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is considered to be an effective method for chromium contamination treatment bharagava and mishra 2018 among existing remediation strategies the microbial reduction method has attracted wide attention due to its unique merits of being cost effective environmentally friendly and collaboratively efficient luo et al 2020a however there are still several hindrances before practical application such as slow reduction rate and low total chromium removal efficiency cheng et al 2010 therefore the enhancement of cr vi bioreduction is still a research hotspot fenton process using fe ii and h2o2 to produce oxidizing oh is widely used to remove refractory pollutants shen et al 2020b mahta et al 2021 however a large amount of ferric sludge is inevitably formed during the process yang et al 2018 causing secondary pollution and substantial treatment costs wang et al 2020 according to statistics the cost of fenton sludge treatment may go up to 35 50 of the total cost of wastewater treatment mahtab et al 2021 moreover conventional treatment methods such as combustion and landfill cannot eliminate the secondary pollution risks of fenton ferric sludge yoo et al 2001 the electrochemical reduction requires a mass of acid input ph 3 and a high power supply zou et al 2020 therefore the efficient and economical disposal of ferric sludge has become the key issue in the large scale application of fenton technology shen et al 2020a recently microbial electrochemical systems such as microbial fuel cells mfc have been demonstrated to be efficient and cost effective solutions for cr vi removal zhou et al 2020 aarthy et al 2020 to further facilitate the cr vi reduction biocathode colonized by chromium reducing bacteria has been employed in mfc romo et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 it has also been found that soluble fe ii can function as an electron mediator to promote cr vi reduction on the abiotic cathode at the acidic environment in mfc wang et al 2017 nevertheless using a large amount of fe ii chemical in the cathode may increase the operating costs and limit the practical application of this method using alternative and renewable sources of fe ii such as fenton ferric sludge in the cathode could address the challenge which feasibility has never been reported the chief difficulty of this idea lies in the reduction of the almost insoluble ferric iron in fenton ferric sludge under neutral conditions zhao et al 2018 which is mainly in the form of fe oh 3 wang et al 2021 on the one hand it is known that many chromium reducing bacteria can also reduce insoluble fe iii to fe ii such as shewanella liu et al 2019 aeromonas shi et al 2019 bacillus fakhar et al 2020 and geobacter jiang et al 2020 on the other hand microbial electrolysis cell mec another typical microbial electrochemical system has shown unique advantages over mfc for providing more reducing power at the cathode due to externally applied voltage zhang and angelidaki 2014 moreover the biocathode mec which combines electrochemical and biological processes in the cathode can further promote electron transfer for wastewater treatment than the abiotic cathode jain and he 2018 in this context biocathode mec could be an efficient method to reduce insoluble fe iii in fenton ferric sludge thus integrating biocathode mec and insoluble fe iii derived from fenton ferric sludge could synergistically boost the cr vi reduction and simultaneously realize waste utilization to the best of our knowledge the synergistic effect of biocathode and fenton ferric sludge on cr vi reduction in mec has never been reported thus this study investigated the effect of fenton derived ferric sludge on cr vi reduction in biocathode mec its enhancement characteristics were explored under different initial ph and cr vi concentration electrochemical and physical characterization and microbial community analysis were employed to decipher the synergistic effects among cr vi fe iii and biocathode this research provides a new strategy and empirical support for the enhancement technology of cr vi bioreduction and the treatment of fenton sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 acclimation of cr vi reducing bacterial consortium the cr vi reducing bacterial consortium used in this research was acclimated from activated sludge collected from lundtofte wastewater treatment plant lyngby denmark it was cultivated at 30 c in acetate minimal medium amm which contains ch3coona 5 g l nh4cl 1 0 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l feso4 7h2o 0 001 g l cacl2 h2o 0 001 g l yeast extract 0 5 g l k2hpo4 0 5 g l ma et al 2021 the medium was replaced every week with the incremental cr vi added in the form of k2cr2o7 from 10 100 mg l until stable cr vi removal efficiency achieved beside all chemicals used in this research were acs reagent grade and purchased from sigma darmstadt german 2 2 biocathode mec setup and operation as shown in the fig s1 the dual chambered mec made of polycarbonate plates was separated by a cation exchange membrane cmi 7001 membrane international nj with 180 ml working volume of each chamber the electrodes of both anode and cathode were commercial carbon fiber brushes 25 mm diameter 25 mm length 1150 cm2 surface area fiber type panex 35 50k mill rose usa while ag agcl was used as reference electrode 0 197 v vs she pine instrument company usa in cathode chamber there was a ph probe in cathode chamber to connect the ph controller and a rotor in each of the chamber was for stirring and mixing the anodic biofilm acclimation was firstly conducted in mfc mode with 1000 ω external resistance where the anode was inoculated with municipal wastewater collected from the primary clarifier of lundtofte wastewater treatment plant lyngby denmark while the cathode was filled with potassium ferricyanide 12 g l containing 50mm of phosphate buffer solution notably the anode was fluxed with n2 for 15 min before the operation the medium was replaced every week until the maximum voltage of mfc stable at approximately 0 65 v which means the anodic biofilm was successfully enriched after that the anolyte was replaced with synthetic wastewater for a more stable condition which contains ch3coona 1 g l na2hpo4 12h2o 11 5 g l nah2po4 2h2o 2 3 g l nh4cl 0 3 g l kcl 0 1 g l trace elements and vitamins wang et al 2020 then in the cathodic biofilm acclimation stage in mec mode with 0 5 v external voltage the external resistance was changed from 1000 to 10 ω the cathodic medium was then replaced by a medium containing 1 0 g l ch3coona 0 2 g l nh4cl 0 1 g l kh2po4 50 mg l cr vi trace elements and vitamins then the cathodic inoculum was the pre acclimated cr vi reducing bacterial consortium described in section 2 1 besides the ph in cathode was controlled at 6 0 by a ph controller with 0 1 m hcl both the anode and cathode were fluxed with n2 for 15 min before the operation half of the cathode solution was taken out every week and replaced with the new medium the solution was inoculated again with cr vi reducing bacterial consortium the same operation lasted about 4 weeks 2 3 poof of concept experiment the fe ii released by fenton ferric sludge was detected under mec biocathode open circuit biocathode and mec abiotic cathode with 0 5 v applied voltage where the fenton ferric sludge was in the form of fecl3 mainly performing as fe oh 3 in ph 6 and higher ph then the cr vi reduction experiment was conducted in biocathode mec with and without fenton ferric sludge to verify the its feasibility of the cr vi reduction enhancement 2 4 the effect of different operating conditions the synergetic interaction between cr vi and fenton ferric sludge in the cathode mec was conducted under different initial ph 5 6 7 8 9 ferric sludge dosage 0 20 50 80 100 mg l and initial cr vi concentration 2 5 10 20 50 mg l unless otherwise stated the normal operating condition was ph 6 controlled by a ph controller with 0 1 m hcl initial cr vi concentration 10 mg l ferric sludge dosage 50 mg l and room temperature 25 5 c the concentration of cr vi cr iii and fe ii was detected regularly and the current during the reaction was monitored by an automatic data acquisition system 7702 40 chan multiplex keithley instrument usa every 10 min in addition the coulombic efficiency ce ratio of the charges consumed for the reduction of cr vi and the total charges flowing across the mec were calculated based on the current during the reaction as shown in the following equation 1 c e α f δ c c r v i v c a 10 3 m c r i 1 n i δ t where δccr vi was the change of cr vi concentration mg l α was number of electrons required for cr vi reduction 3 mol mol vca was the volume of the cathode chamber l f was the faraday s constant 96 485 c mol e mcr was the molecular weight of cr 52 g mol i was the circuit current a and t was the operating time 2 5 the reusability of the feeric sludge for enhancing cr vi reduction a sequential batch experiment was conducted to verify the reusability of ferric sludge in the biocathode it was operated under ph 6 and room temperature of 25 5 c with 10 mg l of initial cr vi concentration and 50 mg l of ferric sludge dosage in the 2nd 3rd and 4th cycle only 10 mg l of cr vi was added into the cathode chamber while in the 5th cycle 10 mg l of cr vi and 50 mg l ferric sludge was both added into the reactor besides the precipitate after the sequential batch experiment was collected for x ray diffraction xrd to analyze its composition by software jade 6 0 in order to decipher the fate of cr and fe in the experiment 2 6 electrochemical analysis the electrochemical characteristics of the biocathode under different ferric sludge dosage were investigated to explore the enhancement mechanism the polarization curve was measured by a slide rheostat model br07 aemc instrument usa and a multimeter dmt 20i0 monacor international germany the cv curves tafel plots and eis measurements were conducted by an electrochemical analyser ivium n stat ivium netherlands under the open circuit condition with the biocathode as working electrode platinum as counter electrode and ag agcl as reference electrode furthermore the cv cyclicvoltammetry curves were performed at a scan rate of 1 0 mv s in the potential range from 1 0 to 1 0 v the tafel plots were conducted with 1 0 mv s scan rate from 0 0 to 1 0 v and the eis electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried at the frequency of 100 khz 0 01 hz with a sinusoidal perturbation of 5 mv in amplitude besides the parameters of eis was analyzed by zview 3 0 2 7 microbial community analysis samples were collected after the test of 10 mg l cr vi with 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge which were conducted under ph 6 and room temperature 25 5 c pierce bca protein assay kit was used to detect biomass and extracellular proteins under different ferric sludge dosages the samples for biomass protein detection were firstly pretreated by 50 mm tris hcl lysis buffer and microwave digestion the samples were then used for cytochrome c detection using sodium dithionite spectrophotometry hach dr3900 kang et al 2018 in addition the microbial samples under different ferric sludge dosage system were collected after the experiment for high throughput 16s rrna analysis on miseq illumina usa the total genomic dna were extracted using a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen gmbh germany and then amplified with pcr primer 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 2 8 analytical methods cr vi was measured by 1 5 diphenylcarbazide method dpc apha 2001 and the fe ii was tested by ferrozine method stookey 1970 and assuming that the species of cr in aqueous solution is only cr vi and cr iii the cr iii in solution was calculated by deducting cr vi from total cr where the total cr was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific usa the cr vi reduction rate was reflected by the first order kinetic constant and the equation of the first order kinetics is shown in the following equation 2 ln c 0 ln c t k t where c0 represents the initial cr vi concentration mg l ct represents the cr vi concentration mg l at time t h k represents the first order kinetic constant h 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of ferric sludge on cr vi reduction in biocathode mec since fenton ferric sludge mainly exists in the form of fe oh 3 under neutral and weakly acidic conditions the main difficulty of its utilization is the reduction of the fe iii under almost insoluble conditions the feasibility of fenton ferric sludge derived fe iii reduction in biocathode mec was investigated in addition the same tests were conducted in open circuit or with an abiotic cathode as shown in fig 1 a there was almost no fe ii released in mec with the abiotic cathode and the fe ii released under open circuit condition was very low maximum was 0 3 mg l which represented reduction capacity of the traditional microbial method while in the biocathode in the close circuit the highest fe ii release up to 1 5 mg l was observed the slight decrease of fe ii after 2 h may be caused by the utilization of microbes as iron is an essential micronutrient of microorganisms liu et al 2018 the results indicated that the biocathode mec could make maximum use of fe iii in ferric sludge as shown in fig 1b a significant enhancement of cr vi reduction in biocathode mec was observed by adding 50 mg l ferric sludge complete cr vi reduction was achieved at 4 h in the system with ferric sludge while it was obtained at 6 h in the control system the results verified the feasibility of using ferric sludge for enhancement of cr vi reduction 3 2 the enhancement characteristics under different operating conditions 3 2 1 the effect of ph the biocathode mec assisted with ferric sludge was further operated under different ph one reactor with no ferric sludge addition was tested as a control as shown in fig s2 cr vi reduction efficiency decreased with the increasing of ph a significant enhancement of cr vi reduction was observed in the reactor with ferric sludge supply under ph 5 6 and 7 conditions while limited enhancement was observed under ph 8 and 9 the results fit better with the first order kinetics than zero order kinetics in both systems with or without ferric sludge tabel s1 it revealed that the reaction process was still dominated by microbial reduction rather than chemical reduction which could be due to the relatively low fe iii reduction efficiency from insoluble ferric sludge by cr vi reducing bacterial the enhancement ability also decreased with the ph increase with 1 6 1 5 1 4 1 3 and 1 4 times enhancement by adding ferric sludge under ph 5 6 7 8 9 respectively fig 2 a it could be attributed to the release ability of fe ii in ferric sludge under different ph conditions fig 2b the higher release ability of fe ii in lower ph is related to the form of fe iii because fe iii is more soluble in acidic phs millero et al 1995 besides the system adding ferric sludge achieved higher coulombic efficiency than the control fig 2c which revealed the higher current efficiency that is the same amount of charge can remove more cr vi after the reaction the cr iii concentration was also detected which demonstrated the capability of ferric sludge to enhance cr iii removal it may be attributed to the co precipitation of cr iii and fe iii as reported before chebeir and liu 2018 yue et al 2019 3 2 2 the effect of ferric sludge dosage the ferric sludge dosage was set as 0 20 50 80 100 mg l to investigate its effects on the cr vi reduction enhancement the cr vi reduction efficiency increased with the increasing of ferric sludge dosage fig s3 the enhancement degree based on the first order kinetics constant was 1 2 1 3 1 5 and 1 9 times higher than the control under 20 50 80 and 100 mg l dosages respectively fig 3 a it was attributed to the higher fe ii release under higher ferric sludge dosage fig 3b this also led to the increasing of coulombic efficiency with ferric sludge dosage fig 3c furthermore the residual cr iii concentration decreased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage fig 3d which further confirmed the speculation of co precipitation between cr iii and fe iii 3 2 3 the effect of initial cr vi concentration the ferric sludge assisted biocathode mec system was further tested with different initial cr vi concentrations as shown in fig s4 the enhancement of cr vi reduction by the ferric sludge was exhibited under all the tested cr vi concentrations the cr vi reduction rate represented by the first order kinetic constant was 2 6 1 6 1 5 1 3 and 1 1 times higher than the control without ferric sludge addition under 2 5 10 20 and 50 mg l initial cr vi concentration respectively fig 4 a the enhancement decreased with the increase of initial cr vi concentrations which may be due to the microbial toxicity of cr vi at higher concentrations resulting in less fe ii reduced from the ferric sludge by microorganisms fig 4b besides the enhancement of coulombic efficiency also decreased with the icreasing of initial cr vi concentration fig 4c the residual cr iii concentration slightly increased with the increase of the initial cr vi concentration fig 4d which was possibly due to the insufficient fe iii for co precipitation with the high concentration of cr iii 3 3 the reusability of ferric sludge a sequential batch experiment was conducted to explore the reusability of ferric sludge for cr vi reduction as shown in fig 5 a in the first four cycles the removal rate of cr vi gradually decreased with the reaction progresses with the first order kinetic constant of 0 094 0 089 0 078 0 064 h 1 respectively the result could be due to the co precipitation of cr iii and fe iii which reduced the content of fe ii that can be released for cr vi reduction an xrd analysis was performed to identify the composition of the precipitate after the reaction fig 5b the results showed that the characteristic diffraction peaks had a higher overlap with fe oh 3 pdf 38 0032 and fe cro4 oh pdf 20 0511 indicating that the co precipitation of cr iii and fe iii occurred then in the 5th cycle 50 mg l ferric sludge was dosed into the reactor and the cr vi removal rate returned to the same level as observed in the first cycle with 0 093 h 1 of the first order kinetic constant therefore the enhancement of cr vi reduction by using ferric sludge can be maintained by continuously adding ferric sludge 3 4 mechanisms analysis for the enhanced cr vi reduction 3 4 1 polarization curve and power output the polarization and power curve were conducted during 100 10000 ω fig 6 a where the open circuit potential ocp under 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge dosage were 0 516 0 523 and 0 536 v respectively the higher ocp of ferric sludge system indicated its role in reducing the electrode overpotential for cr vi reduction leading to higher current efficiency furthermore the internal resistance calculated from the polarization curves were 456 7 441 1 and 423 3 ω under 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge dosage indicating less ohmic loss under ferric sludge addition was in favor of the charge transfer the maximum power density also increased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage with 0 827 0 947 and 1 027 w m3 for 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge dosage system which was consistent with the polarization curve in general the addition of ferric sludge was conducive to improve the operation performance of mec and then promoted the electron transfer of cr vi reduction in biocathode 3 4 2 cv curve cv was conducted to access the reduction capacity of the reactors with or without ferric sludge as shown in fig 6b cv curves showed the lower reductive peak current and more positive reductive peak potential in the system with ferric sludge rather than the control it indicated the indirect reduction of cr vi in the presence of ferric sludge barrera díaza et al 2011 wang et al 2017 that is the fate in which the fe iii in ferric sludge was reduced to fe ii and then cr vi was reduced by the fe ii as for the indistinctive difference between the two systems it may be due to the low ratio of chemical reduction 3 4 3 tafel plot tafel plots were conducted to evaluate the reactor performance and the corresponding reduction kinetics under different ferric sludge dosage fig 6c according to the tafel formula shown in eq 3 the tafel slope b and the exchange current density i were calculated in table 1 with the increase of ferric sludge dosage the slope b of the tafel plot gradually increased which was inversely proportional to the electron transfer coefficient α based on eq 4 indicating the decrease of interface electron transferability zhu et al 2020 it may be related to the adsorption of ferric sludge on the surface of the electrode which may reduce the working specific surface area of the electrode however the higher removal efficiency of cr vi with the addition of ferric sludge demonstrated that the above problem had little effect besides the exchange current density i gradually increased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage illustrating that the increase of ferric sludge reduced the activation energy of the reaction this was conducive to the occurrence of the reduction reaction wang et al 2017 which may be related to the electron shuttle effect of fe iii 3 η a b log i 4 b 2 3 r t α f 3 4 4 eis spectrum eis was further used to assess the resistance of reactors in the presence or absence of ferric sludge where the nyquist plots and corresponding equivalent circuit model were shown in fig 6d and the solution resistance rs and charge transfer resistance rct were calculated and shown in table 2 it is suggested that the rs decreased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage which represented the higher charge transfer efficiency in the solution wang et al 2017 in addition the rct has something to do with the reaction activation energy which also decreased with the ferric sludge dosage increase the results imply the higher electron transport activity and diffusion rate li et al 2018 thus the decline of the two resistances was conducive to the progress of the reduction reaction 3 5 microbiological analyis extracellular and biomass proteins proteins in on the microbials were measured to represent microbial activity indirectly in general the total protein content increased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage furthermore the biomass protein increased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage while the extracellular protein was the opposite and decreased with its increase fig 7 a the increase in total protein content demonstrated that the addition of ferric sludge was beneficial to the growth and metabolism of microorganisms it may be attributed to the fact that fe itself is an essential trace element of microbials and an active factor for various enzymes which participate in microbial electron transfer labbé et al 2003 bityutskii et al 2014 the attachment of ferric sludge may cause the decrease in extracellular protein content to the surface of microbes which can be directly reacted by membrane proteins rather than extracellular proteins then the cytochrome c a membrane protein that plays an important role in electron transport of the respiratory chain li et al 2020 was further detected the content of cytochrome c per unit mass of protein increased with the addition of ferric sludge which was due to that the reduction of fe iii requires the participation of cytochrome c mehta et al 2020 except for the direct contact between the ferric sludge and microbes described above furthermore the cytochrome c produced by its stimulation can simultaneously act on cr vi reduction resulting in the cr vi reduction enhancement then a 16s rrna analysis was conducted to desipher the differences of microbial community structure among the reactor adding 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge as shown in fig 7b the typical alpha diversity indexes of chao and shannon decreased with the increase of ferric sludge addition which indicated the decrease of microbial community richness and diversity demonstrating the higher selectivity caused by the ferric sludge in addition the coverage of all the three samples were higher than 99 5 implying that the results can reflect the true situation of microorganisms as we can see from fig 7c in class level the 0 and 50 mg l ferric sludge addition to the systems had similar microbial community structure while the 100 mg l ferric sludge addition system displayed a significant difference the dominant classes in all the three systems were gammaproteobacteria clostridia bacteroidia and synergistia which were all reported had the capacity for cr vi reduction previously pradhan et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 luo et al 2020b with significantly different proportions the relative abundance of class gammaproteobacteria in 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge addition systems were 61 4 60 7 and 20 6 respectively the relative abundance of class clostridia was 9 3 10 2 and 34 9 respectively this results could be attributed to the striking correlation of clostridia for fe iii reduction kuippers et al 2019 lu et al 2020 furthermore the class abundance of bacteroidia and synergistia also got a slight increase with the increase of ferric sludge dosage which is always observed in fe containing sludge lin and li 2018 as for the genus level the differences between the three systems became more significant fig 7d genera pseudomonas 22 8 and acinetobacter 12 7 took the majority of abundance in 0 mg l ferric sludge system the pseudomonas 27 9 and comamonas 15 1 were predominant in 50 mg l ferric sludge system while the pseudomonas 16 8 and alkaliphilus 20 6 accumulated in 100 mg l ferric sludge system which were all common genera in cr vi reducing mixed bacterial consortium ma et al 2020 furthermore comamonas and alkaliphilus were both reported fe iii reducing bacterial wu et al 2010 zakharyuk et al 2017 and different fe iii concentrations may gather other genera in summary the addition of ferric sludge could make a specific impact on the microbial community structure thereby promoting the reduction of fe iii which was consequently beneficial to the removal of cr vi the mechanisms of cr vi reduction in biocathode microbial electrolysis cell with fenton ferric sludge were now summarized fig 8 first of all the cr vi could be reduced by the microorganisms on the biocathode and electrochemically reduced by electrode weak on the other hand the fe iii in fenton ferric sludge could be also reduced to fe ii by microorganisms and electrode weak which can then chemically reduce cr vi the co precipatation of cr iii and fe iii could be also conducive to the removal of total cr furthermore the addition of ferric sludge could lead to the lower activation energy of the reaction and the higher charge transfer efficiency in the solution which in favour of the reduction of cr vi 4 conclusions in this study the ferric sludge derived from the fenton process was used to enhance the reduction of cr vi in a biocathode mec system the enhancement effects by fenton ferric sludge were investigated under different operating conditions it was found that the cr vi reduction decreased with the increase of ph and initial cr vi concentration or increased with ferric sludge dosage the results revealed that the fe iii of fenton ferric sludge was reduced to fe ii by biocathode which can subsequently chemically reduce cr vi moreover the addition of ferric sludge could reduce the activation energy of cr vi reduction leading to a higher power density and lower process resistance and thereby improving mec operation performance for cr vi reduction furthermore ferric sludge also promoted biomass protein and cytochrome c increasing the abundance of microorganisms that can reduce both cr vi and fe iii this

16289,hexavalent chromium cr vi is one of the major concerns for water environment and human health due to its high toxicicity while ferric sludge produced from fenton processes is also a tough nut to crack in this study the synergetic impact of ferric sludge derived from the fenton process on the bioreduction of cr vi in biocathode microbial electrolysis cell was investigated for the first time as a result cr vi reduction efficiency at biocathode increased by 1 1 2 6 times with 50 mg l ferric sludge under different operation conditions besides the cr vi reduction enhancement decreased with the increase of ph and initial cr vi concentration or increased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage correspondingly relatively higher power density 1 027 w m3 with 100 mg l ferric sludge while 0 827 w m3 for control and lower activation energy and resistance were also observed besides the presence of ferric sludge increased biomass protein 1 7 times higher with 100 mg l ferric sludge and cytochrome c 1 4 times higher with 100 mg l ferric sludge the evolution of microbial community structure for a higher abundance of cr vi and fe iii reducing microorganisms were exhibited implying the enhancement of cr vi reduction was due to the formation of fe ii from the reduction of ferric sludge these findings provide insights and theoretical support for developing a viable biotechnology platform to realize waste treatment using waste graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cr vi bioreduction fenton ferric sludge biocathode microbial electrolysis cell mixed bacterial consortium 1 introduction chromium cr presence in water bodies has become a major environmental problem and may seriously threaten human health zhu et al 2019 tan et al 2020 cr vi and cr iii which are the most prevalent species of chromium in nature have entirely different properties zeng et al 2019 cr vi is highly toxic due to its high oxidation potential mobility and permeability while cr iii has far lower toxicity due to the low solubility and mobility in neutral and alkaline conditions wu et al 2019 luo et al 2019 moreover a low concentration of cr iii is an essential nutrient for humans to better uptake protein fat and sugar lin et al 2020 therefore the reduction of cr vi to cr iii is considered to be an effective method for chromium contamination treatment bharagava and mishra 2018 among existing remediation strategies the microbial reduction method has attracted wide attention due to its unique merits of being cost effective environmentally friendly and collaboratively efficient luo et al 2020a however there are still several hindrances before practical application such as slow reduction rate and low total chromium removal efficiency cheng et al 2010 therefore the enhancement of cr vi bioreduction is still a research hotspot fenton process using fe ii and h2o2 to produce oxidizing oh is widely used to remove refractory pollutants shen et al 2020b mahta et al 2021 however a large amount of ferric sludge is inevitably formed during the process yang et al 2018 causing secondary pollution and substantial treatment costs wang et al 2020 according to statistics the cost of fenton sludge treatment may go up to 35 50 of the total cost of wastewater treatment mahtab et al 2021 moreover conventional treatment methods such as combustion and landfill cannot eliminate the secondary pollution risks of fenton ferric sludge yoo et al 2001 the electrochemical reduction requires a mass of acid input ph 3 and a high power supply zou et al 2020 therefore the efficient and economical disposal of ferric sludge has become the key issue in the large scale application of fenton technology shen et al 2020a recently microbial electrochemical systems such as microbial fuel cells mfc have been demonstrated to be efficient and cost effective solutions for cr vi removal zhou et al 2020 aarthy et al 2020 to further facilitate the cr vi reduction biocathode colonized by chromium reducing bacteria has been employed in mfc romo et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 it has also been found that soluble fe ii can function as an electron mediator to promote cr vi reduction on the abiotic cathode at the acidic environment in mfc wang et al 2017 nevertheless using a large amount of fe ii chemical in the cathode may increase the operating costs and limit the practical application of this method using alternative and renewable sources of fe ii such as fenton ferric sludge in the cathode could address the challenge which feasibility has never been reported the chief difficulty of this idea lies in the reduction of the almost insoluble ferric iron in fenton ferric sludge under neutral conditions zhao et al 2018 which is mainly in the form of fe oh 3 wang et al 2021 on the one hand it is known that many chromium reducing bacteria can also reduce insoluble fe iii to fe ii such as shewanella liu et al 2019 aeromonas shi et al 2019 bacillus fakhar et al 2020 and geobacter jiang et al 2020 on the other hand microbial electrolysis cell mec another typical microbial electrochemical system has shown unique advantages over mfc for providing more reducing power at the cathode due to externally applied voltage zhang and angelidaki 2014 moreover the biocathode mec which combines electrochemical and biological processes in the cathode can further promote electron transfer for wastewater treatment than the abiotic cathode jain and he 2018 in this context biocathode mec could be an efficient method to reduce insoluble fe iii in fenton ferric sludge thus integrating biocathode mec and insoluble fe iii derived from fenton ferric sludge could synergistically boost the cr vi reduction and simultaneously realize waste utilization to the best of our knowledge the synergistic effect of biocathode and fenton ferric sludge on cr vi reduction in mec has never been reported thus this study investigated the effect of fenton derived ferric sludge on cr vi reduction in biocathode mec its enhancement characteristics were explored under different initial ph and cr vi concentration electrochemical and physical characterization and microbial community analysis were employed to decipher the synergistic effects among cr vi fe iii and biocathode this research provides a new strategy and empirical support for the enhancement technology of cr vi bioreduction and the treatment of fenton sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 acclimation of cr vi reducing bacterial consortium the cr vi reducing bacterial consortium used in this research was acclimated from activated sludge collected from lundtofte wastewater treatment plant lyngby denmark it was cultivated at 30 c in acetate minimal medium amm which contains ch3coona 5 g l nh4cl 1 0 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l feso4 7h2o 0 001 g l cacl2 h2o 0 001 g l yeast extract 0 5 g l k2hpo4 0 5 g l ma et al 2021 the medium was replaced every week with the incremental cr vi added in the form of k2cr2o7 from 10 100 mg l until stable cr vi removal efficiency achieved beside all chemicals used in this research were acs reagent grade and purchased from sigma darmstadt german 2 2 biocathode mec setup and operation as shown in the fig s1 the dual chambered mec made of polycarbonate plates was separated by a cation exchange membrane cmi 7001 membrane international nj with 180 ml working volume of each chamber the electrodes of both anode and cathode were commercial carbon fiber brushes 25 mm diameter 25 mm length 1150 cm2 surface area fiber type panex 35 50k mill rose usa while ag agcl was used as reference electrode 0 197 v vs she pine instrument company usa in cathode chamber there was a ph probe in cathode chamber to connect the ph controller and a rotor in each of the chamber was for stirring and mixing the anodic biofilm acclimation was firstly conducted in mfc mode with 1000 ω external resistance where the anode was inoculated with municipal wastewater collected from the primary clarifier of lundtofte wastewater treatment plant lyngby denmark while the cathode was filled with potassium ferricyanide 12 g l containing 50mm of phosphate buffer solution notably the anode was fluxed with n2 for 15 min before the operation the medium was replaced every week until the maximum voltage of mfc stable at approximately 0 65 v which means the anodic biofilm was successfully enriched after that the anolyte was replaced with synthetic wastewater for a more stable condition which contains ch3coona 1 g l na2hpo4 12h2o 11 5 g l nah2po4 2h2o 2 3 g l nh4cl 0 3 g l kcl 0 1 g l trace elements and vitamins wang et al 2020 then in the cathodic biofilm acclimation stage in mec mode with 0 5 v external voltage the external resistance was changed from 1000 to 10 ω the cathodic medium was then replaced by a medium containing 1 0 g l ch3coona 0 2 g l nh4cl 0 1 g l kh2po4 50 mg l cr vi trace elements and vitamins then the cathodic inoculum was the pre acclimated cr vi reducing bacterial consortium described in section 2 1 besides the ph in cathode was controlled at 6 0 by a ph controller with 0 1 m hcl both the anode and cathode were fluxed with n2 for 15 min before the operation half of the cathode solution was taken out every week and replaced with the new medium the solution was inoculated again with cr vi reducing bacterial consortium the same operation lasted about 4 weeks 2 3 poof of concept experiment the fe ii released by fenton ferric sludge was detected under mec biocathode open circuit biocathode and mec abiotic cathode with 0 5 v applied voltage where the fenton ferric sludge was in the form of fecl3 mainly performing as fe oh 3 in ph 6 and higher ph then the cr vi reduction experiment was conducted in biocathode mec with and without fenton ferric sludge to verify the its feasibility of the cr vi reduction enhancement 2 4 the effect of different operating conditions the synergetic interaction between cr vi and fenton ferric sludge in the cathode mec was conducted under different initial ph 5 6 7 8 9 ferric sludge dosage 0 20 50 80 100 mg l and initial cr vi concentration 2 5 10 20 50 mg l unless otherwise stated the normal operating condition was ph 6 controlled by a ph controller with 0 1 m hcl initial cr vi concentration 10 mg l ferric sludge dosage 50 mg l and room temperature 25 5 c the concentration of cr vi cr iii and fe ii was detected regularly and the current during the reaction was monitored by an automatic data acquisition system 7702 40 chan multiplex keithley instrument usa every 10 min in addition the coulombic efficiency ce ratio of the charges consumed for the reduction of cr vi and the total charges flowing across the mec were calculated based on the current during the reaction as shown in the following equation 1 c e α f δ c c r v i v c a 10 3 m c r i 1 n i δ t where δccr vi was the change of cr vi concentration mg l α was number of electrons required for cr vi reduction 3 mol mol vca was the volume of the cathode chamber l f was the faraday s constant 96 485 c mol e mcr was the molecular weight of cr 52 g mol i was the circuit current a and t was the operating time 2 5 the reusability of the feeric sludge for enhancing cr vi reduction a sequential batch experiment was conducted to verify the reusability of ferric sludge in the biocathode it was operated under ph 6 and room temperature of 25 5 c with 10 mg l of initial cr vi concentration and 50 mg l of ferric sludge dosage in the 2nd 3rd and 4th cycle only 10 mg l of cr vi was added into the cathode chamber while in the 5th cycle 10 mg l of cr vi and 50 mg l ferric sludge was both added into the reactor besides the precipitate after the sequential batch experiment was collected for x ray diffraction xrd to analyze its composition by software jade 6 0 in order to decipher the fate of cr and fe in the experiment 2 6 electrochemical analysis the electrochemical characteristics of the biocathode under different ferric sludge dosage were investigated to explore the enhancement mechanism the polarization curve was measured by a slide rheostat model br07 aemc instrument usa and a multimeter dmt 20i0 monacor international germany the cv curves tafel plots and eis measurements were conducted by an electrochemical analyser ivium n stat ivium netherlands under the open circuit condition with the biocathode as working electrode platinum as counter electrode and ag agcl as reference electrode furthermore the cv cyclicvoltammetry curves were performed at a scan rate of 1 0 mv s in the potential range from 1 0 to 1 0 v the tafel plots were conducted with 1 0 mv s scan rate from 0 0 to 1 0 v and the eis electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried at the frequency of 100 khz 0 01 hz with a sinusoidal perturbation of 5 mv in amplitude besides the parameters of eis was analyzed by zview 3 0 2 7 microbial community analysis samples were collected after the test of 10 mg l cr vi with 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge which were conducted under ph 6 and room temperature 25 5 c pierce bca protein assay kit was used to detect biomass and extracellular proteins under different ferric sludge dosages the samples for biomass protein detection were firstly pretreated by 50 mm tris hcl lysis buffer and microwave digestion the samples were then used for cytochrome c detection using sodium dithionite spectrophotometry hach dr3900 kang et al 2018 in addition the microbial samples under different ferric sludge dosage system were collected after the experiment for high throughput 16s rrna analysis on miseq illumina usa the total genomic dna were extracted using a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen gmbh germany and then amplified with pcr primer 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 2 8 analytical methods cr vi was measured by 1 5 diphenylcarbazide method dpc apha 2001 and the fe ii was tested by ferrozine method stookey 1970 and assuming that the species of cr in aqueous solution is only cr vi and cr iii the cr iii in solution was calculated by deducting cr vi from total cr where the total cr was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific usa the cr vi reduction rate was reflected by the first order kinetic constant and the equation of the first order kinetics is shown in the following equation 2 ln c 0 ln c t k t where c0 represents the initial cr vi concentration mg l ct represents the cr vi concentration mg l at time t h k represents the first order kinetic constant h 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of ferric sludge on cr vi reduction in biocathode mec since fenton ferric sludge mainly exists in the form of fe oh 3 under neutral and weakly acidic conditions the main difficulty of its utilization is the reduction of the fe iii under almost insoluble conditions the feasibility of fenton ferric sludge derived fe iii reduction in biocathode mec was investigated in addition the same tests were conducted in open circuit or with an abiotic cathode as shown in fig 1 a there was almost no fe ii released in mec with the abiotic cathode and the fe ii released under open circuit condition was very low maximum was 0 3 mg l which represented reduction capacity of the traditional microbial method while in the biocathode in the close circuit the highest fe ii release up to 1 5 mg l was observed the slight decrease of fe ii after 2 h may be caused by the utilization of microbes as iron is an essential micronutrient of microorganisms liu et al 2018 the results indicated that the biocathode mec could make maximum use of fe iii in ferric sludge as shown in fig 1b a significant enhancement of cr vi reduction in biocathode mec was observed by adding 50 mg l ferric sludge complete cr vi reduction was achieved at 4 h in the system with ferric sludge while it was obtained at 6 h in the control system the results verified the feasibility of using ferric sludge for enhancement of cr vi reduction 3 2 the enhancement characteristics under different operating conditions 3 2 1 the effect of ph the biocathode mec assisted with ferric sludge was further operated under different ph one reactor with no ferric sludge addition was tested as a control as shown in fig s2 cr vi reduction efficiency decreased with the increasing of ph a significant enhancement of cr vi reduction was observed in the reactor with ferric sludge supply under ph 5 6 and 7 conditions while limited enhancement was observed under ph 8 and 9 the results fit better with the first order kinetics than zero order kinetics in both systems with or without ferric sludge tabel s1 it revealed that the reaction process was still dominated by microbial reduction rather than chemical reduction which could be due to the relatively low fe iii reduction efficiency from insoluble ferric sludge by cr vi reducing bacterial the enhancement ability also decreased with the ph increase with 1 6 1 5 1 4 1 3 and 1 4 times enhancement by adding ferric sludge under ph 5 6 7 8 9 respectively fig 2 a it could be attributed to the release ability of fe ii in ferric sludge under different ph conditions fig 2b the higher release ability of fe ii in lower ph is related to the form of fe iii because fe iii is more soluble in acidic phs millero et al 1995 besides the system adding ferric sludge achieved higher coulombic efficiency than the control fig 2c which revealed the higher current efficiency that is the same amount of charge can remove more cr vi after the reaction the cr iii concentration was also detected which demonstrated the capability of ferric sludge to enhance cr iii removal it may be attributed to the co precipitation of cr iii and fe iii as reported before chebeir and liu 2018 yue et al 2019 3 2 2 the effect of ferric sludge dosage the ferric sludge dosage was set as 0 20 50 80 100 mg l to investigate its effects on the cr vi reduction enhancement the cr vi reduction efficiency increased with the increasing of ferric sludge dosage fig s3 the enhancement degree based on the first order kinetics constant was 1 2 1 3 1 5 and 1 9 times higher than the control under 20 50 80 and 100 mg l dosages respectively fig 3 a it was attributed to the higher fe ii release under higher ferric sludge dosage fig 3b this also led to the increasing of coulombic efficiency with ferric sludge dosage fig 3c furthermore the residual cr iii concentration decreased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage fig 3d which further confirmed the speculation of co precipitation between cr iii and fe iii 3 2 3 the effect of initial cr vi concentration the ferric sludge assisted biocathode mec system was further tested with different initial cr vi concentrations as shown in fig s4 the enhancement of cr vi reduction by the ferric sludge was exhibited under all the tested cr vi concentrations the cr vi reduction rate represented by the first order kinetic constant was 2 6 1 6 1 5 1 3 and 1 1 times higher than the control without ferric sludge addition under 2 5 10 20 and 50 mg l initial cr vi concentration respectively fig 4 a the enhancement decreased with the increase of initial cr vi concentrations which may be due to the microbial toxicity of cr vi at higher concentrations resulting in less fe ii reduced from the ferric sludge by microorganisms fig 4b besides the enhancement of coulombic efficiency also decreased with the icreasing of initial cr vi concentration fig 4c the residual cr iii concentration slightly increased with the increase of the initial cr vi concentration fig 4d which was possibly due to the insufficient fe iii for co precipitation with the high concentration of cr iii 3 3 the reusability of ferric sludge a sequential batch experiment was conducted to explore the reusability of ferric sludge for cr vi reduction as shown in fig 5 a in the first four cycles the removal rate of cr vi gradually decreased with the reaction progresses with the first order kinetic constant of 0 094 0 089 0 078 0 064 h 1 respectively the result could be due to the co precipitation of cr iii and fe iii which reduced the content of fe ii that can be released for cr vi reduction an xrd analysis was performed to identify the composition of the precipitate after the reaction fig 5b the results showed that the characteristic diffraction peaks had a higher overlap with fe oh 3 pdf 38 0032 and fe cro4 oh pdf 20 0511 indicating that the co precipitation of cr iii and fe iii occurred then in the 5th cycle 50 mg l ferric sludge was dosed into the reactor and the cr vi removal rate returned to the same level as observed in the first cycle with 0 093 h 1 of the first order kinetic constant therefore the enhancement of cr vi reduction by using ferric sludge can be maintained by continuously adding ferric sludge 3 4 mechanisms analysis for the enhanced cr vi reduction 3 4 1 polarization curve and power output the polarization and power curve were conducted during 100 10000 ω fig 6 a where the open circuit potential ocp under 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge dosage were 0 516 0 523 and 0 536 v respectively the higher ocp of ferric sludge system indicated its role in reducing the electrode overpotential for cr vi reduction leading to higher current efficiency furthermore the internal resistance calculated from the polarization curves were 456 7 441 1 and 423 3 ω under 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge dosage indicating less ohmic loss under ferric sludge addition was in favor of the charge transfer the maximum power density also increased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage with 0 827 0 947 and 1 027 w m3 for 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge dosage system which was consistent with the polarization curve in general the addition of ferric sludge was conducive to improve the operation performance of mec and then promoted the electron transfer of cr vi reduction in biocathode 3 4 2 cv curve cv was conducted to access the reduction capacity of the reactors with or without ferric sludge as shown in fig 6b cv curves showed the lower reductive peak current and more positive reductive peak potential in the system with ferric sludge rather than the control it indicated the indirect reduction of cr vi in the presence of ferric sludge barrera díaza et al 2011 wang et al 2017 that is the fate in which the fe iii in ferric sludge was reduced to fe ii and then cr vi was reduced by the fe ii as for the indistinctive difference between the two systems it may be due to the low ratio of chemical reduction 3 4 3 tafel plot tafel plots were conducted to evaluate the reactor performance and the corresponding reduction kinetics under different ferric sludge dosage fig 6c according to the tafel formula shown in eq 3 the tafel slope b and the exchange current density i were calculated in table 1 with the increase of ferric sludge dosage the slope b of the tafel plot gradually increased which was inversely proportional to the electron transfer coefficient α based on eq 4 indicating the decrease of interface electron transferability zhu et al 2020 it may be related to the adsorption of ferric sludge on the surface of the electrode which may reduce the working specific surface area of the electrode however the higher removal efficiency of cr vi with the addition of ferric sludge demonstrated that the above problem had little effect besides the exchange current density i gradually increased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage illustrating that the increase of ferric sludge reduced the activation energy of the reaction this was conducive to the occurrence of the reduction reaction wang et al 2017 which may be related to the electron shuttle effect of fe iii 3 η a b log i 4 b 2 3 r t α f 3 4 4 eis spectrum eis was further used to assess the resistance of reactors in the presence or absence of ferric sludge where the nyquist plots and corresponding equivalent circuit model were shown in fig 6d and the solution resistance rs and charge transfer resistance rct were calculated and shown in table 2 it is suggested that the rs decreased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage which represented the higher charge transfer efficiency in the solution wang et al 2017 in addition the rct has something to do with the reaction activation energy which also decreased with the ferric sludge dosage increase the results imply the higher electron transport activity and diffusion rate li et al 2018 thus the decline of the two resistances was conducive to the progress of the reduction reaction 3 5 microbiological analyis extracellular and biomass proteins proteins in on the microbials were measured to represent microbial activity indirectly in general the total protein content increased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage furthermore the biomass protein increased with the increase of ferric sludge dosage while the extracellular protein was the opposite and decreased with its increase fig 7 a the increase in total protein content demonstrated that the addition of ferric sludge was beneficial to the growth and metabolism of microorganisms it may be attributed to the fact that fe itself is an essential trace element of microbials and an active factor for various enzymes which participate in microbial electron transfer labbé et al 2003 bityutskii et al 2014 the attachment of ferric sludge may cause the decrease in extracellular protein content to the surface of microbes which can be directly reacted by membrane proteins rather than extracellular proteins then the cytochrome c a membrane protein that plays an important role in electron transport of the respiratory chain li et al 2020 was further detected the content of cytochrome c per unit mass of protein increased with the addition of ferric sludge which was due to that the reduction of fe iii requires the participation of cytochrome c mehta et al 2020 except for the direct contact between the ferric sludge and microbes described above furthermore the cytochrome c produced by its stimulation can simultaneously act on cr vi reduction resulting in the cr vi reduction enhancement then a 16s rrna analysis was conducted to desipher the differences of microbial community structure among the reactor adding 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge as shown in fig 7b the typical alpha diversity indexes of chao and shannon decreased with the increase of ferric sludge addition which indicated the decrease of microbial community richness and diversity demonstrating the higher selectivity caused by the ferric sludge in addition the coverage of all the three samples were higher than 99 5 implying that the results can reflect the true situation of microorganisms as we can see from fig 7c in class level the 0 and 50 mg l ferric sludge addition to the systems had similar microbial community structure while the 100 mg l ferric sludge addition system displayed a significant difference the dominant classes in all the three systems were gammaproteobacteria clostridia bacteroidia and synergistia which were all reported had the capacity for cr vi reduction previously pradhan et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 luo et al 2020b with significantly different proportions the relative abundance of class gammaproteobacteria in 0 50 and 100 mg l ferric sludge addition systems were 61 4 60 7 and 20 6 respectively the relative abundance of class clostridia was 9 3 10 2 and 34 9 respectively this results could be attributed to the striking correlation of clostridia for fe iii reduction kuippers et al 2019 lu et al 2020 furthermore the class abundance of bacteroidia and synergistia also got a slight increase with the increase of ferric sludge dosage which is always observed in fe containing sludge lin and li 2018 as for the genus level the differences between the three systems became more significant fig 7d genera pseudomonas 22 8 and acinetobacter 12 7 took the majority of abundance in 0 mg l ferric sludge system the pseudomonas 27 9 and comamonas 15 1 were predominant in 50 mg l ferric sludge system while the pseudomonas 16 8 and alkaliphilus 20 6 accumulated in 100 mg l ferric sludge system which were all common genera in cr vi reducing mixed bacterial consortium ma et al 2020 furthermore comamonas and alkaliphilus were both reported fe iii reducing bacterial wu et al 2010 zakharyuk et al 2017 and different fe iii concentrations may gather other genera in summary the addition of ferric sludge could make a specific impact on the microbial community structure thereby promoting the reduction of fe iii which was consequently beneficial to the removal of cr vi the mechanisms of cr vi reduction in biocathode microbial electrolysis cell with fenton ferric sludge were now summarized fig 8 first of all the cr vi could be reduced by the microorganisms on the biocathode and electrochemically reduced by electrode weak on the other hand the fe iii in fenton ferric sludge could be also reduced to fe ii by microorganisms and electrode weak which can then chemically reduce cr vi the co precipatation of cr iii and fe iii could be also conducive to the removal of total cr furthermore the addition of ferric sludge could lead to the lower activation energy of the reaction and the higher charge transfer efficiency in the solution which in favour of the reduction of cr vi 4 conclusions in this study the ferric sludge derived from the fenton process was used to enhance the reduction of cr vi in a biocathode mec system the enhancement effects by fenton ferric sludge were investigated under different operating conditions it was found that the cr vi reduction decreased with the increase of ph and initial cr vi concentration or increased with ferric sludge dosage the results revealed that the fe iii of fenton ferric sludge was reduced to fe ii by biocathode which can subsequently chemically reduce cr vi moreover the addition of ferric sludge could reduce the activation energy of cr vi reduction leading to a higher power density and lower process resistance and thereby improving mec operation performance for cr vi reduction furthermore ferric sludge also promoted biomass protein and cytochrome c increasing the abundance of microorganisms that can reduce both cr vi and fe iii this study provided a new approach for fenton ferric sludge treatment and cr vi bioreduction enhancement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
