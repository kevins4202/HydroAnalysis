12575,chitosan copper oxide nanoparticles npcs cuo are widely used in various applications such as antimicrobial catalysis drug delivery and nanotheranostics in this study the structures and antibacterial properties of chitosan cuo nanocomposites is systematically investigated npcs cuo was synthesized via hybrid ionic gelation ultrasonication methods by means of solution mixing of copper oxide npcuo and chitosan nanoparticles npcs with citrate ion as a crosslinker the synthesized npcs cuo were characterized by particle size analyzer psa fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd and antibacterial activity tests the synthesized npcs cuo has the smallest particle size of 195 3 nm with a polydispersity index pdi of 0 972 at the mass ratio of 30 0 005 correspond to npcs and npcuo respectively the interaction between cs and crosslinker predominantly occurred via hydrogen bonding of nh and co moieties while interaction of npcs and npcuo took place via chelation between co and cuo functional groups as confirmed by ftir spectra the x ray diffraction patterns revealed that the addition of npcuo remarkably increased the crystallinity and in contrast reduced the crystallite size of npcs the npcs cuo exhibited superior antibacterial efficacy toward e coli s aureus and p aeruginosa bacteria strains than that of npcs where the maximum zone of inhibition and bacteria killing ratio reached up to 16 mm and 100 respectively however it showed the inferiority toward b subtilis and s typhi bacteria strains these behaviors strongly controlled by the nature of each bacterial strain further studies in advanced characterizations and applications of npcs cuo as antibacterial agent is under investigation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hybrid methods npcs cuo antibacterial activity chitosan morphology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity due to the improper exploitation of natural water resources escalates the needs of water reclamation the safety of reclaimed water remains the important issues since the industrial effluent and domestic sewage water as the source of raw water still contain a large number of microorganism after secondary treatment the spread of pathogenic microorganism contained in the reclaimed water such as coliforms enterococcus and pseudomonas 1 leads to the infectious disease in order to control the microbial contamination in the water treatment disinfection procedures are applied in the water treatment process the general disinfection procedure is using the chemical sterilization approach which relies on adding chemical bactericides such ozone quaternary ammonium salt and quaternary phosphonium salt to water to address the issues of microbial contamination however throughout the water treatment process the majority of these conventional chemical disinfectants can produce toxic disinfection by products dbps 2 therefore the environmental friendly and biocompatible antibacterial agent is necessary for the water disinfection chitosan cs is a cationic biopolymer obtained from deacetylation of chitin from the structural components of crustaceans and arthropod shells through a thermochemical reaction 3 it exhibited exceptional properties such as good film formation adhesion ability non toxic and biocompatible 4 the hydroxyl and amine functional group of cs play an important role in wide area such as biomedical antibacterial wastewater treatment ion exchange and functional matrices for industries 5 the cationic properties of cs allows interaction with anionic materials which led to the fabrication of several nanoparticle np systems 6 chitosan nanoparticles npcs have advanced physical chemical and antibacterial properties due to the nature of nanoparticles such as small size high surface area and quantum size effect that makes npcs possess a better penetration ability in tissues and cells 7 8 thus the development of low cost npcs has become a great of interest for various applications 9 the stability of cs based antibacterial materials is affected by the environmental conditions such as temperature ph and salinity 10 the formation of npcs can remarkably increase the stability and activity of cs based antibacterial materials 11 previous work reported that npcs have a strong adhesive capacity to a wide variety of solid substrates and can interact with metal ions via amine and hydroxyl groups 12 the composites of chitosan graphene oxides was reported to be applied in the wastewater treatment as disinfecting agents 13 in addition the integration of various metal oxides into npcs demonstrates more exceptional antibacterial properties 14 among metal nps copper oxide npcuo nanoparticles are promising as antibacterial agent due to its superior antimicrobial properties and low cost production than other metal oxides 15 several studies have reported the use of npcs cuo as an antibacterial agents in the food biomedical pharmaceutical and medical industries due to its good mechanical and antibacterial properties 16 18 chitosan nanoparticle can be synthesized through several methods such as ionic gelation 6 emulsification and crosslinking 19 reversed micelles 20 phase inversion precipitation emulsion droplet coalescence 21 radical polymerization 22 self assembly 23 acid hydrolysis 24 and spray drying 25 however those methods have some drawbacks such as the use of harmful chemicals time consuming complex application hard to control in a large scale and the specific requirement of system characteristic as well as equipment that should be fulfilled 26 development of a facile and more efficient synthesis method of npcs cuo that requires low energy and precursor composition on the other hand effectively controls the nps formation and its stability therefore remains challenging among the synthesize methods that applicable for chitosan nanoparticle production ionic gelation is a facile and efficient techniques due to the use of mild chemicals simple process and easy to control the nanoparticle size 27 the npcs can be synthesized via the ionic gelation method with an aid of counter ions as crosslinkers such as sodium tripolyphosphate na tpp and sodium citrate sc via high complex formation 28 and ability to control the particle size of the synthesized npcs 29 30 this method offers advantages for synthesizing npcs since it can be carried out at the diluted aqueous solutions ease to control reaction conditions and the particle size and applicable for encapsulating various molecules 30 several methods are commonly used to incorporate metal oxide nanoparticle into chitosan matrix such as microwave assisted 31 in situ polymerization 32 co precipitation 33 and ultrasonication 34 ultrasonication method offers the relatively simple and low cost method compared to the others 35 additionally the ultrasonication technique can accelerate the formation of composite npcs metal oxides and produce the uniform size of nanoparticle 36 37 in this study the synthesis of chitosan copper oxide nanoparticles npcs cuo was carried out via hybrid ionic gelation ultrasonication methods the characteristics of the as synthesized npcs cuo as well as its antibacterial activity were systematically investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials

including pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa atcc 9027 escherichia coli e coli atcc 8939 and staphylococcus aureus s aureus atcc 6538 were employed to perform the antibacterial studies 2 2 methods 2 2 1 synthesis of npcuo the npcuo was synthesized via a facile co precipitation method briefly 0 5 g of cuso4 5h2o was dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water then 0 1 m naoh was added dropwise under vigorous stirring until the ph of the solution reached 14 at this stage a black precipitate was formed thereafter the precipitate was separated from the solution by centrifugation at 5000 rpm 30 min and washed with ethanol water solution 10 90 v v the resultant precipitate was then dried at 110 c for 4 h and followed by calcination in a furnace at 600 c for 8 h 2 2 2 synthesis of npcs a 0 6 mg ml cs solution was prepared by dissolving 0 03 g of cs in 50 ml of 1 acetic acid solution the ph solution was then adjusted to 3 5 using 0 5 m naoh solution under rapid stirring using a magnetic stirrer at 25 c for 1 h the npcs was spontaneously obtained by the dropping of the sc solution 15 to 50 ml of 0 6 mg ml sc the mixture was stirred 700 rpm 1 5 h 25 c to obtain the npcs dispersion 2 2 3 synthesis of npcs cuo a 0 01 mg ml of cuo suspension was synthesized by dispersing 0 1 mg cuo in 10 ml of distilled water under sonication for 3 h 200 w 40 khz the cuo solution with concentration of 0 005 and 0 001 mg ml were prepared by dilution from its starting concentration at 0 01 mg ml and sonicated for 3 h 200 w 40 khz the npcs cuo was prepared by adding cuo suspension into 0 6 mg ml cs sc solution with total volume of 50 ml then sonicated for 1 5 h 200 w 40 khz the suspension was then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 30 min where the mass ratio of npcs and sc were kept constant 30 9 mg while the npcuo loading was varied i e 0 01 0 0075 and 0 005 mg denoted as npcs cuo 1 npcs cuo 2 npcs cuo 3 respectively 2 2 4 physicochemical properties characterization the particle size of synthesized npcs cuo was measured by dynamic light scattering dls technique using the zetasizer nano zs malvern malvern panalytical almelo the netherlands morphology of npcs cuo was observed using sem phenom pure g6 bruker the ftir spectra of npcs npcuo and npcs cuo were measured in the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 at room temperature using the ftir spectrometer shimadzu 8400 the crystallinity and molecular organization of npcs cuo were studied using x ray diffractometer rigaku d max 2500 cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm 50 kv 300 ma the thermal stability of npcs cuo was evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis tga shimadzu dtg 60h at a temperature range 25 c to 650 c heating ramp of 10 c min a flow rate of 15 ml min using uhp ultra high purity nitrogen gas 2 2 5 antibacterial activity test the antibacterial activities of npcs npcuo and npcs cuo against three bacteria strains i e p aeruginosa e coli and s aureus were determined using kirby bauer and bacteria killing ratio bkr methods all the tools and culture media were sterilized at the temperature of 121 c for 1 h the nanocomposite samples were sterilized under uv light for 15 min a total of 40 ml of nutrient agar na media was put into a sterile petri dish until it solidifies an aseptic swab stick was dipped into the bacterial inoculum and then streaked following the lawn etching method onto the solid surface of the agar until it was evenly distributed the dispersed nanocomposite sample 10 and 20 mg ml was immersed in a sterile disc then drained and placed on agar in a petri dish that had been inoculated with bacteria sterile discs were dipped in sterile 1 acetic acid and placed on agar as a negative control sterile discs were dipped in standard antibiotic chloramphenicol with a concentration of 500 ppm and placed on agar as a positive control the inoculated petri dishes were then incubated in an incubator at 37 c for 16 24 h in a downwards orientation after completion of incubation the inhibition zone diameter or clear zone around the disc was measured the bkr test was carried out by a total plate count tpc method a total of 10 μl of nanocomposite suspension was added into a test tube together with 10 μl of bacterial suspension then this small amount of mixture was left in quiescent condition for slow mixing purpose for 30 min exactly 10 ml of sterile distilled water was added into the same test tube and homogenized using a vortex mixer the dilution was continued until 105 times by using nb dispersion at each dilution step 1 ml of the solution was transferred into 5 sterile petri dishes by using a micropipette subsequently 9 ml of na was poured into a petri dish and stirred slowly then allowed to solidify petri dishes were incubated in an incubator at 37 c for 24 and 48 h face down after 24 and 48 h the bacterial colonies formed on the agar medium in a petri dish were counted then the bkr was also calculated from the ratio between the number colonies formed in the positive control nb and in the sample ns using eq 1 38 1 bacteria killing ratio n b n s n b 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle size of npcs cuo the dynamic light scattering dls method provides information of the average hydrodynamic size and polydispersity index pdi of the synthesized npcs cuo composites the optimum particle size distribution of the npcs cuo 3 composite based on intensity volume and number average are shown in fig 1 while those for other composites are presented in fig s1 the z average diameter sometimes call the cumulate mean is used for the analysis of monodisperse or narrow distributions since the particle size of the synthesized nanoparticle has broader size distribution the intensity size distribution was obtained based upon the intensity of light scattered by particles this size distribution interpretation is sensitive to the presence of large particles aggregates therefore particle size by volume and number were derived from the intensity distribution using mie theory particle size by volume equivalent to the mass or weight distribution particle size by number is ideally chosen when the technique measures individual particles 39 particle size analysis revealed a large non symmetric distribution for all samples at different sizes regarding intensity npcs cuo 1 has a unimodal distribution fig 1a while the npcs cuo 2 and npcs cuo 3 have multimodal distribution fig 1a it may be due to the cs amine group was deprotonated then led to hydrophobic interactions since the polymer was in an entangled state resulting in npcs cuo having irregular dimensions 80 since intensity average is also very sensitive and biased toward the present of large aggregation due to scattering principle which dependent on the sixth power of the particle radius hence the intensity average always skewed toward largest size the distribution of npcs cuo particle size at higher mass ratio was found at particle size beyond 400 nm due to the larger number of agglomerated npcs cuo however the particle size distribution of npcs cuo has smallest particle size around 200 nm at lower npcuo composition this result indicated that the particle size of npcs cuo strongly depend on the mass ratio of npcs npcuo where the smaller npcuo amount in the composite the smaller particle size of npcs cuo obtained it also can be inferred that amount of npcuo in the composites controls the formation of nanoparticle through chelation table 1 presents that the particle size of npcs cuo decreases with the reduction in the npcuo ratio where npcs cuo 3 has the smallest average particle size of 195 3 nm with the largest pdi value of 0 972 numerically the higher the pdi the larger the non uniformity and the wider range of particle size distribution 40 and such description is consistent with our results shown in fig 1 the increase in the pdi value could be due to the precipitation that may occurred due to the nature of chitosan which is easily agglomerated 81 ultrasonication is capable to break down particle aggregates however agglomeration can still occur in a prolonged ultrasonication process this means that the ultrasonication time and power determine the uniformity of nanocomposite particle size 41 on the other hand the particle size distribution by number demonstrates that npcs cuo 3 has the smallest particle size compared to that other composition where the largest particle size distribution is of 4 052 nm such observation indicated that most of the particles are small in sizes and the large size and size range found in the intensity average are mainly caused by the presence of particle aggregates the agglomerated nanoparticles having larger particle sizes contribute significantly to the determination of the average particle size of nanoparticles however the number of particles size exceed from 100 nm amounted to be 8 5 based on the number average data however it should be realized that the intensity average is consider the raw data fitted to the autocorrelation function of the scattering measurement and should be used as the main reference data set compared to other results the synthesized npcs cuo has a smallest size this may be due to the use of sc as a crosslinker which has a high chelating potential 28 which can chelate cu metal atoms so that it can produce smaller particles size the previous result reported that the particle size of npcs cuo was around 550 nm by number where the tripolyphosphate tpp was used as crosslinker at a cs cuo mass ratio of 0 025 50 42 meanwhile another study reported the average size of npcs cuo was 215 nm at cs cuo mass ratio of 2 1 without using a crosslinker 43 these results inferred that the particle size is strongly influenced by the mass ratio of npcs npcuo as well as the type of crosslinker used in addition it can be mentioned that the hybrid methods of ionic gelation and ultrasonication effectively control the particle size of nanoparticles 3 2 structures of npcs cuo nanocomposites based on sem images fig s2 agglomerated npcs demonstrated the smooth and flatten surface while npcuo exhibited irregular cubic like structure shape interestingly the agglomerated npcs cuo represented the uneven surface as a result of the npcuo incorporation in the npcs matrix in addition the deposition of npcuo was not observed on the composite surface indicating the homogenous dispersion of cuo in the npcs matrix however these sem images could not provide the information of particle size of composites to confirm the results obtained from psa the ftir spectra provide information on the functional group and molecular fingerprint of cs and sc in npcs and npcs cuo composites the ftir spectra of cs sc npcs cuso4 5h2o npcuo npcs cuo 1 npcs cuo 2 and npcs cuo 3 are presented in fig s3 and fig 2 fig s3a shows the presence of so4 group in the ftir spectrum of cuso4 5h2o which was indicated by absorption peaks of so vibration at 619 and 872 cm 1 44 in contrast the npcuo ftir spectrum indicates no so vibration peak in addition the absorption peaks at 519 and 598 cm 1 demonstrate the vibration mode of cuo bond 12 confirming the formation of npcuo 45 the absorption peaks at wavenumber of 1665 3214 and 3383 cm 1 in the cuso4 ftir spectrum correspond to the bending and stretching vibrations of hoh respectively 44 46 in addition a peak shift was found at 3439 cm 1 associated with the stretching vibration of oh from water molecules in the cuso4 5h2o furthermore the ftir spectrum of npcuo demonstrates the absorption bands at 1634 and 1711 cm 1 indicating the stretching vibration of co from the carboxylic ion that bound to cuo as a bidentate ligand 47 48 in addition the absorption peak at 1227 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the co group 49 these peaks strongly reveal the formation of npcuo however the residual ethanol solvent still can be observed in the npcuo sample as indicated by the absorption peak at 1049 cm 1 and 1101 cm 1 that corresponds to the stretching vibration of the coh and the bending vibration of the oh groups respectively 44 45 these results indicate the successful synthesis of the cuo from cuso4 h2o via co precipitation method the ftir spectra of cs and npcs fig s3b demonstrate a broad absorption peak at 3356 cm 1 that corresponds to the vibrational stretching of the oh and nh groups of primary amines and type ii amides of cs which are located in the same region 50 for the case of npcs the stretching vibrations of the nh2 and oh groups were indicated by an absorption peak of 3445 cm 1 with a larger intensity 28 from these observations it is very likely that the hydrogen bonds in the nh2 and oh groups have been decreased due to the interaction between cs and sc molecules additionally a weak absorption peak at 2871 cm 1 corresponds to the ch stretching vibration 51 on the other hand the absorption peak at 2970 and 2870 cm 1 correspond to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of ch2 from sc respectively 52 whereas the stretching vibration of ch2 from npcs was observed at absorption peak of 2928 cm 1 28 the absorption peaks at 1651 and 1585 cm 1 derived from co stretching and nh bending vibrations of amide i and amide ii of cs respectively 51 a widening and shift peak to 1630 cm 1 indicates an interaction between the nh2 group in cs and o atoms in the sc that occurs during the crosslinking process 28 predominantly via hydrogen bonding in addition the absorption peaks at 1315 and 1151 cm 1 derived from the cn of type i amines and the coc asymmetric stretching vibrations of the cs saccharide structure 53 the absorption peak at 1597 and 1397 cm 1 exhibits the asymmetric and symmetrical coo stretching vibrations respectively 52 meanwhile co symmetrical vibrations of coo ions in npcs appeared in sharp peaks at 1385 cm 1 54 the absorption peak at 1026 cm 1 comes from for the stretching vibration of the co group on the cs polysaccharide ring 55 this peak becomes widening to 1084 cm 1 in case of npcs all these results have indirectly demonstrated that the npcs was successfully synthesized via ionic gelation method fig 2 shows the peak shifts and new peaks appearance in the npcs cuo spectra the peak shifts can be seen in the cs spectrum where stretching vibrations of the nh and oh groups observed at the absorption peak of 3445 cm 1 12 the peak shifts to 3439 3437 and 3435 cm 1 confirmed the interaction between npcs and npcuo in all npcs cuo sample series respectively 56 the absorption peak at 1630 cm 1 in npcs cuo ftir spectrum is due to the nh bending vibration of the protonated amine group of npcs 57 the absorption of npcs cuo in the range of 1701 1713 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of co 47 which allows chelation between sc and cuo the co and co peaks at all npcs cuo series experienced shifting where the smaller npcs cuo particle the sharper the absorption peak and is due to the larger contact of surface area in case of npcs cuo the absorption peak at 1366 1383 cm 1 indicated the presence of a ch bending vibration ch3 symmetrical deformation 57 59 while the absorption at 1078 1223 cm 1 indicates the stretching vibration of the polysaccharide chain functional groups cn and co 49 56 the effect of cuo interaction with the cs backbone is clearly demonstrated by a remarkable change in the cs finger print area with ir absorption at 532 cm 1 which shows the cuo stretching vibration of the cuo monoclinic phase 60 61 this result also confirms the incorporation of npcuo in npcs 16 43 56 57 based on the ftir spectra it can be suggested that npcuo has been incorporated into the npcs matrix through a chelation mechanism by the co group of the citrate ion or from the un deacetylated chitosan side chain with cu ion from npcuo another mechanism of cu ion chelation may also occur with the free nh and oh groups of chitosan which do not interact with the crosslinker as indicated by the ftir results described above the possible mode of interaction in npcs cuo is pictorially illustrated in fig 3 3 3 characteristic of npcs cuo nanocomposite the x ray diffraction patterns provide the information of crystallinity of npcs cuo composites fig 4 the xrd pattern of cuso4 h5o fig 4 demonstrates the diffraction peaks at 15 43 18 72 22 25 29 05 31 14 and 32 48 that correspond to 111 021 110 and 122 crystal lattice planes fig 4b demonstrates the typical x ray diffraction pattern of npcuo which correspond to a monoclinic diffraction pattern at 2θ between 35 5 and 38 7 derived from combination of multiple reflections 002 and 200 indicating a tenorite structure and is in good agreement with jcpds data no 41 0254 using scherrer s equation and plane reflection 002 the crystallite size of synthesized npcuo was calculated to be 22 26 nm meanwhile the x ray diffraction pattern of npcs exhibits a broad peak with higher intensity at around 20 29 correspond to 110 lattice semicrystalline plane of cs 62 82 other diffraction peaks at 26 61 and 29 37 are multireflection of semicrystals of amine i n co ch3 and amine ii nh2 respectively 63 in case of npcs cuo it demonstrates the combination of diffraction peaks derived from npcuo and npcs where the peak shifts were clearly observed the crystallinity and crystallite size l of the npcs cuo composite were calculated using the debye scherrer equation table s1 npcs cuo composite has the largest full width half maximum fwhm and the smallest crystal size resulting in an increase in the crystallinity of the composite 64 regarding table s1 the crystallite size of synthesized npcuo and npcs cuo were smaller compared to the original precursors 20 nm these results suggest that the addition of npcuo into npcs has increased the crystallinity of nanocomposites 3 4 thermal stability of npcs cuo thermogravimetry differential analysis tga profile can be used to describe the thermal stability of nanocomposites this analysis is based on the amount of mass loss weight loss and component degradation in the composite as a function of temperature fig 5 demonstrates two stages of degradation where the first phase of degradation corresponds to the water and co2 decomposition and the second degradation phase corresponds to the breakdown of sc cs crosslinking bond polysaccharide complex degradation in cs depolymerization and polymer deacetylation decomposition 65 the weight loss for each composite is presented in table s2 the result indicated that the incorporation of npcuo improves the thermal stability of npcs in the composite system 3 5 antibacterial activity the bacteria strains used in this study were gram positive s aureus and gram negative bacteria e coli and p aeruginosa these bacteria were found as the main microorganisms contaminant in water and wastewater that have pathogenic properties which can cause various of infections and diseases 66 67 fig 6 shows the kirby bauer results of synthesized nanocomposites the diameter of inhibition zone zoi of npcs cuo increases as the increase of npcuo amount in the composite for all bacterial strain the addition of npcuo concentration improve the antibacterial activity of nanocomposites npcs cuo 1 exhibited the most outstanding inhibition properties among the synthesized nanoparticle with zoi up to 19 35 s aureus 19 45 e coli and 17 3 mm p aeruginosa only by employing 10 mg ml of the nanocomposites at this concentration the synthesized npcs crosslinked with sc also exhibit the inhibition capability even though it is smaller than that of npcs cuo 11 75 12 26 and 13 6 mm for s aureus e coli and p aeruginosa respectively this concentration is lower compare to the reported minimum inhibition concentration of other synthesized npcs with other crosslinking agents from the previous studies 6 68 which shows that the zone of inhibition of s aureus and e coli can be observed starting from the concentration of 30 mg ml and for p aeruginosa starting from 40 mg ml hence the dosage needed for the synthesized npcs as well as npcs cuo to inhibit the bacterial activity is lower the zone of inhibition in npcuo also increased with increasing concentration but the zone of inhibition of the npcs cuo nanocomposite system was higher than that of npcuo even with the same concentration contained in the composite system npcs cuo 1 which has the most npcuo content shows a larger inhibition zone this reflects that the addition of npcuo significantly increase the antibacterial activity of npcs the antibacterial activity of npcuo toward gram negative bacteria is slightly more powerful compared to the gram positive bacteria 14 3 and 14 55 mm for e coli and p aeruginosa respectively 13 9 mm for s aureus at the concentration of 0 01 mg ml indicating that the antibacterial activity of npcs and npcs cuo toward each bacterial strain has different mechanisms the type bacterial strains have different characteristic of functional groups on the cell surface so that the mechanism of bacterial inhibition is also different 16 fig 7 shows the bacteria killing ratio of npcs and npcs cuo composites with an obvious increment in bkr as the composite concentration increases the increase in antibacterial activity was also directly proportional to the addition of cuo to the nanocomposite moreover bkr of npcuo also increased with increasing concentration up to 70 67 71 73 and 61 76 for s aureus e coli and p aeruginosa respectively based on this result s aureus strain is more susceptible toward npcuo the bkr of npcs cuo composite was higher than that of npcuo at the same concentration contained in the composite system with bkr of 89 33 85 62 and 86 14 for s aureus e coli and p aeruginosa respectively by using npcs cuo 1 at 10 mg ml at higher concentration 20 mg ml the bkr of the synthesized nanocomposite exhibit almost similar bkr for all of bacterial strain in the range of 90 this is in line with the results of the kirby bauer test where gram negative bacteria are indeed more resistant than gram positive bacteria based on the antibacterial activity test results npcs also possess antibacterial properties the presence of charged groups in the cs backbone active oxygen and nitrogen can interact strongly with the bacterial wall constituents and induce intracellular electrolyte leakage this impairment of membrane integrity leads to the decrease of bacterial viability 69 70 the antibacterial action of chitosan can be highly diminished at certain ph due to the deprotonation of amine group and the decrease of solubility 71 therefore the modification of chitosan is necessary to improve its activity npcuo is one of nanoparticle that also performed as antibacterial agent the major toxicological mechanism of npcuo for bacterial cell is the formation of reactive oxygen species ros and released it as radicals such as oh and o2 which can penetrate into bacteria cellular and lead to damage of its component such as dna lipids peptidoglycan and protein 72 these ros are capable to oxidize the double bonds in phospholipids thus increase the membrane viscosity which makes cells more vulnerable to osmotic stress 73 the antibacterial activity of npcuo can also be caused by the cu2 release which enable to form complexes compounds in the bacteria leads to the damage of cell walls and proteins in addition cu2 alters the dna structure avoiding bacterial reproduction 74 the synergistic action of npcuo and npcs exhibited better antibacterial and antibiofilm activity 14 16 the possible mechanism of antibacterial activity of npcs and npcs cuo can be explained based on the existing literature as follow bacterial surface having negative charged attract the nanoparticles positively charged through electrostatic interactions after that the nanoparticles attack the bacterial cell wall then enter the cell membrane as a result of leaking and damage to its constituents 16 moreover npcuo will be penetrated through the impaired cell wall and damage the cell constituent the cu2 ion is predicted to be incorporated in the nanocomposite matrix via chelating mechanism with the bond length of 3 018 å fig 3 which is relatively long and loose this promotes the easier cu2 release and increase the antibacterial properties based on figs 6 and 7 npcs and npcs cuo is more effective to constrain gram positive bacteria s aureus while the pristine npcuo is slightly more effective to gram negative bacteria e coli and p aeruginosa this is due to the difference of cell membrane construction of bacteria the gram positive bacteria cell wall is enriched with peptidoglycan layers that promotes the nh3 from chitosan to adsorb on the cell wall and penetrate through the cell 75 76 the cell membrane of gram negative bacteria do not have this special layer thus the npcuo will be easier to penetrate the cell membrane npcs also act as the nutrition flow inhibitor outer the cell membrane of gram negative bacteria 7 71 the synergic inhibition mechanism of npcs and npcuo can expand the antibacterial efficacy spectrum to different bacterial strain the acceptable mechanism antibacterial inhibition of npcs cuo through gram positive and gram negative bacteria is illustrated in fig 8 based on fig 7 the npcs and npcs cuo exhibit the superior antibacterial activity where it effectively killed the used bacteria strains with almost 100 efficiency at the concentration of 30 mg ml the almost similar effect for all of the bacterial strain is due to the high osmotic pressure of antibacterial agent dispersion which is not suitable for the cell viability 77 the particle size of antibacterial agent also significantly affects its antibacterial activity this is due to the unique physicochemical properties of nanoparticles such as large surface area to volume ratio providing more cationic sites and high reactivity thereby potentially increasing charge interactions on the microbial surface and causing a superior antibacterial effect 78 the npcs cuo synthesized through ionic gelation ultrasonication using sc as crosslinking agent in this study still exhibit better antibacterial activity compared to other chitosan cuo antibacterial agents table s3 where the composite was in the suspension form that could a benefit for application subsequently the additional solvent is not necessary t in addition since the npcuo ratio to npcs composite was quite low 0 005 0 01 mg to 30 mg which is lower than the limit of viable concentration through the human pulmonary epithelial cell 0 05 mg ml 79 the potential adverse effect that may toxic to some aquatic life can be avoided the incorporation of cuo to npcs can limit the dosage of cuo as antibacterial agent and provide a synergistic effect to inhibit the bacterial activity 4 conclusions the npcs cuo composites have successfully synthesized by mixing the npcuo and npcs solutions in water with sodium citrates crosslinker via hybrid ionic gelation at 25 c for 2 h followed by ultrasonication 200 w 40 khz npcs cuo was prepared in mass ratio of npcs npcuo 30 0 005 30 0 0075 and 30 0 01 in ch3cooh 1 at ph 3 5 this technique provides the simple and fast method to synthesize npcs cuo without involving a lot of chemicals and low energy used the synthesized npcs cuo has the smallest averaged hydrodynamics size of 195 nm with a pdi of 0 972 obtained at optimum composition ratio of npcs cuo of 30 0 005 the ftir spectra confirmed the interaction between cs and crosslinker predominantly occurred via hydrogen bonding of nh and co moieties while interaction of npcs and npcuo took place via chelation between co and cuo functional groups the addition of npcuo remarkably increased the crystallinity and in contrast reduced the crystallite size of npcs the npcs cuo exhibited superior antibacterial efficacy toward e coli s aureus and p aeruginosa bacteria strains than that of npcs

12575,chitosan copper oxide nanoparticles npcs cuo are widely used in various applications such as antimicrobial catalysis drug delivery and nanotheranostics in this study the structures and antibacterial properties of chitosan cuo nanocomposites is systematically investigated npcs cuo was synthesized via hybrid ionic gelation ultrasonication methods by means of solution mixing of copper oxide npcuo and chitosan nanoparticles npcs with citrate ion as a crosslinker the synthesized npcs cuo were characterized by particle size analyzer psa fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd and antibacterial activity tests the synthesized npcs cuo has the smallest particle size of 195 3 nm with a polydispersity index pdi of 0 972 at the mass ratio of 30 0 005 correspond to npcs and npcuo respectively the interaction between cs and crosslinker predominantly occurred via hydrogen bonding of nh and co moieties while interaction of npcs and npcuo took place via chelation between co and cuo functional groups as confirmed by ftir spectra the x ray diffraction patterns revealed that the addition of npcuo remarkably increased the crystallinity and in contrast reduced the crystallite size of npcs the npcs cuo exhibited superior antibacterial efficacy toward e coli s aureus and p aeruginosa bacteria strains than that of npcs where the maximum zone of inhibition and bacteria killing ratio reached up to 16 mm and 100 respectively however it showed the inferiority toward b subtilis and s typhi bacteria strains these behaviors strongly controlled by the nature of each bacterial strain further studies in advanced characterizations and applications of npcs cuo as antibacterial agent is under investigation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hybrid methods npcs cuo antibacterial activity chitosan morphology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity due to the improper exploitation of natural water resources escalates the needs of water reclamation the safety of reclaimed water remains the important issues since the industrial effluent and domestic sewage water as the source of raw water still contain a large number of microorganism after secondary treatment the spread of pathogenic microorganism contained in the reclaimed water such as coliforms enterococcus and pseudomonas 1 leads to the infectious disease in order to control the microbial contamination in the water treatment disinfection procedures are applied in the water treatment process the general disinfection procedure is using the chemical sterilization approach which relies on adding chemical bactericides such ozone quaternary ammonium salt and quaternary phosphonium salt to water to address the issues of microbial contamination however throughout the water treatment process the majority of these conventional chemical disinfectants can produce toxic disinfection by products dbps 2 therefore the environmental friendly and biocompatible antibacterial agent is necessary for the water disinfection chitosan cs is a cationic biopolymer obtained from deacetylation of chitin from the structural components of crustaceans and arthropod shells through a thermochemical reaction 3 it exhibited exceptional properties such as good film formation adhesion ability non toxic and biocompatible 4 the hydroxyl and amine functional group of cs play an important role in wide area such as biomedical antibacterial wastewater treatment ion exchange and functional matrices for industries 5 the cationic properties of cs allows interaction with anionic materials which led to the fabrication of several nanoparticle np systems 6 chitosan nanoparticles npcs have advanced physical chemical and antibacterial properties due to the nature of nanoparticles such as small size high surface area and quantum size effect that makes npcs possess a better penetration ability in tissues and cells 7 8 thus the development of low cost npcs has become a great of interest for various applications 9 the stability of cs based antibacterial materials is affected by the environmental conditions such as temperature ph and salinity 10 the formation of npcs can remarkably increase the stability and activity of cs based antibacterial materials 11 previous work reported that npcs have a strong adhesive capacity to a wide variety of solid substrates and can interact with metal ions via amine and hydroxyl groups 12 the composites of chitosan graphene oxides was reported to be applied in the wastewater treatment as disinfecting agents 13 in addition the integration of various metal oxides into npcs demonstrates more exceptional antibacterial properties 14 among metal nps copper oxide npcuo nanoparticles are promising as antibacterial agent due to its superior antimicrobial properties and low cost production than other metal oxides 15 several studies have reported the use of npcs cuo as an antibacterial agents in the food biomedical pharmaceutical and medical industries due to its good mechanical and antibacterial properties 16 18 chitosan nanoparticle can be synthesized through several methods such as ionic gelation 6 emulsification and crosslinking 19 reversed micelles 20 phase inversion precipitation emulsion droplet coalescence 21 radical polymerization 22 self assembly 23 acid hydrolysis 24 and spray drying 25 however those methods have some drawbacks such as the use of harmful chemicals time consuming complex application hard to control in a large scale and the specific requirement of system characteristic as well as equipment that should be fulfilled 26 development of a facile and more efficient synthesis method of npcs cuo that requires low energy and precursor composition on the other hand effectively controls the nps formation and its stability therefore remains challenging among the synthesize methods that applicable for chitosan nanoparticle production ionic gelation is a facile and efficient techniques due to the use of mild chemicals simple process and easy to control the nanoparticle size 27 the npcs can be synthesized via the ionic gelation method with an aid of counter ions as crosslinkers such as sodium tripolyphosphate na tpp and sodium citrate sc via high complex formation 28 and ability to control the particle size of the synthesized npcs 29 30 this method offers advantages for synthesizing npcs since it can be carried out at the diluted aqueous solutions ease to control reaction conditions and the particle size and applicable for encapsulating various molecules 30 several methods are commonly used to incorporate metal oxide nanoparticle into chitosan matrix such as microwave assisted 31 in situ polymerization 32 co precipitation 33 and ultrasonication 34 ultrasonication method offers the relatively simple and low cost method compared to the others 35 additionally the ultrasonication technique can accelerate the formation of composite npcs metal oxides and produce the uniform size of nanoparticle 36 37 in this study the synthesis of chitosan copper oxide nanoparticles npcs cuo was carried out via hybrid ionic gelation ultrasonication methods the characteristics of the as synthesized npcs cuo as well as its antibacterial activity were systematically investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials

including pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa atcc 9027 escherichia coli e coli atcc 8939 and staphylococcus aureus s aureus atcc 6538 were employed to perform the antibacterial studies 2 2 methods 2 2 1 synthesis of npcuo the npcuo was synthesized via a facile co precipitation method briefly 0 5 g of cuso4 5h2o was dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water then 0 1 m naoh was added dropwise under vigorous stirring until the ph of the solution reached 14 at this stage a black precipitate was formed thereafter the precipitate was separated from the solution by centrifugation at 5000 rpm 30 min and washed with ethanol water solution 10 90 v v the resultant precipitate was then dried at 110 c for 4 h and followed by calcination in a furnace at 600 c for 8 h 2 2 2 synthesis of npcs a 0 6 mg ml cs solution was prepared by dissolving 0 03 g of cs in 50 ml of 1 acetic acid solution the ph solution was then adjusted to 3 5 using 0 5 m naoh solution under rapid stirring using a magnetic stirrer at 25 c for 1 h the npcs was spontaneously obtained by the dropping of the sc solution 15 to 50 ml of 0 6 mg ml sc the mixture was stirred 700 rpm 1 5 h 25 c to obtain the npcs dispersion 2 2 3 synthesis of npcs cuo a 0 01 mg ml of cuo suspension was synthesized by dispersing 0 1 mg cuo in 10 ml of distilled water under sonication for 3 h 200 w 40 khz the cuo solution with concentration of 0 005 and 0 001 mg ml were prepared by dilution from its starting concentration at 0 01 mg ml and sonicated for 3 h 200 w 40 khz the npcs cuo was prepared by adding cuo suspension into 0 6 mg ml cs sc solution with total volume of 50 ml then sonicated for 1 5 h 200 w 40 khz the suspension was then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 30 min where the mass ratio of npcs and sc were kept constant 30 9 mg while the npcuo loading was varied i e 0 01 0 0075 and 0 005 mg denoted as npcs cuo 1 npcs cuo 2 npcs cuo 3 respectively 2 2 4 physicochemical properties characterization the particle size of

phenom pure g6 bruker the ftir spectra of npcs npcuo and npcs cuo were measured in the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 at room temperature using the ftir spectrometer shimadzu 8400 the crystallinity and molecular organization of npcs cuo were studied using x ray diffractometer rigaku d max 2500 cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm 50 kv 300 ma the thermal stability of npcs cuo was evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis tga shimadzu dtg 60h at a temperature range 25 c to 650 c heating ramp of 10 c min a flow rate of 15 ml min using uhp ultra high purity nitrogen gas 2 2 5 antibacterial activity test the antibacterial activities of npcs npcuo and npcs cuo against three bacteria strains i e p aeruginosa e coli and s aureus were determined using kirby bauer and bacteria killing ratio bkr methods all the tools and culture media were sterilized at the temperature of 121 c for 1 h the nanocomposite samples were sterilized under uv light for 15 min a total of 40 ml of nutrient agar na media was put into a sterile petri dish until it solidifies an aseptic swab stick was dipped into the bacterial inoculum and then streaked following the lawn etching method onto the solid surface of the agar until it was evenly distributed the dispersed nanocomposite sample 10 and 20 mg ml was immersed in a sterile disc then drained and placed on agar in a petri dish that had been inoculated with bacteria sterile discs were dipped in sterile 1 acetic acid and placed on agar as a negative control sterile discs were dipped in standard antibiotic chloramphenicol with a concentration of 500 ppm and placed on agar as a positive control the inoculated petri dishes were then incubated in an incubator at 37 c for 16 24 h in a downwards orientation after completion of incubation the inhibition zone diameter or clear zone around the disc was measured the bkr test was carried out by a total plate count tpc method a total of 10 μl of nanocomposite suspension was added into a test tube together with 10 μl of bacterial suspension then this small amount of mixture was left in quiescent condition for slow mixing purpose for 30 min exactly 10 ml of sterile distilled water was added into the same test tube and homogenized using a vortex mixer the dilution was continued until 105 times by using nb dispersion at each dilution step 1 ml of the solution was transferred into 5 sterile petri dishes

control nb and in the sample ns using eq 1 38 1 bacteria killing ratio n b n s n b 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle size of npcs cuo the dynamic light scattering dls method provides information of the average hydrodynamic size and polydispersity index pdi of the synthesized npcs cuo composites the optimum particle size distribution of the npcs cuo 3 composite based on intensity volume and number average are shown in fig 1 while those for other composites are presented in fig s1 the z average diameter sometimes call the cumulate mean is used for the analysis of monodisperse or narrow distributions since the particle size of the synthesized nanoparticle has broader size distribution the intensity size distribution was obtained based upon the intensity of light scattered by particles this size distribution interpretation is sensitive to the presence of large particles aggregates therefore particle size by volume and number were derived from the intensity distribution using mie theory particle size by volume equivalent to the mass or weight distribution particle size by number is ideally chosen when the technique measures individual particles 39 particle size analysis revealed a large non symmetric distribution for all samples at different sizes regarding intensity npcs cuo 1 has a unimodal distribution fig 1a while the npcs cuo 2 and npcs cuo 3 have multimodal distribution fig 1a it may be due to the cs amine group was deprotonated then led to hydrophobic interactions since the polymer was in an entangled state resulting in npcs cuo having irregular dimensions 80 since intensity average is also very sensitive and biased toward the present of large aggregation due to scattering principle which dependent on the sixth power of the particle radius hence the intensity average always skewed toward largest size the distribution of npcs cuo particle size at higher mass ratio was found at particle size beyond 400 nm due to the larger number of agglomerated npcs cuo however the particle size distribution of npcs cuo has smallest particle size around 200 nm at lower npcuo composition this result indicated that the particle size of npcs cuo strongly depend on the mass ratio of npcs npcuo where the smaller npcuo amount in the composite the smaller particle size of npcs cuo obtained it also can be inferred that amount of npcuo in the composites controls the formation of nanoparticle through chelation table 1 presents that the particle size of npcs cuo decreases with the reduction in the npcuo ratio where npcs cuo 3 has the smallest average particle size of 195 3 nm with the largest pdi value of 0 972 numerically the higher the pdi the larger the non uniformity and the wider range of particle size distribution 40 and such description is consistent with our results shown in fig 1 the increase in the pdi value could be due to the precipitation that may occurred due to the nature of chitosan which is easily agglomerated 81 ultrasonication is capable to break down particle aggregates however agglomeration can still occur in a prolonged ultrasonication process this means that the ultrasonication time and power determine the uniformity of nanocomposite particle size 41 on the other hand the particle size distribution by number demonstrates that npcs cuo 3 has the smallest particle size compared to that other composition where the largest particle size distribution is of 4 052 nm such observation indicated that most of the particles are small in sizes and the large size and size range found in the intensity average are mainly caused by the presence of particle aggregates the agglomerated nanoparticles having larger particle sizes contribute significantly to the determination of the average particle size of nanoparticles however the number of particles size exceed from 100 nm amounted to be 8 5 based on the number average data however it should be realized that the intensity average is consider the raw data fitted to the autocorrelation function of the scattering measurement and should be used as the main reference data set compared to other results the synthesized npcs cuo has a smallest size this may be due to the use of sc as a crosslinker which has a high chelating potential 28 which can chelate cu metal atoms so that it can produce smaller particles size the previous result reported that the particle size of npcs cuo was around 550 nm by number where the tripolyphosphate tpp was used as crosslinker at a cs cuo mass ratio of 0 025 50 42 meanwhile another study reported the average size of npcs cuo was 215 nm at cs cuo mass ratio of 2 1 without using a crosslinker 43 these results inferred that the particle size is strongly influenced by the mass ratio of npcs npcuo as well as the type of crosslinker used in addition it can be mentioned that the hybrid methods of ionic gelation and ultrasonication effectively control the particle size of nanoparticles 3 2 structures of npcs cuo nanocomposites based on sem images fig s2 agglomerated npcs demonstrated the smooth and flatten surface while npcuo exhibited irregular cubic like structure shape interestingly the agglomerated npcs cuo represented the uneven surface as a result of the npcuo incorporation in the npcs matrix in addition the deposition of npcuo was not observed on the composite surface indicating the homogenous dispersion of cuo in the npcs matrix however these sem images could not provide the information of particle size of composites to confirm the results obtained from psa the ftir spectra provide information on the functional group and molecular fingerprint of cs and sc in npcs and npcs cuo composites the ftir spectra of cs sc npcs cuso4 5h2o npcuo npcs cuo 1 npcs cuo 2 and npcs cuo 3 are presented in fig s3 and fig 2 fig s3a shows the presence of so4 group in the ftir spectrum of cuso4 5h2o which was indicated by absorption peaks of so vibration at 619 and 872 cm 1 44 in contrast the npcuo ftir spectrum indicates no so vibration peak in addition the absorption peaks at 519 and 598 cm 1 demonstrate the vibration mode of cuo bond 12 confirming the formation of npcuo 45 the absorption peaks at wavenumber of 1665 3214 and 3383 cm 1 in the cuso4 ftir spectrum correspond to the bending and stretching vibrations of hoh respectively 44 46 in addition a peak shift was found at 3439 cm 1 associated with the stretching vibration of oh from water molecules in the cuso4 5h2o furthermore the ftir spectrum of npcuo demonstrates the absorption bands at 1634 and 1711 cm 1 indicating the stretching vibration of co from the carboxylic ion that bound to cuo as a bidentate ligand 47 48 in addition the absorption peak at 1227 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the co group 49 these peaks strongly reveal the formation of npcuo however the residual ethanol solvent still can be observed in the npcuo sample as indicated by the absorption peak at 1049 cm 1 and 1101 cm 1 that corresponds to the stretching vibration of the coh and the bending vibration of the oh groups respectively 44 45 these results indicate the successful synthesis of the cuo from cuso4 h2o via co precipitation method the ftir spectra of cs and npcs fig s3b demonstrate a broad absorption peak at 3356 cm 1 that corresponds to the vibrational stretching of the oh and nh groups of primary amines and type ii amides of cs which are located in the same region 50 for the case of npcs the stretching vibrations of the nh2 and oh groups were indicated by an absorption peak of 3445 cm 1 with a larger intensity 28 from these observations it is very likely that the hydrogen bonds in the nh2 and oh groups have been decreased due to the interaction between cs and sc molecules additionally a weak absorption peak at 2871 cm 1 corresponds to the ch stretching vibration 51 on the other hand the absorption peak at 2970 and 2870 cm 1 correspond to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of ch2 from sc respectively 52 whereas the stretching vibration of ch2 from npcs was observed at absorption peak of 2928 cm 1 28 the absorption peaks at 1651 and 1585 cm 1 derived from co stretching and nh bending vibrations of amide i and amide ii of cs respectively 51 a widening and shift peak to 1630 cm 1 indicates an interaction between the nh2 group in cs and o atoms in the sc that occurs during the crosslinking process 28 predominantly via hydrogen bonding in addition the absorption peaks at 1315 and 1151 cm 1 derived from the cn of type i amines and the coc asymmetric stretching vibrations of the cs saccharide structure 53 the absorption peak at 1597 and 1397 cm 1 exhibits the asymmetric and symmetrical coo stretching vibrations respectively 52 meanwhile co symmetrical vibrations of coo ions in npcs appeared in sharp peaks at 1385 cm 1 54 the absorption peak at 1026 cm 1 comes from for the stretching vibration of the co group on the cs polysaccharide ring 55 this peak becomes widening to 1084 cm 1 in case of npcs all these results have indirectly demonstrated that the npcs was successfully synthesized via ionic gelation method fig 2 shows the peak shifts and new peaks appearance in the npcs cuo spectra the peak shifts can be seen in the cs spectrum where stretching vibrations of the nh and oh groups observed at the absorption peak of 3445 cm 1 12 the peak shifts to 3439 3437 and 3435 cm 1 confirmed the interaction between npcs and npcuo in all npcs cuo sample series respectively 56 the absorption peak at 1630 cm 1 in npcs cuo ftir spectrum is due to the nh bending vibration of the protonated amine group of npcs 57 the absorption of npcs cuo in the range of 1701 1713 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of co 47 which allows chelation between sc and cuo the co and co peaks at all npcs cuo series experienced shifting where the smaller npcs cuo particle the sharper the absorption peak and is due to the larger contact of surface area in case of npcs cuo the absorption peak at 1366 1383 cm 1 indicated the presence of a ch bending vibration ch3 symmetrical deformation 57 59 while the absorption at 1078 1223 cm 1 indicates the stretching vibration of the polysaccharide chain functional groups cn and co 49 56 the effect of cuo interaction with the cs backbone is clearly demonstrated by a remarkable change in the cs finger print area with ir absorption at 532 cm 1 which shows the cuo stretching vibration of the cuo monoclinic phase 60 61 this result also confirms the incorporation of npcuo in npcs 16 43 56 57 based on the ftir spectra it can be suggested that npcuo has been incorporated into the npcs matrix through a chelation mechanism by the co group of the citrate ion or from the un deacetylated chitosan side chain with cu ion from npcuo another mechanism of cu ion chelation may also occur with the free nh and oh groups of chitosan which do not interact with the crosslinker as indicated by the ftir results described above the possible mode of interaction in npcs cuo is pictorially illustrated in fig 3 3 3 characteristic of npcs cuo nanocomposite the x ray diffraction patterns provide the information of crystallinity of npcs cuo composites fig 4 the xrd pattern of cuso4 h5o fig 4 demonstrates the diffraction peaks at 15 43 18 72 22 25 29 05 31 14 and 32 48 that correspond to 111 021 110 and 122 crystal lattice planes fig 4b demonstrates the typical x ray diffraction pattern of npcuo which correspond to a monoclinic diffraction pattern at 2θ between 35 5 and 38 7 derived from combination of multiple reflections 002 and 200 indicating a tenorite structure and is in good agreement with jcpds data no 41 0254 using scherrer s equation and plane reflection 002 the crystallite size of synthesized npcuo was calculated to be 22 26 nm meanwhile the x ray diffraction pattern of npcs exhibits a broad peak with higher intensity at around 20 29 correspond to 110 lattice semicrystalline plane of cs 62 82 other diffraction peaks at 26 61 and 29 37 are multireflection of semicrystals of amine i n co ch3 and amine ii nh2 respectively 63 in case of npcs cuo it demonstrates the combination of diffraction peaks derived from npcuo and npcs where the peak shifts were clearly observed the crystallinity and crystallite size l of the npcs cuo composite were calculated using the debye scherrer equation table s1 npcs cuo composite has the largest full width half maximum fwhm and the smallest crystal size resulting in an increase in the crystallinity of the composite 64 regarding table s1 the crystallite size of synthesized npcuo and npcs cuo were smaller compared to the original precursors 20 nm these results suggest that the addition of npcuo into npcs has increased the crystallinity of nanocomposites 3 4 thermal stability of npcs cuo thermogravimetry differential analysis tga profile can be used to describe the thermal stability of nanocomposites this analysis is based on the amount of mass loss weight loss and component degradation in the composite as a function of temperature fig 5 demonstrates two stages of degradation where the first phase of degradation corresponds to the water and co2 decomposition and the second degradation phase corresponds to the breakdown of sc cs crosslinking bond polysaccharide complex degradation in cs depolymerization and polymer deacetylation decomposition 65 the weight loss for each composite is presented in table s2 the result indicated that the incorporation of npcuo improves the thermal stability of npcs in the composite system 3 5 antibacterial activity the bacteria strains used in this study were gram positive s aureus and gram negative bacteria e coli and p aeruginosa these bacteria were found as the main microorganisms contaminant in water and wastewater that have pathogenic properties which can cause various of infections and diseases 66 67 fig 6 shows the kirby bauer results of synthesized nanocomposites the diameter of inhibition zone zoi of npcs cuo increases as the increase of npcuo amount in the composite for all bacterial strain the addition of npcuo concentration improve the antibacterial activity of nanocomposites npcs cuo 1 exhibited the most outstanding inhibition properties among the synthesized nanoparticle with zoi up to 19 35 s aureus 19 45 e coli and 17 3 mm p aeruginosa only by employing 10 mg ml of the nanocomposites at this concentration the synthesized npcs crosslinked with sc also exhibit the inhibition capability even though it is smaller than that of npcs cuo 11 75 12 26 and 13 6 mm for s aureus e coli and p aeruginosa respectively this concentration is lower compare to the reported minimum inhibition concentration of other synthesized npcs with other crosslinking agents from the previous studies 6 68 which shows that the zone of inhibition of s aureus and e coli can be observed starting from the concentration of 30 mg ml and for p aeruginosa starting from 40 mg ml hence the dosage needed for the synthesized npcs as well as npcs cuo to inhibit the bacterial activity is lower the zone of inhibition in npcuo also increased with increasing concentration but the zone of inhibition of the npcs cuo nanocomposite system was higher than that of npcuo even with the same concentration contained in the composite system npcs cuo 1 which has the most npcuo content shows a larger inhibition zone this reflects that the addition of npcuo significantly increase the antibacterial activity of npcs the antibacterial activity of npcuo toward gram negative bacteria is slightly more powerful compared to the gram positive bacteria 14 3 and 14 55 mm for e coli and p aeruginosa respectively 13 9 mm for s aureus at the concentration of 0 01 mg ml indicating that the antibacterial activity of npcs and npcs cuo toward each bacterial strain has different mechanisms the type bacterial strains have different characteristic of functional groups on the cell surface so that the mechanism of bacterial inhibition is also different 16 fig 7 shows the bacteria killing ratio of npcs and npcs cuo composites with an obvious increment in bkr as the composite concentration increases the increase in antibacterial activity was also directly proportional to the addition of cuo to the nanocomposite moreover bkr of npcuo also increased with increasing concentration up to 70 67 71 73 and 61 76 for s aureus e coli and p aeruginosa respectively based on this result s aureus strain is more susceptible toward npcuo the bkr of npcs cuo composite was higher than that of npcuo at the same concentration contained in the composite system with bkr of 89 33 85 62 and 86 14 for s aureus e coli and p aeruginosa respectively by using npcs cuo 1 at 10 mg ml at higher concentration 20 mg ml the bkr of the synthesized nanocomposite exhibit almost similar bkr for all of bacterial strain in the range of 90 this is in line with the results of the kirby bauer test where gram negative bacteria are indeed more resistant than gram positive bacteria based on the antibacterial activity test results npcs also possess antibacterial properties the presence of charged groups in the cs backbone active oxygen and nitrogen can interact strongly with the bacterial wall constituents and induce intracellular electrolyte leakage this impairment of membrane integrity leads to the decrease of bacterial viability 69 70 the antibacterial action of chitosan can be highly diminished at certain ph due to the deprotonation of amine group and the decrease of solubility 71 therefore the modification of chitosan is necessary to improve its activity npcuo is one of nanoparticle that also performed as antibacterial agent the major toxicological mechanism of npcuo for bacterial cell is the formation of reactive oxygen species ros and released it as radicals such as oh and o2 which can penetrate into bacteria cellular and lead to damage of its component such as dna lipids peptidoglycan and protein 72 these ros are capable to oxidize the double bonds in phospholipids thus increase the membrane viscosity which makes cells more vulnerable to osmotic stress 73 the antibacterial activity of npcuo can also be caused by the cu2 release which enable to form complexes compounds in the bacteria leads to the damage of cell walls and proteins in addition cu2 alters the dna structure avoiding bacterial reproduction 74 the synergistic action of npcuo and npcs exhibited better antibacterial and antibiofilm activity 14 16 the possible mechanism of antibacterial activity of npcs and npcs cuo can be explained based on the existing literature as follow bacterial surface having negative charged attract the nanoparticles positively charged through electrostatic interactions after that the nanoparticles attack the bacterial cell wall then enter the cell membrane as a result of leaking and damage to its constituents 16 moreover npcuo will be penetrated through the impaired cell wall and damage the cell constituent the cu2 ion is predicted to be incorporated in the nanocomposite matrix via chelating mechanism with the bond length of 3 018 å fig 3 which is relatively long and loose this promotes the easier cu2 release and increase the antibacterial properties based on figs 6 and 7 npcs and npcs cuo is more effective to constrain gram positive bacteria s aureus while the pristine npcuo is slightly more effective to gram negative bacteria e coli and p aeruginosa this is due to the difference of cell membrane construction of bacteria the gram positive bacteria cell wall is enriched with peptidoglycan layers that promotes the nh3 from chitosan to adsorb on the cell wall and penetrate through the cell 75 76 the cell membrane of gram negative bacteria do not have this special layer thus the npcuo will be easier to penetrate the cell membrane npcs also act as the nutrition flow inhibitor outer the cell membrane of gram negative bacteria 7 71 the synergic inhibition mechanism of npcs and npcuo can expand the antibacterial efficacy spectrum to different bacterial strain the acceptable mechanism antibacterial inhibition of npcs cuo through gram positive and gram negative bacteria is illustrated in fig 8 based on fig 7 the npcs and npcs cuo exhibit the superior antibacterial activity where it effectively killed the used bacteria strains with almost 100 efficiency at the concentration of 30 mg ml the almost similar effect for all of the bacterial strain is due to the high osmotic pressure of antibacterial agent dispersion which is not suitable for the cell viability 77 the particle size of antibacterial agent also significantly affects its antibacterial activity this is due to the unique physicochemical properties of nanoparticles such as large surface area to volume ratio providing more cationic sites and high reactivity thereby potentially increasing charge interactions on the microbial surface and causing a superior antibacterial effect 78 the npcs cuo synthesized through ionic gelation ultrasonication using sc as crosslinking agent in this study still exhibit better antibacterial activity compared to other chitosan cuo antibacterial agents table s3 where the composite was in the suspension form that could a benefit for application subsequently the additional solvent is not necessary t in addition since the npcuo ratio to npcs composite was quite low 0 005 0 01 mg to 30 mg which is lower than the limit of viable concentration through the human pulmonary epithelial cell 0 05 mg ml 79 the potential adverse effect that may toxic to some aquatic life can be avoided the incorporation of cuo to npcs can limit the dosage of cuo as antibacterial agent and provide a synergistic effect to inhibit the bacterial activity 4 conclusions the npcs cuo composites have successfully synthesized by mixing the npcuo and npcs solutions in water with sodium citrates crosslinker via hybrid ionic gelation at 25 c for 2 h followed by ultrasonication 200 w 40 khz npcs cuo was prepared in mass ratio of npcs npcuo 30 0 005 30 0 0075 and 30 0 01 in ch3cooh 1 at ph 3 5 this technique provides the simple and fast method to synthesize npcs cuo without involving a lot of chemicals and low energy used the synthesized npcs cuo has the smallest averaged hydrodynamics size of 195 nm with a pdi of 0 972 obtained at optimum composition ratio of npcs cuo of 30 0 005 the ftir spectra confirmed the interaction between cs and crosslinker predominantly occurred via hydrogen bonding of nh and co moieties while interaction of npcs and npcuo took place via chelation between co and cuo functional groups the addition of npcuo remarkably increased the crystallinity and in contrast reduced the crystallite size of npcs the npcs cuo exhibited superior antibacterial efficacy toward e coli s aureus and p aeruginosa bacteria strains than that of npcs

12576,with rapid industrialization enormous amounts of wastewater have been released from the rubber industry into the environment from different industrial processes such as latex concentrate and standard block rubber the rubber industry wastewater must be treated before discharge into common water bodies this review paper presents the recent advances in treatment methods for rubber industry wastewater particularly in biological processes membrane processes coagulation flocculation and advanced oxidation processes besides this review paper discovers more about the potential of integrated methods which apply the synergetic effectiveness of processes to achieve the recycling of treated wastewater and the sustainable development of water resources special emphasis has been laid upon the type of rubber industry wastewater operating condition and performance of the treatment methods along with their pros and cons selection of appropriate treatment strategy lies on the feedwater conditions site restriction water requirement stability of treatment process cost effectiveness energy efficiency and environmental friendliness despite many treatment methods presenting superior performance many of them possess limitations and have not progressed to the industrial scale lastly challenges and future perspectives in developing treatment technology for rubber industry wastewater are proposed to achieve sustainable and integrated water management graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rubber industry wastewater wastewater treatment integrated treatment process sustainable process development data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction natural rubber nr is a polymeric hydrocarbon composed primarily of poly cis 1 4 isoprene chains which exhibit extraordinary tensile properties 1 nr is harvested from the commercial tropical rubber tree hevea brasiliensis via tapping 2 the hevea brasiliensis rubber tree is initially grown at the amazon river basin and can be harvested after six years of cultivation 3 in 1896 henry wickham introduced the cultivation of hevea brasiliensis rubber tree to malaysia as the tropical climate in malaysia is favourable to the growth of hevea brasiliensis rubber tree 4 afterwards the plantation of hevea brasiliensis rubber tree was ampliated to southeast asia and subsequently led to the domination of nr production in southeast asia 5 currently thailand indonesia vietnam china india cote d ivoire and malaysia are the main rubber producers amounting to over 90 of total production in the world 5 although these countries can produce large amount of rubber the demand would not be satisfied as the consumption rate is higher than the production rate for instance the production of nr in china was 816 103 t whereas consumption was as high as 4 680 000 t in 2015 6 therefore china depends greatly on importing nr mainly from southeast asia top suppliers for example thailand and malaysia however the world consumption of nr dropped by 18 6 annually during the first two months of 2020 as the manufacturing industry has been relentlessly affected due to the covid 19 pandemic simultaneously the covid 19 pandemic has boosted the nr industry as demand for certain healthcare products such as medical gloves and masks 7 in general the raw nr can be used to produce two main products latex concentrate lc and standard block rubber 8 lc processing aims to produce concentrated latex that can be used in manufacturing dipped rubber products for instance gloves balloons condoms rubber thread and infant pacifiers 9 lc processing includes three main processes centrifugation coagulation and washing as shown in fig 1 10 firstly ammonia is added to the field latex to prevent bacteria growth under alkaline conditions while various chemicals are added for latex conditioning 11 then ammoniated field latex containing 30 33 rubber is concentrated using high speed centrifuges to produce centrifuged latex and skim latex the centrifuges latex contains 60 rubber while skim latex contains 4 6 rubber finally skim latex containing 0 8 ammonia is coagulated with 98 sulfuric acid to make a byproduct called skim rubber 12 on the other hand standard block rubber is technically specified crumb rubber conformed to the layout by the international organization for standardization the grade specifications of standard block rubber have been adopted and accepted by producing and consuming countries besides the standard block rubber can be graded differently for manufacturing different quality rubber products for instance the standard malaysian rubber smr classified nr latex into different grades based on the concentration of main impurities dirt ash nitrogen volatile matter and properties as shown in table 1 similar parameters with ranged limits were imposed in some countries such as thailand 13 indonesia 14 and vietnam 15 in general the standard block rubber involves three main steps including 1 coagulation 2 crushing and milling followed by 3 hot air drying and pressing in blocks 16 raw nr processing produces large amounts of wastewater which is highly polluted with nitrogen compounds and organic and inorganic matters due to the highly contaminated rubber industry wastewater the wastewater must be treated according to the discharge standard before being released into the water source many studies have been conducted to investigate the best treatment methods for rubber industry wastewater fig 2 shows the number of publications linked to the topic of rubber wastewater treatment in the past ten years as shown the number of publications linked to this topic has escalated rapidly since 2013 besides it is worth noting that the review paper constitutes 10 44 28 80 of the total number of publications linked to this topic and increasing tremendously over the years however most review papers focus on the targeted rubber industry and specific treatment methods there is no state of art review on recent advances in treatment methods for various type of rubber industry wastewater to fill this gap in the literature this review paper aims to comprehensively review on the treatment methods including type of rubber industry wastewater operating condition and performance of the treatment methods along with their pros and cons 2 rubber industry wastewater quality and discharge standard according to tanikawa et al 18 processing 1 ton of nr produced 20 35 m3 of wastewater which comprised of the high content of ammonia as substantial ammonia is used in nr processing to prevent latex coagulation the wastewater quality of rubber processing at thailand indonesia vietnam india and malaysia was tabulated in table 2 slight differences in the wastewater quality were observed in table 2 which could be due to different sampling points and the use of chemical in general high chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod were generally found in the wastewater due to the presence of uncoagulated latex lipids and inorganic compounds from various processing stages 19 high concentrations of nitrogen compounds in the wastewater were due to the use of ammonia and sulfuric acid on another hand the raw smr wastewater consisted of lower value of cod and bod compared to lc wastewater as size reduction and dirt removal processes in smr process involved mainly the physical process rather than chemical process as compared to lc processing according to rosman et al 19 the cod and bod of smr wastewater was within 1850 2960 mg l and 890 1380 mg l respectively the concentration of ammonia was 49 57 mg l at ph 7 25 7 5 research was also conducted to evaluate the wastewater quality released from the rubber industry in different countries in nigeria it is found that the rubber industry wastewater discharge greatly affected the macroinvertebrate species in niger delta 29 the freshwater macroinvertebrate species vary in sensitivity to organic pollution thus their relative population has been used to make inferences about pollution load it is reported that the number of macroinvertebrate species was 63 at the location prior to the rubber industry wastewater discharge point while only 38 species were found at the wastewater discharge point this is due to the deteriorated turbidity total suspended solids nitrite nitrate ammonia conductivity and cod at the wastewater discharge point besides it is reported that firestone liberia s rubber processing facility produced wastewater with high concentration of heavy metals such as aluminium and copper which polluted the farmington river sub basin including wetlands and yur chu 30 the concentration of manganese and ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n in owensgrove creek has exceeded the world health organization who limit for human consumption table 3 tabulates the rubber industry wastewater discharge standard in thailand indonesia vietnam india and malaysia which are among the largest nr producers in the world 31 generally bod cod suspended solid nh3 n and ph are among the most important parameters in determining the quality of rubber industry wastewater the range of bod3 bod5 cod suspended solid nh3 n and ph are 50 100 mg l 20 100 mg l 50 400 mg l 50 200 mg l 5 300 mg l and 5 5 9 respectively comparatively the discharge standard adopted in thailand indonesia vietnam and india is more stringent than in malaysia notably both india and malaysia adopted bod3 instead of bod5 in qualifying the rubber industry wastewater which varies in the incubation periods and the temperature besides total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn which indicates the total of organic nitrogen and nh3 n is considered the sole parameter to measure nitrogen pollutants in thailand 32 as shown in the table 3 thailand and indonesia have only one standard for rubber industry wastewater while vietnam india and malaysia have two standards depending on the location of the discharge and or type of rubber processing in vietnam standard a is to be adopted if the discharge is released to the water source used for daily human activities otherwise standard b is applicable 23 33 similar regulation is observed in india the rubber industry wastewater has to comply with more stringent standards if the wastewater is discharged to inland surface water compared to the discharge on land for irrigation 34 35 in malaysia the discharge quality depends on the rubber processes where regulation 12 is adopted for concentrated latex production while regulation 14 is for the production of products other than concentrated latex or its associated products 36 unfortunately most rubber processing industries cannot comply with the desired discharge quality due to the severely contaminated rubber industry wastewater for instance a few concentrated latex processing plants in vietnam discharged wastewater with 466 to 567 mg l cod 57 92 mg l bod and 67 120 mg l tn which exceeded the standard b water discharge limited 23 in india water samples at the discharge point of a raw rubber processing company contain high conductivity acidic ph and nitrate within the range of 198 229 s m 4 0 to 4 3 and 2 21 to 2 30 mg l respectively which were higher than the tripura state pollution control board standard 37 in malaysia the water quality index of the water quality monitoring station near the rubber plant was graded as class iii indicating extensive treatment is required 38 this scenario has triggered the advancement of treatment methods for rubber industry wastewater which will be discussed in the following section 3 recent advances in treatment method for rubber industry wastewater this section discusses the recent advances in treatment methods for rubber industry wastewater which will be categorized into single stage and integrated treatment the single stage treatment includes biological membrane coagulation flocculation and other methods in contrast integrated treatment involves combining two or more single stage treatments in rubber industry wastewater 3 1 search strategy a comprehensive search was conducted electronically to identify published papers relevant to rubber industry wastewater treatment up to the paper submission the search was conducted in two main databases including web of science and scopus the searches however were not limited to only bibliographic databases as google scholar was also used to identify conference proceedings thesis law regulations and book chapters in view of the conventional treatment methods were reviewed by mitra et al 27 in 2010 therefore the representative studies discussed in this review are mainly based on the literature published in the recent ten years to review the recent advances in treatment technology critically search terms were carefully designed to ensure the search was comprehensive as some terms are used interchangeably afterwards the publications were screened based on the title and abstract then the papers are categorized based on the types of treatment and arranged in chronological order to map the current and future trends for advances in the water treatment strategy for rubber industry wastewater lastly the publications were screened based on the full text and extracted for critical review 3 2 single stage treatment 3 2 1 biological 3 2 1 1 anaerobic treatment process table 4 shows the recent anaerobic biological treatments for rubber industry wastewater as shown the biological treatment for rubber industry wastewater can be mainly categorized into anaerobic aerobic and anaerobic aerobic systems in general an anaerobic process is preferred as biogas such as biomethane and biohydrogen are produced via a rapid breakdown process of organic substances from rubber industry wastewater in order to enhance the production of biogas hydrogen and methane kongjan jariyaboon and o thong 42 have treated skim latex serum sls using two stage up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors operated under thermophilic it is reported that two stage uasb generated an optimum hydrogen production yield of 2 25 0 09 l h2 l sls at 36 h of hrt meanwhile the methane production yield of 6 41 0 52 l ch4 l sls can be attained at 9 d of hrt both hydrogen and methane yield obtained by the two stage uasb was greater than the yield achieved by batch fermentation later jariyaboon o thong and kongjan 43 further manipulated concentrations of sls from 37 5 to 75 0 v v in the two stage uasb reactors the maximum methane production yield was achieved at 12 2 l ch4 l sls with 60 v v sls this is attributed to the mixed microbial inoculums at 60 v v sls contains high microbial diversity comprising both acidogens and methanogens that consume acidigenisic metabolites as their substrate nevertheless the yield ceased at higher sls loadings of 60 v v owing to the insufficient nutrient buffer capacity as there was low basic anaerobic medium kongjan et al 44 later co digested sls with palm oil mill wastewater at a mixing ratio of 55 45 on the basis of volatile solid vs and obtained higher methane yield of 311 2 8 0 ml ch4 g vsadded this is attributed to the palm oil mill wastewater fermentation containing appropriate long chain fatty acids lcfas produced from hydrolysis of lipid in pome consequently enhance methane production besides codigesting sls with palm oil mill wastewater reduced the ammonia concentration contained in sls which produced the proper alkalinity for methane formation lerdrattranataywee and kaosol 45 further studied the effect of mixing time on anaerobic co digestion of decanter cake from palm oil mill and block rubber wastewater similar performance was obtained where the highest biogas production was observed with 10 day hrt and 12 h day mixing time besides the addition of electron donors into the anaerobic system could enhance methanogenesis during the anaerobic process of rubber industry wastewater paepatung et al 46 investigated the effectiveness of zero valent iron zvi in improving anaerobic digestion and biogas production from synthetic wastewater containing cod so4 2 ratio 2 to 3 resemble to rubber skim wastewater it is found that zvi enhances electron transfer activities of microbes in the reactor consequently leading to higher activities of methane forming microbes hence increasing methane production of 0 25 l ch4 g codadded day later paepatung et al 47 found that zvi supplied extra electrons for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and ferrous ions that could co precipitate with sulfides hence this reduced the inhibition of acetoclastic methanogens from undissociated h2s fig 3 shows the images of magnetic particles attached to zvi after the anaerobic treatment furthermore the addition of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polymer and rubber wood ash rwa into wastewater produced from concentrated rubber latex plants and desulfated sls dsls has been studied by chaiprapat et al 48 and raketh et al 49 respectively for instance raketh et al 50 investigated the effect of mixing time and rwa loading on the removal of sulfate from sls the optimum sulfate removal efficiency of 42 was attained at mixing time of 10 min and rwa loading of 10 g l the sulfate removal from the sls solution is proposed to resemble sulfates adsorption on a volcanic ash soil surface through ligand exchange with the oh group later raketh et al 49 studied the efficiency of single stage anaerobic digestion ssad and two stage anaerobic digestion tsad of dsls using rwa loadings it is observed that the methane yields in ssad and tsad were not significantly different ranged within 269 35 305 09 ml ch4 g codadded day however tsad is not economically attractive as payback time for tsad 4 36 years is longer than that of ssad 2 52 years despite a higher energy recovery of 5 3 2 1 2 aerobic treatment process for aerobic treatment of rubber industry wastewater aeration plays crucial role in the rate of aerobic breakdown of organic substances by bacteria chaiprapat et al 53 investigated the effects of retention time rt and air mix ratio on the performance and kinetics of the aerobic biofilm reactor 1 8 l in h2s removal from wastewater discharged by concentrated rubber latex plants at the highest air mix ratio biogas to air ratio 1 4 h2s could be reduced to below 500 mg l with the highest h2s removal of 94 7 at rt of 160 s besides high removal of cod ammonia and tn was attained at 98 4 92 7 and 89 5 respectively yang et al 54 also studied the effect of aeration strategies in aquaculture wastewater treatment by sequencing batch biofilm reactor it is found that post aeration was beneficial to the consistency of the nitrifier abundance and activity of the key nitrifying enzyme hence enhancing the removal efficiency of ammonium nh4 n in addition the use of limited oxygen for aerobic treatment of rubber industry wastewater has been explored using oxygen limited autotrophic nitritation denitrification oland to treat latex processing wastewater fig 4 55 the highest tn removal 94 was achieved under oxygen limiting conditions with do in a range of 0 1 to 0 2 mg l this wastewater quality met the maximum limit of cod and nitrogen compound of the treated latex processing wastewater quality standards in vietnam consistent results were obtained using a micro oxygen hybrid reactor mohr in treating concentrated latex wastewater 56 the mohr is a two zone reactor comprised of a suspended sludge zone and attached biofilm zone operating at dissolved oxygen of 0 10 0 15 mg l the mohr optimal removal efficiencies for sulfate so4 2 tkn and cod were 90 3 67 8 and 93 0 respectively at hrt of 10 d apart from aeration sludge can be optimized to facilitate the aerobic digestion of rubber industry wastewater rosman et al 19 initiated the study of aerobic granular sludge systems for wastewater treatment from the rubber industry the aerobic granular sludge systems operate at a working volume of 600 ml aeration volumetric flowrate of 0 12 m3 h mlss of 5300 mg l and volumetric exchange ratio ver of 50 compact and stable aerobic granular sludge with great settleability and an average diameter of 1 5 mm was cultivated successfully besides high removal efficiencies of cod ammonia and tn 89 4 96 5 were obtained towards the end of the granulation period of 3 months later rosman et al 57 further studied the effect of hydraulic rt hrt 6 12 and 24 h on the physical characteristics of sludge granules and the performance of a sequencing batch reactor treating rubber industry wastewater it is reported that low hrt of 6 h encouraged the development of larger granular sludge with great settleability high biomass density and stronger structure similar removal efficiencies of cod ammonia and tn were attained in a shorter period 6 h compared to the previous study 19 furthermore few studies have worked on the isolation and identification of microorganisms such as pseudomonas sp arthrobacter sp indigenous purple nonsulfur bacteria pnsb and rhodopseudomonas palustris for the treatment of rubber industry wastewater 58 62 bacteria including pseudomonas sp arthrobacter sp were successfully isolated from rubber industry wastewater located at discharge points of a rubber plant in mysore india this is in accordance with studies by krainara et al 63 where pseudomonas sp was the dominant genus at approximately 70 of the total population found in rubber industrial wastewater both pseudomonas sp and arthrobacter sp bacteria can reduce substantial amount of total solids 71 9 73 suspended solids 74 6 75 7 dissolved solids 67 6 68 8 bod 70 4 72 1 cod 76 8 79 4 ammonia 66 0 71 3 and phosphate 62 5 68 8 after 15 d of incubation with higher removal attained by pseudomonas sp 58 59 both studies have successfully reduced the bod and cod of wastewater from the rubber processing industry to the discharge level similar observation was also obtained by kornochalert et al 61 using phototrophic bacteria like pnsb i e rhodopseudomonas palustris p1 to treat latex rubber sheet wastewater the latex rubber sheet wastewater was added with fermented pineapple extract fpe under microaerobic light conditions the fpe acts as growth simulator for the pnsb by supplementing simple substrates like acetate and lactate that are easily digested by pnsb it is reported reduction of cod 91 suspended solids 75 total sulfide 61 and h2s 100 using 7 pnsbsi 0 8 fpe and 4 d rt later kornochalert et al 64 optimized the bioremediation of rhodopseudomonas palustris p1 fpe using a central composite design the optimized removal is achieved using 3 stimulated p1 inoculum with 0 9 added fpe and a 4 d rt higher removal efficiency of cod 98 suspended solids 79 total sulfide 72 and h2s 100 was obtained using the optimized formulation apart from pineapple extract as growth simulator wood vinegar has been employed as a levulinic acid source for pnsb to produce useful byproduct 5 aminolevulinic acid which can be used as herbicide and insecticide 62 65 3 2 1 3 anaerobic aerobic treatment process as shown in table 5 the sequential anaerobic aerobic process has drawn much attention for wastewater treatment as it showed exceptional performance than single stage aerobic or anaerobic treatment the integrated anaerobic aerobic system for the treatment of rubber industry wastewater was pioneered by tanikawa et al 18 with a two stage uasb and down flow hanging sponge dhs system in the two stage uasb the rubber industry wastewater was digested for hydrogen and methane production uasb wastewater discharged from the first stage of uasb was recycled as feed at a recirculation ratio of 2 1 then the remaining uasb wastewater was sent for aerobic post treatment in the dhs the dhs lowered power consumption by 97 and the volume of excess sludge by 98 in overall the system attained high cod removal efficiency of 95 7 at an organic loading rate of 0 8 kg cod m3 d the two stage uasb removed 80 of sulfate while the dhs oxidized the remaining organic matter and sulfide the research group also identified the key factors for residual rubber coagulation in dhs are wastewater air and wastewater core rubber contacts hence recommended the installation of opened contact type pretreatment system for rubber recovery such as a core rubber seeded trickling filter later tanikawa et al 66 incorporated a pre treatment canal ptc seeded with lumps of rubber blocks prior to the anaerobic baffled reactor abr and a dhs reactor it was found that the residual rubber in the wastewater was coagulated and accumulated at the surface of the rubber blocks at the end of operation in short the ptc not only recover residual rubber 16 6 through coagulation but also enhances the removal efficiencies of organic matter cod 76 0 8 2 in the abr and nitrogen ammonia 70 3 4 3 in the dhs reactor besides the water quality of the treated wastewater met the vietnamese standards for the nr industry apart from uasb and dhs configuration tanikawa et al 67 investigated a two stage trickling filter tf system that consisted of a closed type first stage tf and an open type second stage tf fig 5 coconut chips were employed as low cost packing media in tf reactors and can be recovered as fertilizer or mulching material after exhausted due to its non toxic nature and rich in nutrients the two stage tf system attained high removal efficiency of hydrogen sulfide h2s and nitrogen and can be used for high s n ratio wastewater such as latex wastewater furthermore the application of mini scale dhs as post treatment of an existing combined anaerobic tank in an nr processing plant in south vietnam has been studied by watari et al 68 the existing anaerobic tank efficiently removes high concentrations of organic contaminants nevertheless the wastewater from the anaerobic tank still has substantial amount of organic matter and ammonia the post treatment by dhs demonstrated excellent removal efficiencies of cod 64 2 7 5 and tn 55 3 19 2 afterwards watari et al 69 constructed a pilot scale uasb dhs integrated with an abr and a settling tank in a similar nr processing plant fig 6 the process performance of the integrated system with a capacity of 10 000 m3 year was investigated for 267 d the final wastewater of the proposed system attained similar quality to the current treatment system with reduced hrt by 80 and ghgs emissions by 92 however the ammonia content in the final wastewater of the integrated system was unable to meet the mandatory vietnamese national technical regulation on the wastewater of the nr processing industry standard b 40 mg n l however more work needs to be done to accomplish effective nitrogen removal and environmental sustainability of energy recovery 3 2 2 membrane membrane filtration was known to be viable in the different detachment process because of notable highlights like minimal chemical utilization and can be utilized in the commercial process where the operation is continuous 72 generally microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf membranes have been used to reclaim surface waters 73 moreover the nanofiltration nf membrane is used for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation 74 75 most of the membrane processes involved in treatments for rubber industry wastewater are uf and nf which will be discussed in depth in the following section 76 3 2 2 1 ultrafiltration table 6 shows the recent uf treatments for rubber industry wastewater uf received great attention for treating rubber industry wastewater as it can operate under low pressure less energy consumption due to the moderate pore size 5 100 nm 77 however membrane fouling is one of the main factors hindering the widespread uf application membrane fouling leads to higher operational cost higher energy demand reduced membrane lifetime and increased cleaning frequency 78 membrane cleaning such as physical base and acid cleaning steps can be conducted periodically to recover the membrane flux hence performance veerasamy and ismail 79 established procedures for effective membrane cleaning for the membrane fouled during the nr skim lc process to optimize membrane cleaning cost flux recoveries above 90 can be attained by post ultrasonic cleaning at 50 c after chemical cleaning using naoh or hno3 the membrane module would be completely immersed in ultrasonic bath to enhance the effect of ultrasonic on the membrane module on top of chemical cleaning ultrasonication provided the additional force to flush out the irreversible foulants from the membrane pores which caused an increase of 4 in cumulative flux recoveries besides studies have been conducted to model the fouling and foulant attachments on uf membrane towards latex solution abdelrasoul et al 80 have employed predictive models for the mass of fouling on several flat membranes under a constant flow rate and crossflow mode the predictive models produce satisfactory accuracy for the three flat membranes ultrafilic cellulose acetate and polysulfone psf membranes with error range of 8 0 12 4 6 7 8 1 and 2 2 11 1 respectively the predictive models can be used to understand the fouling phenomenon subsequently introduce fouling control strategies to reduce the energy demands improve membrane lifetime and lessen other operational costs more recently significant scientific attention has been paid to the development of antifouling membrane via membrane modification to enhance the hydrophilicity of the membrane 81 82 the hydrophilic membrane prevents fouling due to its lesser affinity to organic materials in wastewater 83 84 membrane hydrophilicity can be dramatically improved with the use of electron beam the electron beam irradiation can be used for the scission of the membrane polymer molecular chain leading to random rupturing of bonds and the crosslinking of polymer molecules this result in the modification to the free volume and free volume distribution within the polymer matrix hence membrane hydrophilicity ruangdit et al 85 have modified the membrane containing titanium oxide tio2 by electron beam irradiation at energies of 3 mev and 10 mev for irradiation doses of 10 kgy and 50 kgy followed by single step grafting using acrylic acid aac and sodium styrene sulfonate sss it is reported that the membrane irradiated at 10 mev and 50 kgy demonstrated the highest hydrophilicity with a water contact angle of 35 2 and high flux recovery ratio frr of 97 8 and 95 9 respectively after filtration with nr serum this is because greater electron beam power and radiation dose enhanced the degree of aac sss grafting this increased the membrane surface energy attracted water molecules and increased surface hydrophilicity however contradicting finding was obtained by kusworo and wulandari 86 by performing uv irradiation on membrane doped with reduced graphene oxide rgo tio2 it is reported that the longer the irradiation time the lower the permeability it was because uv irradiation could increase the density of the polymer of the psf membrane and tighten the chain bonds of each polymer compound uv irradiation would make polymer chains rearrange spaces and fill gaps to fill the volume between polymers this resulted in lower permeability and faster fouling occurrence therefore it is important to control the electron beam dosage and irradiation time to optimize the antifouling capacity of the membrane apart from electron beam irradiation membrane modification with hydrophilic materials was reported to improve their intrinsic properties reducing the fouling propensity 87 besides the addition of hydrophilic materials into the membrane provides hybrid membrane with improved properties indicative of the individual properties exhibited by the added materials nazri et al 10 have incorporated hydrophilic graft copolymer polyvinyl alcohol pva and polyacrylonitrile pan pan g pva into pan based hollow fiber membranes for the treatment of nr wastewater the modified membrane with the highest percentage of grafting and grafting efficiency has displayed superior performance with lower irreversible fouling of 11 16 and higher frr of 84 and 76 for the first two filtration cycles respectively this is because the presence of pva on the membrane surface increased the hydroxyl groups which is favourable for creating hydrophilic surfaces this subsequently enhanced water permeability and antifouling properties in addition nanomaterials have been employed to produce nanocomposite membranes for the treatment of rubber industry wastewater for instance graphene oxide go rgo zinc oxide zno tio2 silicon dioxide sio2 86 88 89 these nanomaterials are usually incorporated into membrane matrices to work synergistically with the membrane to treat polluted water efficiently recently a new class of nanocomposite membranes was reported by incorporating two types of nanomaterials into the membrane matrix this class of membranes demonstrated outstanding membrane performance compared with the respective nanocomposite membrane composed of a single nanomaterial attributed to the synergistic effect among the different nanomaterials kusworo kumoro aryanti et al 89 have incorporated dual filler rgo zno into the polyethersulfone pes membrane to treat nr wastewater it is reported that the frr of the pes zno 82 pes rgo 80 21 and pes rgo zno 83 nanocomposite membrane was 7 12 higher than neat pes membrane the improvement of frr by adding nanomaterials could be due to the improvement of surface hydrophilicity which provides the antifouling behavior besides membrane cleaning under uv light can improve the frr by 14 attributed to the photocatalytic activity of zno and rgo that helped to degrade the organic fouling the synergistic effect of rgo and zno semiconductors improved uv light absorption due to reduced band gap energy similar result was obtained using rgo tio2 and sio2 excellent photocatalytic efficiency with increased photocatalytic activity by 30 100 of the pes rgo tio2 nanocomposite membrane treating nr wastewater this is attributed to the reduction of recombination photogenerated electrons and holes which was remediated by the addition of go as electron acceptor fig 7 90 more recently an outstanding membrane photocatalytic degradation rate was achieved by zno mno2 sio2 where mno2 doping successfully improved the photo sensitivity and photocatalytic activity of the composite 91 mno2 doping reduced the bandgap energy from 3 10 ev to 2 65 ev which promoted the photocatalytic improvement it can be concluded that nanocomposite membranes pose self cleaning ability and antimicrobial activity under both uv and visible light prolonging the membrane lifetime in wastewater treatment applications 3 2 2 2 nanofiltration and others although uf allowed relatively high water fluxes the contaminants in the wastewater in terms of cod and total organic carbon toc were above the permissible wastewater discharges standard 94 95 on the other hand permeate generated from nf can meet the wastewater discharge requirement due to the smaller pore size 1 10 nm lopes xin and crespo 93 have investigated the performance of commercial uf membrane carbosep zro2 techsep and three nf membranes np010 nadir nf270 dow and nf90 dow to treat wastewater from the rubber industry it was reported that permeate produced by nf90 or nf270 membrane met the european legislative requirements for water disposal where permeate cod lower than 2000 mg l then the less restrictive membrane nf270 was selected for study in a pilot plant membrane area 7 6 m2 at the industrial site because of its higher membrane permeability during the pilot plant study the permeate quality complies with wastewater discharge requirements after 12 h of operation and membrane chemical cleaning completely recovered the membrane permeability in addition economic evaluation has suggested that the nf process is economically feasible attributed of its lower energy consumption the energy consumption of the nf process represents merely 62 of the existing energy consumption of the treatment plant using the thermal treatment process considering the energy prices are expected to increase by 50 on average in 2022 the approach and the solution developed in this research are projected to achieve significant economic and energetic cost savings 96 similar to the uf process nanomaterials have been employed to enhance the performance of nanocomposite membranes for the treatment of rubber industry wastewater kusworo ariyanti and utomo 97 have added tio2 nanoparticles into psf membranes to improve their mechanical and separation characteristics the produced membranes are considered nf whose pore size is 7 65 10 10 nm the addition of nano tio2 improved the tensile strength of the membrane from 4 1 mpa to 7 2 mpa nevertheless the membrane tensile strength decreased slightly at higher nano tio2 loadings 2 wt this is attributed to the agglomeration of nanoparticles in the membrane matrix which led to the unselective void between the polymer chain 98 during treatment of nr industry wastewater the best pollutant removal efficiency was exhibited by the psf tio2 1 0 wt membrane with tds cod nh3 and turbidity removal rates reaching 14 03 87 88 88 79 and 99 respectively this is due to the enhanced membrane porosity 36 47 43 21 and pore size 7 65 10 10 nm by the nanoparticles apart from pristine tio2 nanoparticles kusworo susanto et al 90 have incorporated tio2 and go into the psf membrane upon incorporating tio2 go mixture as nanomaterials to the psf membrane extraordinary results were observed in the aspect of permeate flux organic and ammonia removal efficiency of 13 05 l m2 h 60 98 and 91 27 respectively higher porosity 22 79 59 84 and smaller pore size 1 89 6 27 nm were observed by the addition of dual nanoparticles this synergistic combination not only preserves the interesting characteristics of both individual nanoparticles but also overcomes serious drawbacks aside from pressure driven membrane process uf and nf many studies have explored the use of thermally driven separation process membrane distillation md for the treatment of wastewater owing to high rejection of nonvolatile organic compounds lower operation pressure and lower operating temperature as well as smaller footprint than conventional distillation processes in a study by mokhtar et al 26 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf mixed matrix membrane added with inorganic material of cloisite 15a was used as md membrane feed temperature and permeate temperature are 55 5 c and 20 0 c respectively results indicated that the direct contact md process could reduce toc total dissolved solid tds sulphate colour turbidity and conductivity for 96 in rubber industry wastewater however due to the severe fouling problem the membrane water permeate flux deteriorated as the filtration proceeded the severe flux decline is because of the blocking covering of the pore of the membrane by complex components such as latex and protein in rubber industry wastewater this subsequently decreases the evaporation area of the md membrane this has been confirmed by abdelrasoul et al 92 and mohana et al 99 who investigated the influence of latex particles on membrane fouling it was found that membrane pore blocking was the major fouling mechanism with latex particle size 10 mm this is possible because of the attractive forces between the latex particles and the membrane surface leading to 40 irreversible fouling besides increasing the latex particle size by aggregation coagulation with the aid of surfactant cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab can curb pore blocking and the irreversible fouling by up to 35 and 51 5 respectively through hydraulic backwashed 3 2 3 other single stage treatment coagulation flocculation is one of the physicochemical treatment processes that adds coagulant flocculant to react with wastewater to convert soluble pollutants into particulate pollutants which then can be removed by settling palomino hunkeler and stoll 100 have compared two types of cationic polymeric flocculant cationic linear polymer and two branched polymer on the stability of the charged latex particle suspension it is reported that polymer architecture and polymer dosage play crucial part on the rapid destabilization of the colloidal suspension the results showed that the two branched polymer at optimal polymer dosage demonstrates the highest flocculation rate constant compared to the linear polymer on the other hand mikola and tanskanen 101 studied the novel coagulant aluminium formate on the removal of colloidal latex particles from industrial wastewater the coagulant aluminium formate has produced a better removal efficiency of colloidal latex particles with lower turbidity of 0 7 ntu compared to the conventional coagulant polyaluminium chloride 1 4 ntu the separation was enhanced by the addition of polyacrylamide coagulant aid to facilitate the separation of flocs by simple sedimentation due to the significant increase in floc size later riveros 101 integrated the treatment using aluminium polychloride pac as a coagulant and anionic polyacrylamide pam as flocculant for the latex paint industry wastewater the addition of pac to the wastewater removes tss tds cod and turbidity while pam improves the sedimentation rate the treated water can meet the quality standards and 56 of the raw wastewater is recycled back into the process apart from adding coagulant and flocculant chemicals electrocoagulation ec could be used where the metal hydroxides are produced from the dissolution of a metal electrode in the solution with the help of an electrical current the metal hydroxides efficiently remove the organic compounds and other contaminants from wastewater 102 abraham radhakrishnan nair and madhu 12 have performed ec treatment of skim serum wastewater from nr latex centrifuging units effect of different electrodes such as aluminium stainless steel mild steel and cast iron was investigated aluminium anode was reported to be more efficient in removing pollutants and maximum removal of bod 99 5 was attained within 30 min of electrolysis this is owing to the greater charge neutralization of colloidal particles by positively charged metal ions generated in situ by electrolysis nevertheless the major downside of coagulation flocculation is the post treatment of sludge where the sludge has to be removed through the process of filtration which increases the operation cost recently the hydroponic system can be employed as a post treatment process for partially treated wastewater as the crop plants grow using nutrient rich wastewater rubber industry wastewater consists of nitrogen phosphorus potassium magnesium and calcium which are crucial nutrient elements for plant growth owamah enaboifo and izinyon 103 have treated the wastewater from raw rubber processing industry using hydroponic water lettuce macrophyte pond significant reductions for most parameters phosphate nitrates ph bod conductivity and tds were obtained the final wastewater has met the allowable limits of the who for discharge into water bodies except for tss and turbidity in addition raw rubber wastewater was also found to boost up the height stem girth leaf area and biomass yield of maize plant nevertheless more research should be conducted on the plant nutritive values to protect public health by adhering to international and national safety rules 3 3 integrated treatment integrated processes offer the benefit of individual processes and compensate for the limitations of each process therefore yielding an improved wastewater treatment efficiency 104 105 table 7 shows the recent integrated treatments for rubber industry wastewater as shown most of the integrated processes involved in treatments for rubber industry wastewater involves coagulation flocculation adsorption and biological process 3 3 1 physical chemical as illustrated in table 7 coagulation flocculation is typically integrated as pre treatment prior to the biological treatment to remove the residual organic matter hatamoto et al 106 have pretreated deproteinized nr wastewater using calcium chloride cacl2 as coagulant before anaerobic treatment in a uasb reactor it is reported that coagulation efficiency removed the sodium dodecyl sulfate sds under the detection limit 0 5 mg l hence the methane gas produced during the anaerobic process contains very minimum concentration of sulfate and h2s besides methane conversion was enhanced due to the removal of sds as microorganism inhibitor by coagulation however the cacl2 coagulant precipitated and formed a whitish gray sediments subsequently cause long term accumulation hence periodic cleaning of the reactor is required in long term operation similar result was obtained by nguyen et al 24 using aluminium sulphate flocculant on rubber latex processing wastewater prior to the anaerobic treatment in a continuous stirred tank reactor the pretreated rubber latex processing wastewater with reduced cod bod and tss concentrations of 184 110 and 125 mg l provided suitable culture environment which well adapted by hydrogen producing bacteria hence this generates a maximum cumulative hydrogen yield of 221 35 ml l after 28 h apart from coagulation flocculation advanced oxidation processes aop for instance fenton ozonation electrooxidation have been combined with other techniques such as adsorption coagulation flocculation and membrane filtration 107 this is because the single stage aops are reported to achieve only partial mineralization of pollutants which may produce more toxic intermediates 108 the post treatment after aops not only further removes the pollutants discharged to the receiving water but also realize the recycling of treated water and the sustainable development of water resources paul et al 109 have treated rubber processing industry wastewater using a sequential coagulation flocculation and sonolytic oxidation in india it was found that the integrated aluminium sulfate coagulation flocculation followed by sonolytic oxidation using both persulfate and hydrogen peroxide achieved the highest cod removal 91 24 and treatment cost of 16 55 usd kg cod however the treated wastewater still contains cod above the permissible limit 250 mg l and further appropriate treatments are required to dispose of the wastewater in the aquatic environment safely agustina sirait and silalahi 21 have treated the rubber industrial wastewater using fenton followed by adsorption ferrous sulphate was used as fenton reagent and the fe2 participates in the photo fenton reaction by reacting with h2o2 resulting in the production of ho radical the ho radical oxidizes the organic substances to carbon dioxide and water later activated carbon can adsorb the pollutants which were difficult degraded by ho radical consequently a maximum cod removal of 95 was attained by an integrated fenton adsorption process where the treated wastewater met the environmental quality standard regulation in indonesia later nidheesh et al 110 combined electro fenton ef and ec to treat mixed industrial wastewater from chemical plants such as oil cotton textile rubber and plastic the integrated electrochemical processes achieved high overall cod removal of 85 27 cod after 2 h treatment besides it is reported that ef ec configuration is a better strategy than ec ef as the post ec neutralizes the wastewater from ef to the dischargeable limit kusworo kumoro utomo et al 111 have integrated adsorption and ozonation prior to membrane filtration in the treatment of nr wastewater the adsorption consists of adsorber column packed with bentonite granules followed by ozonation with constant injection rate of 3000 mg o3 h the post membrane filtration using nanocomposite membrane modified by tio2 and crosslinked pva has improved the membrane perm selectivity properties the pva coating 3 0 wt on the pes tio2 membrane substantially improved the removal of cod tds and nh3 n by 244 80 56 70 and 5 29 respectively compared with the pristine pes tio2 membrane this is due to the denser membrane formed between the pva and tio2 molecule through van der waals forces and hydrogen bond hence provides higher selectivity 3 3 2 physical biological as mentioned in section 3 2 2 membrane fouling is the major obstacle to membrane separation the deposition and accumulation of foulants on top of the membrane surface deteriorates the performance of membrane therefore membrane process is typically combined with biological process in a membrane bioreactor mbr to improve the treatment performance via mitigating fouling 112 the presence of membrane enables activated sludge immobilization in the reactor which results in both higher biomass content and biodiversity sulaiman ibrahim and abdullah 8 first explored the use of mbr to treat wastewater discharged from lc processing plants the optimum operating flux for fouling mitigation was obtained from the sub critical flux region to be 0 009 m3 m2 h at a cod loading of 3500 mg l using the optimum operating flux the mbr can be operated for over a month without chemical cleaning thus lower operation cost besides high removal efficiencies of bod3 and cod were achieved at 96 78 and 96 99 respectively however the bod of the treated failed to comply with the department of environment doe discharge limit and longer hrt would be required alternatively post treatment procedures can be implemented polish up the wastewater to meet discharge or reuse limits this is confirmed by kim et al 113 with the use of mbr nf in treating wastewater from plant that produce rubber and plastics in the mbr the removal efficiencies of bod5 codmn and toc were 79 76 1 and 72 2 respectively after being treated with mbr the wastewater is further subjected to nf membrane filtration to reduce the toc concentration to comply with the discharge standard of 180 mg l in addition charfi et al 114 developed a complete model for anaerobic mbr anmbr treating latex serum produced from skim latex filtration the developed model was well fitted by both biological data tss cod and vfa r2 0 99 and tmp data r2 0 9 this mechanistic model is useful in understanding and predicting membrane fouling as well as on line control of an anmbr process 3 3 3 other integrated treatment besides biological processes the membrane process is also integrated with other processes to treat rubber industry wastewater some recent examples are thermal and electrochemical process xin et al 115 have combined two stage nf and evaporation process at pilot scale for high strength rubber wastewater treatment in cikautxo spain fig 8 treatment with nf270 4040 modules reduced over 95 cod from the rubber wastewater and the concentrated feed stream is subjected to an evaporator to produce distillate with lower conductivity the treated water can be recovered as process water however it requires further hardness treatment to meet boiling feed water standards the integrated nf and evaporation system effectively reduced energy costs from 4 2 m3 to 1 9 m3 treated wastewater 55 suggesting full scale applications more recently nookwam et al 116 explored the application of microbial fuel cell mfc to convert chemical energy from wastewater into alternative bioenergy the membrane function in mfc is not only separating the pollutants but also transferring protons from the anode to the cathode the study has investigated wastewater from various agro industries such as swine rubber seafood and palm oil among wastewaters investigated mfc fed with anaerobic digester wastewater from the rubber industry yield the maximum power density 55 43 1 08 w m3 and high removal efficiency of cod nitrogen and phosphorus 72 4 0 9 40 5 0 8 and 24 4 1 5 respectively this is because anaerobic digester wastewater from the rubber industry contains high concentration of sulfate the sulfate ions increase ionic strength and enhance proton transfers thus reducing the ohmic loss of the system 117 4 challenges and future prospects the major challenges of conventional wastewater treatment technologies for the rubber processing industry include the need for large areas ponding systems high operation and maintenance costs and high energy requirements for the aerobic treatment system aerator although the ponding system is easy to operate and has low operating costs it is not suitable for plants located in urban areas where land is expensive as it requires large footprint besides the ponding system causes malodour problems especially for plants located near residential areas 118 the malodour is mainly caused by gases released from smr rubber processing plants from dryers and rubber storage areas and h2s gas from plants processing concentrated latex using anaerobic facultative ponding systems 119 in addition the performance of conventional treatment systems is inconsistent and could pose major problems in complying with the regulatory requirement for instance despite most of the rubber processing plants in malaysia have implemented appropriate wastewater treatment systems their effectiveness in complying with the wastewater discharge standards set by the doe in malaysia is unsatisfactory 120 most rubber plants still have difficulties meeting the discharge standards especially for the parameters bod and nitrogen this situation occurs mainly when rubber plants increase the production volume beyond the level when designing the relevant wastewater treatment system besides the rubber industry wastewater has to meet the increasingly stringent discharge standards in many countries worldwide for instance doe in malaysia has imposed a more stringent effluent discharge requirement for all plants processing raw rubber in the southern state johor of malaysia since 2017 this is in line with the johor state government s intention to improve the quality of rivers across the state the stringent effluent standards for the lc and smr plant effluent are shown in table 8 and table 9 respectively unfortunately most of the lc and smr plants in johor cannot meet the stringent discharge standards especially the parameters cod and nh3 n in order to comply with the new discharge standards these plants must either upgrade their existing wastewater treatment plant or build an advanced and modern new wastewater treatment plant that is more practical economically feasible and also adopts the best available technology approach 121 in addition with the new global trend of sustainable development wastewater treatment in rubber processing should be established as a green alternative focusing on waste minimization and efficient utilization of natural resources 122 123 new approaches to achieving green industry status with zero waste discharge for the nr industry require an integrated approach that covers the major aspects of rubber processing from collection through preservation transportation processing and wastewater treatment moreover these aspects are interrelated and have significant implications for developing new technologies for minimizing wastewater discharge and promoting wastewater recycling and utilization 102 essentially these approaches minimize wastewater discharge and the trend is to transform from waste to wealth in line with the principles of the circular economy in addition the latest research on producing nitrogen gas as the product of ammonia oxidation in wastewater could be considered 124 125 lastly effective wastewater treatment systems are needed to reduce the production costs and environmental impact of rubber processing 126 127 5 conclusions untreated wastewater discharged from rubber based industries harmfully affects the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem due to the reduced water quality hence it is necessary to perform advanced treatment of rubber industry wastewater to further remove pollutants and meet stringent environmental regulations the advanced wastewater treatment method can be categorized as single stage and integrated stages each method has pros and cons biological treatment is simple and suitable for the treatment of nitrogen compounds in rubber industry wastewater however it requires large installation area and long retention time on the other hand membrane treatment requires a small footprint produces high quality water and low energy consumption but membrane fouling is a major problem that hinders their widespread and large scale applications whereas chemical treatment such as coagulation flocculation and aops is less cost effective and could lead to secondary pollution of water bodies in general the choice of advanced wastewater treatment methods can be made based on 1 degree of a method required to bring the wastewater quality to a permissible level 2 flexibility of the control method 3 cost of the process and 4 environmental compatibility typically an integrated treatment process offers many advantages by merging the benefit of individual components to compensate for the limitations of each treatment the integrated treatment process is more cost effective technically viable and economically affordable in producing high quality treated water for recycling reuse recently advances in nanoengineering and nanotechnology have also improved the treatment of rubber industry wastewater owing to their unique physical and chemical characteristics the nanomaterials could be incorporated into the membrane as nanofillers to enhance water permeability permeate flux and antifouling capability the nanomaterials could also be used as nanoadsorbents to bind pollutants from rubber industry wastewater future work should focus on the synthesis of nanomaterials from sustainable materials like plant based sources and carbon wastes this review also reveals the challenges and future perspectives that should be concentrated in future research to enable sustainable and integrated water management in the rubber industry it could be achieved by strong water resources plan and enforcement of regulations to meet the demand of socioeconomic development while ensuring the environmental integrity of

12576,with rapid industrialization enormous amounts of wastewater have been released from the rubber industry into the environment from different industrial processes such as latex concentrate and standard block rubber the rubber industry wastewater must be treated before discharge into common water bodies this review paper presents the recent advances in treatment methods for rubber industry wastewater particularly in biological processes membrane processes coagulation flocculation and advanced oxidation processes besides this review paper discovers more about the potential of integrated methods which apply the synergetic effectiveness of processes to achieve the recycling of treated wastewater and the sustainable development of water resources special emphasis has been laid upon the type of rubber industry wastewater operating condition and performance of the treatment methods along with their pros and cons selection of appropriate treatment strategy lies on the feedwater conditions site restriction water requirement stability of treatment process cost effectiveness energy efficiency and environmental friendliness despite many treatment methods presenting superior performance many of them possess limitations and have not progressed to the industrial scale lastly challenges and future perspectives in developing treatment technology for rubber industry wastewater are proposed to achieve sustainable and integrated water management graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rubber industry wastewater wastewater treatment integrated treatment process sustainable process development data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction natural rubber nr is a polymeric hydrocarbon composed primarily of poly cis 1 4 isoprene chains which exhibit extraordinary tensile properties 1 nr is harvested from the commercial tropical rubber tree hevea brasiliensis via tapping 2 the hevea brasiliensis rubber tree is initially grown at the amazon river basin and can be harvested after six years of cultivation 3 in 1896 henry wickham introduced the cultivation of hevea brasiliensis rubber tree to malaysia as the tropical climate in malaysia is favourable to the growth of hevea brasiliensis rubber tree 4 afterwards the plantation of hevea brasiliensis rubber tree was ampliated to southeast asia and subsequently led to the domination of nr production in southeast asia 5 currently thailand indonesia vietnam china india cote d ivoire and malaysia are the main rubber producers amounting to over 90 of total production in the world 5 although these countries can produce large amount of rubber the demand would not be satisfied as the consumption rate is higher than the production rate for instance the production of nr in china was 816 103 t whereas consumption was as high as 4 680 000 t in 2015 6 therefore china depends greatly on importing nr mainly from southeast asia top suppliers for example thailand and malaysia however the world consumption of nr dropped by 18 6 annually during the first two months of 2020 as the manufacturing industry has been relentlessly affected due to the covid 19 pandemic simultaneously the covid 19 pandemic has boosted the nr industry as demand for certain healthcare products such as medical gloves and masks 7 in general the raw nr can be used to produce two main products latex concentrate lc and standard block rubber 8 lc processing aims to produce concentrated latex that can be used in manufacturing dipped rubber products for instance gloves balloons condoms rubber thread and infant pacifiers 9 lc processing includes three main processes centrifugation coagulation and washing as shown in fig 1 10 firstly ammonia is added to the field latex to prevent bacteria growth under alkaline conditions while various chemicals are added for latex conditioning 11 then ammoniated field latex containing 30 33 rubber is concentrated using high speed centrifuges to produce centrifuged latex and skim latex the centrifuges latex contains 60 rubber while skim latex contains 4 6 rubber finally skim latex containing 0 8 ammonia is coagulated with 98 sulfuric acid to make a byproduct called skim rubber 12 on the other hand standard block rubber is technically specified crumb rubber conformed to the layout by the international organization for standardization the grade specifications of standard block rubber have been adopted and accepted by producing and consuming countries besides the standard block rubber can be graded differently for manufacturing different quality rubber products for instance the standard malaysian rubber smr classified nr latex into different grades based on the concentration of main impurities dirt ash nitrogen volatile matter and properties as shown in table 1 similar parameters with ranged limits were imposed in some countries such as thailand 13 indonesia 14 and vietnam 15 in general the standard block rubber involves three main steps including 1 coagulation 2 crushing and milling followed by 3 hot air drying and pressing in blocks 16 raw nr processing produces large amounts of wastewater which is highly polluted with nitrogen compounds and organic and inorganic matters due to the highly contaminated rubber industry wastewater the wastewater must be treated according to the discharge standard before being released into the water source many studies have been conducted to investigate the best treatment methods for rubber industry wastewater fig 2 shows the number of publications linked to the topic of rubber wastewater treatment in the past ten years as shown the number of publications linked to this topic has escalated rapidly since 2013 besides it is worth noting that the review paper constitutes 10 44 28 80 of the total number of publications linked to this topic and increasing tremendously over the years however most review papers focus on the targeted rubber industry and specific treatment methods there is no state of art review on recent advances in treatment methods for various type of rubber industry wastewater to fill this gap in the literature this review paper aims to comprehensively review on the treatment methods including type of rubber industry wastewater operating condition and performance of the treatment methods along with their pros and cons 2 rubber industry wastewater quality and discharge standard according to tanikawa et al 18 processing 1 ton of nr produced 20 35 m3 of wastewater which comprised of the high content of ammonia as substantial ammonia is used in nr processing to prevent latex coagulation the wastewater quality of rubber processing at thailand indonesia vietnam india and malaysia was tabulated in table 2 slight differences in the wastewater quality were observed in table 2 which could be due to different sampling points and the use of chemical in general high chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod were generally found in the wastewater due to the presence of uncoagulated latex lipids and inorganic compounds from various processing stages 19 high concentrations of nitrogen compounds in the wastewater were due to the use of ammonia and sulfuric acid on another hand the raw smr wastewater consisted of lower value of cod and bod compared to lc wastewater as size reduction and dirt removal processes in smr process involved mainly the physical process rather than chemical process as compared to lc processing according to rosman et al 19 the cod and bod of smr wastewater was within 1850 2960 mg l and 890 1380 mg l respectively the concentration of ammonia was 49 57 mg l at ph 7 25 7 5 research was also conducted to evaluate the wastewater quality released from the rubber industry in different countries in nigeria it is found that the rubber industry wastewater discharge greatly affected the macroinvertebrate species in niger delta 29 the freshwater macroinvertebrate species vary in sensitivity to organic pollution thus their relative population has been used to make inferences about pollution load it is reported that the number of macroinvertebrate species was 63 at the location prior to the rubber industry wastewater discharge point while only 38 species were found at the wastewater discharge point this is due to the deteriorated turbidity total suspended solids nitrite nitrate ammonia conductivity and cod at the wastewater discharge point besides it is reported that firestone liberia s rubber processing facility produced wastewater with high concentration of heavy metals such as aluminium and copper which polluted the farmington river sub basin including wetlands and yur chu 30 the concentration of manganese and ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n in owensgrove creek has exceeded the world health organization who limit for human consumption table 3 tabulates the rubber industry wastewater discharge standard in thailand indonesia vietnam india and malaysia which are among the largest nr producers in the world 31 generally bod cod suspended solid nh3 n and ph are among the most important parameters in determining the quality of rubber industry wastewater the range of bod3 bod5 cod suspended solid nh3 n and ph are 50 100 mg l 20 100 mg l 50 400 mg l 50 200 mg l 5 300 mg l and 5 5 9 respectively comparatively the discharge standard adopted in thailand indonesia vietnam and india is more stringent than in malaysia notably both india and malaysia adopted bod3 instead of bod5 in qualifying the rubber industry wastewater which varies in the incubation periods and the temperature besides total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn which indicates the total of organic nitrogen and nh3 n is considered the sole parameter to measure nitrogen pollutants in thailand 32 as shown in the table 3 thailand and indonesia have only one standard for rubber industry wastewater while vietnam india and malaysia have two standards depending on the location of the discharge and or type of rubber processing in vietnam standard a is to be adopted if the discharge is released to the water source used for daily human activities otherwise standard b is applicable 23 33 similar regulation is observed in india the rubber industry wastewater has to comply with more stringent standards if the wastewater is discharged to inland surface water compared to the discharge on land for irrigation 34 35 in malaysia the discharge quality depends on the rubber processes where regulation 12 is adopted for concentrated latex production while regulation 14 is for the production of products other than concentrated latex or its associated products 36 unfortunately most rubber processing industries cannot comply with the desired discharge quality due to the severely contaminated rubber industry wastewater for instance a few concentrated latex processing plants in vietnam discharged wastewater with 466 to 567 mg l cod 57 92 mg l bod and 67 120 mg l tn which exceeded the standard b water discharge limited 23 in india water samples at the discharge point of a raw rubber processing company contain high conductivity acidic ph and nitrate within the range of 198 229 s m 4 0 to 4 3 and 2 21 to 2 30 mg l respectively which were higher than the tripura state pollution control board standard 37 in malaysia the water quality index of the water quality monitoring station near the rubber plant was graded as class iii indicating extensive treatment is required 38 this scenario has triggered the advancement of treatment methods for rubber industry wastewater which will be discussed in the following section 3 recent advances in treatment method for rubber industry wastewater this section discusses the recent advances in treatment methods for rubber industry wastewater which will be categorized into single stage and integrated treatment the single stage treatment includes biological membrane coagulation flocculation and other methods in contrast integrated treatment involves combining two or more single stage treatments in rubber industry wastewater 3 1 search strategy a comprehensive search was conducted electronically to identify published papers relevant to rubber industry wastewater treatment up to the paper submission the search was conducted in two main databases including web of science and scopus the searches however were not limited to only bibliographic databases as google scholar was also used to identify conference proceedings thesis law regulations and book chapters in view of the conventional treatment methods were reviewed by mitra et al 27 in 2010 therefore the representative studies discussed in this review are mainly based on the literature published in the recent ten years to review the recent advances in treatment technology critically search terms were carefully designed to ensure the search was comprehensive as some terms are used interchangeably afterwards the publications were screened based on the title and abstract then the papers are categorized based on the types of treatment and arranged in chronological order to map the current and future trends for advances in the water treatment strategy for rubber industry wastewater lastly the publications were screened based on the full text and extracted for critical review 3 2 single stage treatment 3 2 1 biological 3 2 1 1 anaerobic treatment process table 4 shows the recent anaerobic biological treatments for rubber industry wastewater as shown the biological treatment for rubber industry wastewater can be mainly categorized into anaerobic aerobic and anaerobic aerobic systems in general an anaerobic process is preferred as biogas such as biomethane and biohydrogen are produced via a rapid breakdown process of organic substances from rubber industry wastewater in order to enhance the production of biogas hydrogen and methane kongjan jariyaboon and o thong 42 have treated skim latex serum sls using two stage up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors operated under thermophilic it is reported that two stage uasb generated an optimum hydrogen production yield of 2 25 0 09 l h2 l sls at 36 h of hrt meanwhile the methane production yield of 6 41 0 52 l ch4 l sls can be attained at 9 d of hrt both hydrogen and methane yield obtained by the two stage uasb was greater than the yield achieved by batch fermentation later jariyaboon o thong and kongjan 43 further manipulated concentrations of sls from 37 5 to 75 0 v v in the two stage uasb reactors the maximum methane production yield was achieved at 12 2 l ch4 l sls with 60 v v sls this is attributed to the mixed microbial inoculums at 60 v v sls contains high microbial diversity comprising both acidogens and methanogens that consume acidigenisic metabolites as their substrate nevertheless the yield ceased at higher sls loadings of 60 v v owing to the insufficient nutrient buffer capacity as there was low basic anaerobic medium kongjan et al 44 later co digested sls with palm oil mill wastewater at a mixing ratio of 55 45 on the basis of volatile solid vs and obtained higher methane yield of 311 2 8 0 ml ch4 g vsadded this is attributed to the palm oil mill wastewater fermentation containing appropriate long chain fatty acids lcfas produced from hydrolysis of lipid in pome consequently enhance methane production besides codigesting sls with palm oil mill wastewater reduced the ammonia concentration contained in sls which produced the proper alkalinity for methane formation lerdrattranataywee and kaosol 45 further studied the effect of mixing time on anaerobic co digestion of decanter cake from palm oil mill and block rubber wastewater similar performance was obtained where the highest biogas production was observed with 10 day hrt and 12 h day mixing time besides the addition of electron donors into the anaerobic system could enhance methanogenesis during the anaerobic process of rubber industry wastewater paepatung et al 46 investigated the effectiveness of zero valent iron zvi in improving anaerobic digestion and biogas production from synthetic wastewater containing cod so4 2 ratio 2 to 3 resemble to rubber skim wastewater it is found that zvi enhances electron transfer activities of microbes in the reactor consequently leading to higher activities of methane forming microbes hence increasing methane production of 0 25 l ch4 g codadded day later paepatung et al 47 found that zvi supplied extra electrons for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and ferrous ions that could co precipitate with sulfides hence this reduced the inhibition of acetoclastic methanogens from undissociated h2s fig 3 shows the images of magnetic particles attached to zvi after the anaerobic treatment furthermore the addition of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polymer and rubber wood ash rwa into wastewater produced from concentrated rubber latex plants and desulfated sls dsls has been studied by chaiprapat et al 48 and raketh et al 49 respectively for instance raketh et al 50 investigated the effect of mixing time and rwa loading on the removal of sulfate from sls the optimum sulfate removal efficiency of 42 was attained at mixing time of 10 min and rwa loading of 10 g l the sulfate removal from the sls solution is proposed to resemble sulfates adsorption on a volcanic ash soil surface through ligand exchange with the oh group later raketh et al 49 studied the efficiency of single stage anaerobic digestion ssad and two stage anaerobic digestion tsad of dsls using rwa loadings it is observed that the methane yields in ssad and tsad were not significantly different ranged within 269 35 305 09 ml ch4 g codadded day however tsad is not economically attractive as payback time for tsad 4 36 years is longer than that of ssad 2 52 years despite a higher energy recovery of 5 3 2 1 2 aerobic treatment process for aerobic treatment of rubber industry wastewater aeration plays crucial role in the rate of aerobic breakdown of organic substances by bacteria chaiprapat et al 53 investigated the effects of retention time rt and air mix ratio on the performance and kinetics of the aerobic biofilm reactor 1 8 l in h2s removal from wastewater discharged by concentrated rubber latex plants at the highest air mix ratio biogas to air ratio 1 4 h2s could be reduced to below 500 mg l with the highest h2s removal of 94 7 at rt of 160 s besides high removal of cod ammonia and tn was attained at 98 4 92 7 and 89 5 respectively yang et al 54 also studied the effect of aeration strategies in aquaculture wastewater treatment by sequencing batch biofilm reactor it is found that post aeration was beneficial to the consistency of the nitrifier abundance and activity of the key nitrifying enzyme hence enhancing the removal efficiency of ammonium nh4 n in addition the use of limited oxygen for aerobic treatment of rubber industry wastewater has been explored using oxygen limited autotrophic nitritation denitrification oland to treat latex processing wastewater fig 4 55 the highest tn removal 94 was achieved under oxygen limiting conditions with do in a range of 0 1 to 0 2 mg l this wastewater quality met the maximum limit of cod and nitrogen compound of the treated latex processing wastewater quality standards in vietnam consistent results were obtained using a micro oxygen hybrid reactor mohr in treating concentrated latex wastewater 56 the mohr is a two zone reactor comprised of a suspended sludge zone and attached biofilm zone operating at dissolved oxygen of 0 10 0 15 mg l the mohr optimal removal efficiencies for sulfate so4 2 tkn and cod were 90 3 67 8 and 93 0 respectively at hrt of 10 d apart from aeration sludge can be optimized to facilitate the aerobic digestion of rubber industry wastewater rosman et al 19 initiated the study of aerobic granular sludge systems for wastewater treatment from the rubber industry the aerobic granular sludge systems operate at a working volume of 600 ml aeration volumetric flowrate of 0 12 m3 h mlss of 5300 mg l and volumetric exchange ratio ver of 50 compact and stable aerobic granular sludge with great settleability and an average diameter of 1 5 mm was cultivated successfully besides high removal efficiencies of cod ammonia and tn 89 4 96 5 were obtained towards the end of the granulation period of 3 months later rosman et al 57 further studied the effect of hydraulic rt hrt 6 12 and 24 h on the physical characteristics of sludge granules and the performance of a sequencing batch reactor treating rubber industry wastewater it is reported that low hrt of 6 h encouraged the development of larger granular sludge with great settleability high biomass density and stronger structure similar removal efficiencies of cod ammonia and tn were attained in a shorter period 6 h compared to the previous study 19 furthermore few studies have worked on the isolation and identification of microorganisms such as pseudomonas sp arthrobacter sp indigenous purple nonsulfur bacteria pnsb and rhodopseudomonas palustris for the treatment of rubber industry wastewater 58 62 bacteria including pseudomonas sp arthrobacter sp were successfully isolated from rubber industry wastewater located at discharge points of a rubber plant in mysore india this is in accordance with studies by krainara et al 63 where pseudomonas sp was the dominant genus at approximately 70 of the total population found in rubber industrial wastewater both pseudomonas sp and arthrobacter sp bacteria can reduce substantial amount of total solids 71 9 73 suspended solids 74 6 75 7 dissolved solids 67 6 68 8 bod 70 4 72 1 cod 76 8 79 4 ammonia 66 0 71 3 and phosphate 62 5 68 8 after 15 d of incubation with higher removal attained by pseudomonas sp 58 59 both studies have successfully reduced the bod and cod of wastewater from the rubber processing industry to the discharge level similar observation was also obtained by kornochalert et al 61 using phototrophic bacteria like pnsb i e rhodopseudomonas palustris p1 to treat latex rubber sheet wastewater the latex rubber sheet wastewater was added with fermented pineapple extract fpe under microaerobic light conditions the fpe acts as growth simulator for the pnsb by supplementing simple substrates like acetate and lactate that are easily digested by pnsb it is reported reduction of cod 91 suspended solids 75 total sulfide 61 and h2s 100 using 7 pnsbsi 0 8 fpe and 4 d rt later kornochalert et al 64 optimized the bioremediation of rhodopseudomonas palustris p1 fpe using a central composite design the optimized removal is achieved using 3 stimulated p1 inoculum with 0 9 added fpe and a 4 d rt higher removal efficiency of cod 98 suspended solids 79 total sulfide 72 and h2s 100 was obtained using the optimized formulation apart from pineapple extract as growth simulator wood vinegar has been employed as a levulinic acid source for pnsb to produce useful byproduct 5 aminolevulinic acid which can be used as herbicide and insecticide 62 65 3 2 1 3 anaerobic aerobic treatment process as shown in table 5 the sequential anaerobic aerobic process has drawn much attention for wastewater treatment as it showed exceptional performance than single stage aerobic or anaerobic treatment the integrated anaerobic aerobic system for the treatment of rubber industry wastewater was pioneered by tanikawa et al 18 with a two stage uasb and down flow hanging sponge dhs system in the two stage uasb the rubber industry wastewater was digested for hydrogen and methane production uasb wastewater discharged from the first stage of uasb was recycled as feed at a recirculation ratio of 2 1 then the remaining uasb wastewater was sent for aerobic post treatment in the dhs the dhs lowered power consumption by 97 and the volume of excess sludge by 98 in overall the system attained high cod removal efficiency of 95 7 at an organic loading rate of 0 8 kg cod m3 d the two stage uasb removed 80 of sulfate while the dhs oxidized the remaining organic matter and sulfide the research group also identified the key factors for residual rubber coagulation in dhs are wastewater air and wastewater core rubber contacts hence recommended the installation of opened contact type pretreatment system for rubber recovery such as a core rubber seeded trickling filter later tanikawa et al 66 incorporated a pre treatment canal ptc seeded with lumps of rubber blocks prior to the anaerobic baffled reactor abr and a dhs reactor it was found that the residual rubber in the wastewater was coagulated and accumulated at the surface of the rubber blocks at the end of operation in short the ptc not only recover residual rubber 16 6 through coagulation but also enhances the removal efficiencies of organic matter cod 76 0 8 2 in the abr and nitrogen ammonia 70 3 4 3 in the dhs reactor besides the water quality of the treated wastewater met the vietnamese standards for the nr industry apart from uasb and dhs configuration tanikawa et al 67 investigated a two stage trickling filter tf system that consisted of a closed type first stage tf and an open type second stage tf fig 5 coconut chips were employed as low cost packing media in tf reactors and can be recovered as fertilizer or mulching material after exhausted due to its non toxic nature and rich in nutrients the two stage tf system attained high removal efficiency of hydrogen sulfide h2s and nitrogen and can be used for high s n ratio wastewater such as latex wastewater furthermore the application of mini scale dhs as post treatment of an existing combined anaerobic tank in an nr processing plant in south vietnam has been studied by watari et al 68 the existing anaerobic tank efficiently removes high concentrations of organic contaminants nevertheless the wastewater from the anaerobic tank still has substantial amount of organic matter and ammonia the post treatment by dhs demonstrated excellent removal efficiencies of cod 64 2 7 5 and tn 55 3 19 2 afterwards watari et al 69 constructed a pilot scale uasb dhs integrated with an abr and a settling tank in a similar nr processing plant fig 6 the process performance of the integrated system with a capacity of 10 000 m3 year was investigated for 267 d the final wastewater of the proposed system attained similar quality to the current treatment system with reduced hrt by 80 and ghgs emissions by 92 however the ammonia content in the final wastewater of the integrated system was unable to meet the mandatory vietnamese national technical regulation on the wastewater of the nr processing industry standard b 40 mg n l however more work needs to be done to accomplish effective nitrogen removal and environmental sustainability of energy recovery 3 2 2 membrane membrane filtration was known to be viable in the different detachment process because of notable highlights like minimal chemical utilization and can be utilized in the commercial process where the operation is continuous 72 generally microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf membranes have been used to reclaim surface waters 73 moreover the nanofiltration nf membrane is used for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation 74 75 most of the membrane processes involved in treatments for rubber industry wastewater are uf and nf which will be discussed in depth in the following section 76 3 2 2 1 ultrafiltration table 6 shows the recent uf treatments for rubber industry wastewater uf received great attention for treating rubber industry wastewater as it can operate under low pressure less energy consumption due to the moderate pore size 5 100 nm 77 however membrane fouling is one of the main factors hindering the widespread uf application membrane fouling leads to higher operational cost higher energy demand reduced membrane lifetime and increased cleaning frequency 78 membrane cleaning such as physical base and acid cleaning steps can be conducted periodically to recover the membrane flux hence performance veerasamy and ismail 79 established procedures for effective membrane cleaning for the membrane fouled during the nr skim lc process to optimize membrane cleaning cost flux recoveries above 90 can be attained by post ultrasonic cleaning at 50 c after chemical cleaning using naoh or hno3 the membrane module would be completely immersed in ultrasonic bath to enhance the effect of ultrasonic on the membrane module on top of chemical cleaning ultrasonication provided the additional force to flush out the irreversible foulants from the membrane pores which caused an increase of 4 in cumulative flux recoveries besides studies have been conducted to model the fouling and foulant attachments on uf membrane towards latex solution abdelrasoul et al 80 have employed predictive models for the mass of fouling on several flat membranes under a constant flow rate and crossflow mode the predictive models produce satisfactory accuracy for the three flat membranes ultrafilic cellulose acetate and polysulfone psf membranes with error range of 8 0 12 4 6 7 8 1 and 2 2 11 1 respectively the predictive models can be used to understand the fouling phenomenon subsequently introduce fouling control strategies to reduce the energy demands improve membrane lifetime and lessen other operational costs more recently significant scientific attention has been paid to the development of antifouling membrane via membrane modification to enhance the hydrophilicity of the membrane 81 82 the hydrophilic membrane prevents fouling due to its lesser affinity to organic materials in wastewater 83 84 membrane hydrophilicity can be dramatically improved with the use of electron beam the electron beam irradiation can be used for the scission of the membrane polymer molecular chain leading to random rupturing of bonds and the crosslinking of polymer molecules this result in the modification to the free volume and free volume distribution within the polymer matrix hence membrane hydrophilicity ruangdit et al 85 have modified the membrane containing titanium oxide tio2 by electron beam irradiation at energies of 3 mev and 10 mev for irradiation doses of 10 kgy and 50 kgy followed by single step grafting using acrylic acid aac and sodium styrene sulfonate sss it is reported that the membrane irradiated at 10 mev and 50 kgy demonstrated the highest hydrophilicity with a water contact angle of 35 2 and high flux recovery ratio frr of 97 8 and 95 9 respectively after filtration with nr serum this is because greater electron beam power and radiation dose enhanced the degree of aac sss grafting this increased the membrane surface energy attracted water molecules and increased surface hydrophilicity however contradicting finding was obtained by kusworo and wulandari 86 by performing uv irradiation on membrane doped with reduced graphene oxide rgo tio2 it is reported that the longer the irradiation time the lower the permeability it was because uv irradiation could increase the density of the polymer of the psf membrane and tighten the chain bonds of each polymer compound uv irradiation would make polymer chains rearrange spaces and fill gaps to fill the volume between polymers this resulted in lower permeability and faster fouling occurrence therefore it is important to control the electron beam dosage and irradiation time to optimize the antifouling capacity of the membrane apart from electron beam irradiation membrane modification with hydrophilic materials was reported to improve their intrinsic properties reducing the fouling propensity 87 besides the addition of hydrophilic materials into the membrane provides hybrid membrane with improved properties indicative of the individual properties exhibited by the added materials nazri et al 10 have incorporated hydrophilic graft copolymer polyvinyl alcohol pva and polyacrylonitrile pan pan g pva into pan based hollow fiber membranes for the treatment of nr wastewater the modified membrane with the highest percentage of grafting and grafting efficiency has displayed superior performance with lower irreversible fouling of 11 16 and higher frr of 84 and 76 for the first two filtration cycles respectively this is because the presence of pva on the membrane surface increased the hydroxyl groups which is favourable for creating hydrophilic surfaces this subsequently enhanced water permeability and antifouling properties in addition nanomaterials have been employed to produce nanocomposite membranes for the treatment of rubber industry wastewater for instance graphene oxide go rgo zinc oxide zno tio2 silicon dioxide sio2 86 88 89 these nanomaterials are usually incorporated into membrane matrices to work synergistically with the membrane to treat polluted water efficiently recently a new class of nanocomposite membranes was reported by incorporating two types of nanomaterials into the membrane matrix this class of membranes demonstrated outstanding membrane performance compared with the respective nanocomposite membrane composed of a single nanomaterial attributed to the synergistic effect among the different nanomaterials kusworo kumoro aryanti et al 89 have incorporated dual filler rgo zno into the polyethersulfone pes membrane to treat nr wastewater it is reported that the frr of the pes zno 82 pes rgo 80 21 and pes rgo zno 83 nanocomposite membrane was 7 12 higher than neat pes membrane the improvement of frr by adding nanomaterials could be due to the improvement of surface hydrophilicity which provides the antifouling behavior besides membrane cleaning under uv light can improve the frr by 14 attributed to the photocatalytic activity of zno and rgo that helped to degrade the organic fouling the synergistic effect of rgo and zno semiconductors improved uv light absorption due to reduced band gap energy similar result was obtained using rgo tio2 and sio2 excellent photocatalytic efficiency with increased photocatalytic activity by 30 100 of the pes rgo tio2 nanocomposite membrane treating nr wastewater this is attributed to the reduction of recombination photogenerated electrons and holes which was remediated by the addition of go as electron acceptor fig 7 90 more recently an outstanding membrane photocatalytic degradation rate was achieved by zno mno2 sio2 where mno2 doping successfully improved the photo sensitivity and photocatalytic activity of the composite 91 mno2 doping reduced the bandgap energy from 3 10 ev to 2 65 ev which promoted the photocatalytic improvement it can be concluded that nanocomposite membranes pose self cleaning ability and antimicrobial activity under both uv and visible light prolonging the membrane lifetime in wastewater treatment applications 3 2 2 2 nanofiltration and others although uf allowed relatively high water fluxes the contaminants in the wastewater in terms of cod and total organic carbon toc were above the permissible wastewater discharges standard 94 95 on the other hand permeate generated from nf can meet the wastewater discharge requirement due to the smaller pore size 1 10 nm lopes xin and crespo 93 have investigated the performance of commercial uf membrane carbosep zro2 techsep and three nf membranes np010 nadir nf270 dow and nf90 dow to treat wastewater from the rubber industry it was reported that permeate produced by nf90 or nf270 membrane met the european legislative requirements for water disposal where permeate cod lower than 2000 mg l then the less restrictive membrane nf270 was selected for study in a pilot plant membrane area 7 6 m2 at the industrial site because of its higher membrane permeability during the pilot plant study the permeate quality complies with wastewater discharge requirements after 12 h of operation and membrane chemical cleaning completely recovered the membrane permeability in addition economic evaluation has suggested that the nf process is economically feasible attributed of its lower energy consumption the energy consumption of the nf process represents merely 62 of the existing energy consumption of the treatment plant using the thermal treatment process considering the energy prices are expected to increase by 50 on average in 2022 the approach and the solution developed in this research are projected to achieve significant economic and energetic cost savings 96 similar to the uf process nanomaterials have been employed to enhance the performance of nanocomposite membranes for the treatment of rubber industry wastewater kusworo ariyanti and utomo 97 have added tio2 nanoparticles into psf membranes to improve their mechanical and separation characteristics the produced membranes are considered nf whose pore size is 7 65 10 10 nm the addition of nano tio2 improved the tensile strength of the membrane from 4 1 mpa to 7 2 mpa nevertheless the membrane tensile strength decreased slightly at higher nano tio2 loadings 2 wt this is attributed to the agglomeration of nanoparticles in the membrane matrix which led to the unselective void between the polymer chain 98 during treatment of nr industry wastewater the best pollutant removal efficiency was exhibited by the psf tio2 1 0 wt membrane with tds cod nh3 and turbidity removal rates reaching 14 03 87 88 88 79 and 99 respectively this is due to the enhanced membrane porosity 36 47 43 21 and pore size 7 65 10 10 nm by the nanoparticles apart from pristine tio2 nanoparticles kusworo susanto et al 90 have incorporated tio2 and go into the psf membrane upon incorporating tio2 go mixture as nanomaterials to the psf membrane extraordinary results were observed in the aspect of permeate flux organic and ammonia removal efficiency of 13 05 l m2 h 60 98 and 91 27 respectively higher porosity 22 79 59 84 and smaller pore size 1 89 6 27 nm were observed by the addition of dual nanoparticles this synergistic combination not only preserves the interesting characteristics of both individual nanoparticles but also overcomes serious drawbacks aside from pressure driven membrane process uf and nf many studies have explored the use of thermally driven separation process membrane distillation md for the treatment of wastewater owing to high rejection of nonvolatile organic compounds lower operation pressure and lower operating temperature as well as smaller footprint than conventional distillation processes in a study by mokhtar et al 26 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf mixed matrix membrane added with inorganic material of cloisite 15a was used as md membrane feed temperature and permeate temperature are 55 5 c and 20 0 c respectively results indicated that the direct contact md process could reduce toc total dissolved solid tds sulphate colour turbidity and conductivity for 96 in rubber industry wastewater however due to the severe fouling problem the membrane water permeate flux deteriorated as the filtration proceeded the severe flux decline is because of the blocking covering of the pore of the membrane by complex components such as latex and protein in rubber industry wastewater this subsequently decreases the evaporation area of the md membrane this has been confirmed by abdelrasoul et al 92 and mohana et al 99 who investigated the influence of latex particles on membrane fouling it was found that membrane pore blocking was the major fouling mechanism with latex particle size 10 mm this is possible because of the attractive forces between the latex particles and the membrane surface leading to 40 irreversible fouling besides increasing the latex particle size by aggregation coagulation with the aid of surfactant cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ctab can curb pore blocking and the irreversible fouling by up to 35 and 51 5 respectively through hydraulic backwashed 3 2 3 other single stage treatment coagulation flocculation is one of the physicochemical treatment processes that adds coagulant flocculant to react with wastewater to convert soluble pollutants into particulate pollutants which then can be removed by settling palomino hunkeler and stoll 100 have compared two types of cationic polymeric flocculant cationic linear polymer and two branched polymer on the stability of the charged latex particle suspension it is reported that polymer architecture and polymer dosage play crucial part on the rapid destabilization of the colloidal suspension the results showed that the two branched polymer at optimal polymer dosage demonstrates the highest flocculation rate constant compared to the linear polymer on the other hand mikola and tanskanen 101 studied the novel coagulant aluminium formate on the removal of colloidal latex particles from industrial wastewater the coagulant aluminium formate has produced a better removal efficiency of colloidal latex particles with lower turbidity of 0 7 ntu compared to the conventional coagulant polyaluminium chloride 1 4 ntu the separation was enhanced by the addition of polyacrylamide coagulant aid to facilitate the separation of flocs by simple sedimentation due to the significant increase in floc size later riveros 101 integrated the treatment using aluminium polychloride pac as a coagulant and anionic polyacrylamide pam as flocculant for the latex paint industry wastewater the addition of pac to the wastewater removes tss tds cod and turbidity while pam improves the sedimentation rate the treated water can meet the quality standards and 56 of the raw wastewater is recycled back into the process apart from adding coagulant and flocculant chemicals electrocoagulation ec could be used where the metal hydroxides are produced from the dissolution of a metal electrode in the solution with the help of an electrical current the metal hydroxides efficiently remove the organic compounds and other contaminants from wastewater 102 abraham radhakrishnan nair and madhu 12 have performed ec treatment of skim serum wastewater from nr latex centrifuging units effect of different electrodes such as aluminium stainless steel mild steel and cast iron was investigated aluminium anode was reported to be more efficient in removing pollutants and maximum removal of bod 99 5 was attained within 30 min of electrolysis this is owing to the greater charge neutralization of colloidal particles by positively charged metal ions generated in situ by electrolysis nevertheless the major downside of coagulation flocculation is the post treatment of sludge where the sludge has to be removed through the process of filtration which increases the operation cost recently the hydroponic system can be employed as a post treatment process for partially treated wastewater as the crop plants grow using nutrient rich wastewater rubber industry wastewater consists of nitrogen phosphorus potassium magnesium and calcium which are crucial nutrient elements for plant growth owamah enaboifo and izinyon 103 have treated the wastewater from raw rubber processing industry using hydroponic water lettuce macrophyte pond significant reductions for most parameters phosphate nitrates ph bod conductivity and tds were obtained the final wastewater has met the allowable limits of the who for discharge into water bodies except for tss and turbidity in addition raw rubber wastewater was also found to boost up the height stem girth leaf area and biomass yield of maize plant nevertheless more research should be conducted on the plant nutritive values to protect public health by adhering to international and national safety rules 3 3 integrated treatment integrated processes offer the benefit of individual processes and compensate for the limitations of each process therefore yielding an improved wastewater treatment efficiency 104 105 table 7 shows the recent integrated treatments for rubber industry wastewater as shown most of the integrated processes involved in treatments for rubber industry wastewater involves coagulation flocculation adsorption and biological process 3 3 1 physical chemical as illustrated in table 7 coagulation flocculation is typically integrated as pre treatment prior to the biological treatment to remove the residual organic matter hatamoto et al 106 have pretreated deproteinized nr wastewater using calcium chloride cacl2 as coagulant before anaerobic treatment in a uasb reactor it is reported that coagulation efficiency removed the sodium dodecyl sulfate sds under the detection limit 0 5 mg l hence the methane gas produced during the anaerobic process contains very minimum concentration of sulfate and h2s besides methane conversion was enhanced due to the removal of sds as microorganism inhibitor by coagulation however the cacl2 coagulant precipitated and formed a whitish gray sediments subsequently cause long term accumulation hence periodic cleaning of the reactor is required in long term operation similar result was obtained by nguyen et al 24 using aluminium sulphate flocculant on rubber latex processing wastewater prior to the anaerobic treatment in a continuous stirred tank reactor the pretreated rubber latex processing wastewater with reduced cod bod and tss concentrations of 184 110 and 125 mg l provided suitable culture environment which well adapted by hydrogen producing bacteria hence this generates a maximum cumulative hydrogen yield of 221 35 ml l after 28 h apart from coagulation flocculation advanced oxidation processes aop for instance fenton ozonation electrooxidation have been combined with other techniques such as adsorption coagulation flocculation and membrane filtration 107 this is because the single stage aops are reported to achieve only partial mineralization of pollutants which may produce more toxic intermediates 108 the post treatment after aops not only further removes the pollutants discharged to the receiving water but also realize the recycling of treated water and the sustainable development of water resources paul et al 109 have treated rubber processing industry wastewater using a sequential coagulation flocculation and sonolytic oxidation in india it was found that the integrated aluminium sulfate coagulation flocculation followed by sonolytic oxidation using both persulfate and hydrogen peroxide achieved the highest cod removal 91 24 and treatment cost of 16 55 usd kg cod however the treated wastewater still contains cod above the permissible limit 250 mg l and further appropriate treatments are required to dispose of the wastewater in the aquatic environment safely agustina sirait and silalahi 21 have treated the rubber industrial wastewater using fenton followed by adsorption ferrous sulphate was used as fenton reagent and the fe2 participates in the photo fenton reaction by reacting with h2o2 resulting in the production of ho radical the ho radical oxidizes the organic substances to carbon dioxide and water later activated carbon can adsorb the pollutants which were difficult degraded by ho radical consequently a maximum cod removal of 95 was attained by an integrated fenton adsorption process where the treated wastewater met the environmental quality standard regulation in indonesia later nidheesh et al 110 combined electro fenton ef and ec to treat mixed industrial wastewater from chemical plants such as oil cotton textile rubber and plastic the integrated electrochemical processes achieved high overall cod removal of 85 27 cod after 2 h treatment besides it is reported that ef ec configuration is a better strategy than ec ef as the post ec neutralizes the wastewater from ef to the dischargeable limit kusworo kumoro utomo et al 111 have integrated adsorption and ozonation prior to membrane filtration in the treatment of nr wastewater the adsorption consists of adsorber column packed with bentonite granules followed by ozonation with constant injection rate of 3000 mg o3 h the post membrane filtration using nanocomposite membrane modified by tio2 and crosslinked pva has improved the membrane perm selectivity properties the pva coating 3 0 wt on the pes tio2 membrane substantially improved the removal of cod tds and nh3 n by 244 80 56 70 and 5 29 respectively compared with the pristine pes tio2 membrane this is due to the denser membrane formed between the pva and tio2 molecule through van der waals forces and hydrogen bond hence provides higher selectivity 3 3 2 physical biological as mentioned in section 3 2 2 membrane fouling is the major obstacle to membrane separation the deposition and accumulation of foulants on top of the membrane surface deteriorates the performance of membrane therefore membrane process is typically combined with biological process in a membrane bioreactor mbr to improve the treatment performance via mitigating fouling 112 the presence of membrane enables activated sludge immobilization in the reactor which results in both higher biomass content and biodiversity sulaiman ibrahim and abdullah 8 first explored the use of mbr to treat wastewater discharged from lc processing plants the optimum operating flux for fouling mitigation was obtained from the sub critical flux region to be 0 009 m3 m2 h at a cod loading of 3500 mg l using the optimum operating flux the mbr can be operated for over a month without chemical cleaning thus lower operation cost besides high removal efficiencies of bod3 and cod were achieved at 96 78 and 96 99 respectively however the bod of the treated failed to comply with the department of environment doe discharge limit and longer hrt would be required alternatively post treatment procedures can be implemented polish up the wastewater to meet discharge or reuse limits this is confirmed by kim et al 113 with the use of mbr nf in treating wastewater from plant that produce rubber and plastics in the mbr the removal efficiencies of bod5 codmn and toc were 79 76 1 and 72 2 respectively after being treated with mbr the wastewater is further subjected to nf membrane filtration to reduce the toc concentration to comply with the discharge standard of 180 mg l in addition charfi et al 114 developed a complete model for anaerobic mbr anmbr treating latex serum produced from skim latex filtration the developed model was well fitted by both biological data tss cod and vfa r2 0 99 and tmp data r2 0 9 this mechanistic model is useful in understanding and predicting membrane fouling as well as on line control of an anmbr process 3 3 3 other integrated treatment besides biological processes the membrane process is also integrated with other processes to treat rubber industry wastewater some recent examples are thermal and electrochemical process xin et al 115 have combined two stage nf and evaporation process at pilot scale for high strength rubber wastewater treatment in cikautxo spain fig 8 treatment with nf270 4040 modules reduced over 95 cod from the rubber wastewater and the concentrated feed stream is subjected to an evaporator to produce distillate with lower conductivity the treated water can be recovered as process water however it requires further hardness treatment to meet boiling feed water standards the integrated nf and evaporation system effectively reduced energy costs from 4 2 m3 to 1 9 m3 treated wastewater 55 suggesting full scale applications more recently nookwam et al 116 explored the application of microbial fuel cell mfc to convert chemical energy from wastewater into alternative bioenergy the membrane function in mfc is not only separating the pollutants but also transferring protons from the anode to the cathode the study has investigated wastewater from various agro industries such as swine rubber seafood and palm oil among wastewaters investigated mfc fed with anaerobic digester wastewater from the rubber industry yield the maximum power density 55 43 1 08 w m3 and high removal efficiency of cod nitrogen and phosphorus 72 4 0 9 40 5 0 8 and 24 4 1 5 respectively this is because anaerobic digester wastewater from the rubber industry contains high concentration of sulfate the sulfate ions increase ionic strength and enhance proton transfers thus reducing the ohmic loss of the system 117 4 challenges and future prospects the major challenges of conventional wastewater treatment technologies for the rubber processing industry include the need for large areas ponding systems high operation and maintenance costs and high energy requirements for the aerobic treatment system aerator although the ponding system is easy to operate and has low operating costs it is not suitable for plants located in urban areas where land is expensive as it requires large footprint besides the ponding system causes malodour problems especially for plants located near residential areas 118 the malodour is mainly caused by gases released from smr rubber processing plants from dryers and rubber storage areas and h2s gas from plants processing concentrated latex using anaerobic facultative ponding systems 119 in addition the performance of conventional treatment systems is inconsistent and could pose major problems in complying with the regulatory requirement for instance despite most of the rubber processing plants in malaysia have implemented appropriate wastewater treatment systems their effectiveness in complying with the wastewater discharge standards set by the doe in malaysia is unsatisfactory 120 most rubber plants still have difficulties meeting the discharge standards especially for the parameters bod and nitrogen this situation occurs mainly when rubber plants increase the production volume beyond the level when designing the relevant wastewater treatment system besides the rubber industry wastewater has to meet the increasingly stringent discharge standards in many countries worldwide for instance doe in malaysia has imposed a more stringent effluent discharge requirement for all plants processing raw rubber in the southern state johor of malaysia since 2017 this is in line with the johor state government s intention to improve the quality of rivers across the state the stringent effluent standards for the lc and smr plant effluent are shown in table 8 and table 9 respectively unfortunately most of the lc and smr plants in johor cannot meet the stringent discharge standards especially the parameters cod and nh3 n in order to comply with the new discharge standards these plants must either upgrade their existing wastewater treatment plant or build an advanced and modern new wastewater treatment plant that is more practical economically feasible and also adopts the best available technology approach 121 in addition with the new global trend of sustainable development wastewater treatment in rubber processing should be established as a green alternative focusing on waste minimization and efficient utilization of natural resources 122 123 new approaches to achieving green industry status with zero waste discharge for the nr industry require an integrated approach that covers the major aspects of rubber processing from collection through preservation transportation processing and wastewater treatment moreover these aspects are interrelated and have significant implications for developing new technologies for minimizing wastewater discharge and promoting wastewater recycling and utilization 102 essentially these approaches minimize wastewater discharge and the trend is to transform from waste to wealth in line with the principles of the circular economy in addition the latest research on producing nitrogen gas as the product of ammonia oxidation in wastewater could be considered 124 125 lastly effective wastewater treatment systems are needed to reduce the production costs and environmental impact of rubber processing 126 127 5 conclusions untreated wastewater discharged from rubber based industries harmfully affects the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem due to the reduced water quality hence it is necessary to perform advanced treatment of rubber industry wastewater to further remove pollutants and meet stringent environmental regulations the advanced wastewater treatment method can be categorized as single stage and integrated stages each method has pros and cons biological treatment is simple and suitable for the treatment of nitrogen compounds in rubber industry wastewater however it requires large installation area and long retention time on the other hand membrane treatment requires a small footprint produces high quality water and low energy consumption but membrane fouling is a major problem that hinders their widespread and large scale applications whereas chemical treatment such as coagulation flocculation and aops is less cost effective and could lead to secondary pollution of water bodies in general the choice of advanced wastewater treatment methods can be made based on 1 degree of a method required to bring the wastewater quality to a permissible level 2 flexibility of the control method 3 cost of the process and 4 environmental compatibility typically an integrated treatment process offers many advantages by merging the benefit of individual components to compensate for the limitations of each treatment the integrated treatment process is more cost effective technically viable and economically affordable in producing high quality treated water for recycling reuse recently advances in nanoengineering and nanotechnology have also improved the treatment of rubber industry wastewater owing to their unique physical and chemical characteristics the nanomaterials could be incorporated into the membrane as nanofillers to enhance water permeability permeate flux and antifouling capability the nanomaterials could also be used as nanoadsorbents to bind pollutants from rubber industry wastewater future work should focus on the synthesis of nanomaterials from sustainable materials like plant based sources and carbon wastes this review also reveals the challenges and future perspectives that should be concentrated in future research to enable sustainable and integrated water management in the rubber industry it could be achieved by strong water resources plan and enforcement of regulations to meet the demand of socioeconomic development while ensuring the environmental integrity of

12577,pharmaceutical contaminants have shown widespread presence in water wastewater threatening environmental and human health existing literature shows that adsorption can efficiently bind pharmaceuticals preventing their transfer into the treated water however adsorption only diverts these contaminants from one phase to another requiring the treatment of contaminant laden adsorbents fenton oxidation h2o2 based has shown good potential for the degradation of pharmaceuticals but the practical use of fenton oxidation is often limited by its higher chemical demands and low contact of oxidizing species with target contaminants efforts to overcome these practical obstacles aim to develop efficient heterogeneous catalysts which also benefit from their strong contaminant adsorption capacity this is the first review that focuses exclusively on dual functional materials that can effectively adsorb pharmaceutical pollutants separation based removal and promote fenton oxidation simultaneously degradation based removal in aqueous systems the dual functionality enables the integration of adsorption and fenton based processes heterogeneous fenton photo fenton and photocatalysis to efficiently remove pharmaceuticals this integration can be achieved using a single material having both functions or by compositing impregnating different materials the properties of these materials have important consequences on their treatment efficiency stability and regeneration ability these processes and materials are critically evaluated to illustrate their potential associated challenges and their key solutions some of these challenges originate from the tested materials while others are inherent to the treatment process and the prospects for improvement exist at their intersection future research should aim to rationally improve the catalytic and adsorption properties of these materials and explore their practical implementation in wastewater treatment technologies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wastewater treatment hybrid materials advanced oxidation processes adsorption emerging environmental pollutants data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction pharmaceuticals have been identified as an emerging group of environmental contaminants due to their potential hazards to human health and ecosystem 1 pharmaceutical contaminants are differentiated from traditional industrial pollutants based on a their diverse chemical structures molecular weight and functionality b they are polar molecules having more than one ionizable group whereas the degree of ionization is controlled by the solution ph c they are mainly lipophilic in nature though some of them are moderately soluble in water d they have the ability to persist in nature accumulate in life forms and remain biologically active e after administration metabolic reactions can modify their chemical structure 1 2 thus pharmaceuticals can be excreted without being transformed or metabolized in the form of more polar and lipophilic derivatives these properties ultimately dictate the fate and removal of pharmaceuticals in the environment differently than the traditional pollutants their presence in environment even in small quantities can be harmful because they have been specially designed to exert biological effects even at very low concentration 3 their contamination in aquatic systems is mainly linked to their misuse in medical and agricultural settings and the release of unregulated effluents hospital industrial domestic and agricultural 4 for example according to the us center for disease prevention and control injudicious antibiotic use may approach 50 5 this figure could be worse in developing countries where over the counter sales of drugs is highly unregulated 6 since traditional water wastewater treatments are unable to completely eliminate these compounds 7 finding affordable efficient and environmentally benign treatments is highly desired to maintain ecological security and a clean water supply many technologies have been tested to remove pharmaceuticals from aqueous systems among them adsorption of pharmaceuticals is known for its simplicity cost efficiency quick pollutant removal and low sludge production 8 9 however adsorption is a separation based technique a phase changing technology that simply diverts the pollutants from water to another phase yielding contaminant laden sorbents which require side stream disposal or further treatment to avoid the risks of secondary contamination unlike adsorption advanced oxidation processes aops offer compelling advantage of degrading the organic pollutants this feature is highly attractive for environmental protection and to enable decentralized treatments wherein the collection and transportation of waste are likely to be troublesome 10 among aops fenton based oxidation processes have received tremendous attention to degrade pharmaceuticals and other organic pollutants 11 heterogeneous fenton oxidation relies on iron oxide catalysts to produce reactive oxygen species ros predominantly hydroxyl radicals ho for pollutant degradation however fenton oxidation when applied alone can be environmentally harmful and expensive due to substantial chemical input 1 to overcome these challenges dual functional materials are increasingly studied as heterogenous catalysts and adsorbents 8 9 these materials have the potential to simultaneously adsorb pollutants separation based removal and catalyze fenton oxidation degradation based removal the dual functionality of these materials enables the coupling of adsorption and fenton oxidation for higher treatment efficiency while reducing the associated costs and limitations of individual techniques by regeneration of materials and higher elimination of pollutants heterogeneous fenton processes can be further enhanced with additional input of light photo fenton that has also been explored these integrated treatments can be used for both ex situ after separating the adsorbent as well as in situ applications without separating the adsorbent by relying on the same materials fig 1 this can be achieved either by using a single material having both functions or by compositing impregnating different materials to develop the dual functionality in a hybrid material this dual functionality has been the subject of huge amount of research in the recent decade tables 1 and 2 in integrated processes adsorption usually accounts for the initial treatment stage to bind pharmaceuticals which are then degraded by the ros formed during fenton oxidation pollutant adsorption on the surface of dual functional materials improves the pollutant catalyst oxidant contact which enhances the treatment efficiency moreover the degradation of adsorbed pharmaceuticals by subsequent fenton oxidation allows the regeneration of the spent material for further treatment cycles this regeneration and reuse of materials are highly advantageous to reduce the treatment cost and to avoid the generation and disposal of pollutant laden spent adsorbent dual functionality of these materials improves the pharmaceutical degradation while reducing the risks of secondary contamination 12 the disposal of pollutant laden spent adsorbent is are addressed by subsequent fenton oxidation that regenerates the adsorbent by removing the pollution however in another procedure fenton oxidation can be applied as the initial treatment which is followed by adsorption this procedure allows the elimination of the major organic contaminants by fenton oxidation and the further removal of their traces and or byproducts by subsequent adsorption 13 14 thus integrated treatments combine the benefits of both techniques these treatments have therefore distinct advantages of higher contaminant removal less oxidant consumption and prevention of secondary pollution there exist many reviews that focused on the removal of pharmaceuticals from aqueous environments however main focus of these reviews was either various techniques for pharmaceutical removal 1 2 fenton oxidation 15 16 adsorption 9 or with a focus on particular group of adsorbents for example sewage sludge derived biochar 17 carbon nanotubes 18 the integration of both processes using dual functional materials has however not been reviewed so far which constitutes the main objective of this article to our knowledge this is the first review that focuses on the integration of both treatments by relying on dual functional materials to eliminate pharmaceutical contaminants from aqueous systems for this we compiled the research data from numerous publications retrieved from scopus database evaluating the applications of integrated treatments to eliminate pharmaceuticals in aqueous systems dual functionality of iron minerals and their composites with other materials allows the coupling of adsorption with heterogeneous fenton and photo fenton oxidation processes a brief account of the role of these iron minerals in photo catalysis is also provided a critical evaluation of these techniques and materials is provided to demonstrate the promising treatments materials with a concise explanation of associated limitations and their key solutions with this review we intend to offer a useful resource and potential research directions to explore the practical implications of fenton based processes and adsorption for real wastewater treatment plants 2 literature search

variations of this term this search returned 238 articles which were read to find if it deals with the use of integrated treatment to remove pharmaceuticals 3 coupling of heterogeneous fenton oxidation with adsorption traditional fenton oxidation counts on dissolved iron species fe ii mainly to catalyze hydrogen oxide h2o2 for the generation of ho radicals that degrade organic pollutants however the traditional fenton process suffers from fundamental drawbacks of maintaining an acidic ph the ho radical production is efficient only at an acidic ph below 4 which is costly and impractical in environmental settings 11 moreover this process leads to the generation of iron sludge after the treatment to address these drawbacks heterogeneous fenton oxidation has been developed that relies on iron bearing minerals or solids instead of dissolved fe ii these iron bearing minerals and solids can catalyze fenton oxidation at wide range of ph values 20 in addition to their catalytic ability hydrophilic iron oxides also benefit from their capacity to adsorb polar and negatively charged compounds highlighting their dual role in the remediation of pharmaceuticals 8 9 a brief description of adsorption coupled with heterogeneous fenton oxidation using various materials for the removal of pharmaceuticals is provided below table 1 3 1 pristine nano zero valent iron nzvi and its composites with other materials nano zero valent fe nzvi represents an important material that has been widely used to promote the integrated remediation processes here the removal mechanism involved the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on nzvi surface followed by the production of ho radicals by its reaction with h2o2 eqs 1 and 2 for pollutant oxidation 21 22 1 fe 0 h 2 o 2 2h fe ii 2h 2 o 2 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii ho ho though nzvi particles are highly efficient they being highly reactive are easily oxidized to form oxide layers on its surface which decreases their catalytic ability fig 2 24 indeed the surface passivation of nzvi has been recognized among the major challenges in its successful application to remove pollutants 23 25 nzvi corrosion phenomenon is dictated by various factors including the composition of nzvi itself oxic anoxic environments reaction time and the concentration and type of aqueous species 25 as such nzvi can be corroded and transformed into other iron oxides like ferrihydrite magnetite etc which can also contribute in adsorption and or fenton oxidation fig 2 26 another issue is the magnetic nature of nzvi particles that can cause them to spontaneously agglomerate decreasing their total surface area and efficiency to address these drawbacks associated with nzvi as dual functional materials the stability and reactivity of nzvi particles can be improved by three main strategies including i the development of bimetallic nanocomposites 24 27 ii by loading nzvi onto a support 22 28 29 or iii by encapsulating of nzvi particles for example in three dimensional graphene network 30 these strategies improve the stability and reactivity of nzvi while reducing its agglomeration for example tem images of nzvi on various supports indicate its successful attachment preventing its agglomeration fig 3 however pristine nzvi without any support fig 3 exhibits particle agglomeration and the presence of amorphous layers surrounding nzvi particles these layers have been recognized of iron oxide layers formed by nzvi oxidation 25 31 thus without support fe particles become strongly linked to each other under necklet form this behavior was however not observed in case of bimetallic or composited nzvi figs 3 and 4 bimetallic nanocomposites can be obtained by adding a second metal to nzvi 24 27 for this noble metals e g pt 24 and other metals e g cu 27 were commonly used due to their significant contribution in enhancing the electron generation capacity and stability of nzvi as compared to the pristine nzvi moreover this structural modification largely increased the surface area from 25 m2 g 1 pristine nzvi to 300 m2 g 1 pt0 5 nzvi this substantial increase in the surface area has been marked as the key reason for an improved adsorption of oxytetracycline by the authors 24 however further increase in pt contents beyond 0 5 wt turned nzvi particles into flake agglomeration and thus affected the morphology and reduced the efficiency of nzvi similarly the use of cu based bimetallic nzvi removed 56 of ciprofloxacin as compared to pristine nzvi 30 pollutant removal 27 in the same study 27 an interesting comparison has been made between the efficiency of cu nzvi synthesized by using green tea extract as the reductant termed as green method and the one synthesized by traditional chemical method based on sodium borohydride green synthesized cu nzvi was found more stable oxidation resistant and efficient than chemically synthesized cu nzvi as the former removed 81 of ciprofloxacin compared to the 56 removal by the later this has been linked to the higher dispersion of cu nzvi synthesized by green method adsorption or fenton like oxidation alone were able to remove about 30 and 50 respectively however the integration of both processes removed up to 90 of ciprofloxacin authors further reported that adsorption played a major role in pollutant removal in the start of the reaction but after 5 min desorption started happening with the passage of time due to surface oxidation of nzvi however after 20 min of reaction fenton oxidation began to take over adsorption 27 the stabilization and efficiency of nzvi cu bimetallic particles can be further improved by polyvinylpyrrolidone 32 owing to their catalytic potential of cu species in promoting fenton oxidation nano zerovalent copper cu0 has also been developed as an alternative of nzvi to catalyze iron free fenton like oxidation of ciprofloxacin eqs 3 and 4 33 also the substitution of cu in fe3o4 fe3 xcuxo4 as the final product has been found to increase adsorption capacity and ho radical production during photo fenton oxidation of anticancer drugs including 5 fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide 34 3 2cu 0 h 2 o 2 2h 2cu 2h 2 o 4 cu h 2 o 2 cu 2 ho ho another strategy to improve the stability of nzvi involves the deposition of nzvi particles on a support like biochar 22 reduced graphene oxide 28 29 31 cerium oxide 35 etc which can improve its stability and efficiency fig 3 for example the composites of rgo with bimetallic pd nzvi nanoparticles or nzvi particles provided a good solution to address the drawbacks of nzvi based materials and improved their efficiency 31 fig 4 in comparison with 53 removal of oxytetracycline by pristine nzvi pollutant removal reached 83 with bimetallic pd nzvi pollutant removal improved to 96 with bimetallic nanocomposites of pd nzvi rgo5 rgo 5 w w the removal of oxytetracycline by pd nzvi rgo composite has been linked to adsorption fenton like oxidation and reduction reactions as demonstrated in fig 4 in addition to an improved efficiency the use of pd nzvi rgo5 exhibited better pollutant removal in subsequent treatment cycles oxytetracycline removal by pristine nzvi from 53 to 1 in five oxidation cycles whereas the efficiency of pd nzvi rgo5 composite retained 18 of removal efficiency 31 compositing nzvi with ceo2 was also found to improve the efficiency and stability of nzvi 35 a radical identification experiment linked it to the remarkable production of ho radical by nzvi ceo2 composite as the bare nzvi the ceo2 improved the catalyst s adsorption characteristics and electron transfer to improve h2o2 decomposition due to the abundance of surface oxygen vacancies 35 the encapsulation of nzvi particles in three dimensional graphene network has also been proposed as a potential strategy to enhance the stability and efficiency of nzvi 30 the encapsulation of iron copper bimetallic nps within the mesoporous carbon shell fecu c promoted the catalytic degradation of sulfamethazine 36 synergistic catalytic role of fe and cu species improved the formation of ho radicals by promoting fe ii fe iii redox cycle while the presence of carbon increased the adsorption capacity 63 pollutant removal sulfamethazine was completely removed in the integrated process 3 2 pristine iron minerals having dual functions adsorption and fenton catalyst iron minerals have received substantial attention for their demonstrated efficiency in promoting both adsorption and fenton based oxidation processes owing to the high surface area iron minerals have been widely used to adsorb variety of pollutants from contaminated water wastewater structural fe contents of these minerals enable them to catalyze fenton oxidation at circumneutral ph which is highly advantageous for real scale applications it should be noted that classical fenton oxidation h2o2 soluble fe ii is often limited by the acidic ph range required to avoid the precipitation of soluble fe ii however in case of iron minerals the entrapment of fe species within the structure of iron minerals prevents their precipitation leading to an improved catalytic ability over a wide ph range this quality of iron minerals makes them ideal catalysts for heterogeneous fenton oxidation iron minerals exist in nature as ferric fe iii bearing or mixed valent iron minerals bearing fe ii both fe iii 37 for example feooh based fenton like system showed good capacity 80 to remove roxarsone antibiotic and to adsorb arsenic which has been formed as the by product of roxarone oxidation thus the dual functionality of feooh allowed the degradation of the target pharmaceutical while eliminating the risk of secondary contamination 12 similarly weng et al 26 found that the use of green synthesized fe nps for synergetic adsorption and fenton like oxidation removed 90 of ofloxacin and enrofloxacin in a mixed contamination system after an initial pre adsorption these pharmaceuticals were removed by an oxidative degradation in the presence of h2o2 these materials also showed good treatment efficiency either if they were reused 60 or were applied to remove target pharmaceuticals in the real wastewater 60 26 owing to the existence of structural fe ii mixed valent fe minerals are considered more reactive to catalyze heterogeneous fenton oxidation 20 for example impregnating ferrihydrite on powdered activated carbon demonstrated an excellent adsorption capacity 203 mg g 1 for diclofenac removal however subjecting this material to subsequent fenton oxidation partially removed the adsorbed pollutant along with a decrease in its regeneration ability by 25 on the other hand ball milled magnetite nanoparticles exhibited efficient removal of ciprofloxacin by heterogeneous fenton oxidation 38 indeed magnetite alone removed up to 43 of ciprofloxacin due to adsorption but ciprofloxacin removal was increased to 89 by subsequent chemical oxidation h2o2 12 mm fe3o4 1 75 g l 1 it should be noted that magnetite fe ii fe iii 2 o4 owing to the presence of structural fe ii has emerged as a viable dual purpose material that has shown higher catalytic ability as compared to the ferric minerals 20 moreover its magnetic nature also facilitates the quick recovery of the spent materials using an external magnet from the reaction medium for their reusability or disposal 39 the reuse of magnetite in four consecutive treatments by hassani et al 38 revealed that the efficiency of magnetite decreased from 89 to 65 in four oxidation cycles the oxidation efficiency of iron minerals can get decreased by surface oxidation passivation and fe leaching and which if addressed can recover the treatment efficiency 19 the efficiency and stability of magnetite can be enhanced by preparing its composites with other reactive materials discussed in following sections 3 3 composites of iron minerals and other materials the development of efficient composites particularly based on magnetic materials has received tremendous attention in the recent decade compositing magnetic iron minerals with suitable supports can improve the stability and catalytic ability of these iron minerals moreover composites of magnetic iron minerals with other materials are also prepared to introduce the magnetic feature in materials which are otherwise deprived of these characteristics 40 45 for example embedding fe3o4 nanoparticles on 3d reduced graphene oxide rgo was advantageous to introduce the magnetic feature in the composite adsorbent and improve the catalytic activity of magnetite 40 this material fe3o4 rgo exhibited adsorption capacity 2 78 mmol g 1 for ciprofloxacin and 4 76 mmol g 1 for tetracycline much higher than the rgo alone 1 mmol g 1 for both pollutants and commercial granular activated carbon 1 mmol g 1 fe3o4 nanoparticles were deposited between the graphene sheets and served as spacers preventing the aggregation of graphene sheets all the adsorbed amount was completely removed by subsequent fenton like oxidation by introducing h2o2 and this material maintained its efficiency for 10 adsorption oxidation cycles 40 total iron loss was only 1 after adsorption oxidation cycles underscoring the strong stability and high catalytic efficiency of magnetite nanoparticles on rgo the existence of both fe ii and fe iii in octahedral layer of magnetite on rgo allowed fe species to be reversibly oxidized and reduced while retaining the structure 40 the schematic diagram of this catalytic oxidation along with iron regeneration is presented in fig 5a similarly using magnetite embedded onto chitosan carbon microbeads adsorbed significant amount 4 18 mg g 1 of doxycycline under flow through conditions at a flow rate of 1 1 ml min 46 sequential addition of h2o2 5 to trigger the fenton oxidation removed up to 95 of the adsorbed pollutant regenerating the magnetite chitosan carbon microbeads for repeated applications the regeneration efficiency of this magnetic material increased from 78 to 93 of pollutant removal with an increase in the oxidant dose from 2 to 5 and then decreased to 72 and 55 with further increase in oxidant dose to 8 and 11 it has been attributed to the scavenging of ho radicals at higher oxidant doses 47 a composite of magnetite with carbon nanotubes cnts synthesized by ball milling was used to remove six sulfonamides including sulfanilamide sulfamerazine sulfadimethoxine sulfadiazine sulfamethazine and sulfametoxydiazine 49 the adsorption efficiency of sulfamerazine reached 59 70 and 6 in the presence of magnetite cnt composite cnt and fe3o4 respectively though the adsorption capacity of the composite material was lower than cnt it caused higher pollutant removal by subsequent fenton oxidation 100 71 and 37 in the presence of magnetite cnt composite cnt and fe3o4 respectively with h2o2 moreover the presence of magnetite introduces the magnetic character in composite material that facilitated its separation for regeneration carbon nanotubes cnts pyrrhotite fes also exhibited substantial removal 90 of ciprofloxacin that has been linked to the synergistic adsorption fenton like oxidation and catalytic degradation by cnts catalyst 48 fig 5b cnts possess excellent adsorption capacity owing to its large surface area and porous structure on the other hand fes can produce fe ii in solution that would catalyze h2o2 to produce ho radicals for the degradation of ciprofloxacin additional trials performed using ho radical scavengers including potassium iodide surface bound radical scavenger and methanol scavenger for all the unbounded ho radicals revealed that the removal of ciprofloxacin was mainly dependent on unbounded ho radicals while the contribution of bounded ho radicals remains insignificant adsorption process alone was able to remove 25 of ciprofloxacin while the removal efficiency reached 90 in integrated process due to the synergistic effect of adsorption and oxidation by free and bounded ho radicals biochar has also emerged as an important material in the recent decade with many environmental applications it can be developed from various biomasses for example biochar 50 or carbon 51 derived from sewage sludge with sufficient amounts of native fe removed pharmaceuticals 90 91 through synergetic effect of adsorption and fenton oxidation relying on sewage sludge or agricultural wastes to synthesize biochar could reduce the treatment cost while offering an innovative solution for solid waste management 52 53 however depending upon the contents and form of iron in biomass fe loading on biochar can be required to improve its catalytic ability for example xie et al 54 developed composites of fexp biochar by pyrolysis of phosphorus containing biomass yeast preloaded with feooh on its surface synergistic adsorption and fenton like oxidation removed 99 of sulfamethoxazole however the development of composite materials usually involves impregnation method where iron precursor loaded carbon materials are pyrolyzed or iron oxides are immobilized onto carbon materials these approaches can be limited by uneven distribution of iron or its oxides on the surface of composite materials in this regard direct carbonization of metal organic frameworks mofs to synthesize carbon based porous materials has been suggested by gu et al 55 they developed a magnetic fe porous carbon material via one step pyrolysis method and found it highly suitable to remove tetracycline highest adsorption of 1301 mg g 1 onto this material was recorded which was about 6 times higher than activated carbon the mechanism of adsorption mainly included surface complexation hydrogen bonding and π π interactions fig 6 fenton oxidation allowed the regeneration of this material for further treatment cycles where it retained its efficiency 70 79 55 magnetic iron based carbon materials are also gaining particular interest because of the remarkable adsorption from the mutual role of carbon c and fe higher catalytic ability associated mainly with fe species and easy recovery from aqueous matrix due to their magnetic nature for repeated applications 55 57 iron based mofs nh2 mil 88b were found to completely remove pefloxacin from contaminated solution by adsorption followed by fenton like oxidation 58 adsorption capacity reached 41 4 mg g 1 in 120 min whereas pefloxacin was completely removed by subsequent fenton like oxidation similarly fe2o3 covalent organic frameworks fe2o3 cofs was synthesized by restricting the growth of fe2o3 in the nanoscale channel of cofs 56 the use of this material resulted in 45 removal of sulfamethazine by adsorption while integration with h2o2 completely removed this pollutant recently magnetic spent bleaching earth carbon was synthesized by the anoxic pyrolysis of spent bleaching earth a waste product of vegetable oil industry followed by the in situ synthesis of magnetite via coprecipitation 59 the adsorption of tetracycline hydrochloride reached 16 with equilibrium attained in in 60 min pollutant removal efficiency reached 89 after 1 min of oxidant addition in the reaction medium fig 7a an increase in the quantity of this material from 0 5 to 2 g l 1 increased the adsorption of tetracycline hydrochloride from 18 to 65 and oxidation 52 to 97 fig 7 the development of efficient environmental materials from solid industrial wastes like that of spent bleaching earth could be a sustainable solution for resource recovery and solid waste management however for all the composite materials maintaining an optimum level of iron loading is crucial to attain the maximum degradation of pollutants increasing iron loading beyond an optimum point makes iron dispersion less homogeneous which reduces the oxidation efficiency 60 in another study the loading of fe3o4 on cellulose nanocomposites reduced the iron loss from 19 from fe3o4 to 1 in composite sample while removing about 90 of tetracycline due to the supportive role of adsorption and fenton like degradation 61 it is worth mentioning that adsorption alone was able to remove only 33 of tetracycline moreover the development of bioinspired magnetic cellulose nanocomposites has been suggested as a suitable alternative to the chemically synthesized supports which are non degradable environmentally unsustainable or their synthesis relies on hazardous chemicals 61 4 coupling of photo fenton and photocatalysis with adsorption photo induced processes including photo fenton and photocatalysis can be employed in combination with adsorption to remove pharmaceutical compounds compared to the traditional fenton and fenton like processes photo fenton involves the photo reduction of iron iii to generate ros under light especially ho radicals eq 5 photo fenton reaction favors the regeneration of fe ii that addresses the rate limiting step of fenton oxidation reduction of iron iii into iron ii 70 71 the use of fe iii is a considerable advantage since it is more stable than fe ii at circumneutral ph in addition h2o2 can be also added to the photo fenton process so classical fenton reaction occurs therefore a catalytic cycle fe iii fe ii is set up 5 fe 3 h 2 o hν fe 2 h ho photo fenton oxidation and adsorption are usually integrated using composite materials based on iron oxides composited with different adsorbents table 2 consequently the composite materials can also trigger photocatalysis in the case the iron based material is a semiconductor 72 74 photocatalysis relies on the formation of electron hole e h pairs under light which react further to generate primary ros fig 8 it is worth noting that the isolated use of photo fenton photocatalysis and adsorption processes has been widely studied however their simultaneous application is an emerging field with relatively fewer studies this section illustrates the integration of adsorption with photo fenton and photocatalysis for the removal of pharmaceuticals a brief summary of the salient findings regarding the efficiency of various materials in integrated processes is provided in table 2 a brief description of these studies is provided in the following sections 4 1 iron based materials combined with zeolites and porous alumina iron based spinel structure are widely used photoactive materials especially for heterogeneous photo fenton process their combination with zeolite showed promising potential to remove pharmaceutical compounds since zeolites exhibit excellent adsorption properties due to high ion exchange properties hydrophilic affinities and specific surface area 76 77 indeed nax nanozeolite combined with cofe2o4 can completely remove paracetamol 20 mg l 1 after 30 min irradiation under uva light in the presence of h2o2 that corresponds to a 50 increase in pollutant removal extent compared to that by adsorption alone 77 such a high efficiency is due to the synergy of iron based catalyst and zeolites owing to their excellent adsorption capacity and hydrophilic affinities higher adsorption improves the contact of paracetamol with the iron based catalyst enhancing its degradation with photo fenton process 76 77 similarly mesoporous alumina is an excellent adsorbent for the support of photo fenton catalyst indeed the combination of meso al2o3 with fe ii can almost completely remove phenol after 60 min in the presence of h2o2 under uv light at ph 3 78 adsorption alone can remove 40 of phenol due to the high chemical and thermal stability of mesoporous alumina along with its high specific surface area the integration of adsorption with photo fenton process leads to an increase of 60 in degradation extents owing to the oxidative attack of hydroxyl radicals on phenol 4 2 iron based materials combined with biomass based adsorbents biomass based materials particularly activated carbon are considered highly promising due to their natural origin and their sustainable production recently della flora et al designed an integrated adsorption system with photo fenton process to remove a mixture of pharmaceutical compounds to simulate hospital wastewater including chloramphenicol fluconazole flutamide flurosemide gemfibrozil ibuprofen losartan nimesulide and paracetamol 13 79 the first step involves the photo fenton process which is performed for 15 min under simulated solar light at ph 4 with a single addition of 100 mg l 1 h2o2 and multiple additions of fe ii 5 mg l 1 at 0 min 5 min and 10 min of treatment time subsequently adsorption process using activated carbon obtained from avocado seeds is performed as post treatment for 15 min such a combination of processes can remove almost completely all the pharmaceutical compounds indeed the photo fenton process can degrade from 30 to 80 of the contaminant after 15 min depending upon pharmaceutical compound and the remaining contamination including the toxic transformation products can be removed by adsorption there exist multiple adsorption reactions as illustrated in fig 9 with the example of flutamide in the presence of activated carbon from avocado seeds 69 however the involvement of photo fenton process requires the acidification of the water matrix which is not economically viable 70 71 in addition the ph also affects the efficiency of adsorption process through activated carbon 13 at acidic ph the chemical structure of the adsorbent is composed of aromatic rings possesses positively charged surface thus most of the target and transformed pharmaceutical compounds which also contain aromatic rings and are neutral or negatively charged at acidic ph are easily adsorbed through coulombic and π π interactions 13 it is worth noting that the open ring transformation products are not efficiently removed by adsorption process due to weak interactions with the adsorbent and strong solubility in water respectively but the photo fenton process can efficiently degrade and mineralize this fraction of the contamination 13 79 these studies highlight the utility of the adsorption as the secondary process in the integrated system another integrated system combining adsorption and photo fenton processes has been discussed by oladipo et al where tetracycline and phenol have been removed using fe3o4 nanoparticles covered by waste cyprus coffee residue fe3o4 cc 72 such a composite can adsorb tetracycline with an increase of 50 compared to cc alone and degrade and mineralize efficiently this pharmaceutical compound along with its aromatic intermediates in the presence of h2o2 and solar irradiation 72 as expected the excellent adsorption capacity of fe3o4 cc was found dependent on the solution ph tetracycline exists in cationic form at ph 3 3 in anionic form at ph 7 7 and as zwitterion between ph 3 3 and 7 7 therefore the optimal adsorption of tetracycline occurred at circumneutral ph and it is due to electrostatic interactions and h bonding between the waste coffee residue and the iron oxide respectively and the pharmaceutical compound 72 the photo fenton process generated ros mainly ho and o2 ho2 that efficiently degraded tetracycline as well as its degradation byproducts such as phenol catechol and hydroquinone 72 therefore the use biomass based adsorbent including activated carbon in integrated adsorption with photo fenton system is an interesting strategy for the efficient removal of pharmaceutical compounds such adsorbents interact with aromatic contaminants by π π and h bonding while photo fenton process efficiently oxidize the remaining pollution in the solution 4 3 iron based materials combined with g c3n4 the integration of adsorption with both photo fenton and or photocatalysis has also been proposed as an innovative system 80 81 indeed iron based oxides can also play the role of photocatalyst and adsorbent for the removal of pharmaceuticals for instance the composites based on graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 and iron based oxide like fe2o3 and mnfe2o4 belong to such an integrated system 80 81 eventually an adsorbent can also be included in the composite like graphene 80 for example zhao et al investigated a composite material made of g c3n4 with fe2o3 nanodots 81 such a composite can degrade 90 of tetracycline in the presence of h2o2 after 1 h under visible light for comparison the integrated adsorption with photocatalysis without h2o2 and fenton process in the dark can only degrade about 20 and 45 of the target pharmaceutical respectively 81 however the photo fenton is not discussed in detail by zhao et al although it has probably a significant contribution to the excellent efficiency of the g c3n4 fe2o3 composite it is also worth noting the g c3n4 fe2o3 composite is highly stable since the efficiency of tetracycline degradation by integrated adsorption with simultaneous photocatalysis and photo fenton decreased by about 4 after 4 repeated runs on the other hand wang et al 80 prepared g c3n4 mnfe2o4 graphene composites for the degradation of a wide range of antibiotic compounds including tetracycline ciprofloxacin metronidazole and amoxicillin such composites integrate a non photoactive adsorbent thus combining photocatalysis photo fenton and adsorption fig 10 the photochemical systems also included the use of persulfate s2o8 2 as radical precursor the pollutant degradation efficiency ranged from 50 to 90 in 10 mm pharmaceutical solutions after 90 min visible light irradiation depending upon the compound 80 in addition the reusability of such composites is excellent as no significant decrease in removal efficiency was reported after 5 repeated runs the excellent removal efficiencies of these composite materials were attributed to different reasons an important one is the type ii heterojunction between g c3n4 and iron based oxide that enhances the charge carrier separation and transport another reason is the scavenging of photogenerated electron by the adsorbent thus increasing the charge carrier lifetime while the adsorbent is providing active sites for degradation reactions also the presence of fenton active elements like fe and mn in the composite materials can efficiently catalyze fenton based reactions including photo fenton for the activation of persulfate and h2o2 into inorganic radicals ho and so4 which are highly reactive species for the efficient destruction of pharmaceutical compounds 80 81 4 4 iron based materials combined with mos2 other promising materials are those composed of mos2 and an iron based compound beside the activation of photocatalysis and photo fenton process mos2 has a layered structure that can play a crucial role in organic pollutant adsorption 93 for instance li et al 93 investigated magnetic fe3o4 fe1 xs mos2 which can efficiently degrade tetracycline in water in the presence of h2o2 under visible light the advantage of such a composite is its stability high adsorption capacity and magnetic properties thus being advantageous for post treatment separation however all the processes including adsorption photocatalysis and fenton based processes are discussed separately so it is difficult to describe the contribution of each process other composites based on mos2 have also been investigated for the removal of pharmaceuticals liu et al prepared a mos2 fevo4 composite that can degrade 70 of tetracycline after 1 h reaction under visible light in the presence of h2o2 94 in addition after 4 cycles the degradation efficiency using mos2 fevo4 composite is maintained thus highlighting its stability since the photolysis of h2o2 is negligible under visible light the high degradation extent is due to integrated adsorption with both photo fenton and photocatalysis indeed mos2 photocatalyst has excellent adsorption properties due to its layered structure in addition its combination with fevo4 another photocatalyst leads to the formation of a type ii heterojunction where the photogenerated e h pairs are efficiently separated thus producing more reactive oxygen species including ho radicals furthermore fevo4 contains iron which triggers fenton based processes it is worth reminding that the iron cycle especially the regeneration of fe ii is the limiting step in fenton process in mos2 fevo4 the reduction of fe iii into fe ii is supported by the photogenerated electrons accumulated in fevo4 and the photo fenton reaction also called iron photolysis wang et al investigated the efficiency of a composite material of mos2 and schwertmannite an iron based mineral fe8o8 oh 8 2x so4 x 90 schwertmannite has already shown good potential in environmental remediation via adsorption or fenton based oxidation processes 95 97 therefore its combination with mos2 photocatalyst has been proposed as an efficient strategy for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds indeed mos2 schwertmannite can efficiently remove 85 removal roxarsone by integrated adsorption with photo fenton photocatalysis in the presence of h2o2 after 40 min uva irradiation 90 this high removal extent has been linked to the efficient iron cycling between fe ii fe iii indeed similar to mos2 fevo4 the photogenerated electrons in mos2 can get transferred in the schwertmannite thus subsequently reducing fe iii into fe ii while the iron photolysis under uva light is also a factor which helps the generation of fe ii from fe iii in addition at the composite heterojunction fe o mo bond leads also to the reduction of fe3 by mo4 90 wang et al also highlighted the important role of photogenerated holes along with the attack by hydroxyl radicals in the degradation mechanism of roxarsone 90 4 5 magnetic composites and other sophisticated iron based materials beside the integrated adsorption with photo fenton photocatalysis some issues related to post treatment separation which limits the application of such composite materials a promising solution is the combination of adsorbent with magnetite fe3o4 84 in addition fe3o4 is an excellent heterogeneous photo fenton catalyst due to the presence of both iron ii and iron iii thus being an advantage for the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater composites based on fe3o4 nanoparticles and carbon based materials exhibit high specific surface area and can adsorb about 3 time more pollutants than pristine fe3o4 82 84 85 therefore in presence of h2o2 under solar like light a composite based on magnetite modified by thin carbon shell fe3o4 hcs can completely degrade tetracycline after 10 min reaction time 84 such a composite is stable since a small decrease in degradation efficiency by about 10 is observed after 5 cycles 84 fe3o4 nanoparticles can be also immobilized on graphene oxide fe3o4 go to trigger integrated adsorption with photo fenton process 83 such composite can degrade efficiently phenol which is an important precursor for the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds 83 although fe3o4 go has a lower adsorption capacity than pristine graphene oxide 80 of phenol can be adsorbed after 2 h at ph 5 in the dark while under uv irradiation the removal extent increases to 98 from which 80 is fully mineralized in the presence of h2o2 compared to pristine fe3o4 fe3o4 go enhances the degradation of phenol by about 30 thank to the integrated adsorption with photo fenton process thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the bifunctional material 83 it is worth noting fe3o4 go is also a stable composite with good reproducibility of the results after 3 successive runs while iron leaching do not exceed 0 3 mg l 1 83 similarly reduced graphene oxide rgo loaded fe3o4 particles can degrade almost completely carbamazepine 98 after 3 h sunlight irradiation the contribution of adsorption process and the photocatalytic and fenton based processes are both about 50 respectively 85 concerning the degradation mechanism the generation of hydroxyl radicals via photo fenton process and photocatalysis using fe3o4 can degrade and mineralize the pharmaceutical compounds while the graphene based adsorbents improve their removal of by π π interactions 83 therefore the degradation of phenol and carbamazepine using fe3o4 go and rgo fe3o4 composite is ascribed to the high adsorption capacity and efficient degradation mineralization by the hydroxyl radicals 83 85 more sophisticated magnetic materials can be also designed for the removal of pharmaceuticals 98 99 for instance feni3 sio2 zno can remove completely of penicillin g after 2 h uva irradiation 99 in such an integrated system feni3 plays the role of the magnetic component for easy post separation treatment while sio2 and zno are the adsorbent and the photocatalyst respectively 99 the photo fenton process for such a system has not been yet investigated but it appears promising it is because a similar composite material feni3 sio2 has shown promising ability in coupled adsorption and fenton like oxidation for the degradation of metronidazole 98 about 80 of the metronidazole was removed during this process reusability tests showed a slight decrease of about 8 in the removal efficiency from the first cycle to the sixth cycle demonstrating the strong stability of this material 4 6 stability of iron based materials for integrated adsorption with photochemical process all the above mentioned composite materials integrate adsorption with photo fenton process and or photocatalysis however in such photoactive materials containing iron it is well known that iron can be leached under light irradiation due to the photolysis of iron since most of these composite materials contain an adsorbing component e g carbon based adsorbents this potential leaching of iron can be limited while ternary oxide like mnfe2o4 is highly stable so no leaching occurs 83 in addition the adsorbents which are initially used for the adsorption of the target contaminants can also adsorb the degradation byproducts thus i removing the remaining pollution which cannot be degrade by photo fenton process and ii supporting the photochemical reactions at the surface of the composite material 79 indeed the adsorption ability of the composite not only facilitates the interaction of the contaminant with its surface but can also increase the transfer of photogenerated radicals leading to higher degradation extents 86 however the adsorption process can also affect negatively the photochemical processes where the adsorbed pharmaceuticals and degradation byproducts can hinder light utilization by the composite material thus decreasing the degradation efficiency of the contaminants 86 nevertheless the integrated adsorption with photocatalysis and photo fenton process is among the most efficient and innovative methods to efficiently remove pharmaceutical compounds thank to the bifunctionality of such composite materials therefore integrated adsorption with photo fenton and photocatalysis is highly relevant for efficient decontamination of wastewaters 5 conclusions and outlooks the use of dual functional materials to develop integrated treatments based on fenton oxidation and adsorption could be a highly efficient and cost effective water treatment however it is essential to overcome significant challenges before bench scale findings can be translated to field applications some of these challenges are associated to the treatment process while others are inherent to the tested materials heterogeneous catalysts and adsorbents that pose challenges to treatment system a brief description of major findings is provided below the development of cost effective and efficient materials for this purpose is a promising field it would be highly rewarding to develop materials which are multi functional efficient environment friendly stable and reusable innovative materials can broaden the utility of their applications magnetic nanomaterials and nanoarchitectures are showing great potential but their practical feasibility environmental fate and stability remains questionable magnetic materials when exposed to air can develop a passivating layer on its surface that affects the redox reactivity a phenomenon that turn out to be predominantly significant for nanosized particles with a higher surface to volume ratio 20 therefore finding suitable strategies to further improve the stability and efficiency of these materials e g appropriate coating composites is needed in addition to these solid treatments the addition of other reagents during the reaction may also improve the treatment efficiency for example our recent study showed that the application of ascorbic acid an environment friendly reducing agent improved the magnetite mediated fenton oxidation for higher removal of pentachlorophenol 100 the reducing capacity of ascorbic acid enabled the magnetite to maintain its structural fe ii contents during the oxidation reaction the development of bioinspired materials has also been suggested as a suitable alternative to the chemically synthesized supports but better understanding of their stability and efficiency is required in wastewater further investigations are certainly needed in order to optimize the operational parameters for high scale production of bioinspired materials further integration of these processes with biological treatments should also be sought to make them environmentally attractive this however remains a challenge due to drastic impacts of chemical oxidants on microbial biota activity which should be addressed the chances of improvement exist in preparing the environment friendly reusable materials improving the treatment efficiency and reducing the quantities of chemical oxidants another critical issue in research focused on hybrid treatments is the laboratory scale investigations many studies rely on artificially contaminated water containing only the target pollutant and often at much higher concentrations in real systems however natural organic matter is found in much higher amounts than target pollutants which would decrease the oxidation efficiency due to non target consumption of materials and oxidants 10 thus these hybrid treatments could suffer from reduced performance in complex water matrices for this more studies are needed on real water wastewater representative samples to identify the materials with better potential for field scale applications moreover the quality and quantity of contaminated water dictate the choice of appropriate material treatment hence a thorough site specific characterization of water is needed prior to their treatment non selective nature of adsorption can become a potential drawback in aqueous systems contaminated with a variety of pollutants to address this the development of adsorbents with preferential adsorption properties could be advantageous it will likely concentrate the target pollutants for an ex situ fenton oxidation treatment moreover sequential treatment cycles of adsorption and oxidation processes in separate reactors tanks could also be considered as a means to overcome drawbacks caused by the multi contamination of real wastewaters finally efforts should be made to upscale the findings to simulated realistic conditions and real field applications despite success in laboratory the translation of hybrid treatments for field application remains at an early stage of development future research should focus on rationally designing the dual functional materials for their intended use finally an accurate assessment of the value of dual functional materials with respect to cost and life cycle impacts is crucial for the successful implementation of these materials declaration of competing interest the authors declare

12577,pharmaceutical contaminants have shown widespread presence in water wastewater threatening environmental and human health existing literature shows that adsorption can efficiently bind pharmaceuticals preventing their transfer into the treated water however adsorption only diverts these contaminants from one phase to another requiring the treatment of contaminant laden adsorbents fenton oxidation h2o2 based has shown good potential for the degradation of pharmaceuticals but the practical use of fenton oxidation is often limited by its higher chemical demands and low contact of oxidizing species with target contaminants efforts to overcome these practical obstacles aim to develop efficient heterogeneous catalysts which also benefit from their strong contaminant adsorption capacity this is the first review that focuses exclusively on dual functional materials that can effectively adsorb pharmaceutical pollutants separation based removal and promote fenton oxidation simultaneously degradation based removal in aqueous systems the dual functionality enables the integration of adsorption and fenton based processes heterogeneous fenton photo fenton and photocatalysis to efficiently remove pharmaceuticals this integration can be achieved using a single material having both functions or by compositing impregnating different materials the properties of these materials have important consequences on their treatment efficiency stability and regeneration ability these processes and materials are critically evaluated to illustrate their potential associated challenges and their key solutions some of these challenges originate from the tested materials while others are inherent to the treatment process and the prospects for improvement exist at their intersection future research should aim to rationally improve the catalytic and adsorption properties of these materials and explore their practical implementation in wastewater treatment technologies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wastewater treatment hybrid materials advanced oxidation processes adsorption emerging environmental pollutants data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction pharmaceuticals have been identified as an emerging group of environmental contaminants due to their potential hazards to human health and ecosystem 1 pharmaceutical contaminants are differentiated from traditional industrial pollutants based on a their diverse chemical structures molecular weight and functionality b they are polar molecules having more than one ionizable group whereas the degree of ionization is controlled by the solution ph c they are mainly lipophilic in nature though some of them are moderately soluble in water d they have the ability to persist in nature accumulate in life forms and remain biologically active e after administration metabolic reactions can modify their chemical structure 1 2 thus pharmaceuticals can be excreted without being transformed or metabolized in the form of more polar and lipophilic derivatives these properties ultimately dictate the fate and removal of pharmaceuticals in the environment differently than the traditional pollutants their presence in environment even in small quantities can be harmful because they have been specially designed to exert biological effects even at very low concentration 3 their contamination in aquatic systems is mainly linked to their misuse in medical and agricultural settings and the release of unregulated effluents hospital industrial domestic and agricultural 4 for example according to the us center for disease prevention and control injudicious antibiotic use may approach 50 5 this figure could be worse in developing countries where over the counter sales of drugs is highly unregulated 6 since traditional water wastewater treatments are unable to completely eliminate these compounds 7 finding affordable efficient and environmentally benign treatments is highly desired to maintain ecological security and a clean water supply many technologies have been tested to remove pharmaceuticals from aqueous systems among them adsorption of pharmaceuticals is known for its simplicity cost efficiency quick pollutant removal and low sludge production 8 9 however adsorption is a separation based technique a phase changing technology that simply diverts the pollutants from water to another phase yielding contaminant laden sorbents which require side stream disposal or further treatment to avoid the risks of secondary contamination unlike adsorption advanced oxidation processes aops offer compelling advantage of degrading the organic pollutants this feature is highly attractive for environmental protection and to enable decentralized treatments wherein the collection and transportation of waste are likely to be troublesome 10 among aops fenton based oxidation processes have received tremendous attention to degrade pharmaceuticals and other organic pollutants 11 heterogeneous fenton oxidation relies on iron oxide catalysts to produce reactive oxygen species ros predominantly hydroxyl radicals ho for pollutant degradation however fenton oxidation when applied alone can be environmentally harmful and expensive due to substantial chemical input 1 to overcome these challenges dual functional materials are increasingly studied as heterogenous catalysts and adsorbents 8 9 these materials have the potential to simultaneously adsorb pollutants separation based removal and catalyze fenton oxidation degradation based removal the dual functionality of these materials enables the coupling of adsorption and fenton oxidation for higher treatment efficiency while reducing the associated costs and limitations of individual techniques by regeneration of materials and higher elimination of pollutants heterogeneous fenton processes can be further enhanced with additional input of light photo fenton that has also been explored these integrated treatments can be used for both ex situ after separating the adsorbent as well as in situ applications without separating the adsorbent by relying on the same materials fig 1 this can be achieved either by using a single material having both functions or by compositing impregnating different materials to develop the dual functionality in a hybrid material this dual functionality has been the subject of huge amount of research in the recent decade tables 1 and 2 in integrated processes adsorption usually accounts for the initial treatment stage to bind pharmaceuticals which are then degraded by the ros formed during fenton oxidation pollutant adsorption on the surface of dual functional materials improves the pollutant catalyst oxidant contact which enhances the treatment efficiency moreover the degradation of adsorbed pharmaceuticals by subsequent fenton oxidation allows the regeneration of the spent material for further treatment cycles this regeneration and reuse of materials are highly advantageous to reduce the treatment cost and to avoid the generation and disposal of pollutant laden spent adsorbent dual functionality of these materials improves the pharmaceutical degradation while reducing the risks of secondary contamination 12 the disposal of pollutant laden spent adsorbent is are addressed by subsequent fenton oxidation that regenerates the adsorbent by removing the pollution however in another procedure fenton oxidation can be applied as the initial treatment which is followed by adsorption this procedure allows the elimination of the major organic contaminants by fenton oxidation and the further removal of their traces and or byproducts by subsequent adsorption 13 14 thus integrated treatments combine the benefits of both techniques these treatments have therefore distinct advantages of higher contaminant removal less oxidant consumption and prevention of secondary pollution there exist many reviews that focused on the removal of pharmaceuticals from aqueous environments however main focus of these reviews was either various techniques for pharmaceutical removal 1 2 fenton oxidation 15 16 adsorption 9 or with a focus on particular group of adsorbents for example sewage sludge derived biochar 17 carbon nanotubes 18 the integration of both processes using dual functional materials has however not been reviewed so far which constitutes the main objective of this article to our knowledge this is the first review that focuses on the integration of both treatments by relying on dual functional materials to eliminate pharmaceutical contaminants from aqueous systems for this we compiled the research data from numerous publications retrieved from scopus database evaluating the applications of integrated treatments to eliminate pharmaceuticals in aqueous systems dual functionality of iron minerals and their composites with other materials allows the coupling of adsorption with heterogeneous fenton and photo fenton oxidation processes a brief account of the role of these iron minerals in photo catalysis is also provided a critical evaluation of these techniques and materials is provided to demonstrate the promising treatments materials with a concise explanation of associated limitations and their key solutions with this review we intend to offer a useful resource and potential research directions to explore the practical implications of fenton based processes and adsorption for real wastewater treatment plants 2 literature search methodology scopus database was searched on november 21 2021 updated on june 5 2022 by using these keywords in manuscript titles abstracts and keywords title abs key fenton and adsorption or sorption and pharmaceutical or antibiotic or personal care products this search procedure is commonly used in bibliometric studies where the exact phrases are found by using quotation marks which deactivate the synonym feature of search database 11 19 term or allows finding various expressions which were coupled by using and to ensure the appearance of these words in the title abs key of each article the use of asterisk symbol serves as a wildcard to find the different variations among the target keywords in the databases for example the use of antibiotic allows to find antibiotic antibiotics or other variations of this term this search returned 238 articles which were read to find if it deals with the use of integrated treatment to remove pharmaceuticals 3 coupling of heterogeneous fenton oxidation with adsorption traditional fenton oxidation counts on dissolved iron species fe ii mainly to catalyze hydrogen oxide h2o2 for the generation of ho radicals that degrade organic pollutants however the traditional fenton process suffers from fundamental drawbacks of maintaining an acidic ph the ho radical production is efficient only at an acidic ph below 4 which is costly and impractical in environmental settings 11 moreover this process leads to the generation of iron sludge after the treatment to address these drawbacks heterogeneous fenton oxidation has been developed that relies on iron bearing minerals or solids instead of dissolved fe ii these iron bearing minerals and solids can catalyze fenton oxidation at wide range of ph values 20 in addition to their catalytic ability hydrophilic iron oxides also benefit from their capacity to adsorb polar and negatively charged compounds highlighting their dual role in the remediation of pharmaceuticals 8 9 a brief description of adsorption coupled with heterogeneous fenton oxidation using various materials for the removal of pharmaceuticals is provided below table 1 3 1 pristine nano zero valent iron nzvi and its composites with other materials nano zero valent fe nzvi represents an important material that has been widely used to promote the integrated remediation processes here the removal mechanism involved the adsorption of pharmaceuticals on nzvi surface followed by the production of ho radicals by its reaction with h2o2 eqs 1 and 2 for pollutant oxidation 21 22 1 fe 0 h 2 o 2 2h fe ii 2h 2 o 2 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii ho ho though nzvi particles are highly efficient they being highly reactive are easily oxidized to form oxide layers on its surface which decreases their catalytic ability fig 2 24 indeed the surface passivation of nzvi has been recognized among the major challenges in its successful application to remove pollutants 23 25 nzvi corrosion phenomenon is dictated by various factors including the composition of nzvi itself oxic anoxic environments reaction time and the concentration and type of aqueous species 25 as such nzvi can be corroded and transformed into other iron oxides like ferrihydrite magnetite etc which can also contribute in adsorption and or fenton oxidation fig 2 26 another issue is the magnetic nature of nzvi particles that can cause them to spontaneously agglomerate decreasing their total surface area and efficiency to address these drawbacks associated with nzvi as dual functional materials the stability and reactivity of nzvi particles can be improved by three main strategies including i the development of bimetallic nanocomposites 24 27 ii by loading nzvi onto a support 22 28 29 or iii by encapsulating of nzvi particles for example in three dimensional graphene network 30 these strategies improve the stability and reactivity of nzvi while reducing its agglomeration for example tem images of nzvi on various supports indicate its successful attachment preventing its agglomeration fig 3 however pristine nzvi without any support fig 3 exhibits particle agglomeration and the presence of amorphous layers surrounding nzvi particles these layers have been recognized of iron oxide layers formed by nzvi oxidation 25 31 thus without support fe particles become strongly linked to each other under necklet form this behavior was however not observed in case of bimetallic or composited nzvi figs 3 and 4 bimetallic nanocomposites can be obtained by adding a second metal to nzvi 24 27 for this noble metals e g pt 24 and other metals e g cu 27 were commonly used due to their significant contribution in enhancing the electron generation capacity and stability of nzvi as compared to the pristine nzvi moreover this structural modification largely increased the surface area from 25 m2 g 1 pristine nzvi to 300 m2 g 1 pt0 5 nzvi this substantial increase in the surface area has been marked as the key reason for an improved adsorption of oxytetracycline by the authors 24 however further increase in pt contents beyond 0 5 wt turned nzvi particles into flake agglomeration and thus affected the morphology and reduced the efficiency of nzvi similarly the use of cu based bimetallic nzvi removed 56 of ciprofloxacin as compared to pristine nzvi 30 pollutant removal 27 in the same study 27 an interesting comparison has been made between the efficiency of cu nzvi synthesized by using green tea extract as the reductant termed as green method and the one synthesized by traditional chemical method based on sodium borohydride green synthesized cu nzvi was found more stable oxidation resistant and efficient than chemically synthesized cu nzvi as the former removed 81 of ciprofloxacin compared to the 56 removal by the later this has been linked to the higher dispersion of cu nzvi synthesized by green method adsorption or fenton like oxidation alone were able to remove about 30 and 50 respectively however the integration of both processes removed up to 90 of ciprofloxacin authors further reported that adsorption played a major role in pollutant removal in the start of the reaction but after 5 min desorption started happening with the passage of time due to surface oxidation of nzvi however after 20 min of reaction fenton oxidation began to take over adsorption 27 the stabilization and efficiency of nzvi cu bimetallic particles can be further improved by polyvinylpyrrolidone 32 owing to their catalytic potential of cu species in promoting fenton oxidation nano zerovalent copper cu0 has also been developed as an alternative of nzvi to catalyze iron free fenton like oxidation of ciprofloxacin eqs 3 and 4 33 also the substitution of cu in fe3o4 fe3 xcuxo4 as the final product has been found to increase adsorption capacity and ho radical production during photo fenton oxidation of anticancer drugs including 5 fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide 34 3 2cu 0 h 2 o 2 2h 2cu 2h 2 o 4 cu h 2 o 2 cu 2 ho ho another strategy to improve the stability of nzvi involves the deposition of nzvi particles on a support like biochar 22 reduced graphene oxide 28 29 31 cerium oxide 35 etc which can improve its stability and efficiency fig 3 for example the composites of rgo with bimetallic pd nzvi nanoparticles or nzvi particles provided a good solution to address the drawbacks of nzvi based materials and improved their efficiency 31 fig 4 in comparison with 53 removal of oxytetracycline by pristine nzvi pollutant removal reached 83 with bimetallic pd nzvi pollutant removal improved to 96 with bimetallic nanocomposites of pd nzvi rgo5 rgo 5 w w the removal of oxytetracycline by pd nzvi rgo composite has been linked to adsorption fenton like oxidation and reduction reactions as demonstrated in fig 4 in addition to an improved efficiency the use of pd nzvi rgo5 exhibited better pollutant removal in subsequent treatment cycles oxytetracycline removal by pristine nzvi from 53 to 1 in five oxidation cycles whereas the efficiency of pd nzvi rgo5 composite retained 18 of removal efficiency 31 compositing nzvi with ceo2 was also found to improve the efficiency and stability of nzvi 35 a radical identification experiment linked it to the remarkable production of ho radical by nzvi ceo2 composite as the bare nzvi the ceo2 improved the catalyst s adsorption characteristics and electron transfer to improve h2o2 decomposition due to the abundance of surface oxygen vacancies 35 the encapsulation of nzvi particles in three dimensional graphene network has also been proposed as a potential strategy to enhance the stability and efficiency of nzvi 30 the encapsulation of iron copper bimetallic nps within the mesoporous carbon shell fecu c promoted the catalytic degradation of sulfamethazine 36 synergistic catalytic role of fe and cu species improved the formation of ho radicals by promoting fe ii fe iii redox cycle while the presence of carbon increased the adsorption capacity 63 pollutant removal sulfamethazine was completely removed in the integrated process 3 2 pristine iron minerals having dual functions adsorption and fenton catalyst iron minerals have received substantial attention for their demonstrated efficiency in promoting both adsorption and fenton based oxidation processes owing to the high surface area iron minerals have been widely used to adsorb variety of pollutants from contaminated water wastewater structural fe contents of these minerals enable them to catalyze fenton oxidation at circumneutral ph which is highly advantageous for real scale applications it should be noted that classical fenton oxidation h2o2 soluble fe ii is often limited by the acidic ph range required to avoid the precipitation of soluble fe ii however in case of iron minerals the entrapment of fe species within the structure of iron minerals prevents their precipitation leading to an improved catalytic ability over a wide ph range this quality of iron minerals makes them ideal catalysts for heterogeneous fenton oxidation iron minerals exist in nature as ferric fe iii bearing or mixed valent iron minerals bearing fe ii both fe iii 37 for example feooh based fenton like system showed good capacity 80 to remove roxarsone antibiotic and to adsorb arsenic which has been formed as the by product of roxarone oxidation thus the dual functionality of feooh allowed the degradation of the target pharmaceutical while eliminating the risk of secondary contamination 12 similarly weng et al 26 found that the use of green synthesized fe nps for synergetic adsorption and fenton like oxidation removed 90 of ofloxacin and enrofloxacin in a mixed contamination system after an initial pre adsorption these pharmaceuticals were removed by an oxidative degradation in the presence of h2o2 these materials also showed good treatment efficiency either if they were reused 60 or were applied to remove target pharmaceuticals in the real wastewater 60 26 owing to the existence of structural fe ii mixed valent fe minerals are considered more reactive to catalyze heterogeneous fenton oxidation 20 for example impregnating ferrihydrite on powdered activated carbon demonstrated an excellent adsorption capacity 203 mg g 1 for diclofenac removal however subjecting this material to subsequent fenton oxidation partially removed the adsorbed pollutant along with a decrease in its regeneration ability by 25 on the other hand ball milled magnetite nanoparticles exhibited efficient removal of ciprofloxacin by heterogeneous fenton oxidation 38 indeed magnetite alone removed up to 43 of ciprofloxacin due to adsorption but ciprofloxacin removal was increased to 89 by subsequent chemical oxidation h2o2 12 mm fe3o4 1 75 g l 1 it should be noted that magnetite fe ii fe iii 2 o4 owing to the presence of structural fe ii has emerged as a viable dual purpose material that has shown higher catalytic ability as compared to the ferric minerals 20 moreover its magnetic nature also facilitates the quick recovery of the spent materials using an external magnet from the reaction medium for their reusability or disposal 39 the reuse of magnetite in four consecutive treatments by hassani et al 38 revealed that the efficiency of magnetite decreased from 89 to 65 in four oxidation cycles the oxidation efficiency of iron minerals can get decreased by surface oxidation passivation and fe leaching and which if addressed can recover the treatment efficiency 19 the efficiency and stability of magnetite can be enhanced by preparing its composites with other reactive materials discussed in following sections 3 3 composites of iron minerals and other materials the development of efficient composites particularly based on magnetic materials has received tremendous attention in the recent decade compositing magnetic iron minerals with suitable supports can improve the stability and catalytic ability of these iron minerals moreover composites of magnetic iron minerals with other materials are also prepared to introduce the magnetic feature in materials which are otherwise deprived of these characteristics 40 45 for example embedding fe3o4 nanoparticles on 3d reduced graphene oxide rgo was advantageous to introduce the magnetic feature in the composite adsorbent and improve the catalytic activity of magnetite 40 this material fe3o4 rgo exhibited adsorption capacity 2 78 mmol g 1 for ciprofloxacin and 4 76 mmol g 1 for tetracycline much higher than the rgo alone 1 mmol g 1 for both pollutants and commercial granular activated carbon 1 mmol g 1 fe3o4 nanoparticles were deposited between the graphene sheets and served as spacers preventing the aggregation of graphene sheets all the adsorbed amount was completely removed by subsequent fenton like oxidation by introducing h2o2 and this material maintained its efficiency for 10 adsorption oxidation cycles 40 total iron loss was only 1 after adsorption oxidation cycles underscoring the strong stability and high catalytic efficiency of magnetite nanoparticles on rgo the existence of both fe ii and fe iii in octahedral layer of magnetite on rgo allowed fe species to be reversibly oxidized and reduced while retaining the structure 40 the schematic diagram of this catalytic oxidation along with iron regeneration is presented in fig 5a similarly using magnetite embedded onto chitosan carbon microbeads adsorbed significant amount 4 18 mg g 1 of doxycycline under flow through conditions at a flow rate of 1 1 ml min 46 sequential addition of h2o2 5 to trigger the fenton oxidation removed up to 95 of the adsorbed pollutant regenerating the magnetite chitosan carbon microbeads for repeated applications the regeneration efficiency of this magnetic material increased from 78 to 93 of pollutant removal with an increase in the oxidant dose from 2 to 5 and then decreased to 72 and 55 with further increase in oxidant dose to 8 and 11 it has been attributed to the scavenging of ho radicals at higher oxidant doses 47 a composite of magnetite with carbon nanotubes cnts synthesized by ball milling was used to remove six sulfonamides including sulfanilamide sulfamerazine sulfadimethoxine sulfadiazine sulfamethazine and sulfametoxydiazine 49 the adsorption efficiency of sulfamerazine reached 59 70 and 6 in the presence of magnetite cnt composite cnt and fe3o4 respectively though the adsorption capacity of the composite material was lower than cnt it caused higher pollutant removal by subsequent fenton oxidation 100 71 and 37 in the presence of magnetite cnt composite cnt and fe3o4 respectively with h2o2 moreover the presence of magnetite introduces the magnetic character in composite material that facilitated its separation for regeneration carbon nanotubes cnts pyrrhotite fes also exhibited substantial removal 90 of ciprofloxacin that has been linked to the synergistic adsorption fenton like oxidation and catalytic degradation by cnts catalyst 48 fig 5b cnts possess excellent adsorption capacity owing to its large surface area and porous structure on the other hand fes can produce fe ii in solution that would catalyze h2o2 to produce ho radicals for the degradation of ciprofloxacin additional trials performed using ho radical scavengers including potassium iodide surface bound radical scavenger and methanol scavenger for all the unbounded ho radicals revealed that the removal of ciprofloxacin was mainly dependent on unbounded ho radicals while the contribution of bounded ho radicals remains insignificant adsorption process alone was able to remove 25 of ciprofloxacin while the removal efficiency reached 90 in integrated process due to the synergistic effect of adsorption and oxidation by free and bounded ho radicals biochar has also emerged as an important material in the recent decade with many environmental applications it can be developed from various biomasses for example biochar 50 or carbon 51 derived from sewage sludge with sufficient amounts of native fe removed pharmaceuticals 90 91 through synergetic effect of adsorption and fenton oxidation relying on sewage sludge or agricultural wastes to synthesize biochar could reduce the treatment cost while offering an innovative solution for solid waste management 52 53 however depending upon the contents and form of iron in biomass fe loading on biochar can be required to improve its catalytic ability for example xie et al 54 developed composites of fexp biochar by pyrolysis of phosphorus containing biomass yeast preloaded with feooh on its surface synergistic adsorption and fenton like oxidation removed 99 of sulfamethoxazole however the development of composite materials usually involves impregnation method where iron precursor loaded carbon materials are pyrolyzed or iron oxides are immobilized onto carbon materials these approaches can be limited by uneven distribution of iron or its oxides on the surface of composite materials in this regard direct carbonization of metal organic frameworks mofs to synthesize carbon based porous materials has been suggested by gu et al 55 they developed a magnetic fe porous carbon material via one step pyrolysis method and found it highly suitable to remove tetracycline highest adsorption of 1301 mg g 1 onto this material was recorded which was about 6 times higher than activated carbon the mechanism of adsorption mainly included surface complexation hydrogen bonding and π π interactions fig 6 fenton oxidation allowed the regeneration of this material for further treatment cycles where it retained its efficiency 70 79 55 magnetic iron based carbon materials are also gaining particular interest because of the remarkable adsorption from the mutual role of carbon c and fe higher catalytic ability associated mainly with fe species and easy recovery from aqueous matrix due to their magnetic nature for repeated applications 55 57 iron based mofs nh2 mil 88b were found to completely remove pefloxacin from contaminated solution by adsorption followed by fenton like oxidation 58 adsorption capacity reached 41 4 mg g 1 in 120 min whereas pefloxacin was completely removed by subsequent fenton like oxidation similarly fe2o3 covalent organic frameworks fe2o3 cofs was synthesized by restricting the growth of fe2o3 in the nanoscale channel of cofs 56 the use of this material resulted in 45 removal of sulfamethazine by adsorption while integration with h2o2 completely removed this pollutant recently magnetic spent bleaching earth carbon was synthesized by the anoxic pyrolysis of spent bleaching earth a waste product of vegetable oil industry followed by the in situ synthesis of magnetite via coprecipitation 59 the adsorption of tetracycline hydrochloride reached 16 with equilibrium attained in in 60 min pollutant removal efficiency reached 89 after 1 min of oxidant addition in the reaction medium fig 7a an increase in the quantity of this material from 0 5 to 2 g l 1 increased the adsorption of tetracycline hydrochloride from 18 to 65 and oxidation 52 to 97 fig 7 the development of efficient environmental materials from solid industrial wastes like that of spent bleaching earth could be a sustainable solution for resource recovery and solid waste management however for all the composite materials maintaining an optimum level of iron loading is crucial to attain the maximum degradation of pollutants increasing iron loading beyond an optimum point makes iron dispersion less homogeneous which reduces the oxidation efficiency 60 in another study the loading of fe3o4 on cellulose nanocomposites reduced the iron loss from 19 from fe3o4 to 1 in composite sample while removing about 90 of tetracycline due to the supportive role of adsorption and fenton like degradation 61 it is worth mentioning that adsorption alone was able to remove only 33 of tetracycline moreover the development of bioinspired magnetic cellulose nanocomposites has been suggested as a suitable alternative to the chemically synthesized supports which are non degradable environmentally unsustainable or their synthesis relies on hazardous chemicals 61 4 coupling of photo fenton and photocatalysis with adsorption photo induced processes including photo fenton and photocatalysis can be employed in combination with adsorption to remove pharmaceutical compounds compared to the traditional fenton and fenton like processes photo fenton involves the photo reduction of iron iii to generate ros under light especially ho radicals eq 5 photo fenton reaction favors the regeneration of fe ii that addresses the rate limiting step of fenton oxidation reduction of iron iii into iron ii 70 71 the use of fe iii is a considerable advantage since it is more stable than fe ii at circumneutral ph in addition h2o2 can be also added to the photo fenton process so classical fenton reaction occurs therefore a catalytic cycle fe iii fe ii is set up 5 fe 3 h 2 o hν fe 2 h ho photo fenton oxidation and adsorption are usually integrated using composite materials based on iron oxides composited with different adsorbents table 2 consequently the composite materials can also trigger photocatalysis in the case the iron based material is a semiconductor 72 74 photocatalysis relies on the formation of electron hole e h pairs under light which react further to generate primary ros fig 8 it is worth noting that the isolated use of photo fenton photocatalysis and adsorption processes has been widely studied however their simultaneous application is an emerging field with relatively fewer studies this section illustrates the integration of adsorption with photo fenton and photocatalysis for the removal of pharmaceuticals a brief summary of the salient findings regarding the efficiency of various materials in integrated processes is provided in table 2 a brief description of these studies is provided in the following sections 4 1 iron based materials combined with zeolites and porous alumina iron based spinel structure are widely used photoactive materials especially for heterogeneous photo fenton process their combination with zeolite showed promising potential to remove pharmaceutical compounds since zeolites exhibit excellent adsorption properties due to high ion exchange properties hydrophilic affinities and specific surface area 76 77 indeed nax nanozeolite combined with cofe2o4 can completely remove paracetamol 20 mg l 1 after 30 min irradiation under uva light in the presence of h2o2 that corresponds to a 50 increase in pollutant removal extent compared to that by adsorption alone 77 such a high efficiency is due to the synergy of iron based catalyst and zeolites owing to their excellent adsorption capacity and hydrophilic affinities higher adsorption improves the contact of paracetamol with the iron based catalyst enhancing its degradation with photo fenton process 76 77 similarly mesoporous alumina is an excellent adsorbent for the support of photo fenton catalyst indeed the combination of meso al2o3 with fe ii can almost completely remove phenol after 60 min in the presence of h2o2 under uv light at ph 3 78 adsorption alone can remove 40 of phenol due to the high chemical and thermal stability of mesoporous alumina along with its high specific surface area the integration of adsorption with photo fenton process leads to an increase of 60 in degradation extents owing to the oxidative attack of hydroxyl radicals on phenol 4 2 iron based materials combined with biomass based adsorbents biomass based materials particularly activated carbon are considered highly promising due to their natural origin and their sustainable production recently della flora et al designed an integrated adsorption system with photo fenton process to remove a mixture of pharmaceutical compounds to simulate hospital wastewater including chloramphenicol fluconazole flutamide flurosemide gemfibrozil ibuprofen losartan nimesulide and paracetamol 13 79 the first step involves the photo fenton process which is performed for 15 min under simulated solar light at ph 4 with a single addition of 100 mg l 1 h2o2 and multiple additions of fe ii 5 mg l 1 at 0 min 5 min and 10 min of treatment time subsequently adsorption process using activated carbon obtained from avocado seeds is performed as post treatment for 15 min such a combination of processes can remove almost completely all the pharmaceutical compounds indeed the photo fenton process can degrade from 30 to 80 of the contaminant after 15 min depending upon pharmaceutical compound and the remaining contamination including the toxic transformation products can be removed by adsorption there exist multiple adsorption reactions as illustrated in fig 9 with the example of flutamide in the presence of activated carbon from avocado seeds 69 however the involvement of photo fenton process requires the acidification of the water matrix which is not economically viable 70 71 in addition the ph also affects the efficiency of adsorption process through activated carbon 13 at acidic ph the chemical structure of the adsorbent is composed of aromatic rings possesses positively charged surface thus most of the target and transformed pharmaceutical compounds which also contain aromatic rings and are neutral or negatively charged at acidic ph are easily adsorbed through coulombic and π π interactions 13 it is worth noting that the open ring transformation products are not efficiently removed by adsorption process due to weak interactions with the adsorbent and strong solubility in water respectively but the photo fenton process can efficiently degrade and mineralize this fraction of the contamination 13 79 these studies highlight the utility of the adsorption as the secondary process in the integrated system another integrated system combining adsorption and photo fenton processes has been discussed by oladipo et al where tetracycline and phenol have been removed using fe3o4 nanoparticles covered by waste cyprus coffee residue fe3o4 cc 72 such a composite can adsorb tetracycline with an increase of 50 compared to cc alone and degrade and mineralize efficiently this pharmaceutical compound along with its aromatic intermediates in the presence of h2o2 and solar irradiation 72 as expected the excellent adsorption capacity of fe3o4 cc was found dependent on the solution ph tetracycline exists in cationic form at ph 3 3 in anionic form at ph 7 7 and as zwitterion between ph 3 3 and 7 7 therefore the optimal adsorption of tetracycline occurred at circumneutral ph and it is due to electrostatic interactions and h bonding between the waste coffee residue and the iron oxide respectively and the pharmaceutical compound 72 the photo fenton process generated ros mainly ho and o2 ho2 that efficiently degraded tetracycline as well as its degradation byproducts such as phenol catechol and hydroquinone 72 therefore the use biomass based adsorbent including activated carbon in integrated adsorption with photo fenton system is an interesting strategy for the efficient removal of pharmaceutical compounds such adsorbents interact with aromatic contaminants by π π and h bonding while photo fenton process efficiently oxidize the remaining pollution in the solution 4 3 iron based materials combined with g c3n4 the integration of adsorption with both photo fenton and or photocatalysis has also been proposed as an innovative system 80 81 indeed iron based oxides can also play the role of photocatalyst and adsorbent for the removal of pharmaceuticals for instance the composites based on graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 and iron based oxide like fe2o3 and mnfe2o4 belong to such an integrated system 80 81 eventually an adsorbent can also be included in the composite like graphene 80 for example zhao et al investigated a composite material made of g c3n4 with fe2o3 nanodots 81 such a composite can degrade 90 of tetracycline in the presence of h2o2 after 1 h under visible light for comparison the integrated adsorption with photocatalysis without h2o2 and fenton process in the dark can only degrade about 20 and 45 of the target pharmaceutical respectively 81 however the photo fenton is not discussed in detail by zhao et al although it has probably a significant contribution to the excellent efficiency of the g c3n4 fe2o3 composite it is also worth noting the g c3n4 fe2o3 composite is highly stable since the efficiency of tetracycline degradation by integrated adsorption with simultaneous photocatalysis and photo fenton decreased by about 4 after 4 repeated runs on the other hand wang et al 80 prepared g c3n4 mnfe2o4 graphene composites for the degradation of a wide range of antibiotic compounds including tetracycline ciprofloxacin metronidazole and amoxicillin such composites integrate a non photoactive adsorbent thus combining photocatalysis photo fenton and adsorption fig 10 the photochemical systems also included the use of persulfate s2o8 2 as radical precursor the pollutant degradation efficiency ranged from 50 to 90 in 10 mm pharmaceutical solutions after 90 min visible light irradiation depending upon the compound 80 in addition the reusability of such composites is excellent as no significant decrease in removal efficiency was reported after 5 repeated runs the excellent removal efficiencies of these composite materials were attributed to different reasons an important one is the type ii heterojunction between g c3n4 and iron based oxide that enhances the charge carrier separation and transport another reason is the scavenging of photogenerated electron by the adsorbent thus increasing the charge carrier lifetime while the adsorbent is providing active sites for degradation reactions also the presence of fenton active elements like fe and mn in the composite materials can efficiently catalyze fenton based reactions including photo fenton for the activation of persulfate and h2o2 into inorganic radicals ho and so4 which are highly reactive species for the efficient destruction of pharmaceutical compounds 80 81 4 4 iron based materials combined with mos2 other promising materials are those composed of mos2 and an iron based compound beside the activation of photocatalysis and photo fenton process mos2 has a layered structure that can play a crucial role in organic pollutant adsorption 93 for instance li et al 93 investigated magnetic fe3o4 fe1 xs mos2 which can efficiently degrade tetracycline in water in the presence of h2o2 under visible light the advantage of such a composite is its stability high adsorption capacity and magnetic properties thus being advantageous for post treatment separation however all the processes including adsorption photocatalysis and fenton based processes are discussed separately so it is difficult to describe the contribution of each process other composites based on mos2 have also been investigated for the removal of pharmaceuticals liu et al prepared a mos2 fevo4 composite that can degrade 70 of tetracycline after 1 h reaction under visible light in the presence of h2o2 94 in addition after 4 cycles the degradation efficiency using mos2 fevo4 composite is maintained thus highlighting its stability since the photolysis of h2o2 is negligible under visible light the high degradation extent is due to integrated adsorption with both photo fenton and photocatalysis indeed mos2 photocatalyst has excellent adsorption properties due to its layered structure in addition its combination with fevo4 another photocatalyst leads to the formation of a type ii heterojunction where the photogenerated e h pairs are efficiently separated thus producing more reactive oxygen species including ho radicals furthermore fevo4 contains iron which triggers fenton based processes it is worth reminding that the iron cycle especially the regeneration of fe ii is the limiting step in fenton process in mos2 fevo4 the reduction of fe iii into fe ii is supported by the photogenerated electrons accumulated in fevo4 and the photo fenton reaction also called iron photolysis wang et al investigated the efficiency of a composite material of mos2 and schwertmannite an iron based mineral fe8o8 oh 8 2x so4 x 90 schwertmannite has already shown good potential in environmental remediation via adsorption or fenton based oxidation processes 95 97 therefore its combination with mos2 photocatalyst has been proposed as an efficient strategy for the removal of pharmaceutical compounds indeed mos2 schwertmannite can efficiently remove 85 removal roxarsone by integrated adsorption with photo fenton photocatalysis in the presence of h2o2 after 40 min uva irradiation 90 this high removal extent has been linked to the efficient iron cycling between fe ii fe iii indeed similar to mos2 fevo4 the photogenerated electrons in mos2 can get transferred in the schwertmannite thus subsequently reducing fe iii into fe ii while the iron photolysis under uva light is also a factor which helps the generation of fe ii from fe iii in addition at the composite heterojunction fe o mo bond leads also to the reduction of fe3 by mo4 90 wang et al also highlighted the important role of photogenerated holes along with the attack by hydroxyl radicals in the degradation mechanism of roxarsone 90 4 5 magnetic composites and other sophisticated iron based materials beside the integrated adsorption with photo fenton photocatalysis some issues related to post treatment separation which limits the application of such composite materials a promising solution is the combination of adsorbent with magnetite fe3o4 84 in addition fe3o4 is an excellent heterogeneous photo fenton catalyst due to the presence of both iron ii and iron iii thus being an advantage for the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater composites based on fe3o4 nanoparticles and carbon based materials exhibit high specific surface area and can adsorb about 3 time more pollutants than pristine fe3o4 82 84 85 therefore in presence of h2o2 under solar like light a composite based on magnetite modified by thin carbon shell fe3o4 hcs can completely degrade tetracycline after 10 min reaction time 84 such a composite is stable since a small decrease in degradation efficiency by about 10 is observed after 5 cycles 84 fe3o4 nanoparticles can be also immobilized on graphene oxide fe3o4 go to trigger integrated adsorption with photo fenton process 83 such composite can degrade efficiently phenol which is an important precursor for the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds 83 although fe3o4 go has a lower adsorption capacity than pristine graphene oxide 80 of phenol can be adsorbed after 2 h at ph 5 in the dark while under uv irradiation the removal extent increases to 98 from which 80 is fully mineralized in the presence of h2o2 compared to pristine fe3o4 fe3o4 go enhances the degradation of phenol by about 30 thank to the integrated adsorption with photo fenton process thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the bifunctional material 83 it is worth noting fe3o4 go is also a stable composite with good reproducibility of the results after 3 successive runs while iron leaching do not exceed 0 3 mg l 1 83 similarly reduced graphene oxide rgo loaded fe3o4 particles can degrade almost completely carbamazepine 98 after 3 h sunlight irradiation the contribution of adsorption process and the photocatalytic and fenton based processes are both about 50 respectively 85 concerning the degradation mechanism the generation of hydroxyl radicals via photo fenton process and photocatalysis using fe3o4 can degrade and mineralize the pharmaceutical compounds while the graphene based adsorbents improve their removal of by π π interactions 83 therefore the degradation of phenol and carbamazepine using fe3o4 go and rgo fe3o4 composite is ascribed to the high adsorption capacity and efficient degradation mineralization by the hydroxyl radicals 83 85 more sophisticated magnetic materials can be also designed for the removal of pharmaceuticals 98 99 for instance feni3 sio2 zno can remove completely of penicillin g after 2 h uva irradiation 99 in such an integrated system feni3 plays the role of the magnetic component for easy post separation treatment while sio2 and zno are the adsorbent and the photocatalyst respectively 99 the photo fenton process for such a system has not been yet investigated but it appears promising it is because a similar composite material feni3 sio2 has shown promising ability in coupled adsorption and fenton like oxidation for the degradation of metronidazole 98 about 80 of the metronidazole was removed during this process reusability tests showed a slight decrease of about 8 in the removal efficiency from the first cycle to the sixth cycle demonstrating the strong stability of this material 4 6 stability of iron based materials for integrated adsorption with photochemical process all the above mentioned composite materials integrate adsorption with photo fenton process and or photocatalysis however in such photoactive materials containing iron it is well known that iron can be leached under light irradiation due to the photolysis of iron since most of these composite materials contain an adsorbing component e g carbon based adsorbents this potential leaching of iron can be limited while ternary oxide like mnfe2o4 is highly stable so no leaching occurs 83 in addition the adsorbents which are initially used for the adsorption of the target contaminants can also adsorb the degradation byproducts thus i removing the remaining pollution which cannot be degrade by photo fenton process and ii supporting the photochemical reactions at the surface of the composite material 79 indeed the adsorption ability of the composite not only facilitates the interaction of the contaminant with its surface but can also increase the transfer of photogenerated radicals leading to higher degradation extents 86 however the adsorption process can also affect negatively the photochemical processes where the adsorbed pharmaceuticals and degradation byproducts can hinder light utilization by the composite material thus decreasing the degradation efficiency of the contaminants 86 nevertheless the integrated adsorption with photocatalysis and photo fenton process is among the most efficient and innovative methods to efficiently remove pharmaceutical compounds thank to the bifunctionality of such composite materials therefore integrated adsorption with photo fenton and photocatalysis is highly relevant for efficient decontamination of wastewaters 5 conclusions and outlooks the use of dual functional materials to develop integrated treatments based on fenton oxidation and adsorption could be a highly efficient and cost effective water treatment however it is essential to overcome significant challenges before bench scale findings can be translated to field applications some of these challenges are associated to the treatment process while others are inherent to the tested materials heterogeneous catalysts and adsorbents that pose challenges to treatment system a brief description of major findings is provided below the development of cost effective and efficient materials for this purpose is a promising field it would be highly rewarding to develop materials which are multi functional efficient environment friendly stable and reusable innovative materials can broaden the utility of their applications magnetic nanomaterials and nanoarchitectures are showing great potential but their practical feasibility environmental fate and stability remains questionable magnetic materials when exposed to air can develop a passivating layer on its surface that affects the redox reactivity a phenomenon that turn out to be predominantly significant for nanosized particles with a higher surface to volume ratio 20 therefore finding suitable strategies to further improve the stability and efficiency of these materials e g appropriate coating composites is needed in addition to these solid treatments the addition of other reagents during the reaction may also improve the treatment efficiency for example our recent study showed that the application of ascorbic acid an environment friendly reducing agent improved the magnetite mediated fenton oxidation for higher removal of pentachlorophenol 100 the reducing capacity of ascorbic acid enabled the magnetite to maintain its structural fe ii contents during the oxidation reaction the development of bioinspired materials has also been suggested as a suitable alternative to the chemically synthesized supports but better understanding of their stability and efficiency is required in wastewater further investigations are certainly needed in order to optimize the operational parameters for high scale production of bioinspired materials further integration of these processes with biological treatments should also be sought to make them environmentally attractive this however remains a challenge due to drastic impacts of chemical oxidants on microbial biota activity which should be addressed the chances of improvement exist in preparing the environment friendly reusable materials improving the treatment efficiency and reducing the quantities of chemical oxidants another critical issue in research focused on hybrid treatments is the laboratory scale investigations many studies rely on artificially contaminated water containing only the target pollutant and often at much higher concentrations in real systems however natural organic matter is found in much higher amounts than target pollutants which would decrease the oxidation efficiency due to non target consumption of materials and oxidants 10 thus these hybrid treatments could suffer from reduced performance in complex water matrices for this more studies are needed on real water wastewater representative samples to identify the materials with better potential for field scale applications moreover the quality and quantity of contaminated water dictate the choice of appropriate material treatment hence a thorough site specific characterization of water is needed prior to their treatment non selective nature of adsorption can become a potential drawback in aqueous systems contaminated with a variety of pollutants to address this the development of adsorbents with preferential adsorption properties could be advantageous it will likely concentrate the target pollutants for an ex situ fenton oxidation treatment moreover sequential treatment cycles of adsorption and oxidation processes in separate reactors tanks could also be considered as a means to overcome drawbacks caused by the multi contamination of real wastewaters finally efforts should be made to upscale the findings to simulated realistic conditions and real field applications despite success in laboratory the translation of hybrid treatments for field application remains at an early stage of development future research should focus on rationally designing the dual functional materials for their intended use finally an accurate assessment of the value of dual functional materials with respect to cost and life cycle impacts is crucial for the successful implementation of these materials declaration of competing interest the authors declare

12578,a drastic improvement in the overall permeability and antifouling performance was observed for the polyacrylonitrile pan ultrafiltration uf membrane by the co incorporation of dopamine da protease e1 and lipase e2 in a facile multi step synthetic scheme sem was utilized to indicate the successful formation of modifying layers on the membrane surface whereas atr ftir and zeta potential were used to provide deeper insight into the membrane surface chemistry afm and contact angle were used to assess the membrane s surface roughness and hydrophilicity respectively the optimally modified membrane surface was found to be quite hydrophilic as indicated by the water contact angle value 39 8 0 8 and water flux across the membrane of 78 09 1 6 kg m2 h simultaneously natural organic matter nom including milk powder mp bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha were efficiently removed resulting in 99 9 92 5 and 80 5 removal efficiencies respectively notably the enzyme immobilized membrane demonstrated outstanding antifouling performance as well as long term stability the dynamic anti nom fouling studies indicated that the surface modification was potentially capable of overcoming the tradeoff between membrane permeability and selectivity resulting in frr values of 90 the antibacterial properties of the surface modified membranes against e coli and s aureus were also explored and the optimal enzyme immobilized membrane was found to be substantially antibacterial overall this study aims to pave the way for the development of sustainable chemistry in designing innovative and highly efficient membranes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polyacrylonitrile ultrafiltration membrane surface modification dopamine enzyme immobilization data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction as a robust pressure driven membrane separation technology ultrafiltration uf has already been extensively implemented in biotechnology 1 food and dairy processing 2 wastewater treatment 3 4 and reverse osmosis ro pretreatment 5 owing to their versatility and cost effectiveness polymeric membranes are an integral part of the ultrafiltration process 6 polyacrylonitrile pan has become one of the most commonly used polymers in membrane fabrication in consequence of its favorable properties such as satisfactory resistance to solvents decent mechanical properties considerable chemical stability and being more cost effective than other polymers such as polyethersulfone pes and polysulfone psf 7 8 however membrane fouling attributed to the membrane matrix s intrinsic hydrophobicity limits the widespread implementation of pan membranes 9 protein deposition on membrane surfaces and pore walls leads to a rise in hydraulic resistance as well as a substantial decrease in flux and ultimate separation performance shortening membrane lifetime and inducing a major impact on energy and cost consumption 10 as a result numerous researchers have zeroed in their attention on developing membranes that impede foulants such as proteins from being absorbed due to its versatility and effectiveness in rendering the desired functionalities membrane surface modification is currently one of the most pursued strategies for fine tuning filtration membrane properties 10 12 the core mission of surface modification is to promote surface characteristics such as surface composition morphology and surface charge without altering the bulk properties of the membrane a membrane containing precisely tailored properties guarantees that the separation process runs smoothly 13 the investigation of novel modifying agents for membrane modification has been conducted in parallel with the development of innovative membrane surface modification techniques 14 in this light among potential macromolecules investigated in recent years such as polymeric additives 15 20 biomolecules are starting to emerge as a class of modifying materials owing to their eco friendliness biomolecules are employed in many aspects of human life including the therapeutic field as well as the water purification process 13 in some early studies biomolecules such as enzymes have been used to modify polymeric membranes resulting in a shift in surface hydrophobicity hydrophilicity 21 in a study mehrabi et al used the covalent binding strategy to immobilize α amylase and lysozyme enzymes on polydopamine pda polyethyleneimine pei modified pes membranes removing 87 of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms 22 due to the build up of biofilm on its surface the unmodified membranes suffered a significant decline in water flux from 6723 l m 2 h 1 to 4090 l m 2 h 1 whereas the enzyme immobilized membranes experienced only a slight decrease in one most recent research tian s group has enhanced the antibacterial properties of a polyamide pa membrane surface by coating it with lysozymes minimizing bacterial adhesion and preventing trade offs between water flux and salt rejection 23 in comparison to the control membrane the modified ro membrane suppressed bacterial growth by 50 and had practically no loss in water flux or salt rejection as aforementioned in the existing literature covalent modification works by covalently linking the enzymes to the support membrane via their functional groups recent investigations have indicated that by employing a material surface with a moderate hydrophilicity enzyme adhesion capacity can be improved 24 messersmith and colleagues pioneered mussel inspired chemistry in 2007 and it has since opened up a whole new world of surface modification 25 owing to its self polymerization hydrophilicity and acceptable compatibility with polymers such as pan in terms of the flory huggins interaction parameter from a thermodynamic viewpoint 26 28 dopamine da 3 4 dihydroxyphenethylamine a well known molecular bio mimetic adhesive inspired by adhesive proteins excreted by marine mussels has gained great interest for bridging the gap between a wide range of materials under aerobic and alkaline conditions da containing abundant functional groups such as catechol and amino groups can spontaneously oxypolymerize into polydopamine pda the freshly formed hydrophilic pda layer not only strengthens the binding interactions between the modifier and membrane but also provides a versatile platform for efficient post functionalization of the membrane surface 29 30 to the best of the authors knowledge there have been very few investigations on the use of da to modify pan membrane surfaces in a comparative manner containing various modifying steps in order to load hydrolytic enzyme biomolecules in the present study we developed a novel surface modified uf membrane by immobilizing protease e1 and lipase e2 enzymes employing both an individual and an integrative covalent strategy on pda deposited pan membrane surfaces to suppress fouling formation and break down any cake layer that is formed immobilization of protease e1 lipase e2 and their mixtures e1 e2 has been undertaken on activated uf membrane surfaces with and without da to study their effects on the membrane properties and performance in addition to investigating the chemical structures and morphologies of the surface modified membranes natural organic matter nom including milk powder mp bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha were used to evaluate the effect of this multilayer surface modification on the minimization of cake layer formation besides antibacterial tests against e coli and s aureus were also performed 2 experimental 2 1 apparatus the filtration unit consists of a 250 ml stirred dead end filtration cell with

along with pvp were dissolved in dmf with concentrations of 16 and 1 wt respectively at 60 c with constant stirring 400 rpm the prepared solution was ultrasonically degassed for 10 min prior to getting left at room temperature for 6 h to allow trapped gas bubbles to escape from the solution the solution was directly cast on a glass support with a predetermined casting thickness of 150 μm using a self made casting knife and then submerged in a coagulation bath containing di water 25 c to verify that phase separation was accomplished prior to usage the polymer support was maintained in fresh di water at room temperature overnight interposing the precipitated membranes m1 between two sheets of filter paper allowed them to dry completely for 24 h 2 3 2 surface activation first the circular cut pan membranes 2 5 cm 2 5 cm were soaked in 3 m naoh for 1 h to introduce the hydroxyl groups onto the membranes surface the membranes were then taken from the alkaline solution and submerged in a thf solution containing 0 03 mol l cyanuric chloride cyanuric chloride has been utilized as a coupling reagent to efficiently cross link and immobilize enzymes to supports to form

compounds before use 32 2 3 3 enzyme immobilization the target enzymes to be immobilized on the pan support membrane by the immersion procedure were protease e1 lipase e2 and their mixture e1 e2 the role of da in immobilizing enzymes as well as regulating membrane structure and performance was investigated by immobilizing enzymes in the presence and absence of a polydopamine pda interlayer formed in situ on the top side of the activated pan support membranes to directly incorporate enzymes onto the support surface the activated membranes were soaked in a 1 g l e1 solution for 2 h at room temperature in a shaker incubator m2 individual immobilization of e2 as well as simultaneous immobilization of e1 and e2 on pan support membranes were also carried out in the same manner m3 and m4 respectively in the meantime 0 03 m of dopamine tris hcl solution ph 8 5 was required to form the pda layer on the activated pan support 33 to obtain the self polymerized layer of pda the activated uf supports were submerged in the da solution for 2 h while stirring at 400 rpm at room temperature m5 similarly e1 e2 and their combination e1 e2 were immobilized on top of the pda deposited pan membranes as outlined in the previous step m6 m7 and m8 respectively ultimately the free enzymes were eliminated by washing all enzyme immobilized membranes three times with phosphate buffer table 1 presents the specifications of all the fabricated membranes as they progressed through the surface modification processes 2 4 membranes characterization the attenuated total reflectance atr methodology was used on a bruker tensor27 spectrometer in the range of 450 4000 cm 1 equipped with a horizontal atr device to analyze changes in the surface functional groups of the fabricated membranes the significance of surface load in defining the mechanism of membrane separation cannot be overstated accordingly the membranes zeta potential was measured using a physica eka electro kinetic analyzer anton paar austria the solution s ph and kcl concentration were maintained at about 7 and 0 01 m respectively 34 changes in the top surface and cross section morphologies of the pan membranes were probed by employing a scanning electron microscope sem tescan mira3 filter paper was used to clean the membranes after they had been cut into little coupons all membrane specimens were made conductive prior to sem imaging by sputtering a thin coating of gold under vacuum membrane cross sections were obtained by fracturing the membranes at liquid nitrogen temperature they were examined under a microscope at 20 kv after sputtering with gold 35 an atomic force microscope afm nanosurf scanning probe optical microscope switzerland was used to investigate the topographical profiles of the membrane surfaces to capture afm images coupons of the fabricated membranes were attached to a glass holder and a small surface area of them was scanned under tapping mode in air to estimate roughness parameters the obtained imaging data was further analyses using nanosurf mobile software the average roughness sa the root mean square of the z data sq and the difference between the highest peaks and lowest valleys were used to represent the surface roughness parameters sz 2 5 membrane hydrophilicity and permeability assessment water contact angle wca was quantified using the sessile drop method 25 c with a goniometer g10 kruss germany to evaluate the membrane surface hydrophilicity a water droplet containing 2 μl of di water was put on a flat homogeneous membrane surface and the contact angle between the membrane surface and water was monitored until there was no change random sites were chosen for each sample to limit measurement error and average quantities were reported after five replications permeability of all membranes were investigated in a dead end filtration cell at 25 c using a 3 bar transmembrane pressure fig 1 permeate samples were collected and

antifouling evaluation natural organic matter nom is the most common contaminant inducing membrane fouling both reversible and irreversible being chemically complex nom is composed mostly of proteins polysaccharides and humic like substances that are prevalent in natural surface waters nom fouling is accompanied by the polymerization the cake layer formation pore narrowing and its blockage due to foulant adhesion and deposition mp 1000 mg l bsa 300 mg l and ha 100 mg l were selected as representatives of lipids proteins and humic substances respectively to evaluate the anti nom fouling properties and nom removal of the membranes deionized water was used to prepare the nom solutions and the ph of the solutions was adjusted to approximately 7 0 using either 0 1 m hcl or naoh the pwf was initially measured and used as a reference for membrane permeability in 1 h at 3 bar jw1 the membrane was then fouled for 2 5 h with freshly prepared model foulant solutions to determine the flux jp filtration was halted after 2 5 h of operation and the membrane was removed and washed briefly with di water for around 20 min without any physical treatment the cleansed membranes pwfs were measured again after hydraulic cleaning jw2 the flux recovery ratio frr during this three step filtration was calculated using eq 2 to assess the fouling resistance capacity of the fabricated

rejection 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the permeate and feed solution concentrations respectively overall during the membrane separation performance each membrane was subjected to at least four repetitions 2 7 antibacterial activity assay 2 7 1 halo zone test the inhibition zone technique was used to assess the surface modified membrane s antibacterial efficacy against two types of bacteria gram positive g s aureus and gram negative g e coli 39 these bacterial strains were activated in nutrient broth for a whole day at 37 c prior to the tests to obtain the desired bacterial suspensions e coli and s aureus colonies were diluted in mueller hinton broth mh broth prepared in petri dishes with 100 μl of the bacterial strain suspension at a dosage of 104 colony forming units cfu ml adjusted with phosphate buffered saline pbs solution 3 ml of the resultant bacterial suspension was uniformly spread across mh agar plates the membranes were then sterilized and placed on top of plates in contact with mh agar medium prior to being incubated at 37 c for 24 h 40 the halo zone emerged after a day the antibacterial properties of the modified membrane were evidenced by transparent regions on the disk where the bacteria could not grow digital photos were taken to study the formation of inhibition halo zones 2 7 2 optical density od measurement the antibacterial activity against s aureus and e coli was investigated further using the jis l 1902 2002 methodology 41 in each of four 150 ml cylindrical containers 20 ml of broth was prepared all containers were autoclaved for 15 min at 121 c and 15 psi following autoclaving 100 μl of staphylococcus aureus was inoculated in two of the containers and an e coli strain was inoculated in the other two the control and modified membranes were then placed in two containers with the g strain and the other two with the g strain then incubated at 37 c for 24 h a spectrophotometer was used to measure the od at 600 nm after incubation 42 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane surface chemistry atr ftir analysis was applied to inspect the surface chemistry and the validity of in situ polymerization of pda as well as the covalent immobilization of enzymatic biomolecules on the pan membranes the pristine pan membrane m1 displays a characteristic peak at 2101 cm 1 which is attributable to the stretching vibrations of nitrile cn bands as seen in supplementary file 1 43 the bending vibration of ch bands is also responsible for the peak at 1293 cm 1 whereas the peak at 1081 cm 1 reflects coc stretching vibrations 44 in pristine pan there is also cn symmetric stretching at 919 cm 1 and ocn stretching at 627 cm 1 45 46 atr ftir analysis was applied to inspect the surface chemistry and the validity of in situ polymerization of pda as well as the covalent immobilization of enzymatic biomolecules on the pan membranes the pristine pan membrane m1 displays a characteristic peak at 2101 cm 1 which is attributable to the stretching vibrations of nitrile cn bands as seen in supplementary file 1 43 the bending vibration of ch bands is also responsible for the peak at 1293 cm 1 whereas the peak at 1081 cm 1 reflects coc stretching vibrations 44 in pristine pan there is also cn symmetric stretching at 919 cm 1 and ocn stretching at 627 cm 1 45 46 most of the aforementioned pan support signature peaks notably those at 450 1000 cm 1 could be detected in all of the spectra however due to the conversion of nitrile groups through covalent bonding the cn stretching peak at 2101 cm 1 vanishes following any surface modification of the pan membrane supplementary file 1 furthermore following the deposition of pda protease lipase and their mixtures m2 m8 through michael addition and or schiff base formation 47 a new absorbance between 2900 and 3000 cm 1 ascribed to nh oh stretching vibrations was detected in comparison to the pristine pan support m1 the absorption intensity of about 3000 cm 1 in pda deposited membranes that were covalently bound to enzymes continued rising due to the absorption of amino groups meanwhile the absorption about 1000 1200 cm 1 decreased implying that the pda and enzymatic layers had been effectively deposited 48 overall except for the ones mentioned no substantial changes in membrane spectra could be found most likely owing to overlapping of the distinctive bands most of the aforementioned pan support signature peaks notably those at 450 1000 cm 1 could be detected in all of the spectra however due to the conversion of nitrile groups through covalent bonding the cn

through michael addition and or schiff base formation 47 a new absorbance between 2900 and 3000 cm 1 ascribed to nh oh stretching vibrations was detected in comparison to the pristine pan support m1 the absorption intensity of about 3000 cm 1 in pda deposited membranes that were covalently bound to enzymes continued rising due to the absorption of amino groups meanwhile the absorption about 1000 1200 cm 1 decreased implying that the pda and enzymatic layers had been effectively deposited 48 overall except for the ones mentioned no substantial changes in membrane spectra could be found most likely owing to overlapping of the distinctive bands ionizable groups on the membrane surface generate the membrane s surface charge the electrostatic attraction repulsion of charged species may be induced by the surface charge of membranes influencing the selective mass transport of charged species and fouling behavior of the membranes 49 the zeta potential of membranes as a function of ph is shown in fig 2 the pristine membrane displayed the point of zero charge pzc at ph 5 5 as a result the zeta potential of all membranes is negative at the ph used for the surface modification processes ph 8 5 this tendency promotes the immobilization of amphoteric protein based protease and lipase enzymes as they possess positive charges in solution since the amine group functions as a weak base 50 51 similar to enzymes pda is also an amphoteric substance due to the amine group and the phenolic hydroxyl group the pda layer has a negative charge at high ph preventing anions but allowing cations to pass through at low ph it is positively charged and excludes cations but passes anions 52 pda on the other hand provides a platform for the incorporation of enzyme biomolecules improving the rejection of particularly charged substances as a result the membrane s surface charge is attributed not only to the pda layer s characteristics but also to the immobilized protease and lipase on the pda layer the pzc of the membranes shifted to a lower ph after the integrative surface modification with pda and enzymes in addition these membranes had greater zeta potential values consequently enhanced foulant rejection of the surface modified membranes relative to the pristine pan membrane might be attributed to increased negative charges as well as greater surface hydrophilicity by increasing both of the aforementioned factors the negatively charged foulants are prevented from adsorbing and settling on the membranes surface resulting in higher rejection 53 3 2 membrane morphology it is widely recognized that the morphology of a membrane affects its permeability selectivity and antifouling properties as a result the surface and cross section morphologies of the membranes before and after different stages of surface modification were investigated by sem figs 3 and 4 respectively as shown in fig 3b d the surfaces of the membranes directly bonded with enzymes m2 m4 were rather smooth however due to the simultaneous presence of both enzymes m4 experienced a slight decrease in its surface smoothness also once the pda and enzymatic multilayers piled up the membrane s surface became rough and fluctuated up and down after da self polymerization the surface of m5 membrane developed a distinct rough layer fig 3e enzyme immobilization resulted in a smoother surface as shown in surface sem images of the m6 m8 membranes fig 3f h which might be the consequence of effective enzyme integration into the polyelectrolyte network 48 similar to the trend observed for m4 simultaneous integration of enzymes is also responsible for the slight fluctuation on the surface of the m8 membrane in comparison to the other two m6 and m7 since all membranes include the same support pan matrix similar finger like structures were formed for all membranes from the top of the sublayer to the bottom as evidenced in cross section sem images fig 4a h however thin layers of modification began to form on the pan supports as seen in fig 4b h with no detectable impact on the membrane structure s integrity the thickness single layered m3 2 37 μm double layered m6 3 17 μm triple layered m8 5 2 μm values and composition of the modification layers perfectly match the surface sem images previously discussed further indicating m8 da e1 e2 pan is the optimum membrane 3 3 membrane topography membrane surface roughness is linked to increased water affinity and adjusting it might improve membrane permeability 54 because foulants are less inclined to adhere to a smooth surface there is indeed a clear link between antifouling property and membrane surface roughness 55 fig 5 and table 2 depict 3d topographic profiles and parameters pertaining to membrane surface roughness respectively in comparison to m1 integrating the enzymes directly onto the pan surface resulted in a gradual decrease in membrane surface roughness from sa 32 57 0 65 to sa 6 76 0 01 nm as shown in table 2 the simultaneous integration of enzymes is responsible for the slight increase in surface roughness of the m4 membrane to sa 15 9 0 32 nm as originally proposed by miao et al 56 the observed increase in m5 roughness might be due to the formation of polymeric pda agglomerates on the membrane surface however immobilization of protease lipase and their mixture on the pda layer led to a smoother surface inspired by the results found by marques et al 51 in a different study with some similar aspects regarding the presence of pda it could be concluded that the incorporation of enzymes resulted in the breakdown of non covalent connections between the pda aggregates promoting homogeneous deposition of the components furthermore pda aggregates may impede the efficiency of membranes with small pores particularly ones employed in ultrafiltration by raising water penetration resistances 57 this effect was also observed in the current study because a slight reduction in hydraulic permeance was seen when only dopamine was involved in membrane modification despite the blocking of certain pores the inclusion of hydrophilic pda to the membrane surface resulted in a roughening of the membrane surface which increased the effective filtration area 55 overall according to the finding the surface roughness of the membrane was significantly improved following surface modification leading to an increase in water flux foulants on the other hand are easily embedded into the valleys of the membrane surface with increased surface roughness increasing irreversible fouling as a result as noted in section 3 5 the antifouling property of the membrane would be reduced 3 4 membrane hydrophilicity and permeability membrane performance is heavily influenced by the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface water contact angles wca were determined in a static mode to reflect the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface due to the intrinsic hydrophobicity of pan polymer wca of the pristine pan membrane was 62 94 1 26 as reported in fig 6 from the figure wca was decreased for surface modified membranes rather than m1 the minimum wca was achieved for m5 35 65 0 7 so it could be concluded that the increase in membrane hydrophilicity was mostly attributable to the inclusion of hydrophilic pda groups on the pan surface furthermore the hydrophilic layer was synergistically enhanced by the inclusion of da and enzymes drawing water molecules to the membrane surface and forming a hydrated layer that prevented contaminants from adhering 55 at room temperature the pure water flux pwf of the fabricated membranes was evaluated at 3 bar the variation in water flux as shown in fig 6 was consistent with the hydrophilicity findings the water flux of the pristine pan membrane was to be 46 31 0 93 kg m2 h the water flux of the membrane has gradually reduced after surface modification when there was no enzyme on the membrane surface the water flux of m5 reached a value of 35 44 0 71 kg m2 h a 23 5 decline from m1 this phenomenon was attributed to the addition of dopamine increasing the separation layer thickness and creating a stronger resistance to water penetration the introduction of enzymes and dopamine to the membrane increased its hydrophilicity facilitating and accelerating the passage of water molecules through formed water channels leading to a considerably enhanced pwf 55 water permeability and antifouling properties can be greatly enhanced by the synergistic effect of da e1 and e2 inclusion notably benefiting from this synergistic effect m8 da e1 e2 pan presented the remarkable permeability and hydrophilicity with corresponding values of pwf and wca as 78 09 1 6 kg m2 h and 39 8 0 8 3 5 membrane antifouling performance 3 5 1 milk powder mp filtration fig 7a depicts the results of dynamic three step flux and also normalized flux over step 3 during fouling experiments when a simulated protein and lipid feed as milk powder mp is filtered an increasing number of protein and lipid molecules accumulate on the membrane surface and become trapped in the membrane pores leading to a significant rise in permeation resistances and a decrease in flux step 2 all surface modified membranes however demonstrated excellent flux recovery frr after being washed with di water for 20 min step 3 the findings also suggest that the optimally modified membrane m8 had superior antifouling capacity resulting in a frr of 99 32 1 9 an increase of 23 5 over the pristine pan membrane after surface modification the overall antifouling properties of the membranes were enhanced the antifouling capacity of the modified membranes is shown in fig 7b more and more enzyme molecules adhered to the membrane surface when da was added establishing a new hydrophilic separation layer 51 higher water and milk powder fluxes arose from the enhancement in hydrophilicity meanwhile the enhanced separation layer prevented protein and lipid molecules from filtering and increased milk powder rejection furthermore despite the fact that the membrane surface got rougher the membrane surface became more hydrophilic according to the aforementioned membrane characterization consequently a water layer formed between the foulant and the membrane surface during the filtration of the milk powder solution inhibiting the adsorption and pileup of milk powder and subsequently improving the antifouling capacity all the resistance capability assessment elements for the fabricated membranes were calculated including intrinsic resistance rm cake gel resistance rc pore resistance rf and total filtration resistance rt proving that the modified membranes clearly have significantly improved antifouling properties when compared to the pristine pan membrane fig 7c as can be noticed the majority of the fouling resistance of pan membranes is due to their cake and intrinsic resistance considerably limiting their flux as previously suggested the agglomeration of a self polymerized pda layer on the membrane surface might clarify a limited undesirable rise in above resistances for m5 membrane due to their higher hydrophilic properties and active degradation of the protein and lipid layers introducing protease and lipase to pda deposited pan membranes might lessen these two forms of resistance 58 overall all of the aforementioned factors contribute to an improvement in the antifouling and flux recovery properties of the surface modified membranes during long term filtration mp solution and distilled water were alternately provided over four cycles the permeate flux profile over four cycles and also normalized flux during the last cycle for m1 and m8 membranes in the dead end system are shown in fig 7d as compared to m1 m8 s filtration behavior deteriorated slightly towards the end of the fourth cycle after 15 h of filtration resulting in an 6 flux reduction meanwhile after 900 min m1 s flow dropped dramatically from 46 32 to 10 46 kg m2 h this may be rationalized by the high degree of hydrophilicity inducing a dense and stable hydration layer exceptional antifouling resistance and high hydraulic cleaning effectiveness offered by the enzyme immobilized surface of m8 3 5 2 bovine serum albumin bsa filtration membrane fouling was explored in depth by looking into bsa fouling mechanism and membrane physicochemical properties to further investigate the antifouling property offered by the synergistic effect of enzyme immobilization and da interlayer formation fouling resistances over time during three step bsa filtration were evaluated and shown in fig 8 for the pristine and selected membranes of m4 m5 and m8 these membranes were selected based on the physicochemical characterization and mp filtration results which can confidently provide a potential platform to compare the effects of key stages of surface modification as a result the permeate flux and frr decline in m5 fig 8a and b was observed owing to the addition of da and its polymerization which increased the separation layer thickness and resulted in a greater resistance to water penetration these findings suggest that the optimally modified membrane m8 had superior antifouling capacity benefiting from the simultaneous presence of protease and lipase enzymes frr of 94 1 1 89 and an increase of 36 18 0 7 over the pristine m1 these results were in line with the surface roughness data previously discussed it is worth noting following the surface modification by both da and enzymes m8 rir was effectively alleviated by 80 9 1 6 compared to the pristine pan the smaller size of bsa molecules as well as their greater adherence and deposition led to lower values of flux and fouling resistance variables in bsa filtration compared to mp fouling 59 60 since bsa was hydrophobic and also had negative charges at ph of 7 the membranes improved hydrophilicity fig 6 and greater negative charge fig 2 played a key role in fouling control under these conditions the incorporated e1 and e2 enzymes catalyzed the hydrolysis of the bsa fouling layer hence improving antifouling behavior of m8 similar to mp the considerable decrease in dominant fouling resistance indicators fig 8c is solid proof that the enzymes were successfully immobilized and actively contributed to the degradation of the bsa fouling layer furthermore four fouling cycles with bsa were conducted to study bsa fouling permeation flux and normalized flux decline as outlined previously demonstrating that the enzyme modification is reasonably stable fig 8d after four filtration cycles the compact size of bsa molecules along with their greater adhesion resulted in an 14 reduction in flux for m8 furthermore as compared to mp fouling the m1 flux became nil after 850 min 3 5 3 humic acid ha filtration in addition to exploring the fouling resistance of the modified membranes in the face of mp and bsa ha fouling was also investigated the initial phase in ha fouling is ha adsorption which is heavily dependent on the ha affinity towards the membrane surface an increase in the hydrophilicity of the selected modified membranes may reduce the interaction forces involving the membrane surface and ha molecules decreasing adsorption of the ha onto the membrane surface and reducing ha narrowing or blocking membrane pores 60 the inclusion of a hydrophilic layer made it easier to remove ha adhered to the membrane surface or deposited in its pores during hydraulic backwash fig 9a resulting in improved cleaning efficiency in terms of surface charge the surface modification elevated the membrane surfaces negative charge strengthening the charge repulsion between the membrane surface and ha as a consequence less ha contacted the membrane surface and deposited in membrane pores resulting in decreased fouling of the surface modified membranes frr of 91 4 1 83 in overall in filtration of ha similar trends with bsa and mp filtration were achieved for the selected membranes in fig 9b the reversibility of ha fouling of the membranes was estimated reversible fouling was the most prominent fouling type for ha filtration as can be observed cake layer formation and concentration polarization are two key aspects of reversible fouling 59 in comparison to reversible fouling irreversible fouling induced by pore narrowing and its blockage underwent a decrease in m8 the better hydrophilicity and increased negative charge of the surface modified membranes were likely the major reasons for their improved anti ha fouling performance as aforementioned membrane surface roughness was also regarded to have an impact on antifouling behavior overall in anti bsa fouling the surface modified uf membranes had greater permeate flux and irreversible fouling control than in anti ha fouling however due to bsa s lower zeta potential the charge repulsion between the membrane surface and bsa was weaker than that of ha as a result hydrophilicity appears to be more significant than surface charge in bsa fouling mitigation than ha fouling nonetheless it can be assumed that immobilization of the enzyme mixture e1 e2 on the m8 surface similar to prior foulants is capable of degrading the tightly adherent ha layer resulting in improved fouling resistance fig 9c 58 the surface modified m8 membrane outperformed the pristine pan in every filtration cycle as seen in fig 9d similar to two other foulants after 900 min the optimal membrane s flux has gone down from 79 651 6 to 65 171 3 kg m2 h but the pristine membrane s flux has steadily declined from 45 960 92 kg m2 h to zero implying a major contribution of ha molecules to fouling 3 6 membrane separation performance nom removal fig 10 depicts the nom removal of the pristine pan m1 and surface modified m4 m5 and m8 membranes the boost in nom removal by the surface modified uf membranes is attributable to the physicochemical characteristics of the membranes and the properties of foulants for mp bsa and ha the pristine pan obtained removal efficiencies of 99 5 0 19 72 5 1 45 and 44 5 1 9 respectively among the nom foulants studied mp was the most efficiently removed by all membranes the mp removal for all membranes were around 99 9 which was most likely owing to the development of an mp cake layer on the membrane surface assisting in its removal as shown in fig 10 the bsa removal increased from 72 5 1 45 of the bare pan to 92 5 1 85 of the m8 overall this data was superior to that of other surface modified membranes where bsa rejection was increased to 88 7 1 78 in enzyme immobilized membrane without da m4 or even slightly decreased to 84 9 1 7 after the pda interlayer formation in m5 membrane the bsa removal efficiency for each type of membrane was greater than that for ha the rejection of ha and bsa increased by 80 9 1 62 and 27 6 0 55 for the m8 membrane respectively as compared to the bare pan since bsa has a smaller negative charge than ha there may be less charge repulsion between the membrane surface and the bsa molecules as a result the surface modified membranes did not significantly improve bsa removal as they did ha removal 59 ha had a broad molecular size range including small molecules 1 kda 60 since the small molecules of ha pass through the membrane effortlessly the pristine pan membrane led to a low ha rejection of 44 5 1 9 the surface modified membranes were more hydrophilic than the pristine pan resulting in less hydrophobic interactions between the membrane surface and ha and hence more ha removal furthermore the surface of the modified membranes and ha molecules were both negatively charged surface modified membranes displayed higher charge repulsion between the membrane surface and ha than m1 which contributed to increased ha rejection overall the rejection of organics in pan uf membranes was attributed to hydrophilicity and surface charge repulsion accordingly mp and bsa were rejected better than ha furthermore due to firmly bonded water molecules hydrophilic modified membranes may effectively block organic molecules from passing through the membrane surface and immobilized enzymatic biomolecules can have surface reactions and hydrolyze certain foulants the higher nom removal efficiency of m4 and m8 membranes can also be attributed to the enzymes sufficient active sites allowing for significant interactions with the organic substance and hence better nom removal 58 the enzyme molecules bound on the membrane surface may degrade the foulants that pass through the skin layer enhancing the membrane s nom removal efficiency since enzyme substrate interaction is totally dependent on the degradation process enzyme substrate degradation is more specific than others the active site where the enzyme binds and catalyzes substrates serves as a specific binding spot for the substrate foulants to recapitulate surface modified membranes significantly improved the removal of hydrophobic nom foulants 3 7 membrane antibacterial property the qualitative investigation of the bactericidal properties of surface modified membranes against s aureus and e coli can be seen in fig 11a by covalently immobilizing the antimicrobial enzymes e1 e2 on the surface of the da pan membranes a previously non existent inhibition zone for the bare pan membrane was converted into a clearly visible inhibition zone obviously the zone inhibition test yielded nearly identical results for both species of bacteria 61 the od measurement was also used to quantitatively determine antibacterial activity against the aforementioned g and g bacterial strains as shown in fig 11b the container with the bare membrane m1 was turbid signaling bacterial growth whereas the container with the modified membrane m8 had such a clear solution s aureus and e coli induction were detected on m1 membranes with an od of 1 198 and 1 489 respectively the g and g optical densities of the m8 modified membranes on the other hand were 0 021 and 0 095 respectively indicating that bacterial growth was negligible the development of g and g bacteria was successfully prevented by optimally surface modified membranes according to the observations 62 the enhancement of antibacterial properties in membranes is dependent on two key factors hydrophilicity and surface roughness the increased hydrophilicity of the surface modified membranes was confirmed by water contact angle measurements fig 6 when water molecules are in close proximity to membrane surfaces they tend to interact with hydrophilic surfaces leading to a thin layer of water molecules covering the entire surface of the membrane the water layer prevents bacteria from sticking to the surface due to their organic structure microorganisms were also less likely to find suitable attachment sites on the smoother surface with low roughness the presence of covalently linked protease and lipase on the m8 membrane surface is another key component of the optimally modified membranes antibacterial resistance the dual immobilization of antimicrobial lipase and protease e1 e2 on the membrane surface which both have an on lytic mechanism targeting the cell wall might underlie the improved antibacterial properties of the surface modified membrane the glycosidic or peptide linkages of peptidoglycan the primary component of bacterial cell walls are hydrolyzed by these enzymes resulting in antibacterial activity as a consequence intracellular components leak out and rna synthesis is inhibited 63 3 8 comparative study table 3 presents a comparison of certain polymeric filtration membranes performance covalently employing enzyme biomolecules to the findings of this investigation in terms of filtration and antifouling performance the novel surface modified membranes in this study can clearly compete with the existing membranes turning them into a promising candidate for large scale industrial implementation 4 conclusion in this study a simple multi step technique based on self polymerization of dopamine and covalent bonding of hydrolytic protease and lipase enzymes was employed to decorate the pan uf membrane dopamine content had a major impact on membrane performance parameters such as hydrophilicity and antifouling the successful layer formation for membrane surface modification was confirmed by atr ftir zeta potential and sem analyses as revealed in afm images the introduction of modifiers enhanced the surface roughness the results showed that the modified membrane had greater hydrophilicity as determined by the wca leading to an increase in water flux under optimal conditions da e1 e2 pan m8 possessed a pure water flux of 78 09 1 6 kg m2 h higher than the pristine membrane 46 31 kg m2 h the performance of selected uf membranes was comprehensively assessed against anti nom fouling and removal mechanisms yielding removal efficiencies and frr values of 80 and 90 respectively the key elements in controlling membrane fouling induced by mp bsa and ha and their subsequent stable long term filtration performance were smoother and negatively charged surfaces enhanced hydrophilicity and enzymatic degradation of the foulants as a result it may be one step closer to breaking through the upper bound which has long been a source of concern in membrane separation the inhibitory zone and optical density od measuring methods were also used to study and compare the antibacterial ability of optimal enzyme immobilized membranes against s aureus and e coli compared to the bare membrane the results demonstrated an efficient bactericidal and growth inhibitory impact on both strains confirming the successful immobilization of antibacterial enzymes on the membrane surface and their activity via an on lytic mechanism targeting the cell wall to recapitulate the surface modified membranes seemed to have the potential to be employed as a viable

12578,a drastic improvement in the overall permeability and antifouling performance was observed for the polyacrylonitrile pan ultrafiltration uf membrane by the co incorporation of dopamine da protease e1 and lipase e2 in a facile multi step synthetic scheme sem was utilized to indicate the successful formation of modifying layers on the membrane surface whereas atr ftir and zeta potential were used to provide deeper insight into the membrane surface chemistry afm and contact angle were used to assess the membrane s surface roughness and hydrophilicity respectively the optimally modified membrane surface was found to be quite hydrophilic as indicated by the water contact angle value 39 8 0 8 and water flux across the membrane of 78 09 1 6 kg m2 h simultaneously natural organic matter nom including milk powder mp bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha were efficiently removed resulting in 99 9 92 5 and 80 5 removal efficiencies respectively notably the enzyme immobilized membrane demonstrated outstanding antifouling performance as well as long term stability the dynamic anti nom fouling studies indicated that the surface modification was potentially capable of overcoming the tradeoff between membrane permeability and selectivity resulting in frr values of 90 the antibacterial properties of the surface modified membranes against e coli and s aureus were also explored and the optimal enzyme immobilized membrane was found to be substantially antibacterial overall this study aims to pave the way for the development of sustainable chemistry in designing innovative and highly efficient membranes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polyacrylonitrile ultrafiltration membrane surface modification dopamine enzyme immobilization data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction as a robust pressure driven membrane separation technology ultrafiltration uf has already been extensively implemented in biotechnology 1 food and dairy processing 2 wastewater treatment 3 4 and reverse osmosis ro pretreatment 5 owing to their versatility and cost effectiveness polymeric membranes are an integral part of the ultrafiltration process 6 polyacrylonitrile pan has become one of the most commonly used polymers in membrane fabrication in consequence of its favorable properties such as satisfactory resistance to solvents decent mechanical properties considerable chemical stability and being more cost effective than other polymers such as polyethersulfone pes and polysulfone psf 7 8 however membrane fouling attributed to the membrane matrix s intrinsic hydrophobicity limits the widespread implementation of pan membranes 9 protein deposition on membrane surfaces and pore walls leads to a rise in hydraulic resistance as well as a substantial decrease in flux and ultimate separation performance shortening membrane lifetime and inducing a major impact on energy and cost consumption 10 as a result numerous researchers have zeroed in their attention on developing membranes that impede foulants such as proteins from being absorbed due to its versatility and effectiveness in rendering the desired functionalities membrane surface modification is currently one of the most pursued strategies for fine tuning filtration membrane properties 10 12 the core mission of surface modification is to promote surface characteristics such as surface composition morphology and surface charge without altering the bulk properties of the membrane a membrane containing precisely tailored properties guarantees that the separation process runs smoothly 13 the investigation of novel modifying agents for membrane modification has been conducted in parallel with the development of innovative membrane surface modification techniques 14 in this light among potential macromolecules investigated in recent years such as polymeric additives 15 20 biomolecules are starting to emerge as a class of modifying materials owing to their eco friendliness biomolecules are employed in many aspects of human life including the therapeutic field as well as the water purification process 13 in some early studies biomolecules such as enzymes have been used to modify polymeric membranes resulting in a shift in surface hydrophobicity hydrophilicity 21 in a study mehrabi et al used the covalent binding strategy to immobilize α amylase and lysozyme enzymes on polydopamine pda polyethyleneimine pei modified pes membranes removing 87 of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms 22 due to the build up of biofilm on its surface the unmodified membranes suffered a significant decline in water flux from 6723 l m 2 h 1 to 4090 l m 2 h 1 whereas the enzyme immobilized membranes experienced only a slight decrease in one most recent research tian s group has enhanced the antibacterial properties of a polyamide pa membrane surface by coating it with lysozymes minimizing bacterial adhesion and preventing trade offs between water flux and salt rejection 23 in comparison to the control membrane the modified ro membrane suppressed bacterial growth by 50 and had practically no loss in water flux or salt rejection as aforementioned in the existing literature covalent modification works by covalently linking the enzymes to the support membrane via their functional groups recent investigations have indicated that by employing a material surface with a moderate hydrophilicity enzyme adhesion capacity can be improved 24 messersmith and colleagues pioneered mussel inspired chemistry in 2007 and it has since opened up a whole new world of surface modification 25 owing to its self polymerization hydrophilicity and acceptable compatibility with polymers such as pan in terms of the flory huggins interaction parameter from a thermodynamic viewpoint 26 28 dopamine da 3 4 dihydroxyphenethylamine a well known molecular bio mimetic adhesive inspired by adhesive proteins excreted by marine mussels has gained great interest for bridging the gap between a wide range of materials under aerobic and alkaline conditions da containing abundant functional groups such as catechol and amino groups can spontaneously oxypolymerize into polydopamine pda the freshly formed hydrophilic pda layer not only strengthens the binding interactions between the modifier and membrane but also provides a versatile platform for efficient post functionalization of the membrane surface 29 30 to the best of the authors knowledge there have been very few investigations on the use of da to modify pan membrane surfaces in a comparative manner containing various modifying steps in order to load hydrolytic enzyme biomolecules in the present study we developed a novel surface modified uf membrane by immobilizing protease e1 and lipase e2 enzymes employing both an individual and an integrative covalent strategy on pda deposited pan membrane surfaces to suppress fouling formation and break down any cake layer that is formed immobilization of protease e1 lipase e2 and their mixtures e1 e2 has been undertaken on activated uf membrane surfaces with and without da to study their effects on the membrane properties and performance in addition to investigating the chemical structures and morphologies of the surface modified membranes natural organic matter nom including milk powder mp bovine serum albumin bsa and humic acid ha were used to evaluate the effect of this multilayer surface modification on the minimization of cake layer formation besides antibacterial tests against e coli and s aureus were also performed 2 experimental 2 1 apparatus the filtration unit consists of a 250 ml stirred dead end filtration cell with a membrane area of 19 625 cm2 attached to a nitrogen pressurized vessel fig 1 during the experiments the membrane feed was regularly agitated at 400 rpm to avoid concentration polarization an analytical balance was also used to collect the permeate and measure its mass the change in permeate water s cumulative mass as a function of time was used to compute permeate flux 2 2 materials after

modification 2 3 1 fabrication the non solvent induced phase inversion a common technique for fabricating polymeric membranes was employed to fabricate the uf support membranes 31 dried pan powder along with pvp were dissolved in dmf with concentrations of 16 and 1 wt respectively at 60 c with constant stirring 400 rpm the prepared solution was ultrasonically degassed for 10 min prior to getting left at room temperature for 6 h to allow trapped gas bubbles to escape from the solution the solution was directly cast on a glass support with a predetermined casting thickness of 150 μm using a self made casting knife and then submerged in a coagulation bath containing di water 25 c to verify that phase separation was accomplished prior to usage the polymer support was maintained in fresh di water at room temperature overnight interposing the precipitated membranes m1 between two sheets of filter paper allowed them to dry completely for 24 h 2 3 2 surface activation first the circular cut pan membranes 2 5 cm 2 5 cm were soaked in 3 m naoh for 1 h to introduce the hydroxyl groups onto the membranes surface the membranes were then taken from the alkaline solution and submerged in a thf solution containing 0 03 mol l cyanuric chloride cyanuric chloride has been utilized as a coupling reagent to efficiently cross link and immobilize enzymes to supports to form stable linkages chlorine atoms in the molecule react with nucleophilic groups the membrane were removed after 6 h of gentle shaking to be thoroughly rinsed with di water to eliminate any unreacted compounds before use 32 2 3 3 enzyme immobilization the target enzymes to be immobilized on the pan support membrane by the immersion procedure were protease e1 lipase e2 and their mixture e1 e2 the role of da in immobilizing enzymes as well as regulating membrane structure and performance was investigated by immobilizing enzymes in the presence and absence of a polydopamine pda interlayer formed in situ on the top side of the activated pan support membranes to directly incorporate enzymes onto the support surface the activated membranes were soaked in a 1 g l e1 solution for 2 h at room temperature in a shaker incubator m2 individual immobilization of e2 as well as simultaneous immobilization of e1 and e2 on pan support membranes were also carried out in the same manner m3 and m4 respectively in the meantime 0 03 m of dopamine tris hcl solution ph 8 5 was required to form the pda layer on the activated pan support 33 to obtain the self polymerized layer of pda the activated uf supports were submerged in the da solution for 2 h while stirring at 400 rpm at room temperature m5 similarly e1 e2 and their combination e1 e2 were immobilized on top of the pda deposited pan membranes as outlined in the previous step m6 m7 and m8 respectively ultimately the free enzymes were eliminated by washing all enzyme immobilized membranes three times with phosphate buffer table 1 presents the specifications of all the fabricated membranes as they progressed through the surface modification processes 2 4 membranes characterization the attenuated total reflectance atr methodology was used on a bruker tensor27 spectrometer in the range of 450 4000 cm 1 equipped with a horizontal atr device to analyze changes in the surface functional groups of the fabricated membranes the significance of surface load in defining the mechanism of membrane separation cannot be overstated accordingly the membranes zeta potential was measured using a physica eka electro kinetic analyzer anton paar austria the solution s ph and kcl concentration were maintained at about 7 and 0 01 m respectively 34 changes in the top surface and cross section morphologies of the pan membranes were probed by employing a scanning electron microscope sem tescan mira3 filter paper was used to clean the membranes after they had been cut into little coupons all membrane specimens were made conductive prior to sem imaging by sputtering a thin coating of gold under vacuum membrane cross sections were obtained by fracturing the membranes at liquid nitrogen temperature they were examined under a microscope at 20 kv after sputtering with gold 35 an atomic force microscope afm nanosurf scanning probe optical microscope switzerland was used to investigate the topographical profiles of the membrane surfaces to capture afm images coupons of the fabricated membranes were attached to a glass holder and a small surface area of them was scanned under tapping mode in air to estimate roughness parameters the obtained imaging data was further analyses using nanosurf mobile software the average roughness sa the root mean square of the z data sq and the difference between the highest peaks and lowest valleys were used to represent the surface roughness parameters sz 2 5 membrane hydrophilicity and permeability assessment water contact angle wca was quantified using the sessile drop method 25 c with a goniometer g10 kruss germany to evaluate the membrane surface hydrophilicity a water droplet containing 2 μl of di water was put on a flat homogeneous membrane surface and the contact angle between the membrane surface and water was monitored until there was no change random sites were chosen for each sample to limit measurement error and average quantities were reported after five replications permeability of all membranes were investigated in a dead end filtration cell at 25 c using a 3 bar transmembrane pressure fig 1 permeate samples were collected and weighed over a set length of time the membrane pure water flux pwf jw 1 kg m2 h was calculated using gravimetric method as described eq 1 1 j w 1 m aδt m denotes the permeation weight kg a the effective membrane area m2 and t the filtration duration h 36 each test was repeated four times to obtain valuable data resulting in a mean value with a 95 confidence level 2 6 membrane separation and antifouling evaluation natural organic matter nom is the most common contaminant inducing membrane fouling both reversible and irreversible being chemically complex nom is composed mostly of proteins polysaccharides and humic like substances that are prevalent in natural surface waters nom fouling is accompanied by the polymerization the cake layer formation pore narrowing and its blockage due to foulant adhesion and deposition mp 1000 mg l bsa 300 mg l and ha 100 mg l were selected as representatives of lipids proteins and humic substances respectively to evaluate the anti nom fouling properties and nom removal of the membranes deionized water was used to prepare the nom solutions and the ph of the solutions was adjusted to approximately 7 0 using either 0 1 m hcl or naoh the pwf was initially measured and used as a reference for membrane permeability in 1 h at 3 bar jw1 the membrane was then fouled for 2 5 h with freshly prepared model foulant solutions to determine the flux jp filtration was halted after 2 5 h of operation and the membrane was removed and washed briefly with di water for around 20 min without any physical treatment the cleansed membranes pwfs were measured again after hydraulic cleaning jw2 the flux recovery ratio frr during this three step filtration was calculated using eq 2 to assess the fouling resistance capacity of the fabricated membranes with a higher frr indicating better antifouling properties of the membranes 2 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 the resistance appearing during filtration can be used to quantify fouling and the elimination of this resistance can be used to indicate cleaning the formation of a cake or gel layer on the membrane surface may be the source of resistance eqs 3 5 are being used to estimate membrane

end system fig 1 each following the three step procedure stated above to test the long term filtration and antifouling potential of the pristine and selected membranes the mp bsa and ha concentrations employed in the nom removal test were measured by a uv visible spectrophotometer using the standard bradford s method 38 eq 10 was used to determine the nom removal of the investigated membranes 10 rejection 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the permeate and feed solution concentrations respectively overall during the membrane separation performance each membrane was subjected to at least four repetitions 2 7 antibacterial activity assay 2 7 1 halo zone test the inhibition zone technique was used to assess the surface modified membrane s antibacterial efficacy against two types of bacteria gram positive g s aureus and gram negative g e coli 39 these bacterial strains were activated in nutrient broth for a whole day at 37 c prior to the tests to obtain the desired bacterial suspensions e coli and s aureus colonies were diluted in mueller hinton broth mh broth prepared in petri dishes with 100 μl of the bacterial strain suspension at a dosage of 104 colony forming units cfu ml adjusted with phosphate buffered saline pbs solution 3 ml of the resultant bacterial suspension was uniformly spread across mh agar plates the membranes were then sterilized and placed on top of plates in contact with mh agar medium prior to being incubated at 37 c for 24 h 40 the halo zone emerged after a day the antibacterial properties of the modified membrane were evidenced by transparent regions on the disk where the bacteria could not grow digital photos were taken to study the formation of inhibition halo zones 2 7 2 optical density od measurement the antibacterial activity against s aureus and e coli was investigated further using the jis l 1902 2002 methodology 41 in each of four 150 ml cylindrical containers 20 ml of broth was prepared all containers were autoclaved for 15 min at 121 c and 15 psi following autoclaving 100 μl of staphylococcus aureus was inoculated in two of the containers and an e coli strain was inoculated in the other two the control and modified membranes were then placed in two containers with the g strain and the other two with the g strain then incubated at 37 c for 24 h a spectrophotometer was used to measure the od at 600 nm after incubation 42 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane surface chemistry atr ftir analysis was applied to inspect the surface chemistry and the validity of in situ polymerization of pda as well as the covalent immobilization of enzymatic biomolecules on the pan membranes the pristine pan membrane m1 displays a characteristic peak at 2101 cm 1 which is attributable to the stretching vibrations of nitrile cn bands as seen in supplementary file 1 43 the bending vibration of ch bands is also responsible for the peak at 1293 cm 1 whereas the peak at 1081 cm 1 reflects coc stretching vibrations 44 in pristine pan there is also cn symmetric stretching at 919 cm 1 and ocn stretching at 627 cm 1 45 46 atr ftir analysis was applied to inspect the surface chemistry and the validity of in situ polymerization of pda as well as the covalent immobilization of enzymatic biomolecules on the pan membranes the pristine pan membrane m1 displays a characteristic peak at 2101 cm 1 which is attributable to the stretching vibrations of nitrile cn bands as seen in supplementary file 1 43 the bending vibration of ch bands is also responsible for the peak at 1293 cm 1 whereas the peak at 1081 cm 1 reflects coc stretching vibrations 44 in pristine pan there is also cn symmetric stretching at 919 cm 1 and ocn stretching at 627 cm 1 45 46 most of the aforementioned pan support signature peaks notably those at 450 1000 cm 1 could be detected in all of the spectra however due to the conversion of nitrile groups through covalent bonding the cn stretching peak at 2101 cm 1 vanishes following any surface modification of the pan membrane supplementary file 1 furthermore following the deposition of pda protease lipase and their mixtures m2 m8 through michael addition and or schiff base formation 47 a new absorbance between 2900 and 3000 cm 1 ascribed to nh oh stretching vibrations was detected in comparison to the pristine pan support m1 the absorption intensity of about 3000 cm 1 in pda deposited membranes that were covalently bound to enzymes continued rising due to the absorption of amino groups meanwhile the absorption about 1000 1200 cm 1 decreased implying that the pda and enzymatic layers had been effectively deposited 48 overall except for the ones mentioned no substantial changes in membrane spectra could be found most likely owing to overlapping of the distinctive bands most of the aforementioned pan support signature peaks notably those at 450 1000 cm 1 could be detected in all of the spectra however due to the conversion of nitrile groups through covalent bonding the cn

through michael addition and or schiff base formation 47 a new absorbance between 2900 and 3000 cm 1 ascribed to nh oh stretching vibrations was detected in comparison to the pristine pan support m1 the absorption intensity of about 3000 cm 1 in pda deposited membranes that were covalently bound to enzymes continued rising due to the absorption of amino groups meanwhile the absorption about 1000 1200 cm 1 decreased implying that the pda and enzymatic layers had been effectively deposited 48 overall except for the ones mentioned no substantial changes in membrane spectra could be found most likely owing to overlapping of the distinctive bands ionizable groups on the membrane surface generate the membrane s surface charge the electrostatic attraction repulsion of charged species may be induced by the surface charge of membranes influencing the selective mass transport of charged species and fouling behavior of the membranes 49 the zeta potential of membranes as a function of ph is shown in fig 2 the pristine membrane displayed the point of zero charge pzc at ph 5 5 as a result the zeta potential of all membranes is negative at the ph used for the surface modification processes ph 8 5 this tendency promotes the immobilization of amphoteric protein based protease and lipase enzymes as they possess positive charges in solution since the amine group functions as a weak base 50 51 similar to enzymes pda is also an amphoteric substance due to the amine group and the phenolic hydroxyl group the pda layer has a negative charge at high ph preventing anions but allowing cations to pass through at low ph it is positively charged and excludes cations but passes anions 52 pda on the other hand provides a platform for the incorporation of enzyme biomolecules improving the rejection of particularly charged substances as a result the membrane s surface charge is attributed not only to the pda layer s characteristics but also to the immobilized protease and lipase on the pda layer the pzc of the membranes shifted to a lower ph after the integrative surface modification with pda and enzymes in addition these membranes had greater zeta potential values consequently enhanced foulant rejection of the surface modified membranes relative to the pristine pan membrane might be attributed to increased negative charges as well as greater surface hydrophilicity by increasing both of the aforementioned factors the negatively charged foulants are prevented from adsorbing and settling on the membranes surface resulting in higher rejection 53 3 2 membrane morphology it is widely recognized that the morphology of a membrane affects its permeability selectivity and antifouling properties as a result the surface and cross section morphologies of the membranes before and after different stages of surface modification were investigated by sem figs 3 and 4 respectively as shown in fig 3b d the surfaces of the membranes directly bonded with enzymes m2 m4 were rather smooth however due to the simultaneous presence of both enzymes m4 experienced a slight decrease in its surface smoothness also once the pda and enzymatic multilayers piled up the membrane s surface became rough and fluctuated up and down after da self polymerization the surface of m5 membrane developed a distinct rough layer fig 3e enzyme immobilization resulted in a smoother surface as shown in surface sem images of the m6 m8 membranes fig 3f h which might be the consequence of effective enzyme integration into the polyelectrolyte network 48 similar to the trend observed for m4 simultaneous integration of enzymes is also responsible for the slight fluctuation on the surface of the m8 membrane in comparison to the other two m6 and m7 since all membranes include the same support pan matrix similar finger like structures were formed for all membranes from the top of the sublayer to the bottom as evidenced in cross section sem images fig 4a h however thin layers of modification began to form on the pan supports as seen in fig 4b h with no detectable impact on the membrane structure s integrity the thickness single layered m3 2 37 μm double layered m6 3 17 μm triple layered m8 5 2 μm values and composition of the modification layers perfectly match the surface sem images previously discussed further indicating m8 da e1 e2 pan is the optimum membrane 3 3 membrane topography membrane surface roughness is linked to increased water affinity and adjusting it might improve membrane permeability 54 because foulants are less inclined to adhere to a smooth surface there is indeed a clear link between antifouling property and membrane surface roughness 55 fig 5 and table 2 depict 3d topographic profiles and parameters pertaining to membrane surface roughness respectively in comparison to m1 integrating the enzymes directly onto the pan surface resulted in a gradual decrease in membrane surface roughness from sa 32 57 0 65 to sa 6 76 0 01 nm as shown in table 2 the simultaneous integration of enzymes is responsible for the slight increase in surface roughness of the m4 membrane to sa 15 9 0 32 nm as originally proposed by miao et al 56 the observed increase in m5 roughness might be due to the formation of polymeric pda agglomerates on the membrane surface however immobilization of protease lipase and their mixture on the pda layer led to a smoother surface inspired by the results found by marques et al 51 in a different study with some similar aspects regarding the presence of pda it could be concluded that the incorporation of enzymes resulted in the breakdown of non covalent connections between the pda aggregates promoting homogeneous deposition of the components furthermore pda aggregates may impede the efficiency of membranes with small pores particularly ones employed in ultrafiltration by raising water penetration resistances 57 this effect was also observed in the current study because a slight reduction in hydraulic permeance was seen when only dopamine was involved in membrane modification despite the blocking of certain pores the inclusion of hydrophilic pda to the membrane surface resulted in a roughening of the membrane surface which increased the effective filtration area 55 overall according to the finding the surface roughness of the membrane was significantly improved following surface modification leading to an increase in water flux foulants on the other hand are easily embedded into the valleys of the membrane surface with increased surface roughness increasing irreversible fouling as a result as noted in section 3 5 the antifouling property of the membrane would be reduced 3 4 membrane hydrophilicity and permeability membrane performance is heavily influenced by the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface water contact angles wca were determined in a static mode to reflect the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface due to the intrinsic hydrophobicity of pan polymer wca of the pristine pan membrane was 62 94 1 26 as reported in fig 6 from the figure wca was decreased for surface modified membranes rather than m1 the minimum wca was achieved for m5 35 65 0 7 so it could be concluded that the increase in membrane hydrophilicity was mostly attributable to the inclusion of hydrophilic pda groups on the pan surface furthermore the hydrophilic layer was synergistically enhanced by the inclusion of da and enzymes drawing water molecules to the membrane surface and forming a hydrated layer that prevented contaminants from adhering 55 at room temperature the pure water flux pwf of the fabricated membranes was evaluated at 3 bar the variation in water flux as shown in fig 6 was consistent with the hydrophilicity findings the water flux of the pristine pan membrane was to be 46 31 0 93 kg m2 h the water flux of the membrane has gradually reduced after surface modification when there was no enzyme on the membrane surface the water flux of m5 reached a value of 35 44 0 71 kg m2 h a 23 5 decline from m1 this phenomenon was attributed to the addition of dopamine increasing the separation layer thickness and creating a stronger resistance to water penetration the introduction of enzymes and dopamine to the membrane increased its hydrophilicity facilitating and accelerating the passage of water molecules through formed water channels leading to a considerably enhanced pwf 55 water permeability and antifouling properties can be greatly enhanced by the synergistic effect of da e1 and e2 inclusion notably benefiting from this synergistic effect m8 da e1 e2 pan presented the remarkable permeability and hydrophilicity with corresponding values of pwf and wca as 78 09 1 6 kg m2 h and 39 8 0 8 3 5 membrane antifouling performance 3 5 1 milk powder mp filtration fig 7a depicts the results of dynamic three step flux and also normalized flux over step 3 during fouling experiments when a simulated protein and lipid feed as milk powder mp is filtered an increasing number of protein and lipid molecules accumulate on the membrane surface and become trapped in the membrane pores leading to a significant rise in permeation resistances and a decrease in flux step 2 all surface modified membranes however demonstrated excellent flux recovery frr after being washed with di water for 20 min step 3 the findings also suggest that the optimally modified membrane m8 had superior antifouling capacity resulting in a frr of 99 32 1 9 an increase of 23 5 over the pristine pan membrane after surface modification the overall antifouling properties of the membranes were enhanced the antifouling capacity of the modified membranes is shown in fig 7b more and more enzyme molecules adhered to the membrane surface when da was added establishing a new hydrophilic separation layer 51 higher water and milk powder fluxes arose from the enhancement in hydrophilicity meanwhile the enhanced separation layer prevented protein and lipid molecules from filtering and increased milk powder rejection furthermore despite the fact that the membrane surface got rougher the membrane surface became more hydrophilic according to the aforementioned membrane characterization consequently a water layer formed between the foulant and the membrane surface during the filtration of the milk powder solution inhibiting the adsorption and pileup of milk powder and subsequently improving the antifouling capacity all the resistance capability assessment elements for the fabricated membranes were calculated including intrinsic resistance rm cake gel resistance rc pore resistance rf and total filtration resistance rt proving that the modified membranes clearly have significantly improved antifouling properties when compared to the pristine pan membrane fig 7c as can be noticed the majority of the fouling resistance of pan membranes is due to their cake and intrinsic resistance considerably limiting their flux as previously suggested the agglomeration of a self polymerized pda layer on the membrane surface might clarify a limited undesirable rise in above resistances for m5 membrane due to their higher hydrophilic properties and active degradation of the protein and lipid layers introducing protease and lipase to pda deposited pan membranes might lessen these two forms of resistance 58 overall all of the aforementioned factors contribute to an improvement in the antifouling and flux recovery properties of the surface modified membranes during long term filtration mp solution and distilled water were alternately provided over four cycles the permeate flux profile over four cycles and also normalized flux during the last cycle for m1 and m8 membranes in the dead end system are shown in fig 7d as compared to m1 m8 s filtration behavior deteriorated slightly towards the end of the fourth cycle after 15 h of filtration resulting in an 6 flux reduction meanwhile after 900 min m1 s flow dropped dramatically from 46 32 to 10 46 kg m2 h this may be rationalized by the high degree of hydrophilicity inducing a dense and stable hydration layer exceptional antifouling resistance and high hydraulic cleaning effectiveness offered by the enzyme immobilized surface of m8 3 5 2 bovine serum albumin bsa filtration membrane fouling was explored in depth by looking into bsa fouling mechanism and membrane physicochemical properties to further investigate the antifouling property offered by the synergistic effect of enzyme immobilization and da interlayer formation fouling resistances over time during three step bsa filtration were evaluated and shown in fig 8 for the pristine and selected membranes of m4 m5 and m8 these membranes were selected based on the physicochemical characterization and mp filtration results which can confidently provide a potential platform to compare the effects of key stages of surface modification as a result the permeate flux and frr decline in m5 fig 8a and b was observed owing to the addition of da and its polymerization which increased the separation layer thickness and resulted in a greater resistance to water penetration these findings suggest that the optimally modified membrane m8 had superior antifouling capacity benefiting from the simultaneous presence of protease and lipase enzymes frr of 94 1 1 89 and an increase of 36 18 0 7 over the pristine m1 these results were in line with the surface roughness data previously discussed it is worth noting following the surface modification by both da and enzymes m8 rir was effectively alleviated by 80 9 1 6 compared to the pristine pan the smaller size of bsa molecules as well as their greater adherence and deposition led to lower values of flux and fouling resistance variables in bsa filtration compared to mp fouling 59 60 since bsa was hydrophobic and also had negative charges at ph of 7 the membranes improved hydrophilicity fig 6 and greater negative charge fig 2 played a key role in fouling control under these conditions the incorporated e1 and e2 enzymes catalyzed the hydrolysis of the bsa fouling layer hence improving antifouling behavior of m8 similar to mp the considerable decrease in dominant fouling resistance indicators fig 8c is solid proof that the enzymes were successfully immobilized and actively contributed to the degradation of the bsa fouling layer furthermore four fouling cycles with bsa were conducted to study bsa fouling permeation flux and normalized flux decline as outlined previously demonstrating that the enzyme modification is reasonably stable fig 8d after four filtration cycles the compact size of bsa molecules along with their greater adhesion resulted in an 14 reduction in flux for m8 furthermore as compared to mp fouling the m1 flux became nil after 850 min 3 5 3 humic acid ha filtration in addition to exploring the fouling resistance of the modified membranes in the face of mp and bsa ha fouling was also investigated the initial phase in ha fouling is ha adsorption which is heavily dependent on the ha affinity towards the membrane surface an increase in the hydrophilicity of the selected modified membranes may reduce the interaction forces involving the membrane surface and ha molecules decreasing adsorption of the ha onto the membrane surface and reducing ha narrowing or blocking membrane pores 60 the inclusion of a hydrophilic layer made it easier to remove ha adhered to the membrane surface or deposited in its pores during hydraulic backwash fig 9a resulting in improved cleaning efficiency in terms of surface charge the surface modification elevated the membrane surfaces negative charge strengthening the charge repulsion between the membrane surface and ha as a consequence less ha contacted the membrane surface and deposited in membrane pores resulting in decreased fouling of the surface modified membranes frr of 91 4 1 83 in overall in filtration of ha similar trends with bsa and mp filtration were achieved for the selected membranes in fig 9b the reversibility of ha fouling of the membranes was estimated reversible fouling was the most prominent fouling type for ha filtration as can be observed cake layer formation and concentration polarization are two key aspects of reversible fouling 59 in comparison to reversible fouling irreversible fouling induced by pore narrowing and its blockage underwent a decrease in m8 the better hydrophilicity and increased negative charge of the surface modified membranes were likely the major reasons for their improved anti ha fouling performance as aforementioned membrane surface roughness was also regarded to have an impact on antifouling behavior overall in anti bsa fouling the surface modified uf membranes had greater permeate flux and irreversible fouling control than in anti ha fouling however due to bsa s lower zeta potential the charge repulsion between the membrane surface and bsa was weaker than that of ha as a result hydrophilicity appears to be more significant than surface charge in bsa fouling mitigation than ha fouling nonetheless it can be assumed that immobilization of the enzyme mixture e1 e2 on the m8 surface similar to prior foulants is capable of degrading the tightly adherent ha layer resulting in improved fouling resistance fig 9c 58 the surface modified m8 membrane outperformed the pristine pan in every filtration cycle as seen in fig 9d similar to two other foulants after 900 min the optimal membrane s flux has gone down from 79 651 6 to 65 171 3 kg m2 h but the pristine membrane s flux has steadily declined from 45 960 92 kg m2 h to zero implying a major contribution of ha molecules to fouling 3 6 membrane separation performance nom removal fig 10 depicts the nom removal of the pristine pan m1 and surface modified m4 m5 and m8 membranes the boost in nom removal by the surface modified uf membranes is attributable to the physicochemical characteristics of the membranes and the properties of foulants for mp bsa and ha the pristine pan obtained removal efficiencies of 99 5 0 19 72 5 1 45 and 44 5 1 9 respectively among the nom foulants studied mp was the most efficiently removed by all membranes the mp removal for all membranes were around 99 9 which was most likely owing to the development of an mp cake layer on the membrane surface assisting in its removal as shown in fig 10 the bsa removal increased from 72 5 1 45 of the bare pan to 92 5 1 85 of the m8 overall this data was superior to that of other surface modified membranes where bsa rejection was increased to 88 7 1 78 in enzyme immobilized membrane without da m4 or even slightly decreased to 84 9 1 7 after the pda interlayer formation in m5 membrane the bsa removal efficiency for each type of membrane was greater than that for ha the rejection of ha and bsa increased by 80 9 1 62 and 27 6 0 55 for the m8 membrane respectively as compared to the bare pan since bsa has a smaller negative charge than ha there may be less charge repulsion between the membrane surface and the bsa molecules as a result the surface modified membranes did not significantly improve bsa removal as they did ha removal 59 ha had a broad molecular size range including small molecules 1 kda 60 since the small molecules of ha pass through the membrane effortlessly the pristine pan membrane led to a low ha rejection of 44 5 1 9 the surface modified membranes were more hydrophilic than the pristine pan resulting in less hydrophobic interactions between the membrane surface and ha and hence more ha removal furthermore the surface of the modified membranes and ha molecules were both negatively charged surface modified membranes displayed higher charge repulsion between the membrane surface and ha than m1 which contributed to increased ha rejection overall the rejection of organics in pan uf membranes was attributed to hydrophilicity and surface charge repulsion accordingly mp and bsa were rejected better than ha furthermore due to firmly bonded water molecules hydrophilic modified membranes may effectively block organic molecules from passing through the membrane surface and immobilized enzymatic biomolecules can have surface reactions and hydrolyze certain foulants the higher nom removal efficiency of m4 and m8 membranes can also be attributed to the enzymes sufficient active sites allowing for significant interactions with the organic substance and hence better nom removal 58 the enzyme molecules bound on the membrane surface may degrade the foulants that pass through the skin layer enhancing the membrane s nom removal efficiency since enzyme substrate interaction is totally dependent on the degradation process enzyme substrate degradation is more specific than others the active site where the enzyme binds and catalyzes substrates serves as a specific binding spot for the substrate foulants to recapitulate surface modified membranes significantly improved the removal of hydrophobic nom foulants 3 7 membrane antibacterial property the qualitative investigation of the bactericidal properties of surface modified membranes against s aureus and e coli can be seen in fig 11a by covalently immobilizing the antimicrobial enzymes e1 e2 on the surface of the da pan membranes a previously non existent inhibition zone for the bare pan membrane was converted into a clearly visible inhibition zone obviously the zone inhibition test yielded nearly identical results for both species of bacteria 61 the od measurement was also used to quantitatively determine antibacterial activity against the aforementioned g and g bacterial strains as shown in fig 11b the container with the bare membrane m1 was turbid signaling bacterial growth whereas the container with the modified membrane m8 had such a clear solution s aureus and e coli induction were detected on m1 membranes with an od of 1 198 and 1 489 respectively the g and g optical densities of the m8 modified membranes on the other hand were 0 021 and 0 095 respectively indicating that bacterial growth was negligible the development of g and g bacteria was successfully prevented by optimally surface modified membranes according to the observations 62 the enhancement of antibacterial properties in membranes is dependent on two key factors hydrophilicity and surface roughness the increased hydrophilicity of the surface modified membranes was confirmed by water contact angle measurements fig 6 when water molecules are in close proximity to membrane surfaces they tend to interact with hydrophilic surfaces leading to a thin layer of water molecules covering the entire surface of the membrane the water layer prevents bacteria from sticking to the surface due to their organic structure microorganisms were also less likely to find suitable attachment sites on the smoother surface with low roughness the presence of covalently linked protease and lipase on the m8 membrane surface is another key component of the optimally modified membranes antibacterial resistance the dual immobilization of antimicrobial lipase and protease e1 e2 on the membrane surface which both have an on lytic mechanism targeting the cell wall might underlie the improved antibacterial properties of the surface modified membrane the glycosidic or peptide linkages of peptidoglycan the primary component of bacterial cell walls are hydrolyzed by these enzymes resulting in antibacterial activity as a consequence intracellular components leak out and rna synthesis is inhibited 63 3

filtration and antifouling performance the novel surface modified membranes in this study can clearly compete with the existing membranes turning them into a promising candidate for large scale industrial implementation 4 conclusion in this study a simple multi step technique based on self polymerization of dopamine and covalent bonding of hydrolytic protease and lipase enzymes was employed to decorate the pan uf membrane dopamine content had a major impact on membrane performance parameters such as hydrophilicity and antifouling the successful layer formation for membrane surface modification was confirmed by atr ftir zeta potential and sem analyses as revealed in afm images the introduction of modifiers enhanced the surface roughness the results showed that the modified membrane had greater hydrophilicity as determined by the wca leading to an increase in water flux under optimal conditions da e1 e2 pan m8 possessed a pure water flux of 78 09 1 6 kg m2 h higher than the pristine membrane 46 31 kg m2 h the performance of selected uf membranes was comprehensively assessed against anti nom fouling and removal mechanisms yielding removal efficiencies and frr values of 80 and 90 respectively the key elements in controlling membrane fouling induced by mp bsa and ha and their subsequent stable long term filtration performance were smoother and negatively charged surfaces enhanced hydrophilicity and enzymatic degradation of the foulants as a result it may be one step closer to breaking through the upper bound which has long been a source of concern in membrane

12579,in this study clinoptilolite was used in batch and sand box model experiments to investigate the uptake efficiency of lead from contaminated groundwater in fashafuye plain surface properties structure and composition of adsorbent were investigated using xrf xrd sem and bet based on bet clinoptilolite has a surface area of 38 8 m2 g and mean value pore size of 17 97 nm on account of the ph variability in the fashafuye plain batch testing was conducted in ph 6 7 and 8 with various concentrations 1 1 5 3 5 6 8 5 10 and 12 5 mg l the maximum uptake efficiency 96 3 was obtained with clinoptilolite dose of 0 05 g ph 6 at 328 k within 90 min corresponding to 47 4 mg g of adsorption capacity the freundlich isotherm was used to predict multilayer lead adsorption on the heterogeneous area of clinoptilolite the desirable kinetic model for clinoptilolite is the pseudo 2nd order equation the thermodynamic parameters showed that lead adsorption on clinoptilolite were endothermic and spontaneous based on column tracer tests the values of dispersivity were calculated 90 3 and 10 cm for site no 2 and no 9 respectively indicating some preferential flow and scale dependent dispersion the amount of drawdown in sand box model experiments is lower in site no 2 than in site no 9 which is due to sediment permeability the real contaminated groundwater tests showed that clinoptilolite was successful in absorbing lead from polluted groundwater and removal efficiency in batch experiments and sand box models were more than 85 and 25 respectively due to shorter contact time in sand box

groundwater the most valuable natural resource in arid and semi arid countries is not only the most important natural resource but also has a significant impact on the ecosystems of these countries 1 2 groundwater supplies nearly half of the world water resources for drinking about 40 of the world water used for irrigation and about one third of the water needed for industry and manufacturing apart from maintaining aquatic ecosystems groundwater plays an important role in adaptation to climate change 3 over the past three decades human activity and climate change have led to increased water scarcity and unavailability of surface water this not only increases the imposed pressure and dependence on groundwater but also poses a significant threat to groundwater quality becoming a global problem with enormous impacts on human health and ecosystem services 4 5 a huge kind of substances along with artificial natural chemicals inorganic cations hydrocarbons inorganic anions radionuclides pathogens and different rising contaminants were indicated as contaminants discovered in groundwater 6 due to human and natural activities distinct kinds of contaminants might also additionally reach groundwater 7 recent research in numerous components of the arena have targeted on infection of groundwater assets with poisonous metals along with lead 8 lead as a ubiquitous environmental toxin able to inflicting several acute and persistent circulatory neurological hematological gastrointestinal reproductive and immunological pathologies 9 although in current decades tremendously a hit and complicated strategies were evolved for the remediation of wastewaters in current years groundwater remedy has been turn out to be critical for scientists and environmental researchers 10 11 ex situ and in situ processes are essential kinds for water and soil remediation and in terms of groundwater remediation due to the fact of high price of excavation and publicity of excavators to negative fitness dangers of contaminants in ex situ approach in situ strategies turn out to be greater favorable 12 several strategies along with pump and treat permeable reactive substances in situ flashing and bioremediation exist for groundwater remediation but the remediation approach is chosen primarily based totally at the characteristic site contaminant conditions remedial time price and favored cleanup levels 13 reactive materials are chosen for in situ groundwater remediation technologies based on some characteristics such as reactivity stability cost and availability 7 14 there are a wide range of reactive materials that have been used in groundwater remediation including zerovalent iron zvi activated carbon zeolites peat and other reactive materials 15 16 zeolite an aluminosilicate mineral with cage like structures has been used for the removal of lead from polluted groundwater level as a consequence of its high surface area reactivity hydraulic conductivity less fouling and clogging environmental compatibility and commercial and industrial applications 17 18 clinoptilolite the most prevalent and regular type of natural zeolite for commercial and industrial use is used as a reactive material to reduce toxic pollutants such as lead from contaminated water 19 20 and contaminated groundwater 21 22 to date the large number of different studies have been investigated the removal lead from aqueous solutions using clinoptilolite natural and synthetic 19 23 several studied reported excellent efficiencies of natural clinoptilolite in removal of lead from contaminated water 20 24 due to process simplicity relatively inexpensive and easy of maintenance natural zeolites have been used to removal lead from aqueous solutions in batch experiments 24 however natural and synthetic adsorbents have their own advantages and disadvantages in the field of synthetic adsorbents oxide compounds in comparison with alloys compounds are more resistance to the aggressive influence of environmental factors such as temperature oxygen and electromagnetic radiation and also they are much more stable when used up to 1000 c in recent years oxide compounds such as the complex iron oxides called as the ferrites have attracted more and more attention due to their high adsorption capacities special super paramagnetic properties and surface area to volume ration 25 recently attention increasingly has been concentrated on advanced catalytic oxidation methods in the field of wastewater treatment 26 and microwave technology improves their efficiency and decreases investment and operation costs of these methods 27 commonly most materials in wastewater are unable to absorb microwave directly while some materials such as complex oxide compounds can easily absorb and transfer microwave energy to the matters in wastewater 28 and these abilities have caused them to use as a microwave absorption the synthesis methods are crucial to produce high quality oxide compounds with regard to purity morphology surface area and stability the main categories of oxide compounds synthesis methods are bottom up and top down approaches 29 in the bottom up approach the ions are chemically united together to form the particles but in top down approach materials are reduced to fine particles 25 the various synthesis techniques for bottom up option are thermal decomposition co precipitation solvothermal hydrothermal sol gel sonochemical flame spray pyrolysis microwave assisted vapor deposition polyol techniques microemulsion while only the mechanical milling techniques and pulsed laser ablation are usual for the top down approach 30 groundwater remediation can be achieved by adsorption ion exchange abiotic reduction biotic reduction chemical precipitation and or groundwater remediation through two or more of these mechanisms 7 31 the removal of lead from wastewater using electro active adsorption and biological processes is highly efficient 32 33 lead removal by natural zeolite is an efficient process that involves binding to residual negative charges on the zeolite as well as exchanging ions with na k ca2 and mg2 34 the fashafuye aquifer is a significant provenance of water for the area around tehran and it helps to meet the water needs of many people in the region the aquifer is unconfined and it has been contaminated by lead based on water sample collection based on the presence of high quality 75 95 wt clinoptilolite crystals in iran 35 and the distribution of contamination over the fashafuye aquifer it is suggested that clinoptilolite will be used to remove lead from groundwater in water wells in regard to this point transform raw or waste water sources into products that are useful to society batch experiments and fixed bed column studies 8 were conducted the study found that clinoptilolite can be used to remove lead from the contaminated groundwater as a continuation of the previous work 8 in this survey for the first time a sand box model was designed and the feasibility of using clinoptilolite as a gravel pack in water wells to removal lead from contaminated groundwater as an in situ remediation method was evaluated the main advantage of this approach is that the contaminant is managed under the ground without needing to physically move the contaminated groundwater moreover time saving easy to use and relatively inexpensive make it more favorable our hope is that this research will be continued up to achieve a desired result and its outcome will be used practically in water supply in any place in the world with lead pollution problems 2 material and methods 2 1 location and hydro geological settings the fashafuye plain is located about 50 km southwest of tehran the capital of iran fig 1s based on groundwater prospecting studies the sediments in the northern part of the fashafuye plain are composed of coarse sand and silt with a thickness of over 150 m from north

the samples were rinsed with instilled water and the xrd analysis was replicated multi point brunauer emmett teller bet analysis was used nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were performed on the n2 adsorption desorption affinity belsorp miniii bel japan calculate the specific surface area and investigate the accessible void porosity of clinoptilolite 2 4 lead adsorption tests to study lead adsorption on clinoptilolite the adsorbent was crushed and sifted to a grain size of 0 6 0 8 mm due to the ph variability of the fashafuye plain sorption studies were performed at ph 3 6 7 8 and 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh standard solutions were used to regulate the ph of the solutions the influence of initial lead concentration on a constant sorbent 50 mg was investigated using lead solutions of varying concentrations 1 1 5 3 5 6 8 5 10 and 12 5 mg l in kinetic experiments the contact time varied between 0 and 150 min and in thermodynamic studies 50 mg clinoptilolite was added to 50 ml lead solutions at ph 6 to a starting concentration of 50 mg l the impression of temperature on the adsorption of lead to clinoptilolite was observed at temperatures of 298 k 25 c 308 k 35 c 318 k 45 c and 328 k 55 c was evaluated using an initial lead concentration of 50 mg l the fixed nominal dose of adsorbent is 50 mg and ph 6 all lead sorption tests were performed in 100 ml transparent beakers containing 50 ml lead solution of the desired concentration and sorbent it is recommended to run using dose the mixture was stirred at 160 rpm for 90 150 min on a temperature controlled shaker clinoptilolite was separated from the ionic metal solution using a laboratory centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 120 s after reaching adsorption equilibrium the difference between the initial lead concentration and the equilibrium lead content was used to calculate the amount of lead ions adsorbed on clinoptilolite removal efficiencies percent and adsorption capacities q e were estimated using the downward equations eqs 1 and 2 1 removal c i c e c i 100 2 q t q e c i c e v w where q e is the quantity of lead adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent mg of lead adsorbed g of adsorbent q t is the equilibrium capacity mg g over time c i and c e are the lead ions indicates concentration of initiative and ending solution mg l v is the solution volume l and w is the amount of used adsorbent g a groundwater sample was taken from the fashafuye plain southwest of tehran iran and 200 mg of sorbent was mixed with 200 ml of contaminated groundwater at true ph it was stirred at 160 rpm for 2 h at 24 c after which the mixture was centrifuged and the final solution analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 2 5 recycling tests in order to investigate the recycling of clinoptilolite successive adsorption desorption cycle was carried out for eight trials first clinoptilolites were washed gently by 1 m kcl to remove the desorbed lead from their surface then they were rinsed with deionized water to remove any residual kcl and after that dried at 80 c finally the recycled clinoptilolites were exposed to lead solution for performance evaluation 2 6 the sand box and column sediments we first determined the particle size of the material representative of the aquifer materials at site no 2 and no 9 in this study and the results are shown in fig 1 at site no 2 the grain size of the aquifer material is greater than 0 1 mm and less than 6 mm and at site no 9 the grain size of the aquifer material is between 0 01 mm and 4 mm based on these curves at site no 2 the 38 5 cm bottom of the sandbox is filled with aquifer materials with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 6 mm and at site no 9 the 38 5 cm bottom of the sandbox is filled with aquifer materials with 0 1 1 mm particles as shown in fig 1 based on laboratory work some physical parameters of clinoptilolite and sediments from its two sites used in this study are shown in table 1 a filter pack or gravel pack is a borehole filter that consists of coarse sand or gravel around a water pipe to prevent the entrance of sand to water pipe in water wells 39 in this study based on johnson s filter pack design criteria 39 the particle size of clinoptilolite used as gravel packs in sandpit models at sites no 2 and no 9 was 4d15 aquifer materials at these sites the particle size of clinoptilolite is 0 8 1 mm at site no 9 and 1 2 mm at site no 2 in the column test at sites no 2 and no 9 the column was filled with air dried sediment and its gradient curve was shown in fig 1 to establish a perfect chemical balance between water and sediment the sediment and clinoptilolite were washed with tap water before the experiment 2 7 construction sandbox model and column to evaluate the ability of clinoptilolite a sandbox model was constructed to remove lead from polluted groundwater and a column experiment were conducted to investigate dispersion phenomena at two sites nos 2 and 9 most sandbox models and column instruments are generally manufactured of materials that are inactive to many organic and not organic trace contaminants 40 42 therefore in this study according to previous works the sandbox model and column were made of plexiglas the basic body of the sandbox model is a rectangular sandbox with outer dimensions of 43 cm in height and 22 cm in length and width and inner dimensions of 42 2 cm in height and 20 4 cm in length and width there is a valve in the middle of the bottom of the sandbox to control the output of the sandbox model inside the model is a perforated plexiglas tube with a hole diameter of 0 7 mm an exterior diameter of 2 5 cm an interior diameter of 2 1 cm and a height of 42 cm as a water pipe and another plexiglas tube with an outer diameter of 10 cm an inner diameter of 9 2 cm and a height of 42 cm as casing and screen installed around it and the bottom 39 cm has a 0 7 mm diameter pore to measure the water level in a sandbox two perforated plexiglas tubes with an external diameter of 1 cm an internal diameter of 0 6 cm and a height of 42 cm were placed at a radius of 8 cm from the center and their bottoms attached to the sand box 33 cm has a 0 7 mm diameter pore as an observation well fig 2 contaminated groundwater was moved from around to the center in the sandbox and a constant pressure column apparatus was used to maintain flow consistency in this regard a hole at a distance of 2 5 cm from the top of the sandbox was embedded the space between the water pipe and the screen was filled with clinoptilolite and the lower 38 5 cm of the model was filled with sediments from two selected locations leaving a 1 5 cm thick water layer was kept constant on top of it column tests used columns with 34 mm id 4 cm od and 15 cm lengths to ensure that the column was saturated the solution was transferred from the bottom of the column to the top up flow mode it is recommended using the constant head method to measure hydraulic conductivity and maintain flow consistency in column experiments 2 8 breakthrough curve experiment in this study ec was used as a tracer because of the weak interaction between dissolved k and aquifer materials 43 in this context a kcl solution 0 025 mg l ec 2000 μs cm was prepared and used for tracer tests the amount of ec in the influent and effluent was measured at predetermined time intervals using a microprocessor based model 7021 waterproof conductivity temperature tester in column transport experiments once stable flow rates of 10 and 1 ml min were achieved at sites no 2 and no 9 respectively a breakthrough experiment was performed by continuously injecting kcl solution and once the ec amount in the effluent was exceeded to 85 the influent the experiment was terminated 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization based on xrf analysis the si al atomic ratio of the zeolite sample was 6 85 according to a study by breck and sieves 44 this is the zeolite clinoptilolite and the primary oxides in the tested samples are sio2 and al2o3 followed by na2o k2o and cl which are more common than other oxides according to xrd the main minerals in clinoptilolite zeolite before washing are clinoptilolite salt gypsum quartz and cristobalite after washing the main minerals are clinoptilolite cristobalite quartz and gypsum appear as trace elements and the salt disappears 8 electron beam methods especially sem have wide application in the characterization of different types of zeolites and can provide structural morphological and chemical data down to the atomic level 45 fesem images of the zeolites revealed a blocky structure with small pores of 0 22 0 76 nm providing a surface for adsorption corresponding to eds analysis the ruling substitutable cations in the clinoptilolite structure are na and k 8 bet analysis is used to determine exact micro porous volumes in hierarchical zeolites and to fully understand the structural characteristics of zeolites 46 those zeolites which have a high surface area and are porous in nature are better adsorbents 47 based on bet and laboratory experiments clinoptilolite has a surface area of 38 85 m2 g and mean value pore size of 17 97 nm which means that is sponge like and can efficiently absorb lead mobile absorbency connects to the receptiveness of a rock or sediment that is momentous for solute transport and can boost fluid flow through the sediment or rock 48 laboratory experiments show that the analyzed sample has a total porosity of 65 5 and a mobile porosity of 20 8 3 2 influence of key factors on adsorption in this survey we researched the effects of temperature initial concentration ph adsorbent dosage and contact time on the sorbent removal efficiency according to previous studies 19 49 the adsorption of lead on clinoptilolite is an endothermic reaction and the lead adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature according to our previous work 8 when the temperature was enhanced from 298 k to 328 k the adsorption of pb ii on the clinoptilolite proliferated from 93 2 to 96 3 the adsorption volume amount grow quickly from 45 9 to 47 4 mg g acknowledging that it is an endothermic reaction and the maximal adsorption was measured at 328 k 55 c they also showed that the removal decreases with increasing starting lead concentration as the starting concentration increases the adsorption volume declines because more exchange sites are saturated 23 the ph is another important variable that affecting lead sorption in clinoptilolite and because of adsorption and cation exchange the uptake of lead from aqueous solutions on natural zeolites is a complex process and at higher initial lead concentrations could be accompanied by precipitation 50 the effect of ph 6 7 and 8 on the lead adsorption onto under investigated clinoptilolite was conducted in our previous work that level of adsorption decreased with increasing ph and the higher lead uptake was achieved at ph 6 8 according to previous studies 19 51 as the adsorbent mass increases more exchangeable sites are available and the uptake increases in this study the adsorbent dosage was varied from 25 to 75 mg and removal efficiency was ranged from 87 to almost 100 gunay and his colleagues 23 showed that lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite reached to a maximum after approximately 60 120 min and continued unchanged thereafter in this study the contact time was varied from 0 to 150 min and the sorption volume values ranged from 38 7 to 45 96 mg g the adsorption kinetics of clinoptilolite was at the outset rapid up to 30 min the sorption capacity amount growth from 38 7 to 42 7 mg g reaching equilibrium after 100 150 min of stirring and the adsorption kinetics remained constant however the contact time was longer table 2 compares the results of lead adsorption onto natural clinoptilolite in this survey with other studies it shows that the iranian natural clinoptilolite adsorption capacity is near to south african natural clinoptilolite and it is higher than syrian and kazakh natural clinoptilolite it is recommended that the contact time plays a vital role in the lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite the effect of contact time on lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite was investigated by several researchers and they reported the maximum uptake efficiency 98 to 99 8 within 82 87 to 90 min contact time for lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite 19 52 53 in this survey the contact time for lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite was obtained 90 min fig 5s 3 3 equilibrium research in contemplation of research the equivalence functions of clinoptilolite lead adsorption freundlich 56 and langmuir 57 isotherm models have been used and their parameters have been calculated through linear shape in their equations the langmuir isotherm may be indicated in lineal shape eq 3 57 as follows 3 c e q e 1 q m b c e q m where q e is the equilibrium amount of lead adsorbed in step with mass of adsorbent mg g q m is the adsorbent most uptake capacity mg g c e is the amount of adsorbent within the solution mg g and b is the langmuir steady associated with adsorption energy the constants in eq 6 have been decided through draw a linear graph among 1 q e and 1 c e which the slope of the graph offers us possibility to calculate k 1 and q m can decided through the intersection of the plot among 1 q e and 1 c e based on langmuir model consequences the separation factor r l 58 was equaled to 0 01 indicating a favorable adsorption implying that the langmuir pattern isotherm was not the foremost defined for their sorption data fig 3 when adsorbent surfaces are heterogeneous and answers are low in attention freundlich isotherms are used the linear shape of the freundlich adsorption isotherm equation eq 4 is as follows 59 4 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e the isotherm constants 1 n and kf changed into calculated through the slope and intercept of the linear graph between ln q e and ln c e the value of r2 in the freundlich isotherm transformation for lead adsorption on under investigated clinoptilolite is close to 1 indicating a heterogeneous sorption mechanism for multilayer lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite moreover due to the fact 1 n is much less than one it is viable to finish that it is able to effectively imbibe lead ii over a large concentration range 8 3 4 kinetic studies kinetic pattern pseudo 1st order and pseudo 2nd order were used to figure out the clinoptilolite performance and study the adsorption mass transfer mechanism pseudo 1st order for the linear version of the dynamic model and pseudo 2nd orders eqs 5 6 60 61 are 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 6 t q t 1 k q e 2 t q e where q t and q e are the equilibrium values of adsorbed lead per mass of clinoptilolite at any time t min k 1 l min is the first order rate constant for adsorption and k g mg min is the rate constant for the pseudo 2nd model fig 4 affirms the result of time on the adsorption of lead onto clinoptilolite this illustrates that the adsorption of lead onto clinoptilolite is a time affiliate procedure in well agreement with pseudo 2nd order equation this indicates that the adsorption rate depends on the absorption capacity and is independent of lead concentration 62 63 as can be seen from table 3 8 the first order r2 values of the kinetic models are higher than 0 95 on the other hand the coefficient of determination r2 0 999 of the second order kinetic model is very close to 1 and the calculated adsorption capacities q e cal for indicate the high adsorption capacity of clinoptilolite 3 5 thermodynamic research thermodynamic studies are important in determining whether and if adsorption is spontaneous the free energy δg entropy δs and enthalpy δh were estimated using the van t hoff equation 64 65 according to the survey that was carried out by nakhaei and his colleagues 8 the amount of lead adsorbed onto clinoptilolite increases with increasing temperature the enthalpy and entropy change values of under investigated clinoptilolite for a lead concentration of 50 mg l were 17 32 kj mol and 79 71 j mol k respectively the values of δg at temperature 298 308 318 and 328 k were 6 43 7 23 8 03 and 8 82 kj mol respectively indicate that the lead adsorption is spontaneous nature process 8 positive δh values illustrate that lead adsorption by clinoptilolite is endothermic in nature 66 a positive δs value indicates an increment in degrees of freedom and randomness of molecules adsorbed at the solid liquid interface 67 3 6 adsorbent recycling one of the most crucial stages in every remediation method is recycling of the utilized adsorbent 68 in order to determine lead adsorption desorption potential of the clinoptilolite several adsorption desorption cycles were carried out once it had been renewable eight times because of using kcl solution during the first three cycles the lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite was increased fig 5a this is due fact that the removal impurities from channels of the clinoptilolite might cause more lead adsorb onto clinoptilolite in addition because of replacing some ions such as calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 and sodium na with potassium k ions present in renewable solution the adsorbent structure could be modified furthermore the formation of complexes among chlorides and metals could be increased the amount of metal uptake especially during the renewable cycle some chloride cl ions could be entrapped in the channels or cavities of adsorbent and remain there even after washing 69 during the adsorption process these ions could form inner sphere complexes with lead ions and enhance the lead uptake efficiency as it was shown in fig 5b the desorption efficiency decreases with ascending renewable cycles which means that some lead actually remained on the clinoptilolite and therefore in the subsequent adsorption cycles the amount of lead adsorption decreases according to eds analysis fig 4s throughout the adsorption process plenty of lead is captured by natural clinoptilolite while some amount of lead remains in the sample after regeneration 3 7 interpreting column breakthrough curves solute transport in the saturation zone of a homogeneous aquifer in one dimensional steady flow is commonly described using the convective dispersion equation cde 70 as follows eq 7 7 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x where c is the content mean value solution concentration mg cm3 t is the time period min x is the distance cm v q ε is the mean pore water speed cm min q is the darcian liquid flow rate cm min and ε is the effective porosity r is the retardation coefficient describing sorption or exchange in linear equilibrium dimensionless and d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 min if diffusion was inconsiderable dispersivity α is characterized as the proportion of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d to the pore water velocity v eq 8 8 α d v dispersity values are traditionally considered a property of the whole medium 71 and are typically of the order of 0 1 2 cm for columns of unpacked uniform soil 72 results from field studies show that dispersivity is scale dependent as a result of the heterogeneous nature of the geological material migration time migration distance and or measurement scales 73 74 and for heterogeneous columns was reported as high as 200 cm 70 the observed breakthrough curves for tracer injection experiments at sites no 2 and no 9 in sandy soil columns are shown in fig 6a b in this study the cxtfit code 75 in the standmod software was used to simulate a resident concentration a third type of inlet solute free feed water constant initial concentration zero production and a steady state semi infinite system to match the experimental data fig 6c d this code allows us to simultaneously fit v and d to the measured btc data 76 the kcl tracer lag r in the column was assumed to be negligible because the sand in the soil column was relatively free of organic matter after estimating v and d from the btc at the column outlet α was calculated using a formula similar to eq 8 and ε was calculated as follows eq 9 77 9 ε q v table 4 shows the standmod convoy test and simulation btc results in this study the effective porosities at sites no 2 and no 9 were calculated to be 33 and 18 respectively which are close to the volumetrically determined values shown in table 1 the two sided dispersivity exceeds 2 cm indicating that preferential flow and scale dependent dispersal likely occur at the two sites site no 2 is more dispersive than site no 9 due to sediment heterogeneity 3 8 water fluctuation in sandbox the equation for radial flow into an unconfined aquifer with uniform recharge is 78 10 h 0 2 h 2 w 2 k r 2 r 0 2 q w πk ln r 0 r where k is the hydraulic conductivity q w is the well discharge h 0 is the thickness of the aquifer at the radius outside the influence zone h is the thickness of the aquifer at the pumping well r 0 and r are the influence radius of the pumping well and pumping well radius since there is no groundwater recharge around the sand box the radius of influence is only a function of the well pumping power and recharge rate fig 7 shows the results of measuring water fluctuations in the water pipe and the observation pipe to ensure water flow from the corner of the sandbox to the pipe for unconfined aquifers the drawdown at any moment of time is straightforward proportional to the pumping speed and inversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity of the underground stratum 72 it is clear that the amount of drawdown in the water pipe and observation pipes at site no 2 is less than site no 9 which implies that the sediments in site no 2 are more permeable and as a result in the same constant head the recharge rate in site no 2 is more than site no 9 3 9 treatment of contaminated groundwater in the final stage the ability of clinoptilolite to remove lead and treat contaminated groundwater was evaluated in batch experiments and sandbox models and the results are shown in table 5 as shown in fig 8 based on this study in batch and sandbox model experiments the treated groundwater had lower concentrations of lead than the contaminated groundwater at two locations and clinoptilolite successfully absorbed lead from the contaminated groundwater on the other hand in the sandbox model the lead removal efficiency of clinoptilolite from contaminated groundwater is lower than in the batch experiments due to the shorter contact time table 6 shows the concentration of some metals in real groundwater before and after treatment which their amounts have changed during the treatment process according to table 1 after treatment lead and strontium concentration were decreased while the concentration of potassium sodium magnesium and calcium were increased which implies that adsorption and ion exchange were occurred these are two main properties of clinoptilolite due to reactive surfaces presence of al3 on adsorption sites with a si4 ion resides and the micro pores crystalline system 79 based on previous studies 80 82 synthetic zeolites have higher adsorption capacities compared to natural zeolites and are proposed as suitable materials for potential practical applications especially for the removal of lead from wastewater therefore the use of synthetic zeolites as a gravel pack in water wells will be a subject of future research 4 conclusion the feasibility of using clinoptilolite as an adsorbent to remove lead from polluted groundwater in the fashafuye plain was investigated in this study as a small sandbox model the investigated sorbent is natural clinoptilolite which contains gypsum and halite as impurities and based on xrd and xrf data pattern it is high in sodium na based on bet the surface area and mean value pore size of clinoptilolite is 38 85 m2 g and 17 969 nm respectively because of ph variations in fashafuye plain simple clinoptilolite was carried out for lead sorption with various concentrations 1 1 5 3 5 6 8 5 10 and 12 5 mg l at ph 6 7 and 8 with increasing ph decreasing the amount of adsorption reaching the mean maximum lead sorption to 84 2 obtained within 90 min at ph 6 and 298 k as the temperature was enhanced from 298 k to 328 k lead adsorption onto the clinoptilolite proliferated from 93 2 to 96 3 the adsorption volume amount grow quickly from 45 86 to 47 4 mg g the highest removal efficiency of approximately 96 3 was found with clinoptilolite dose of 0 05 g at ph 6 and 328 k within 90 min the adsorption mechanism was discussed using the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the freundlich isotherm model best describes lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite and shows that lead molecules are adsorbed in multi layers on the inhomogeneous surface of clinoptilolite the adsorption kinetics experiments showed the outset rapid up to 30 min and the sorption capacity amount growth from 38 7 to 42 7 mg g the equilibrium was achieved after 100 150 min of stirring while the adsorption kinetics remained constant the pseudo 2nd order kinetic model fits the empirical data points well indicating that the speed of adsorption is relying on absorbent capacity and it is independent of lead concentration negative gibbs values for free energy δg at all temperatures imply that the adsorption of lead onto clinoptilolite is a spontaneous nature mechanism based on breakthrough curves which obtain from column tracer tests in sites no 2 and no 9 and simulation them by the cxtfit code in standmod software effective porosity of sites no 2 and no 9 is calculated 33 and 18 respectively and values of dispersivity of sites no 2 and no 9 are 90 3 and 10 cm which declare that some privileged flow and scale dependent dispersion may occur at both locations and due to sediment heterogeneity the dispersivity in site no 2 is larger than site no 9 in sand box model experiments the amount of drawdown in site no 2 in comparison to site no 9 is lower than which this is due the fact that the sediments in site no 2 are more permeable and as a result in the same constant head the recharge rate in site no 2 is more than site no 9 the treated groundwater in batch experiment and sand box model had less concentration of lead on two sites than polluted groundwater the uptake efficiency in batch experiments and sand box models was found more than 85 and 25 respectively implying that clinoptilolite was successful in absorbing lead from polluted ground water and in sand box model due to shorter contact time clinoptilolite efficiency to removal lead from polluted groundwater is less than batch experiment finally this study demonstrates the feasibility of exerting clinoptilolite as a gravel pack in water wells as a novel in situ groundwater remediation method it is proposed that future studies examine the possibility of applying modified zeolites as gravel

12579,in this study clinoptilolite was used in batch and sand box model experiments to investigate the uptake efficiency of lead from contaminated groundwater in fashafuye plain surface properties structure and composition of adsorbent were investigated using xrf xrd sem and bet based on bet clinoptilolite has a surface area of 38 8 m2 g and mean value pore size of 17 97 nm on account of the ph variability in the fashafuye plain batch testing was conducted in ph 6 7 and 8 with various concentrations 1 1 5 3 5 6 8 5 10 and 12 5 mg l the maximum uptake efficiency 96 3 was obtained with clinoptilolite dose of 0 05 g ph 6 at 328 k within 90 min corresponding to 47 4 mg g of adsorption capacity the freundlich isotherm was used to predict multilayer lead adsorption on the heterogeneous area of clinoptilolite the desirable kinetic model for clinoptilolite is the pseudo 2nd order equation the thermodynamic parameters showed that lead adsorption on clinoptilolite were endothermic and spontaneous based on column tracer tests the values of dispersivity were calculated 90 3 and 10 cm for site no 2 and no 9 respectively indicating some preferential flow and scale dependent dispersion the amount of drawdown in sand box model experiments is lower in site no 2 than in site no 9 which is due to sediment permeability the real contaminated groundwater tests showed that clinoptilolite was successful in absorbing lead from polluted groundwater and removal efficiency in batch experiments and sand box models were more than 85 and 25 respectively due to shorter contact time in sand box

groundwater the most valuable natural resource in arid and semi arid countries is not only the most important natural resource but also has a significant impact on the ecosystems of these countries 1 2 groundwater supplies nearly half of the world water resources for drinking about 40 of the world water used for irrigation and about one third of the water needed for industry and manufacturing apart from maintaining aquatic ecosystems groundwater plays an important role in adaptation to climate change 3 over the past three decades human activity and climate change have led to increased water scarcity and unavailability of surface water this not only increases the imposed pressure and dependence on groundwater but also poses a significant threat to groundwater quality becoming a global problem with enormous impacts on human health and ecosystem services 4 5 a huge kind of substances along with artificial natural chemicals inorganic cations hydrocarbons inorganic anions radionuclides pathogens and different rising contaminants were indicated as contaminants discovered in groundwater 6 due to human and natural activities distinct kinds of contaminants might also additionally reach groundwater 7 recent research in numerous components of the arena have targeted on infection of groundwater assets with poisonous metals along with lead 8 lead as a ubiquitous environmental toxin able to inflicting several acute and persistent circulatory neurological hematological gastrointestinal reproductive and immunological pathologies 9 although in current decades tremendously a hit and complicated strategies were evolved for the remediation of wastewaters in current years groundwater remedy has been turn out to be critical for scientists and environmental researchers 10 11 ex situ and in situ processes are essential kinds for water and soil remediation and in terms of groundwater remediation due to the fact of high price of excavation and publicity of excavators to negative fitness dangers of contaminants in ex situ approach in situ strategies turn out to be greater favorable 12 several strategies along with pump and treat permeable reactive substances in situ flashing and bioremediation exist for groundwater remediation but the remediation approach is chosen primarily based totally at the characteristic site contaminant conditions remedial time price and favored cleanup levels 13 reactive materials are chosen for in situ groundwater remediation technologies based on some characteristics such as reactivity stability cost and availability 7 14 there are a wide range of reactive materials that have been used in groundwater remediation including zerovalent iron zvi activated carbon zeolites peat and other reactive materials 15 16 zeolite an aluminosilicate mineral with cage like structures has been used for the removal of lead from polluted groundwater level as a consequence of its high surface area reactivity hydraulic conductivity less fouling and clogging environmental compatibility and commercial and industrial applications 17 18 clinoptilolite the most prevalent and regular type of natural zeolite for commercial and industrial use is used as a reactive material to reduce toxic pollutants such as lead from contaminated water 19 20 and contaminated groundwater 21 22 to date the large number of different studies have been investigated the removal lead from aqueous solutions using clinoptilolite natural and synthetic 19 23 several studied reported excellent efficiencies of natural clinoptilolite in removal of lead from contaminated water 20 24 due to process simplicity relatively inexpensive and easy of maintenance natural zeolites have been used to removal lead from aqueous solutions in batch experiments 24 however natural and synthetic adsorbents have their own advantages and disadvantages in the field of synthetic adsorbents oxide compounds in comparison with alloys compounds are more resistance to the aggressive influence of environmental factors such as temperature oxygen and electromagnetic radiation and also they are much more stable when used up to 1000 c in recent years oxide compounds such as the complex iron oxides called as the ferrites have attracted more and more attention due to their high adsorption capacities special super paramagnetic properties and surface area to volume ration 25 recently attention increasingly has been concentrated on advanced catalytic oxidation methods in the field of wastewater treatment 26 and microwave technology improves their efficiency and decreases investment and operation costs of these methods 27 commonly most materials in wastewater are unable to absorb microwave directly while some materials such as complex oxide compounds can easily absorb and transfer microwave energy to the matters in wastewater 28 and these abilities have caused them to use as a microwave absorption the synthesis methods are crucial to produce high quality oxide compounds with regard to purity morphology surface area and stability the main categories of oxide compounds synthesis methods are bottom up and top down approaches 29 in the bottom up approach the ions are chemically united together to form the particles but in top down approach materials are reduced to fine particles 25 the various synthesis techniques for bottom up option are thermal decomposition co precipitation solvothermal hydrothermal sol gel sonochemical flame spray pyrolysis microwave assisted vapor deposition polyol techniques microemulsion while only the mechanical milling techniques and pulsed laser ablation are usual for the top down approach 30 groundwater remediation can be achieved by adsorption ion exchange abiotic reduction biotic reduction chemical precipitation and or groundwater remediation through two or more of these mechanisms 7 31 the removal of lead from wastewater using electro active adsorption and biological processes is highly efficient 32 33 lead removal by natural zeolite is an efficient process that involves binding to residual negative charges on the zeolite as well as exchanging ions with na k ca2 and mg2 34 the fashafuye aquifer is a significant provenance of water for the area around tehran and it helps to meet the water needs of many people in the region the aquifer is unconfined and it has been contaminated by lead based on water sample collection based on the presence of high quality 75 95 wt clinoptilolite crystals in iran 35 and the distribution of contamination over the fashafuye aquifer it is suggested that clinoptilolite will be used to remove lead from groundwater in water wells in regard to this point transform raw or waste water sources into products that are useful to society batch experiments and fixed bed column studies 8 were conducted the study found that clinoptilolite can be used to remove lead from the contaminated groundwater as a continuation of the previous work 8 in this survey for the first time a sand box model was designed and the feasibility of using clinoptilolite as a gravel pack in water wells to removal lead from contaminated groundwater as an in situ remediation method was evaluated the main advantage of this approach is that the contaminant is managed under the ground without needing to physically move the contaminated groundwater moreover time saving easy to use and relatively inexpensive make it more favorable our hope is that this research will be continued up to achieve a desired result and its outcome will be used practically in water supply in any place in the world with lead pollution problems 2 material and methods 2 1 location and hydro geological settings the fashafuye plain is located about 50 km southwest of tehran the capital of iran fig 1s based on groundwater prospecting studies the sediments in the northern part of the fashafuye plain are composed of coarse sand and silt with a thickness of over 150 m from north to south the particle size of sediments diminishes and in the outlet of the plain sedimentary particles silt and a small clay containing saline water with thickness less than 75 m the axis of deposition in this plain is corresponded to the bottom line of the plain and thickness of alluvial sediments is decreased from the center of the plain towards heights 36 to measure the lead concentration in the fashafuye plain 11 water samples were collected from water wells at different depths 50 150 m in july 2021 the amount of lead at 11 sites in this plain ranged from 0 08 to 0 25 mg

the samples were rinsed with instilled water and the xrd analysis was replicated multi point brunauer emmett teller bet analysis was used nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were performed on the n2 adsorption desorption affinity belsorp miniii bel japan calculate the specific surface area and investigate the accessible void porosity of clinoptilolite 2 4 lead adsorption tests to study lead adsorption on clinoptilolite the adsorbent was crushed and sifted to a grain size of 0 6 0 8 mm due to the ph variability of the fashafuye plain sorption studies were performed at ph 3 6 7 8 and 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh standard solutions were used to regulate the ph of the solutions the influence of initial lead concentration on a constant sorbent 50 mg was investigated using lead solutions of varying concentrations 1 1 5 3 5 6 8 5 10 and 12 5 mg l in kinetic experiments the contact time varied between 0 and 150 min and in thermodynamic studies 50 mg clinoptilolite was added to 50 ml lead solutions at ph 6 to a starting concentration of 50 mg l the impression of temperature on the adsorption of lead to clinoptilolite was observed at temperatures of 298 k 25 c 308 k 35 c 318 k 45 c and 328 k 55 c was evaluated using an initial lead concentration of 50 mg l the fixed nominal dose of adsorbent is 50 mg and ph 6 all lead sorption tests were performed in 100 ml transparent beakers containing 50 ml lead solution of the desired concentration and sorbent it is recommended to run using dose the mixture was stirred at 160 rpm for 90 150 min on a temperature controlled shaker clinoptilolite was separated from the ionic metal solution using a laboratory centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 120 s after reaching adsorption equilibrium the difference between the initial lead concentration and the equilibrium lead content was used to calculate the amount of lead ions adsorbed on clinoptilolite removal efficiencies percent and adsorption capacities q e were estimated using the downward equations eqs 1 and 2 1 removal c i c e c i 100 2 q t q e c i c e v w where q e is the quantity of lead adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent mg of lead adsorbed g of adsorbent q t is the

groundwater sample was taken from the fashafuye plain southwest of tehran iran and 200 mg of sorbent was mixed with 200 ml of contaminated groundwater at true ph it was stirred at 160 rpm for 2 h at 24 c after which the mixture was centrifuged and the final solution analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 2 5 recycling tests in order to investigate the recycling of clinoptilolite successive adsorption desorption cycle was carried out for eight trials first clinoptilolites were washed gently by 1 m kcl to remove the desorbed lead from their surface then they were rinsed with deionized water to remove any residual kcl and after that dried at 80 c finally the recycled clinoptilolites were exposed to lead solution for performance evaluation 2 6 the sand box and column sediments we first determined the particle size of the material representative of the aquifer materials at site no 2 and no 9 in this study and the results are shown in fig 1 at site no 2 the grain size of the aquifer material is greater than 0 1 mm and less than 6 mm and at site no 9 the grain size of the aquifer material is between 0 01 mm and 4 mm based on these curves at site no 2 the 38 5 cm bottom of the sandbox is filled with aquifer materials with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 6 mm and at site no 9 the 38 5 cm bottom of the sandbox is filled with aquifer materials with 0 1 1 mm particles as shown in fig 1 based on laboratory work some physical parameters of clinoptilolite and sediments from its two sites used in this study are shown in table 1 a filter pack or gravel pack is a borehole filter that consists of coarse sand or gravel around a water pipe to prevent the entrance of sand to water pipe in water wells 39 in this study based on johnson s filter pack design criteria 39 the particle size of clinoptilolite used as gravel packs in sandpit models at sites no 2 and no 9 was 4d15 aquifer materials at these sites the particle size of clinoptilolite is 0 8 1 mm at site no 9 and 1 2 mm at site no 2 in the column test at sites no 2 and no 9 the column was filled with air dried sediment and its gradient curve was shown in fig 1 to establish a perfect chemical balance between water and sediment the sediment and clinoptilolite were washed with tap water before the experiment 2 7 construction sandbox model and column to evaluate the ability of clinoptilolite a sandbox model was constructed to remove lead from polluted groundwater and a column experiment were conducted to investigate dispersion phenomena at two sites nos 2 and 9 most sandbox models and column instruments are generally manufactured of materials that are inactive to many organic and not organic trace contaminants 40 42 therefore in this study according to previous works the sandbox model and column were made of plexiglas the basic body of the sandbox model is a rectangular sandbox with outer dimensions of 43 cm in height and 22 cm in length and width and inner dimensions of 42 2 cm in height and 20 4 cm in length and width there is a valve in the middle of the bottom of the sandbox to control the output of the sandbox model inside the model is a perforated plexiglas tube with a hole diameter of 0 7 mm an exterior diameter of 2 5 cm an interior diameter of 2 1 cm and a height of 42 cm as a water pipe and another plexiglas tube with an outer diameter of 10 cm an inner diameter of 9 2 cm and a height of 42 cm as casing and screen installed around it and the bottom 39 cm has a 0 7 mm diameter pore to measure the water level in a sandbox two perforated plexiglas tubes with an external diameter of 1 cm an internal diameter of 0 6 cm and a height of 42 cm were placed at a radius of 8 cm from the center and their bottoms attached to the sand box 33 cm has a 0 7 mm diameter pore as an observation well fig 2 contaminated groundwater was moved from around to the center in the sandbox and a constant pressure column apparatus was used to maintain flow consistency in this regard a hole at a distance of 2 5 cm from the top of the sandbox was embedded the space between the water pipe and the screen was filled with clinoptilolite and the lower 38 5 cm of the model was filled with sediments from two selected locations leaving a 1 5 cm thick water layer was kept constant on top of it column tests used columns with 34 mm id 4 cm od and 15 cm lengths to ensure that the column was saturated the solution was transferred from the bottom of the column to the top up flow mode it is recommended using the constant head method to measure hydraulic conductivity and maintain flow consistency in column experiments 2 8 breakthrough curve experiment in this study ec was used as a tracer because of the weak interaction between dissolved k and aquifer materials 43 in this context a kcl solution 0 025 mg l ec 2000 μs cm was prepared and used for tracer tests the amount of ec in the influent and effluent was measured at predetermined time intervals using a microprocessor based model 7021 waterproof conductivity temperature tester in column transport experiments once stable flow rates of 10 and 1 ml min were achieved at sites no 2 and no 9 respectively a breakthrough experiment was performed by continuously injecting kcl solution and once the ec amount in the effluent was exceeded to 85 the influent the experiment was terminated 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization based on xrf analysis the si al atomic ratio of the zeolite sample was 6 85 according to a study by breck and sieves 44 this is the zeolite clinoptilolite and the primary oxides in the tested samples are sio2 and al2o3 followed by na2o k2o and cl which are more common than other oxides according to xrd the main minerals in clinoptilolite zeolite before washing are clinoptilolite salt gypsum quartz and cristobalite after washing the main minerals are clinoptilolite cristobalite quartz and gypsum appear as trace elements and the salt disappears 8 electron beam methods especially sem have wide application in the characterization of different types of zeolites and can provide structural morphological and chemical data down to the atomic level 45 fesem images of the zeolites revealed a blocky structure with small pores of 0 22 0 76 nm providing a surface for adsorption corresponding to eds analysis the ruling substitutable cations in the clinoptilolite structure are na and k 8 bet analysis is used to determine exact micro porous volumes in hierarchical zeolites and to fully understand the structural characteristics of zeolites 46 those zeolites which have a high surface area and are porous in nature are better adsorbents 47 based on bet and laboratory experiments clinoptilolite has a surface area of 38 85 m2 g and mean value pore size of 17 97 nm which means that is sponge like and can efficiently absorb lead mobile absorbency connects to the receptiveness of a rock or sediment that is momentous for solute transport and can boost fluid flow through the sediment or rock 48 laboratory experiments show that the analyzed sample has a total porosity of 65 5 and a mobile porosity of 20 8 3 2 influence of key factors on adsorption in this survey we researched the effects of temperature initial concentration ph adsorbent dosage and contact time on the sorbent removal efficiency according to previous studies 19 49 the adsorption of lead on clinoptilolite is an endothermic reaction and the lead adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature according to our previous work 8 when the temperature was enhanced from 298 k to 328 k the adsorption of pb ii on the clinoptilolite proliferated from 93 2 to 96 3 the adsorption volume amount grow quickly from 45 9 to 47 4 mg g acknowledging that it is an endothermic reaction and the maximal adsorption was measured at 328 k 55 c they also showed that the removal decreases with increasing starting lead concentration as the starting concentration increases the adsorption volume declines because more exchange sites are saturated 23 the ph is another important variable that affecting lead sorption in clinoptilolite and because of adsorption and cation exchange the uptake of lead from aqueous solutions on natural zeolites is a complex process and at higher initial lead concentrations could be accompanied by precipitation 50 the effect of ph 6 7 and 8 on the lead adsorption onto under investigated clinoptilolite was conducted in our previous work that level of adsorption decreased with increasing ph and the higher lead uptake was achieved at ph 6 8 according to previous studies 19 51 as the adsorbent mass increases more exchangeable sites are available and the uptake increases in this study the adsorbent dosage was varied from 25 to 75 mg and removal efficiency was ranged from 87 to almost 100 gunay and his colleagues 23 showed that lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite reached to a maximum after approximately 60 120 min and continued unchanged thereafter in this study the contact time was varied from 0 to 150 min and the sorption volume values ranged from 38 7 to 45 96 mg g the adsorption kinetics of clinoptilolite was at the outset rapid up to 30 min the sorption capacity amount growth from 38 7 to 42 7 mg g reaching equilibrium after 100 150 min of stirring and the adsorption kinetics remained constant however the contact time was longer table 2 compares the results of lead adsorption onto natural clinoptilolite in this survey with other studies it shows that the iranian natural clinoptilolite adsorption capacity is near to south african natural clinoptilolite and it is higher than syrian and kazakh natural clinoptilolite it is recommended that the contact time plays a vital role in the lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite the effect of contact time on lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite was investigated by several researchers and they reported the maximum uptake efficiency 98 to 99 8 within 82 87 to 90 min contact time for lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite 19 52 53 in this survey the contact time for lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite was obtained 90 min fig 5s 3 3 equilibrium research in contemplation of research the equivalence functions of clinoptilolite lead adsorption freundlich 56 and langmuir 57 isotherm models have been used and their parameters have been calculated through linear shape in their equations the langmuir isotherm may be indicated in lineal shape eq 3 57 as follows 3 c e q e 1 q m b c e q m where q e is the equilibrium amount of lead adsorbed in step with mass of adsorbent mg g q m is the adsorbent most uptake capacity mg g c e is the amount of adsorbent within the solution mg g and b is the langmuir steady associated with adsorption energy the constants in eq 6 have been decided through draw a linear graph among 1 q e and 1 c e which the slope of the graph offers us possibility to calculate k 1 and q m can decided through the intersection of the plot among 1 q e and 1 c e based on langmuir model consequences the separation factor r l 58 was equaled to 0 01 indicating a favorable adsorption implying that the langmuir pattern isotherm was not the foremost defined for their sorption data fig 3 when adsorbent surfaces are heterogeneous and answers are low in attention freundlich isotherms are used the linear shape of the freundlich adsorption isotherm equation eq 4 is as follows 59 4 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e the isotherm constants 1 n and kf changed into calculated through the slope and intercept of the linear graph between ln q e and ln c e the value of r2 in the freundlich isotherm transformation for lead adsorption on under investigated clinoptilolite is close to 1 indicating a heterogeneous sorption mechanism for multilayer lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite moreover due to the fact 1 n is much less than one it is viable to finish that it is able to effectively imbibe lead ii over a large concentration range 8 3 4 kinetic studies kinetic pattern pseudo 1st order and pseudo 2nd order were used to figure out the clinoptilolite performance and study the adsorption mass transfer mechanism pseudo 1st order for the linear version of the dynamic model and pseudo 2nd orders eqs 5 6 60 61 are 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 6 t q t 1 k q e 2 t q e where q t and q e are the equilibrium values of adsorbed lead per mass of clinoptilolite at any time t min k 1 l min is the first order rate constant for adsorption and k g mg min is the rate constant for the pseudo 2nd model fig 4 affirms the result of time on the adsorption of lead onto clinoptilolite this illustrates that the adsorption of lead onto clinoptilolite is a time affiliate procedure in well agreement with pseudo 2nd order equation this indicates that the adsorption rate depends on the absorption capacity and is independent of lead concentration 62 63 as can be seen from table 3 8 the first order r2 values of the kinetic models are higher than 0 95 on the other hand the coefficient of determination r2 0 999 of the second order kinetic model is very close to 1 and the calculated adsorption capacities q e cal for indicate the high adsorption capacity of clinoptilolite 3 5 thermodynamic research thermodynamic studies are important in determining whether and if adsorption is spontaneous the free energy δg entropy δs and enthalpy δh were estimated using the van t hoff equation 64 65 according to the survey that was carried out by nakhaei and his colleagues 8 the amount of lead adsorbed onto clinoptilolite increases with increasing temperature the enthalpy and entropy change values of under investigated clinoptilolite for a lead concentration of 50 mg l were 17 32 kj mol and 79 71 j mol k respectively the values of δg at temperature 298 308 318 and 328 k were 6 43 7 23 8 03 and 8 82 kj mol respectively indicate that the lead adsorption is spontaneous nature process 8 positive δh values illustrate that lead adsorption by clinoptilolite is endothermic in nature 66 a positive δs value indicates an increment in degrees of freedom and randomness of molecules adsorbed at the solid liquid interface 67 3 6 adsorbent recycling one of the most crucial stages in every remediation method is recycling of the utilized adsorbent 68 in order to determine lead adsorption desorption potential of the clinoptilolite several adsorption desorption cycles were carried out once it had been renewable eight times because of using kcl solution during the first three cycles the lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite was increased fig 5a this is due fact that the removal impurities from channels of the clinoptilolite might cause more lead adsorb onto clinoptilolite in addition because of replacing some ions such as calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 and sodium na with potassium k ions present in renewable solution the adsorbent structure could be modified furthermore the formation of complexes among chlorides and metals could be increased the amount of metal uptake especially during the renewable cycle some chloride cl ions could be entrapped in the channels or cavities of adsorbent and remain there even after washing 69 during the adsorption process these ions could form inner sphere complexes with lead ions and enhance the lead uptake efficiency as it was shown in fig 5b the desorption efficiency decreases with ascending renewable cycles which means that some lead actually remained on the clinoptilolite and therefore in the subsequent adsorption cycles the amount of lead adsorption decreases according to eds analysis fig 4s throughout the adsorption process plenty of lead is captured by natural clinoptilolite while some amount of lead remains in the sample after regeneration 3 7 interpreting column

liquid flow rate cm min and ε is the effective porosity r is the retardation coefficient describing sorption or exchange in linear equilibrium dimensionless and d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 min if diffusion was inconsiderable dispersivity α is characterized as the proportion of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d to the pore water velocity v eq 8 8 α d v dispersity values are traditionally considered a property of the whole medium 71 and are typically of the order of 0 1 2 cm for columns of unpacked uniform soil 72 results from field studies show that dispersivity is scale dependent as a result of the heterogeneous nature of the geological material migration time migration distance and or measurement scales 73 74 and for heterogeneous columns was reported as high as 200 cm 70 the observed breakthrough curves for tracer injection experiments at sites no 2 and no 9 in sandy soil columns are shown in fig 6a b in this study the cxtfit code 75 in the standmod software was used to simulate a resident concentration a third type of inlet solute free feed water constant initial concentration zero production and a steady state semi infinite system to match the experimental data fig 6c d this code allows us to simultaneously fit v and d to the measured btc data 76 the kcl tracer lag r in the column was assumed to be negligible because the sand in the soil column was relatively free of organic matter after estimating v and d from the btc at the column outlet α was calculated using a formula similar to eq 8 and ε was calculated as follows eq 9 77 9 ε q v table 4 shows the standmod convoy test and simulation btc results in this study the effective porosities at sites no 2 and no 9 were calculated to be 33 and 18 respectively which are close to the volumetrically determined values shown in table 1 the two sided dispersivity exceeds 2 cm indicating that preferential flow and scale dependent dispersal likely occur at the two sites site no 2 is more dispersive than site no 9 due to sediment heterogeneity 3 8 water fluctuation in sandbox the equation for radial flow into an unconfined aquifer with uniform recharge is 78 10 h 0 2 h 2 w 2 k r 2 r 0 2 q w πk ln r 0 r where k is the hydraulic conductivity q w is the well discharge h 0 is the thickness of the aquifer at the radius outside the influence zone h is the thickness of the aquifer at the pumping well r 0 and r are the influence radius of the pumping well and pumping well radius since there is no groundwater recharge around the sand box the radius of influence is only a function of the well pumping power and recharge rate fig 7 shows the results of measuring water fluctuations in the water pipe and the observation pipe to ensure water flow from the corner of the sandbox to the pipe for unconfined aquifers the drawdown at any moment of time is straightforward proportional to the pumping speed and inversely proportional to the hydraulic conductivity of the underground stratum 72 it is clear that the amount of drawdown in the water pipe and observation pipes at site no 2 is less than site no 9 which implies that the sediments in site no 2 are more permeable and as a result in the same constant head the recharge rate in site no 2 is more than site no 9 3 9 treatment of contaminated groundwater in the final stage the ability of clinoptilolite to remove lead and treat contaminated groundwater was evaluated in batch experiments and sandbox models and the results are shown in table 5 as shown in fig 8 based on this study in batch and sandbox model experiments the treated groundwater had lower concentrations of lead than the contaminated groundwater at two locations and clinoptilolite successfully absorbed lead from the contaminated groundwater on the other hand in the sandbox model the lead removal efficiency of clinoptilolite from contaminated groundwater is lower than in the batch experiments due to the shorter contact time table 6 shows the concentration of some metals in real groundwater before and after treatment which their amounts have changed during the treatment process according to table 1 after treatment lead and strontium concentration were decreased while the concentration of potassium sodium magnesium and calcium were increased which implies that adsorption and ion exchange were occurred these are two main properties of clinoptilolite due to reactive surfaces presence of al3 on adsorption sites with a si4 ion resides and the micro pores crystalline system 79 based on previous studies 80 82 synthetic zeolites have higher adsorption capacities compared to natural zeolites and are proposed as suitable materials for potential practical applications especially for the removal of lead from wastewater therefore the use of synthetic zeolites as a gravel pack in water wells will be a subject of future research 4 conclusion the feasibility of using clinoptilolite as an adsorbent to remove lead from polluted groundwater in the fashafuye plain was investigated in this study as a small sandbox model the investigated sorbent is natural clinoptilolite which contains gypsum and halite as impurities and based on xrd and xrf data pattern it is high in sodium na based on bet the surface area and mean value pore size of clinoptilolite is 38 85 m2 g and 17 969 nm respectively because of ph variations in fashafuye plain simple clinoptilolite was carried out for lead sorption with various concentrations 1 1 5 3 5 6 8 5 10 and 12 5 mg l at ph 6 7 and 8 with increasing ph decreasing the amount of adsorption reaching the mean maximum lead sorption to 84 2 obtained within 90 min at ph 6 and 298 k as the temperature was enhanced from 298 k to 328 k lead adsorption onto the clinoptilolite proliferated from 93 2 to 96 3 the adsorption volume amount grow quickly from 45 86 to 47 4 mg g the highest removal efficiency of approximately 96 3 was found with clinoptilolite dose of 0 05 g at ph 6 and 328 k within 90 min the adsorption mechanism was discussed using the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the freundlich isotherm model best describes lead adsorption onto clinoptilolite and shows that lead molecules are adsorbed in multi layers on the inhomogeneous surface of clinoptilolite the adsorption kinetics experiments showed the outset rapid up to 30 min and the sorption capacity amount growth from 38 7 to 42 7 mg g the equilibrium was achieved after 100 150 min of stirring while the adsorption kinetics remained constant the pseudo 2nd order kinetic model fits the empirical data points well indicating that the speed of adsorption is relying on absorbent capacity and it is independent of lead concentration negative gibbs values for free energy δg at all temperatures imply that the adsorption of lead onto clinoptilolite is a spontaneous nature mechanism based on breakthrough curves which obtain from column tracer tests in sites no 2 and no 9 and simulation them by the cxtfit code in standmod software effective porosity of sites no 2 and no 9 is calculated 33 and 18 respectively and values of dispersivity of sites no 2 and no 9 are 90 3 and 10 cm which declare that some privileged flow and scale dependent dispersion may occur at both locations and due to sediment heterogeneity the dispersivity in site no 2 is larger than site no 9 in sand box model experiments the amount of drawdown in site no 2 in comparison to site no 9 is lower than which this is due the fact that the sediments in site no 2 are more permeable and as a result in the same constant head the recharge rate in site no 2 is more than site no 9 the treated groundwater in batch experiment and sand box model had less concentration of lead on two sites than polluted groundwater the uptake efficiency in batch experiments and sand box models was found more than 85 and 25 respectively implying that clinoptilolite was successful in absorbing lead from polluted ground water and in sand box model due to shorter contact time clinoptilolite efficiency to removal lead from polluted groundwater is less than batch experiment finally this study demonstrates the feasibility of exerting clinoptilolite as a gravel pack in water wells as a novel in situ groundwater remediation method it is proposed that future studies examine the possibility of applying modified zeolites as gravel packing in water wells to remove heavy metals from polluted groundwater funding the financial support of this research was received from vice presidency for science and technology islamic republic of
