17190,the rapid and efficient degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah derivatives with toxicological properties remains a substantial challenge in this study a cost effective and eco friendly catalyst nano moo2 0 05 g l 1 exhibited excellent performance in activating 4 0 mmol l 1 peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of naphthalene derivatives with 1 mg l 1 in aqueous systems these derivatives include 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene 1 naphthylamine and 1 naphthol with high degradation rates of 87 52 86 23 97 87 99 74 and 77 16 nano moo2 acts as an electron donor by transferring an electron causing o o bond of pms to cleave producing so4 and later oh electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis combined with free radical quenching research indicated that so4 and oh dominated the degradation of naphthalene derivatives and o2 and 1o2 participated in the processes x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps revealed the transformation of mo iv to mo v and mo vi which suggested that the activation process proceeded via electron transfer from nano moo2 to pms the applicability of the nano moo2 pms system in influencing parameters and stability was explored the degradation pathways were primarily elucidated for each naphthalene derivative based on the intermediates identified in the systems the ch3 no2 cl oh substituents increased the positive electrostatic potential esp on the molecular surface of 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene and 1 naphthol which reduced the electrophilic reaction and electron transfer between the reactive species and pollutants leading to a lower degradation rate of naphthalene derivatives than the parent compound however the effect of nh2 substituents is the opposite these findings suggest that nano moo2 may aid as a novel catalyst in the future remediation of environments polluted with pah derivatives graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nano moo2 peroxymonosulfate activation pah derivatives reactive species degradation 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah derivatives methyl nitrogen chlorine and hydroxyl containing pahs are compounds that incorporate substituted groups into the molecular structure of the parent pahs they arise from the incomplete combustion of carbon containing compounds and by chemical and microbial transformation of parent pahs kojima et al 2010 qiao et al 2016 these pollutants are widely present and more persistent in the aquatic environment because of their high polarity they are more carcinogenic mutagenic and estrogenic and can accumulate in sediments then migrate and transform in the water ranjbar jafarabadi et al 2019 trine et al 2019 the concentration of pah derivatives in the aquatic environment range from not detected to µg l 1 kong et al 2021 alkylated pahs have light induced genotoxicity and metabolic toxicity in aquatic organisms kang et al 2016 the concentration of nitro pahs in taihu lake can reach 212 ng l 1 and the carcinogenic risk level ranged from 2 09 10 7 to 5 75 10 5 kong et al 2021 the content of halogenated pahs with high lipophilicity in the sediments of the pearl river estuary reached 1 4 ng g 1 to 40 9 ng g 1 and was also detected in drinking water yuan et al 2020 thus frequently exposing humans and wildlife naphthylamines have high toxicity and carcinogenicity and are widespread in wastewater they pose risks to aquatic ecosystems and lower dissolved oxygen wang et al 2019b hydroxy pahs are widely present in printing and dyeing wastewater and are linked to health complications such as cancer nephritis and hemolysis rebekah et al 2020 in summary previous studies on pah derivatives have focused on their conversion content and toxicity on human beings and the environment however there is a need to explore the efficient and green remediation of pah derivatives in polluted water the current chemical method for degrading pah derivatives is mainly advanced oxidation processes aops it s advantageous because of high efficiency and limited amount of secondary pollution sun et al 2019 aops usually include ozonation chlorine oxidation fenton fenton like oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and persulfate including peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds oxidation ao et al 2021 however most of aops have studied the degradation of a single pah derivative das et al 2020 the degradation of derivatives with different substituents on the same parent is still unclear the oxidation processes in the aquatic environment are based on oh because of high oxidation potential e oh 2 8v ghanbari and moradi 2017 however in complex water substrates containing oh scavengers such as inorganic anions and natural organics the efficiency of aops may be limited and oh t1 2 20 ns have a short half life therefore in recent years employing reactive substances with higher selectivity and wide half life such as so4 e so4 2 5 3 1v t1 2 30 40 μs have received increased attention ghanbari and moradi 2017 pms is preferentially selected as an oxidant because it is easier to activate because of its asymmetric structure ho o so3 and superoxide o o bond io o 1 326 å guo et al 2020 and the activated final product of pms is so4 2 which is harmless in water persulfate can be activated by heat light and transition metal fe co cu ag etc lee et al 2020 transition metals have the advantages of convenience and outstanding catalytic efficiency as well as their copresence in some polluted waters however most of the current catalyst are limited to several common transition metal compounds and nano molybdenum oxides have not been explored in pms aops furthermore it is the first time to study how to effectively remove various pah derivatives in aqueous systems based on pms aops and explore its mechanism mo containing minerals in nature are mainly molybdenite wulfenite and powellite giussani and nriagu 2011 the mo oxidation states range from mo ii to mo vi and the variable oxidation state allows mo to participate in a large number of redox reactions moreover compared to other transition metals mo is toxicologically harmless and does not have severe health impacts giussani and nriagu 2011 mo is present in rocks and soils at levels between 1 and 10 mg kg 1 and the concentration can exceed 100 mg kg 1 due to wind erosion under strongly reducing conditions near the sea smedley and kinniburgh 2017 moreover the groundwater concentration can reach 25 mg l 1 near mo ore districts giussani and nriagu 2011 mo oxides generally have more advantages than other mo containing compounds from an engineering perspective wei et al 2020 for instance nanomolybdenum dioxide nano moo2 particles have high stability and low solubility and toxicity and are easy to synthesize anh tran et al 2014 song et al 2014 moo2 has been only used as a cocatalyst to promote fe iii fe ii cycling in aops ji et al 2020 shen et al 2019 however to our knowledge the use of moo2 as a catalyst for pms activation in aops is still being explored herein naphthalene derivatives 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene 1 naphthylamine 1 naphthol of environmental concern were selected as model contaminants and their degradation patterns in aqueous solution were primarily investigated by the nano moo2 as an activator and pms as an oxidant system this work has the following objectives a for the first time we use nano moo2 to activate pms for pah derivatives catalytic oxidation b exploring the mechanism of catalysis and degradation c finding the commonality and difference between the degradation rate and pathways of derivative and clarifying the relationship between substituents and degradation those results of this work will provide insights into a new technology for the degradation of pah derivatives as well as an understanding of nano moo2 as a new catalyst for the removal of toxic organic pollutants in aqueous matrices 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals naphthalene and its derivatives all 99 0 peroxymonosulfate 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 hereinafter pms 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 98 0 and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp 99 0 were obtained from sigma aldrich saint louis mo usa nanomolybdenum oxides nano moo2 99 9 nano moo3 99 9 were purchased from shanghai maikun chemical corporation ltd shanghai china tert butyl alcohol tba 98 ethanol etoh 99 8 and mocl5 99 6 all water used was ultrapure water resistance 18 25 mω 2 2 degradation of pah derivatives by the nano moo2 pms system batch experiments were carried out in 40 ml epa glass vials containing 19 ml of 1 mg l 1 selected pah derivatives in each experiment a certain nano moo2 dosage and 1 ml of pms solution was added to the reaction vials to start the reaction at 25 c under 200 r min 1 for 180 min in the dark unless otherwise specified the catalyst and pms dosages were 0 05 g l 1 and 4 0 mmol l 1 respectively the initial solution ph 4 4 10 0 was adjusted with 1 mol l 1 h2so4 or naoh once degradation was initiated 1 ml of the reaction solution was collected from the suspension at given time intervals quenched by 1 ml methanol filtered with a 0 22 µm organic phase filter and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc all degradation experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods the properties analysis of the test pah derivatives and the morphology and character analysis of nano moo2 are shown in the supplementary information si a 1 ml sample of the pah derivatives was removed at specific time and quenched by 1 ml methanol then the sample methanol mixture was filtered with a 0 22 µm filter for hplc agilent 1200 usa equipped with an inertsil c18 column analysis in addition the samples were subjected to solid phase extraction with methanol and they were concentrated under flowing nitrogen and analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms thermo q exactive focus usa to determine the degradation products the detailed detection processes are provided in the si reactive species in the nano moo2 pms system were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance epr elexsys ii germany with 0 1 mol l 1 dmpo as spin trapping agents for so4 oh and o2 and 0 03 mol l 1 temp for 1o2 the epr spectra were read at room temperature using the following conditions a frequency of 9 746 ghz a modulation amplitude of 1 00 g a sweep width of 200 g a microwave power of 19 92 mw a modulation frequency of 100 00 khz and a time constant of 40 96 the relative concentrations of reactive species in the system were represented as peak intensity signals of dmpo x and temp 1o2 and corrected with background noise the calculation of electrostatic potential esp is divided into 4 steps chemoffice 16 0 software was used to draw the original structures of pah derivatives then optimized by gaussian 09 w based on density functional theory dft with the ωb97xd 6 311g basis sets and simultaneously add smd solvation model and then calculated using multiwfn 3 7 software and finally displayed by vmd1 9 3 software lu and manzetti 2014 the specific surface area of pah derivatives was analyzed over different esp ranges by origin 8 5 1 software all the experimental data analyzed by statistical analysis using spssau software the significant level of the data is accepted only when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 catalytic performance of nano moo2 the degradation kinetics of pah derivatives in the nano moo2 pms system are displayed in fig 1 a f the results show that most pah derivatives were not oxidized by pms alone except for 1 naphthylamine and 1 naphthol which showed 100 and 36 degradation respectively by pms in 180 min due to the weak oxidation ability of pms itself li et al 2016 moreover the degradation of naphthalene derivatives was negligible by nano moo2 alone all pah derivatives underwent a great concentration reduction the degradation percentage was 77 and the degradation rate constant k was 0 024 in the nano moo2 pms system in 180 min indicating that pms was activated by nano moo2 in particular the degradation percentages of 1 chloronaphthalene 97 87 and 1 naphthylamine 99 74 in 180 min were similar to that of the parent naphthalene compound 98 17 moreover 1 methylnaphthalene and 1 nitronaphthalene were degraded by more than 85 while the degradation of 1 naphthol was slightly lower approximately 77 a pseudo first order kinetics equation si was used to fit the degradation kinetics fig s2 and the pseudo first order rate constants k are listed in fig 1 g the k values of the naphthalene derivatives were lower than that of the parent naphthalene compound 0 0700 min 1 the k value of 1 chloronaphthalene was 0 0067 min 1 followed by 1 naphthylamine 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene and 1 naphthol with k values of 0 0530 0 0402 0 0356 and 0 0242 min 1 respectively also the results and analysis of the total organic carbon toc concentrations are displayed in the si the loading of the catalyst is a crucial factor in the wastewater treatment process sun et al 2019 the effect of catalyst loading 0 0 5 g l 1 on the degradation of pah derivatives was investigated fig s4 panel a and fig s5 panel a the degradation rate of all pah derivatives was 100 when the nano moo2 does was increased from 0 g l 1 to 0 5 g l 1 except for 1 naphthol which showed only 82 42 degradation most pah derivatives were completely degraded within 5 min at 0 25 0 50 g l 1 nano moo2 the k increased with increasing nano moo2 from 0 05 0 10 g l 1 shown in tab 1 and the k values of naphthalene and 1 chloronaphthalene increased to 0 2086 and 0 2136 respectively which are much higher than those of the other naphthalene derivatives the k value of 1 methylnaphthalene was 0 0681 that of 1 nitronaphthalene was 0 0738 and that of 1 naphthol was 0 1292 the pms concentration is directly related to the production of reactive oxygen species ros sun et al 2019 the influence of the pms concentration 0 12 mmol l 1 on the removal of pah derivatives by nano moo2 pms was investigated fig s4 panel b and fig s5 panel b as the pms concentration increases to 12 mmol l 1 the degradation rate of all pah derivatives is 90 except for 1 naphthol which is 80 the concentration of pms had a positive but limited effect on the degradation of pah derivatives as shown in tab 1 the k values of naphthalene 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene and 1 naphthol gradually increased with the pms concentration from 0 mmol l 1 to 12 mmol l 1 and were 0 0548 0 0280 0 0280 0 0679 and 0 0328 at 12 mmol l 1 pms respectively in addition 1 naphthylamine can be fully degraded within 1 min at high pms concentrations the solution ph affects the heterogeneous pms oxidation systems by affecting the surface characteristics of the catalyst and the generation of radicals ghanbari and moradi 2017 li et al 2019 wang and wang 2018 zheng et al 2019 the degradation trends and kinetic fit of pah derivatives at different ph values are shown in fig s4 panel c and fig s5 panel c the degradation rate of all pah derivatives except for 1 naphthylamine and 1 naphthol decreased significantly to below 50 with increasing ph from 4 4 to 10 0 while that of 1 naphthylamine increased to 100 and that of 1 naphthol remained at 77 the k values of all pah derivatives except for 1 naphthylamine were correspondingly reduced to 0 0076 naphthalene 0 0054 1 methylnaphthalene 0 0014 1 nitronaphthalene 0 0064 1 chloronaphthalene and 0 0074 1 naphthol respectively as shown in tab 1 in addition the initial ph reduced only the reaction rate of 1 naphthol and had little effect on the degradation percentage fig s4 panel c r in contrast 1 naphthylamine was degraded faster and more efficiently with increasing ph values and it was fully degraded in 1 min at ph 10 moreover the influence of temperature is more complicated due to the existence of thermal activation under high temperature conditions and the correlation analysis is shown in si 3 2 identification of reactive species in the nano moo2 pms system in situ epr analysis combined with dmpo was utilized to determine the reactive species in the nano moo2 pms system and the results were shown in fig 2 a f the free radical capture signals dmpo so4 hyperfine coupling constants of αn 13 2 g αh 9 6 g αh 1 48 g and αh 0 78 g and dmpo oh αn αh 14 9 g were clearly visible at 1 10 min in all six degradation systems wang and chen 2015 moreover fig s7 a shows that pms alone did not produce any free radicals thus their occurrence is accounted for by the activation of pms by nano moo2 furthermore so4 gradually decreased with increasing of oh and the peak intensity signal of dmpo oh was significantly higher than that of dmpo so4 to further distinguish their contributions the chemical quenchers ethanol etoh k etoh so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 k etoh oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 for so4 and oh and tert butanol tba k tba so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 k tba oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 for oh were used in quenching experiments with etoh tba pms concentration ratios of 200 and 500 as illustrated in fig 3 both etoh and tba had a detrimental effect on the degradation of pah derivatives except for 1 naphthol which was less inhibited by the quenchers as shown in fig 3 f when the ratio of etoh to pms is 500 the degradation rates of naphthalene 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene and 1 naphthylamine are reduced by 74 57 68 38 86 23 71 42 and 51 74 respectively compared to the control group these values are reduced by 96 40 76 13 81 56 88 66 and 67 59 respectively when the ratio of tba to pms is 500 another reactive species signal of dmpo ooh a combination of o2 and dmpo occurred in the nano moo2 pms system as detected by epr with dmpo and was pronounced as shown in fig 2 g the signal intensity of dmpo ooh is weaker than other reactive species in this system 1o2 was also found and there is a visible temp 1o2 signal peak fig 2 h in the system with temp as a spin trapping agent the temp 1o2 signal peak 1 1 1 α 17 0 g peak intensities of 136 31 142 37 and 142 09 appeared with temp alone see fig s7 c due to oxidation but the peak intensities approximately 206 11 202 05 and 196 89 in the moo2 pms system were obviously increased the ability of o2 0 33 v and 1o2 to induce pah derivative degradation may be limited because of weak oxidation the quenching experiments of so4 and oh suggest that those substantially control the degradation of pah derivatives except for 1 naphthol for 1 naphthol the removal inhibition by the alcohols was incomplete therefore potential reactive species other than so4 and oh are likely to play a role in the degradation process in addition possible secondary reactions induced by e g alcohol derived radicals should be taken into account 3 3 surface investigation and stability of nano moo2 the surface characteristics of nano moo2 were investigated by sem fig s8 and xps fig 4 and the surface was smooth after the reaction with no obvious traces of corrosion and the new deconvoluted peaks of mo v and mo vi were detected by xps the characteristic peaks assigned to c 1s 284 08 ev o 1s 530 08 ev mo 3d 232 08 ev mo 3p3 2 396 08 ev mo 3p1 2 413 08 ev and mo 4p 38 08 ev were monitored in the full xps spectrum the mo 3d high resolution peak could be deconvoluted into six peaks as shown in fig 4 a f and the corresponding binding energies are listed in detail in tab s2 the strong deconvoluted peaks with binding energies of 228 87 and 232 04 ev are mo iv double peaks corresponding to mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 in nano moo2 respectively wang et al 2019a we also found that the deconvoluted peaks representing mo v and mo vi in nano moo2 after pms activation showed binding energies of 230 20 ev mo 3d5 2 and 233 86 ev mo 3d3 2 and of 231 38 ev mo 3d5 2 and 235 00 ev mo 3d3 2 respectively wang et al 2019a moreover the xps spectra of nano moo2 in pah derivative degradation systems were almost the same in addition the leaching of ionic mo at different ph values at the end of the experiments was analyzed by icp oes fig s9 a the leaching amount of mo ions ranged from 15 to 22 mg l 1 and more mo ions would be leached at a low ph pms activation by leached mo ions resulting in concurrent degradation of pah derivatives was conducted the homogeneous phase activation experiments were carried out using 1 mmol l 1 mo v ions due to the low water solubility of commercially available mo iv compounds as shown in fig s9 b the homogeneous mo v pms system was able to induce the degradation of all pah derivatives with the fastest and most complete degradation observed for 1 methylnaphthalene and especially 1 naphthol while only approximately 50 of 1 naphthylamine was degraded the stability of nano moo2 was examined by collecting and reusing it in four consecutive degradation cycles tab 2 the catalytic effects and removal efficiency of the pah derivatives in the 2nd and 3rd uses of nano moo2 gradually deteriorated to below 61 except for those of 1 naphthylamine since it was degraded completely in all cycles however when using nano moo2 in the 4th cycle the catalytic activity was partially recovered and the degradation rate of the pah derivatives was improved by 9 38 4 63 1 48 9 22 and 13 30 for naphthalene 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene and 1 naphthol respectively compared to that in the 3rd cycle 3 4 degradation pathways of pah derivatives the degradation intermediates of the pah derivatives in the nano moo2 pms system were identified by lc ms and the corresponding spectra are given in fig s10 s71 there are 10 intermediates formed from naphthalene 13 from 1 methylnaphthalene 4 from 1 nitronaphthalene 13 from 1 chloronaphthalene 12 from 1 naphthylamine and 10 from 1 naphthol and they are listed in si these intermediates were transformed from redox reactions by reactive species which attack electron rich substituents and or carbon atoms based on the detected intermediates and previously reported results bandowe and meusel 2017 cui et al 2018 huang et al 2016 qian et al 2015 shen et al 2008 so et al 2019 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2006 we propose transformation pathways for each pah derivative as shown in fig 5 some undetected compounds presumably undetected because of low stability in the studied systems which would act as precursors via known transformation pathways are shown in square brackets in the figure panels naphthalene fig 5 a first yielded naphthol a h c i by hydroxylation so et al 2019 then hydroxynaphthalene was transformed into 4 hydroxy 1 naphthoic acid d and 2 hydroxy 1 naphthoic acid m by carbonylation or a hydroformylation like reaction and 2 hydroxy 1 4 naphoquinone g and 4 hydroxy 1 2 naphthoquinone l were formed by oxidation then they were further transformed by ring opening reactions to produce o phthalic anhydride e phthalic acid f carboxyl cinnamaldehydes j acetophenone k and 2 hydroxycinnamic acid n so et al 2019 wang et al 2015 these pathways are also common to most pah derivatives second the hydroxyl group was likely substituted by a methyl group to produce methylnaphthalene and then it was oxidized via electron transfer from so4 and hydroxyl substitution form 4 hydroxy 4 methylnaphthalene 1 4h one b this and other observed transformation pathways proceeded through c atom addition suggesting that oxidation fragmentation pathways likely yielded carbon based radicals in addition to the transient species identified by epr qian et al 2015 the pathway of 1 methylnaphthalene fig 5 b underwent oxidative decarboxylation to form 1 naphthoic acid q and naphthalene r and most degradation processes were similar to that of naphthalene another route was the c on the methyl substituent was attacked by so4 through electron transfer to form organic free radicals which are further oxidized to produce 1 naphthaldehyde o qian et al 2015 additionally ring contraction and hydroxylation processes of naphthalene r yielded hydroquinone p shen et al 2008 the occurrence of reducing transient species such as o2 in the reaction system can account for reduction pathways such as the transformation of 1 2 dihydroxynaphthalene i into 1 2 dihydro 1 2 dihydroxynaphthalene s the degradation pathway of 1 nitronaphthalene is shown in fig 5 c as nitronaphthalene shares several transformation intermediates with naphthylamine see below we speculate that its transformation also involves reduction to 1 naphthylamine although that was not observed here indeed it is easonable to hypothesize that 1 naphthylamine underwent hydroxylated substitution followed by oxidative ring opening to form o phthalic anhydride e and carboxyl cinnamaldehydes j moreover hydroxylation at the ortho and para positions of the nitro functional group would yield 1 nitro 1 2 dihydronaphthalen 2 ol t and 4 hydroxy 1 nitronaphthalene u the degradation pathway of 1 chloronaphthalene shares similarities with the transformation of naphthalene fig 5 d however the oxidation products 1 4 naphthoquinone z and 1 2 naphthoquinone a were detected in this system moreover the para position of 1 chloronaphthalene was hydroxylated to form 4 chloronaphthalene 1 ol v and 4 chloronaphthalene 1 2 diol w and finally underwent ring opening to form e 2 1 chloro 3 oxoprop 1 en 1 yl benzaldehyde x cui et al 2018 furthermore the c on the naphthalene ring was attacked via electron transfer by so4 hydroxide oxygenated and opened to form 2 formylbenzoyl chloride y cui et al 2018 the degradation pathway of 1 naphthylamine is shown in fig 5 e the loss of the nitrogen atom in some intermediates leads us to speculate that substitution hydroxylation might have yielded undetected naphthol zhang et al 2006 which can undergo a conversion process as an intermediate naphthol similar to naphthalene and further undergo oxidation ring fragmentation to produce 2 hydroxycinnamic acid n and then 2z 4z hexa 2 4 dienedioic acid e a parallel reduction process for the intermediate naphthalene followed by ring contraction could yield indene b which could be degraded to 2 butyl 1 4 dimethylbenzene c by methyl substitution and ring opening in addition naphthalene may also first undergo methylation and the c on the methyl substituent was attacked by so4 and then further oxidized to produce 1 naphthylmethanol d qian et al 2015 another degradation pathway of 1 naphthylamine involved the amino functional group which was oxidatively converted to 1 nitrosonaphthalene f and then to 1 nitronaphthalene g the nitro derivative was then hydroxylated and hydrogenated to produce 1 nitro 1 2 dihydronaphthalen 2 ol t the degradation pathway of 1 naphthol is reported in fig 5 f and it is similar to that undergone by 1 naphthol as a common intermediate of the parent naphthalene compound and other derivatives furthermore 1 naphthol was involved in alkylation and ring fragmentation would produce tetramethylbenzene h 4 discussion a very small amount of nano moo2 can have a significant catalytic effect on pms and all pah derivatives can be degraded efficiently the catalytic effect on pah derivatives with substituents was slightly weaker than that on the parent pah except for 1 naphthylamine which had a higher catalytic effect than the parent pah degradation was generally favored by an increase in the nano moo2 loading or pms concentration due to enhanced production of ros an increased nano moo2 loading i e catalytic sites allows for accelerated activation of pms sun et al 2019 and an increased pms concentration can optimize contact with the nano moo2 active sites indrawirawan et al 2015 a possible explanation for the lower degradation of pah derivatives at a higher ph is that the pms acid base equilibrium is dominated by so5 2 which has negligible redox capacity and cannot to be activated by nano moo2 and it leads to reduced electro static interaction between pms and nano moo2 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 furthermore two possible explanations can account for the positive ph effect on 1 naphthylamine i the degradation of 1 naphthylamine occurs to a higher extent upon reaction with so5 2 which prevails under basic conditions and or ii degradation is more difficult in the presence of the protonated substrate 1 naphthylammonium under acidic conditions the dmpo so4 signal occurred in the nano moo2 pms system indicating the efficient activation of pms by nano moo2 and dmpo oh was found to be mainly converted from so4 via a nucleophilic substitution reaction according to eqs 1 and 2 park et al 2018 1 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h 2 so4 oh so4 2 oh the dmpo oh signal increases with time indicating that oh is always produced in the system the dmpo so4 signal has always existed but slightly weakened there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon one is the attenuation of the captured signal dmpo so4 itself and the other may be caused by the conversion between so4 and oh in this system oh and so4 significantly affected the removal of pah derivatives and generally the reaction rate constants of the two free radicals and organics are usually between 108 and 109 mol 1 s 1 however according to the quenching experiment the degradation of 1 naphthol is different from that of the other pah derivatives as shown in fig s72 a ch2ch2oh alcohol radicals were formed in the nano moo2 pms etoh system and can likely explain the observed degradation since they have a high reduction potential 1 39 v to 1 18 v peyton et al 1995 schwarz and dodson 1989 for instance fang et al reported that tba radicals reductively degrade pcbs that are otherwise difficult to degrade fang et al 2017 as shown in fig s72 b compared to the system without alcohol only oh was significantly reduced in the nano moo2 pms tba system this result is consistent with the tba reaction rate with oh being higher than that with so4 the fact that tba did not affect the degradation of 1 naphthol suggests that 1 naphthol might be mainly degraded by the reaction with so4 in the nano moo2 pms system both o2 and 1o2 occurred in the nano moo2 pms system and were likely generated by the following chemical eqs 3 7 duan et al 2018 3 hso5 h2o h2o2 hso4 4 h2o2 2 oh 5 oh h2o2 ho2 h2o 6 ho2 h o2 7 2o2 2h h2o2 1o2 however quenching experiments with etoh and tba indicate that reactive species different from oh and so4 have extremely limited effects on the removal of pah derivatives after the reaction the surface of nano moo2 shows that it can further contact the reactant with the largest contact area to act as a catalyst the double peaks of mo v and mo vi that appeared in the xps spectra of the reacted nano moo2 can be accounted for by oxidation reactions on the surface of nano moo2 zhuang et al 2019 mo iv activates pms by transferring electrons followed by transformation into mo v and mo vi according to eqs 8 9 8 mo ⅳ hso5 mo ⅴ so4 oh 9 mo ⅴ hso5 mo ⅵ so4 oh this process is depicted in fig 6 a similar activation process has also been described in other systems such as fe2o3 and v2o3 as catalysts fang et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 in addition the modifications of nano moo2 are due to the interaction with pms and not with the pah derivatives homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis may both occur in the nano moo2 pms system and the activation of pms by mo v may take place as shown in eq 10 10 mo v hso5 mo vi so4 oh 11 so4 so4 s2o8 2 12 so4 oh hso5 more mo ion leaching at low ph leads to the fast homogeneous activation reaction which may also be a reason for the rapid degradation of pollutants at lower ph however the degradation effect of 1 naphthylamine in the homogeneous system was poor with more leaching ions than in the heterogeneous system this observation is mainly because a large number of free radicals were generated in a short time in a homogeneous system and the radicals were consumed because of competitive reactions according to eq 11 12 guo et al 2018 it is probably due to the hydrolysis of metal ions or acidic products the ph of the solution after the homogeneous reaction was decreased to approximately 2 3 which is not conducive to the conversion of so4 into oh correspondingly the homogeneous system was particularly effective in the degradation of 1 naphthol fig s9 b because the degradation mainly process involved so4 reuse of nano moo2 resulted in decreased activity most likely due to oxidation of the surface mo iv groups it has previously been reported that iron copper oxide and composite catalyst activated pms undergo a reduction process according to eqs 13 15 espinosa et al 2019 oh et al 2016 13 fe ⅲ hso5 fe ⅱ so5 h 14 cu ⅱ hso5 cu ⅰ so5 h 15 cat co3 sites hso5 cat co2 sites so5 h we speculate that the regeneration of excess mo ⅳ or mo ⅴ on the surface of nano moo2 particles upon reduction of mo ⅵ might be a possible factor influencing the catalytic activity according to eqs 16 17 and that the formed mo ⅳ is responsible for pms activation in the 4th cycle at the same time these processes would produce so5 which has a weak oxidizing ability e so5 1 1 v oh et al 2016 16 mo ⅵ hso5 mo ⅴ so5 h 17 mo ⅴ hso5 mo ⅳ so5 h the degradation of pah derivatives in the nano moo3 pms system was carried out to verify this hypothesis and the results are shown in fig s73 naphthalene 23 1 methylnaphthalene 21 1 nitronaphthalene 5 1 chloronaphthalene 33 1 naphthylamine 100 and 1 naphthol 100 the degradation of those pah derivatives can be accounted for by the activation of pms by nano moo3 furthermore a weak oh signal fig s74 appeared in the epr spectra of the nano moo3 pms systems implying the formation of so4 upon the reduction of mo vi to mo iv and the activation of pms by mo iv and then so4 is converted to oh the activation of pms is mainly achieved upon acceptance of one electron from the transition metal to homolytically cleave the o o bond and the activation effect depends on the electron donating or electron transfer ability of the catalyst oh et al 2016 yu et al 2020 in this experiment nano moox was used as an electron donor mo iv can provide up to two electrons to pms mo vi has no electrons that can be used so nano moo2 has the best catalytic effect mo vi must be converted to a low valence state through some reactions before activating pms based on the above findings we postulate an activation mechanism for nano moo2 on pms as shown in fig 6 the degradation mechanism of pah derivatives mainly involves two processes one is that nano moo2 provides electrons to pms to generate so4 and oh a process accompanied by the change of the mo valence state the second is where free radicals degrade pollutants so4 oxidized pah derivatives is achieved by electron transfer due to its high selectivity in the degradation pathways of naphthalene 1 methylnaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene 1 naphthylamine and 1 naphthol so4 mainly attacks the carbon or oxygen on the benzene ring or the substituent and then forms corresponding organic free radicals which are further degraded and oh attack probably occurs through electrophilic addition and or substitution reactions and hydrogen abstraction reactions naphthol is a somewhat common transformation intermediate for pah derivatives furthermore in the case of substituted naphthalenes oxidative or reductive transformation can involve either the functional group or the aromatic ring the reductive pathway involving o2 was for instance operational in the transformation of no2 into nh2 the substituents affect the degradation of pah derivatives by influencing the esp mainly because the electrons on the molecular surface affect the electrophilic attack of free radicals esp distributions and surface areas for all esp ranges of pah derivatives and parent pah are shown in fig 1 a g according to spearman correlation analysis by spssau software there is a significant correlation fig 1 h between the degradation rate of pah derivatives and esp the esp of naphthalene is mainly determined by the positive potential on the periphery of the molecule and the negative potential in the core of the molecule and the average value is 15 5 however the substituents change the esp and disrupt this balance nh2 causes the distribution of a large quantity of negative electrons on the surface of 1 naphthylamine 48 4 which is conducive to the attack of so4 and oh on the double bond in the naphthalene ring and nh2 substituents because so4 and oh have a high electron affinity thus 1 naphthylamine has a higher degradation rate than the parent naphthalene compound however the ch3 no2 cl and oh substituents cause the esp of 1 methylnaphthalene 19 7 1 nitronaphthalene 273 0 1 chloronaphthalene 88 3 and 1 naphthol 125 8 respectively to show positive potentials which is not conducive for electrophilic so4 and oh to obtain electrons resulting in a lower removal rate of these pah derivatives relative to that of naphthalene 5 conclusion nano moo2 is a promising catalyst for the activation of pms to degrade pah derivatives owing to its high catalytic efficiency and limited production of secondary pollution nano moo2 activates pms by electron transfer to produce so4 and later oh upon the reaction of so4 with h2o and or oh both so4 and oh are mainly dominated the degradation of pah derivatives spin trapping experiments suggest that additional transient species o2 and 1o2 were formed in the system but were found to have a limited effect on the degradation of pah derivatives part of the degradation mechanism triggered by nano moo2 is likely due to the leached mo ions which can activate pms through homogeneous phase reactions the surface of nano moo2 is oxidized during pms activation resulting in an initial decrease in activity as the catalyst is reused however the formation of high valence surface species mo vi as detected by xps might be the basis for the partial restoration of the catalytic activity in further reuse cycles because excess mo vi can be reduced back to mo iv by hso5 to then activate pms the observed differences in the degradation of the pah derivatives were primarily due to the impact of the substituents on the esp and a negative esp is beneficial to the attack of electrophilic so4 and oh on the pollutants the implications of our novel and promising findings suggest that future remediation strategies for pah derivative polluted water should include aops that rely on nano moo2 induced pms activation declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was

friendly catalyst nano moo2 0 05 g l 1 exhibited excellent performance in activating 4 0 mmol l 1 peroxymonosulfate pms for the degradation of naphthalene derivatives with 1 mg l 1 in aqueous systems

an electron donor by transferring an electron causing o o bond of pms to cleave producing so4 and later oh electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis combined with free radical quenching research indicated that so4 and oh dominated the degradation of naphthalene derivatives and o2 and 1o2 participated in the processes x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps revealed the transformation of mo iv to mo v and mo vi which suggested that the activation process proceeded via electron transfer from nano moo2 to pms the applicability of the nano moo2 pms system in influencing parameters and stability was explored the degradation pathways were primarily elucidated for each naphthalene derivative based on the intermediates identified in the systems the ch3 no2 cl oh substituents increased the positive electrostatic potential esp on the molecular surface of 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene and 1 naphthol which reduced the electrophilic reaction and electron transfer between the reactive species and pollutants leading to a lower degradation rate of naphthalene derivatives than the parent compound however the effect of nh2 substituents is the opposite these findings suggest that nano moo2 may aid as a novel catalyst in the future remediation of environments polluted with pah derivatives graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nano moo2 peroxymonosulfate activation pah derivatives reactive species degradation 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah derivatives methyl nitrogen chlorine and hydroxyl containing pahs are compounds that incorporate substituted groups into the molecular structure of the parent pahs they arise from the incomplete combustion of carbon containing compounds and by chemical and microbial transformation of parent pahs kojima et al 2010 qiao et al 2016 these pollutants are widely present and more persistent in the aquatic environment because of their high polarity they are more carcinogenic mutagenic and estrogenic and can accumulate in sediments then migrate and transform in the water ranjbar jafarabadi et al 2019 trine et al 2019 the concentration of pah derivatives in the aquatic environment range from not detected to µg l 1 kong et al 2021 alkylated pahs have light induced genotoxicity and metabolic toxicity in aquatic organisms kang et al 2016 the concentration of nitro pahs in taihu lake can reach 212 ng l 1 and the carcinogenic risk level ranged from 2 09 10 7 to 5 75 10 5 kong et al 2021 the content of halogenated pahs with high lipophilicity in the sediments of the pearl river estuary reached 1 4 ng g 1 to 40 9 ng g 1 and was also detected in drinking water yuan et al 2020 thus frequently exposing humans and wildlife naphthylamines have high toxicity and carcinogenicity and are widespread in wastewater they pose risks to aquatic ecosystems and lower dissolved oxygen wang et al 2019b hydroxy pahs are widely present in printing and dyeing wastewater and are linked to health complications such as cancer nephritis and hemolysis rebekah et al 2020 in summary previous studies on pah derivatives have focused on their conversion content and toxicity on human beings and the environment however there is a need to explore the efficient and green remediation of pah derivatives in polluted water the current chemical method for degrading pah derivatives is mainly advanced oxidation processes aops it s advantageous because of high efficiency and limited amount of secondary pollution sun et al 2019 aops usually include ozonation chlorine oxidation fenton fenton like oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and persulfate including peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds oxidation ao et al 2021 however most of aops have studied the degradation of a single pah derivative das et al 2020 the degradation of derivatives with different substituents on the same parent is still unclear the oxidation processes in the aquatic environment are based on oh because of high oxidation potential e oh 2 8v ghanbari and moradi 2017 however in complex water substrates containing oh scavengers such as inorganic anions and natural organics the efficiency of aops may be limited and oh t1 2 20 ns have a short half life therefore in recent years employing reactive substances with higher selectivity and wide half life such as so4 e so4 2 5 3 1v t1 2 30 40 μs have received increased attention ghanbari and moradi 2017 pms is preferentially selected as an oxidant because it is easier to activate because of its asymmetric structure ho o so3 and superoxide o o bond io o 1 326 å guo et al 2020 and the activated final product of pms is so4 2 which is harmless in water persulfate can be activated by heat light and transition metal fe co cu ag etc lee et al 2020 transition metals have the advantages of convenience and outstanding catalytic efficiency as well as their copresence in some polluted waters however most of the current catalyst are limited to several common transition metal compounds and nano molybdenum oxides have not been explored in pms aops furthermore it is the first time to study how to effectively remove various pah derivatives in aqueous systems based on pms aops and explore its mechanism mo containing minerals in nature are mainly molybdenite wulfenite and powellite giussani and nriagu 2011 the mo oxidation states range from mo ii to mo vi and the variable oxidation state allows mo to participate in a large number of redox reactions moreover compared to other transition metals mo is toxicologically harmless and does not have severe health impacts giussani and nriagu 2011 mo is present in rocks and soils at levels between 1 and 10 mg kg 1 and the concentration can exceed 100 mg kg 1 due to wind erosion under strongly reducing conditions near the sea smedley and kinniburgh 2017 moreover the groundwater concentration can reach 25 mg l 1 near mo ore districts giussani and nriagu 2011 mo oxides generally have more advantages than other mo containing compounds from an engineering perspective wei et al 2020 for instance nanomolybdenum dioxide nano moo2 particles have high stability and low solubility and toxicity and are easy to synthesize anh tran et al 2014 song et al 2014 moo2 has been only used as a cocatalyst to promote fe iii fe ii cycling in aops ji et al 2020 shen et al 2019 however to our knowledge the use of moo2 as a catalyst for pms activation in aops is still being explored herein naphthalene derivatives 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene 1 naphthylamine 1 naphthol of environmental concern were selected as model contaminants and their degradation patterns in aqueous solution were primarily investigated by the nano moo2 as an activator and pms as an oxidant system this work has the following objectives a for the first time we use nano moo2 to activate pms for pah derivatives catalytic oxidation b exploring the mechanism of catalysis and degradation c finding the commonality and difference between the degradation rate and pathways of derivative and clarifying the relationship between substituents and degradation those results of this work will provide insights into a new technology for the degradation of pah derivatives as well as an understanding of nano moo2 as a new catalyst for the removal of toxic organic pollutants in

shanghai china tert butyl alcohol tba 98 ethanol etoh 99 8 and mocl5 99 6 all water used was ultrapure water resistance 18 25 mω 2 2 degradation of pah derivatives by the nano moo2 pms system batch experiments were carried out in 40 ml epa glass vials containing 19 ml of 1 mg l 1 selected pah derivatives in each experiment a certain nano moo2 dosage and 1 ml of pms solution was added to the reaction vials to start the reaction at 25 c under 200 r min 1 for 180 min in the dark unless otherwise specified the catalyst and pms dosages were 0 05 g l 1 and 4 0 mmol l 1 respectively the initial solution ph 4 4 10 0 was adjusted with 1 mol l 1 h2so4 or naoh once degradation was initiated 1 ml of the reaction solution was collected from the suspension at given time intervals quenched by 1 ml methanol filtered with a 0 22 µm organic phase filter and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc all degradation experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods the properties analysis of the test pah derivatives and the morphology and character analysis of nano moo2 are shown in the supplementary information si a 1 ml sample of the pah derivatives was removed at

samples were subjected to solid phase extraction with methanol and they were concentrated under flowing nitrogen and analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms thermo q exactive focus usa to determine the degradation products the detailed detection processes are provided in the si reactive species in the nano moo2 pms system were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance epr elexsys ii germany with 0 1 mol l 1 dmpo as spin trapping agents for so4 oh and o2 and 0 03 mol l 1 temp for 1o2 the epr spectra were read at room temperature using the following conditions a frequency of 9 746 ghz a modulation amplitude of 1 00 g a sweep width of 200 g a microwave power of 19 92 mw a modulation frequency of 100 00 khz and a time constant of 40 96 the relative concentrations of reactive species in the system were represented as peak intensity signals of dmpo x and temp 1o2 and corrected with background noise the calculation of electrostatic potential esp is divided into 4 steps chemoffice 16 0 software was used to draw the original structures of pah derivatives then optimized by gaussian 09 w based on density functional theory dft with the ωb97xd 6 311g basis sets and simultaneously add smd solvation model and then calculated using multiwfn 3 7 software and finally displayed by vmd1 9 3 software lu and manzetti 2014 the specific surface area of pah derivatives was analyzed over different esp ranges by origin 8 5 1 software all the experimental data analyzed by statistical analysis using spssau software the significant level of the data is accepted only when p 0 05 3 results 3 1 catalytic performance of nano moo2 the degradation kinetics of pah derivatives in the nano moo2 pms system are displayed in fig 1 a f the results show that most pah derivatives were not oxidized by pms alone except for 1 naphthylamine and 1 naphthol which showed 100 and 36 degradation respectively by pms in 180 min due to the weak oxidation ability of pms itself li et al 2016 moreover the degradation of naphthalene derivatives was negligible by nano moo2 alone all pah derivatives underwent a great concentration reduction the degradation percentage was 77 and the degradation rate constant k was 0 024 in the nano moo2 pms system in 180 min indicating that pms was activated by nano moo2 in particular the degradation percentages of 1 chloronaphthalene 97 87 and 1 naphthylamine 99 74 in 180 min were similar to that of the parent naphthalene compound 98 17 moreover 1 methylnaphthalene and 1 nitronaphthalene were degraded by more than 85 while the degradation of 1 naphthol was slightly lower approximately 77 a pseudo first order kinetics equation si was used to fit the degradation kinetics fig s2 and the pseudo first order rate constants k are listed in fig 1 g the k values of the naphthalene derivatives were lower than that of the parent naphthalene compound 0 0700 min 1 the k value of 1 chloronaphthalene was 0 0067 min 1 followed by 1 naphthylamine 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene and 1 naphthol with k values of 0 0530 0 0402 0 0356 and 0 0242 min 1 respectively also the results and analysis of the total organic carbon toc concentrations are displayed in the si the loading of the catalyst is a crucial factor in the wastewater treatment process sun et al 2019 the effect of catalyst loading 0 0 5 g l 1 on the degradation of pah derivatives was investigated fig s4 panel a and fig s5 panel a the degradation rate of all pah derivatives was 100 when the nano moo2 does was increased from 0 g l 1 to 0 5 g l 1 except for 1 naphthol which showed only 82 42 degradation most pah derivatives were completely degraded within 5 min at 0 25 0 50 g l 1 nano moo2 the k increased with increasing nano moo2 from 0 05 0 10 g l 1 shown in tab 1 and the k values of naphthalene and 1 chloronaphthalene increased to 0 2086 and 0 2136 respectively which are much higher than those of the other naphthalene derivatives the k value of 1 methylnaphthalene was 0 0681 that of 1 nitronaphthalene was 0 0738 and that of 1 naphthol was 0 1292 the pms concentration is directly related to the production of reactive oxygen species ros sun et al 2019 the influence of the pms concentration 0 12 mmol l 1 on the removal of pah derivatives by nano moo2 pms was investigated fig s4 panel b and fig s5 panel b as the pms concentration increases to 12 mmol l 1 the degradation rate of all pah derivatives is 90 except for 1 naphthol which is 80 the concentration of pms had a positive but limited effect on the degradation of pah derivatives as shown in tab 1 the k values of naphthalene 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene and 1 naphthol gradually increased with the pms concentration from 0 mmol l 1 to 12 mmol l 1 and were 0 0548 0 0280 0 0280 0 0679 and 0 0328 at 12 mmol l 1 pms respectively in addition 1 naphthylamine can be fully degraded within 1 min at high pms concentrations the solution ph affects the heterogeneous pms oxidation systems by affecting the surface characteristics of the catalyst and the generation of radicals ghanbari and moradi 2017 li et al 2019 wang and wang 2018 zheng et al 2019 the degradation trends and kinetic fit of pah derivatives at different ph values are shown in fig s4 panel c and fig s5 panel c the degradation rate of all pah derivatives except for 1 naphthylamine and 1 naphthol decreased significantly to below 50 with increasing ph from 4 4 to 10 0 while that of 1 naphthylamine increased to 100 and that of 1 naphthol remained at 77 the k values of all pah derivatives except for 1 naphthylamine were correspondingly reduced to 0 0076 naphthalene 0 0054 1 methylnaphthalene 0 0014 1 nitronaphthalene 0 0064 1 chloronaphthalene and 0 0074 1 naphthol respectively as shown in tab 1 in addition the initial ph reduced only the reaction rate of 1 naphthol and had little effect on the degradation percentage fig s4 panel c r in contrast 1 naphthylamine was degraded faster and more efficiently with increasing ph values and it was fully degraded in 1 min at ph 10 moreover the influence of temperature is more complicated due to the existence of thermal activation under high temperature conditions and the correlation analysis is shown in si 3 2 identification of reactive species in the nano moo2 pms system in situ epr analysis combined with dmpo was utilized to determine the reactive species in the nano moo2 pms system and the results were shown in fig 2 a f the free radical capture signals dmpo so4 hyperfine coupling constants of αn 13 2 g αh 9 6 g αh 1 48 g and αh 0 78 g and dmpo oh αn αh 14 9 g were clearly visible at 1 10 min in all six degradation systems wang and chen 2015 moreover fig s7 a shows that pms alone did not produce any free radicals thus their occurrence is accounted for by the activation of pms by nano moo2 furthermore so4 gradually decreased with increasing of oh and the peak intensity signal of dmpo oh was significantly higher than that of dmpo so4 to further distinguish their contributions the chemical quenchers ethanol etoh k etoh so4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1s 1 k etoh oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1s 1 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 for so4 and oh and tert butanol tba k tba so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1s 1 k tba oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 for oh were used in quenching experiments with etoh tba pms concentration ratios of 200 and 500 as illustrated in fig 3 both etoh and tba had a detrimental effect on the degradation of pah derivatives except for 1 naphthol which was less inhibited by the quenchers as shown in fig 3 f when the ratio of etoh to pms is 500 the degradation rates of naphthalene 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene and 1 naphthylamine are reduced by 74 57 68 38 86 23 71 42 and 51 74 respectively compared to the control group these values are reduced by 96 40 76 13 81 56 88 66 and 67 59 respectively when the ratio of tba to pms is 500 another reactive species signal of dmpo ooh a combination of o2 and dmpo occurred in the nano moo2 pms system as detected by epr with dmpo and was pronounced as shown in fig 2 g the signal intensity of dmpo ooh is weaker than other reactive species in this system 1o2 was also found and there is a visible temp 1o2 signal peak fig 2 h in the system with temp as a spin trapping agent the temp 1o2 signal peak 1 1 1 α 17 0 g peak intensities of 136 31 142 37 and 142 09 appeared with temp alone see fig s7 c due to oxidation but the peak intensities approximately 206 11 202 05 and 196 89 in the moo2 pms system were obviously increased the ability of o2 0 33 v and 1o2 to induce pah derivative degradation may be limited because of weak oxidation the quenching experiments of so4 and oh suggest that those substantially control the degradation of pah derivatives except for 1 naphthol for 1 naphthol the removal inhibition by the alcohols was incomplete therefore potential reactive species other than so4 and oh are likely to play a role in the degradation process in addition possible secondary reactions induced by e g alcohol derived radicals should be taken into account 3 3 surface investigation and stability of nano moo2 the surface characteristics of nano moo2 were investigated by sem fig s8 and xps fig 4 and the surface was smooth after the reaction with no obvious traces of corrosion and the new deconvoluted peaks of mo v and mo vi were detected by xps the characteristic peaks assigned to c 1s 284 08 ev o 1s 530 08 ev mo 3d 232 08 ev mo 3p3 2 396 08 ev mo 3p1 2 413 08 ev and mo 4p 38 08 ev were monitored in the full xps spectrum the mo 3d high resolution peak could be deconvoluted into six peaks as shown in fig 4 a f and the corresponding binding energies are listed in detail in tab s2 the strong deconvoluted peaks with binding energies of 228 87 and 232 04 ev are mo iv double peaks corresponding to mo 3d5 2 and mo 3d3 2 in nano moo2 respectively wang et al 2019a we also found that the deconvoluted peaks representing mo v and mo vi in nano moo2 after pms activation showed binding energies of 230 20 ev mo 3d5 2 and 233 86 ev mo 3d3 2 and of 231 38 ev mo 3d5 2 and 235 00 ev mo 3d3 2 respectively wang et al 2019a moreover the xps spectra of nano moo2 in pah derivative degradation systems were almost the same in addition the leaching of ionic mo at different ph values at the end of the experiments was analyzed by icp oes fig s9 a the leaching amount of mo ions ranged from 15 to 22 mg l 1 and more mo ions would be leached at a low ph pms activation by leached mo ions resulting in concurrent degradation of pah derivatives was conducted the homogeneous phase activation experiments were carried out using 1 mmol l 1 mo v ions due to the low water solubility of commercially available mo iv compounds as shown in fig s9 b the homogeneous mo v pms system was able to induce the degradation of all pah derivatives with the fastest and most complete degradation observed for 1 methylnaphthalene and especially 1 naphthol while only approximately 50 of 1 naphthylamine was degraded the stability of nano moo2 was examined by collecting and reusing it in four consecutive degradation cycles tab 2 the catalytic effects and removal efficiency of the pah derivatives in the 2nd and 3rd uses of nano moo2 gradually deteriorated to below 61 except for those of 1 naphthylamine since it was degraded completely in all cycles however when using nano moo2 in the 4th cycle the catalytic activity was partially recovered and the degradation rate of the pah derivatives was improved by 9 38 4 63 1 48 9 22 and 13 30 for naphthalene 1 methylnaphthalene 1 nitronaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene and 1 naphthol respectively compared to that in the 3rd cycle 3 4 degradation pathways of pah derivatives the degradation intermediates of the pah derivatives in the nano moo2 pms system were identified by lc ms and the corresponding spectra are given in fig s10 s71 there are 10 intermediates formed from naphthalene 13 from 1 methylnaphthalene 4 from 1 nitronaphthalene 13 from 1 chloronaphthalene 12 from 1 naphthylamine and 10 from 1 naphthol and they are listed in si these intermediates were transformed from redox reactions by reactive species which attack electron rich substituents and or carbon atoms based on the detected intermediates and previously reported results bandowe and meusel 2017 cui et al 2018 huang et al 2016 qian et al 2015 shen et al 2008 so et al 2019 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2006 we propose transformation pathways for each pah derivative as shown in fig 5 some undetected compounds presumably undetected because of low stability in the studied systems which would act as precursors via known transformation pathways are shown in square brackets in the figure panels naphthalene fig 5 a first yielded naphthol a h c i by hydroxylation so et al 2019 then hydroxynaphthalene was transformed into 4 hydroxy 1 naphthoic acid d and 2 hydroxy 1 naphthoic acid m by carbonylation or a hydroformylation like reaction and 2 hydroxy 1 4 naphoquinone g and 4 hydroxy 1 2 naphthoquinone l were formed by oxidation then they were further transformed by ring opening reactions to produce o phthalic anhydride e phthalic acid f carboxyl cinnamaldehydes j acetophenone k and 2 hydroxycinnamic acid n so et al 2019 wang et al 2015 these pathways are also common to most pah derivatives second the hydroxyl group was likely substituted by a methyl group to produce methylnaphthalene and then it was oxidized via electron transfer from so4 and hydroxyl substitution form 4 hydroxy 4 methylnaphthalene 1 4h one b this and other observed transformation pathways proceeded through c atom addition suggesting that oxidation fragmentation pathways likely yielded carbon based radicals in addition to the transient species identified by epr qian et al 2015 the pathway of 1 methylnaphthalene fig 5 b underwent oxidative decarboxylation to form 1 naphthoic acid q and naphthalene r and most degradation processes were similar to that of naphthalene another route was the c on the methyl substituent was attacked by so4 through electron transfer to form organic free radicals which are further oxidized to produce 1 naphthaldehyde o qian et al 2015 additionally ring contraction and hydroxylation processes of naphthalene r yielded hydroquinone p shen et al 2008 the occurrence of reducing transient species such as o2 in the reaction system can account for reduction pathways such as the transformation of 1 2 dihydroxynaphthalene i into 1 2 dihydro 1 2 dihydroxynaphthalene s the degradation pathway of 1 nitronaphthalene is shown in fig 5 c as nitronaphthalene shares several transformation intermediates with naphthylamine see below we speculate that its transformation also involves reduction to 1 naphthylamine although that was not observed here indeed it is easonable to hypothesize that 1 naphthylamine underwent hydroxylated substitution followed by oxidative ring opening to form o phthalic anhydride e and carboxyl cinnamaldehydes j moreover hydroxylation at the ortho and para positions of the nitro functional group would yield 1 nitro 1 2 dihydronaphthalen 2 ol t and 4 hydroxy 1 nitronaphthalene u the degradation pathway of 1 chloronaphthalene shares similarities with the transformation of naphthalene fig 5 d however the oxidation products 1 4 naphthoquinone z and 1 2 naphthoquinone a were detected in this system moreover the para position of 1 chloronaphthalene was hydroxylated to form 4 chloronaphthalene 1 ol v and 4 chloronaphthalene 1 2 diol w and finally underwent ring opening to form e 2 1 chloro 3 oxoprop 1 en 1 yl benzaldehyde x cui et al 2018 furthermore the c on the naphthalene ring was attacked via electron transfer by so4 hydroxide oxygenated and opened to form 2 formylbenzoyl chloride y cui et al 2018 the degradation pathway of 1 naphthylamine is shown in fig 5 e the loss of the nitrogen atom in some intermediates leads us to speculate that substitution hydroxylation might have yielded undetected naphthol zhang et al 2006 which can undergo a conversion process as an intermediate naphthol similar to naphthalene and further undergo oxidation ring fragmentation to produce 2 hydroxycinnamic acid n and then 2z 4z hexa 2 4 dienedioic acid e a parallel reduction process for the intermediate naphthalene followed by ring contraction could yield indene b which could be degraded to 2 butyl 1 4 dimethylbenzene c by methyl substitution and ring opening in addition naphthalene may also first undergo methylation and the c on the methyl substituent was attacked by so4 and then further oxidized to produce 1 naphthylmethanol d qian et al 2015 another degradation pathway of 1 naphthylamine involved the amino functional group which was oxidatively converted to 1 nitrosonaphthalene f and then to 1 nitronaphthalene g the nitro derivative was then hydroxylated and hydrogenated to produce 1 nitro 1 2 dihydronaphthalen 2 ol t the degradation pathway of 1 naphthol is reported in fig 5 f and it is similar to that undergone by 1 naphthol as a common intermediate of the parent naphthalene compound and other derivatives furthermore 1 naphthol was involved in alkylation and ring fragmentation would produce tetramethylbenzene h 4 discussion a very small amount of nano moo2 can have a significant catalytic effect on pms and all pah derivatives can be degraded efficiently the catalytic effect on pah derivatives with substituents was slightly weaker than that on the parent pah except for 1 naphthylamine which had a higher catalytic effect than the parent pah degradation was generally favored by an increase in the nano moo2 loading or pms concentration due to enhanced production of ros an increased nano moo2 loading i e catalytic sites allows for accelerated activation of pms sun et al 2019 and an increased pms concentration can optimize contact with the nano moo2 active sites indrawirawan et al 2015 a possible explanation for the lower degradation of pah derivatives at a higher ph is that the pms acid base equilibrium is dominated by so5 2 which has negligible redox capacity and cannot to be activated by nano moo2 and it leads to reduced electro static interaction between pms and nano moo2 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 furthermore two possible explanations can account for the positive ph effect on 1 naphthylamine i the degradation of 1 naphthylamine occurs to a higher extent upon reaction with so5 2 which prevails under basic conditions and or ii degradation is more difficult in the presence of the protonated substrate 1 naphthylammonium under acidic conditions the dmpo so4 signal occurred in the nano moo2 pms system indicating the efficient activation of pms by nano moo2 and dmpo oh was found to be mainly converted from so4 via a nucleophilic substitution reaction according to eqs 1 and 2 park et al 2018 1 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h 2 so4 oh so4 2 oh the dmpo oh signal increases with time indicating that oh is always produced in the system the dmpo so4 signal has always existed but slightly weakened there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon one is the attenuation of the captured signal dmpo so4 itself and the other may be caused by the conversion between so4 and oh in this system oh and so4 significantly affected the removal of pah derivatives and generally the reaction rate constants of the two free radicals and organics are usually between 108 and 109 mol 1 s 1 however according to the quenching experiment the degradation of 1 naphthol is different from that of the other pah derivatives as shown in fig s72 a ch2ch2oh alcohol radicals were formed in the nano moo2 pms etoh system and can likely explain the observed degradation since they have a high reduction potential 1 39 v to 1 18 v peyton et al 1995 schwarz and dodson 1989 for instance fang et al reported that tba radicals reductively degrade pcbs that are otherwise difficult to degrade fang et al 2017 as shown in fig s72 b compared to the system without alcohol only oh was significantly reduced in the nano moo2 pms tba system this result is consistent with the tba reaction rate with oh being higher than that with so4 the fact that tba did not affect the degradation of 1 naphthol suggests that 1 naphthol might be mainly degraded by the reaction with so4 in the nano moo2 pms system both o2 and 1o2 occurred in the nano moo2 pms system and were likely generated by the following chemical eqs 3 7 duan et al 2018 3 hso5 h2o h2o2 hso4 4 h2o2 2 oh 5 oh h2o2 ho2 h2o 6 ho2 h o2 7 2o2 2h h2o2 1o2 however quenching experiments with etoh and tba indicate that reactive species different from oh and so4 have extremely limited effects on the removal of pah derivatives after the reaction the surface of nano moo2 shows that it can further contact the reactant with the largest contact area to act as a catalyst the double peaks of mo v and mo vi that appeared in the xps spectra of the reacted nano moo2 can be accounted for by oxidation reactions on the surface of nano moo2 zhuang et al 2019 mo iv activates pms by transferring electrons followed by transformation into mo v and mo vi according to eqs 8 9 8 mo ⅳ hso5 mo ⅴ so4 oh 9 mo ⅴ hso5 mo ⅵ so4 oh this process is depicted in fig 6 a similar activation process has also been described in other systems such as fe2o3 and v2o3 as catalysts fang et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 in addition the modifications of nano moo2 are due to the interaction with pms and not with the pah derivatives homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis may both occur in the nano moo2 pms system and the activation of pms by mo v may take place as shown in eq 10 10 mo v hso5 mo vi so4 oh 11 so4 so4 s2o8 2 12 so4 oh hso5 more mo ion leaching at low ph leads to the fast homogeneous activation reaction which may also be a reason for the rapid degradation of pollutants at lower ph however the degradation effect of 1 naphthylamine in the homogeneous system was poor with more leaching ions than in the heterogeneous system this observation is mainly because a large number of free radicals were generated in a short time in a homogeneous system and the radicals were consumed because of competitive reactions according to eq 11 12 guo et al 2018 it is probably due to the hydrolysis of metal ions or acidic products the ph of the solution after the homogeneous reaction was decreased to approximately 2 3 which is not conducive to the conversion of so4 into oh correspondingly the homogeneous system was particularly effective in the degradation of 1 naphthol fig s9 b because the degradation mainly process involved so4 reuse of nano moo2 resulted in decreased activity most likely due to oxidation of the surface mo iv groups it has previously been reported that iron copper oxide and composite catalyst activated pms undergo a reduction process according to eqs 13 15 espinosa et al 2019 oh et al 2016 13 fe ⅲ hso5 fe ⅱ so5 h 14 cu ⅱ hso5 cu ⅰ so5 h 15 cat co3 sites hso5 cat co2 sites so5 h we speculate that the regeneration of excess mo ⅳ or mo ⅴ on the surface of nano moo2 particles upon reduction of mo ⅵ might be a possible factor influencing the catalytic activity according to eqs 16 17 and that the formed mo ⅳ is responsible for pms activation in the 4th cycle at the same time these processes would produce so5 which has a weak oxidizing ability e so5 1 1 v oh et al 2016 16 mo ⅵ hso5 mo ⅴ so5 h 17 mo ⅴ hso5 mo ⅳ so5 h the degradation of pah derivatives in the nano moo3 pms system was carried out to verify this hypothesis and the results are shown in fig s73 naphthalene 23 1 methylnaphthalene 21 1 nitronaphthalene 5 1 chloronaphthalene 33 1 naphthylamine 100 and 1 naphthol 100 the degradation of those pah derivatives can be accounted for by the activation of pms by nano moo3 furthermore a weak oh signal fig s74 appeared in the epr spectra of the nano moo3 pms systems implying the formation of so4 upon the reduction of mo vi to mo iv and the activation of pms by mo iv and then so4 is converted to oh the activation of pms is mainly achieved upon acceptance of one electron from the transition metal to homolytically cleave the o o bond and the activation effect depends on the electron donating or electron transfer ability of the catalyst oh et al 2016 yu et al 2020 in this experiment nano moox was used as an electron donor mo iv can provide up to two electrons to pms mo vi has no electrons that can be used so nano moo2 has the best catalytic effect mo vi must be converted to a low valence state through some reactions before activating pms based on the above findings we postulate an activation mechanism for nano moo2 on pms as shown in fig 6 the degradation mechanism of pah derivatives mainly involves two processes one is that nano moo2 provides electrons to pms to generate so4 and oh a process accompanied by the change of the mo valence state the second is where free radicals degrade pollutants so4 oxidized pah derivatives is achieved by electron transfer due to its high selectivity in the degradation pathways of naphthalene 1 methylnaphthalene 1 chloronaphthalene 1 naphthylamine and 1 naphthol so4 mainly attacks the carbon or oxygen on the benzene ring or the substituent and then forms corresponding organic free radicals which are further degraded and oh attack probably occurs through electrophilic addition and or substitution reactions and hydrogen abstraction reactions naphthol is a somewhat common transformation intermediate for pah derivatives furthermore in the case of substituted naphthalenes oxidative or reductive transformation can involve either the functional group or the aromatic ring the reductive pathway involving o2 was for instance operational in the transformation of no2 into nh2 the substituents affect the degradation of pah derivatives by influencing the esp mainly because the electrons on the molecular surface affect the electrophilic attack of free radicals esp distributions and surface areas for all esp ranges of pah derivatives and parent pah are shown in fig 1 a g according to spearman correlation analysis by spssau software there is a significant correlation fig 1 h between the degradation rate of pah derivatives and esp the esp of naphthalene is mainly determined by the positive potential on the periphery of the molecule and the negative potential in the core of the molecule and the average value is 15 5 however the substituents change the esp and disrupt this balance nh2 causes the distribution of a large quantity of negative electrons on the surface of 1 naphthylamine 48 4 which is conducive to the attack of so4 and oh on the double bond in the naphthalene ring and nh2 substituents because so4 and oh have a high electron affinity thus 1 naphthylamine has a higher degradation rate than the parent naphthalene compound however the ch3 no2 cl and oh substituents cause the esp of 1 methylnaphthalene 19 7 1 nitronaphthalene 273 0 1 chloronaphthalene 88 3 and 1 naphthol 125 8 respectively to show positive potentials which is not conducive for electrophilic so4 and oh to obtain electrons resulting in a lower removal rate of these pah derivatives relative to that of naphthalene 5 conclusion nano moo2 is a promising catalyst for the activation of pms to degrade pah derivatives owing to its high catalytic efficiency and limited production of secondary pollution nano moo2 activates pms by electron transfer to produce so4 and later oh upon the reaction of so4 with h2o and or oh both so4 and oh are mainly dominated the degradation of pah derivatives spin trapping experiments suggest that additional transient species o2 and 1o2 were formed in the system but were found to have a limited effect on the degradation of pah derivatives part of the degradation mechanism triggered by nano moo2 is likely due to the leached mo ions which can activate pms through homogeneous phase reactions the surface of nano moo2 is oxidized during pms activation resulting in an initial decrease in activity as the catalyst is reused however the formation of high valence surface species mo vi as detected by xps might be the basis for the partial restoration of the catalytic activity in further reuse cycles because excess mo vi can be reduced back to mo iv by hso5 to then activate pms the observed differences in the degradation of the pah derivatives were primarily due to the impact of the substituents on the esp and a negative esp is beneficial to the attack of electrophilic so4 and oh on the pollutants the implications of our novel and promising findings suggest that future remediation strategies for pah derivative polluted water should include aops that rely on nano moo2 induced pms activation declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this work was

17191,the complexity of production process and chemical compositions of soluble microbial products smps largely limits the understanding of membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors mbrs herein we used a model single strain escherichia coli to better understand the chemical natures of smps and their roles in membrane fouling the effects of carbon source and growth phase on the chemical compositions of smps were identified at both the compound and molecular levels by using advanced techniques including excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis eem parafac size exclusion chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection lc ocd and untargeted ultra performance liquid chromatography q exactive mass spectrometry uplc q exactive ms subsequently the roles of smps in the propensity of membrane fouling during ultrafiltration uf were studied the results showed that the chemical compositions and fouling potentials of smps were carbon source and growth phase dependent in the exponential phase smps mainly consisted of utilization associated products uaps and remaining substrates as the microorganism progressed into the stationary and senescent phases uaps and biomass associated products baps were the main components respectively the smp contents generated in glucose medium were higher than those generated in acetate medium and higher abundances of humic fluorescent components were observed in glucose fed smps van krevelen diagrams of the uplc ms results revealed that acetate fed smps contained more carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules peptides like aromatic and carbohydrates like components than glucose fed smps in the stationary and senescent phases these components played a significant role in irreversible membrane fouling as evidenced in uf experiments standard blocking and cake filtration were the main fouling mechanisms for the filtration of smps collected in the exponential and stationary senescent phases respectively our findings highlight linkages between smp compositions and membrane fouling at both the compound and molecular levels and suggest that both the carbon source and growth phase strongly determine the production potential chemical nature and fouling behavior of smps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords soluble microbial products escherichia coli carbon source growth lifecycle membrane fouling 1 introduction membrane fouling is the major bottleneck for the wide application of membrane bioreactors mbrs meng et al 2009 and increases the operation cost and reduces membrane lifetime soluble microbial products smps are known to be the main source of membrane foulants in mbrs jarusutthirak and amy 2006 2007 kunacheva et al 2020 and are a complex mixture consisting of proteins polysaccharides amino acids humic substances etc hu et al 2019 tian et al 2011 in general smps can be categorized into two groups utilization associated products uaps and biomass associated products baps uaps are produced from substrate metabolism and biomass growth while baps are associated with biomass decay and cell lysis during the endogenous phase kunacheva and stuckey 2014 ni et al 2010 thus the growth stages of microbes can largely determine the compositions of smps the production and transformation of smps in biological systems are usually complex the relative abundance and chemical compositions of smps are largely influenced by various factors such as carbon source c n ratio sludge retention time organic loading rate and growth phase hu et al 2019 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 ly et al 2019 ly et al 2018 maqbool et al 2017a zhou et al 2012 organic carbon source as the main energy source markedly determine the metabolism of microorganisms and smp production for example smps generated in a sodium acetate fed sequencing batch reactor sbr contained higher concentrations of protein like fluorescent components and large sized aliphatic biopolymers among the three sbrs fed with different carbon sources i e sodium acetate glucose and starch ly et al 2019 the nature of carbon source could also regulate the biosynthetic pathway of free extracellular polysaccharides and the monomeric saccharide composition fructose fed reactor produced less total free extracellular polysaccharides than those in the glucose grown cultures le and stuckey 2017 in addition when toxic phenol was used as carbon source more carbon flowed into the extracellular components resulting in higher smps formation potentials than those with acetate as carbon source wu et al 2018 uaps are normally the dominant smp composition under a substrate sufficient condition while extracellular or intracellular polymeric substances eps or ips can be consumed by their own producers as an alternative substrate when substrate is deficient resulting in the enrichment of baps maqbool et al 2017a therefore these previous efforts further suggest that carbon sources and biomass growth phases should be taken in full consideration when exploring the production and chemical traits of smps it should be noted that the so called uaps and baps are normally obtained or classified according to the overall evolution of the biomass concentrations of a mixed culture nonetheless the bacterial species in a mixed culture have quite different growth rates with a doubling time ranging from a couple of minutes to a couple of days gray et al 2019 long et al 2020 thus the production of uaps and baps is strongly bacteria species dependent one of our previous studies showed that bacterial strains belonging to a given genus bacillus had quite different eps production potentials and thus different fouling behaviors maddela et al 2018 the eps of the medium and high fouling strains had higher concentrations of polysaccharide and protein components such as α 1 4 glycosidic bond and amide ii groups in comparison with those of low fouling strains moreover the eps of the medium and high fouling strains had higher gelling capabilities due to the presence of unique components such as uronic acids and o acetyl previous studies showed that operation conditions could affect the metabolism of microorganisms influencing the reactor performance and the production of smps and eps zhou et al 2012 for example the day night temperature differences dntd in a mbr could affect functional bacteria e g the growth of nitrospina nitrite oxidizing bacteria and tetrasphaera phosphate accumulating organisms were inhibited by dntd operation zhang et al 2018 the exposure to oxidation chemicals such as naclo can induce the release of eps by microorganisms cai and liu 2016 compared with escherichia coli e coli and mycobacterium aurum staphylococcus epidermidis produced a significant higher amount of eps under naclo exposure helbling and vanbriesen 2007 these findings further corroborate the significance of bacterial species on smp and eps formation thus the major motivation of this work is to reveal smp production at the bacterial species level to provide clear information regarding the characteristics of smps and their membrane fouling potential in addition to the complex formation or source of smps their complex chemical nature is another factor limiting the understanding of the compositions and behaviors of smps to date smps are mainly characterized or identified at the compound level such as hydrophilicity hydrophobicity fractions shi et al 2018 molecular weight distributions huber et al 2011 ly et al 2019 fluorescent components and functional groups kunacheva and stuckey 2014 ly et al 2018 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 compound level characterization largely limits knowledge regarding the membrane fouling mechanism of smps if individual smp compounds can be identified then it would be possible to track the dynamic changes of smps at the molecular level and clearly reveal their membrane fouling mechanisms ni et al 2010 untargeted ultra performance liquid chromatography q exactive mass spectrometry uplc q exactive ms based metabolomics has been widely applied to complex biological samples hou et al 2012 this approach is capable of distinguishing individual organic compound enabling the identification of the components of smps at the molecular level lc ms based approaches have been applied to identify and compare components of smps from different phases of anaerobic digestion kunacheva et al 2020 tipthara et al 2017 we expect that characterizing the smp profiles of model species at both the compound and molecular levels will provide new insights into the membrane fouling mechanism of smps under different conditions therefore the objective of this study is to use a model strain e coli to systematically explore the effects of carbon source and growth phase on the chemical compositions of smps at both the compound and molecular levels and to reveal their roles in membrane fouling during ultrafiltration e coli as a model strain has been widely used in eps and membrane fouling studies eboigbodin and biggs 2008 hilal et al 2004 the complete genome sequence of e coli is currently available which can provide information for reconstructing its complete metabolic networks edwards et al 2001 therein the utilization of different carbon sources by e coli has been reported eiteman and altman 2006 oh et al 2002 which might help to fundamentally understand its smps production thus the e coli was chosen as a model strain in this study glucose and sodium acetate were selected as the carbon sources in this study as they had different substrate utilization rates and metabolic pathways by e coli it has been reported that acetic acid was an extracellular co product of e coli during aerobic fermentation eiteman and altman 2006 although such short chain acid also serves as a carbon source of e coli it might reduce the biosynthesis rate of several proteins in addition glucose and acetate are widely used carbon sources for enhancing denitrification in wastewater treatment plants wwtps thus investigating the effects of carbon source on chemical compositions of smps and their membrane fouling mechanisms was of significance for membrane fouling control in mbr applications the dynamic changes in the chemical compositions of smps of e coli in various growth phases were characterized using advanced analyses including fluorescence excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis eem parafac size exclusion chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection lc ocd and uplc q exactive ms finally the membrane fouling propensity of smps collected from e coli at various growth phases in different media was investigated and compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ethanol methanol isopropanol acetonitrile hplc grade or equivalent glucose sodium acetate and all other inorganic salts of the minimal 9 m9 culture medium were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa ultrapure water obtained

e coli atcc25922 was obtained from guangdong microbial culture collection center gdmcc china the e coli strains were first activated in luria bertani lb medium then the activated e coli strains were subcultured in m9 media with different carbon sources five times according to the procedure reported by goldford et al 2018 specifically two kinds of m9 media compositions g l 1 na2po4 7h2o 12 8 kh2po4 3 nacl 0 5 nh4cl 1 mgso4 0 24 cacl2 0 01 with 1000 mg cod l of glucose and sodium acetate as carbon sources were used for e coli strain cultivation fifty millimeter cultures with 45 ml m9 media and 5 ml e coli strains were allowed to grow for 24 h at 150 rpm at 37 c during the fifth cultivation a small amount of cultured samples was collected every two hours and their optical densities od600 were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv2700 shimadzu japan to determine the growth curves all experiments were conducted in triplicate then the smps were collected by centrifuging the above collected cultures at 3500 rpm for 15 min followed by filtering the supernatant through a 0 45 µm acetate cellulose membrane filter the bacterial growth in these two media presented different growth curves fig 1 a hence the samples collected at 4 8 and 18 h were representative of exponential stationary and senescent phases of growth in the glucose medium and are denoted as g4 g8 and g18 respectively analogously the samples collected at 6 12 18 h were representative of growth in acetate medium and are denoted as a6 a12 and a18 respectively all the smp samples were stored in a 80 c refrigerator for further analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chemical analysis and uv vis spectroscopy the dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of the smps were determined using a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan the concentration of acetate was measured using a gas chromatograph gc 2014c shimadzu japan equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30 cm 0 25 mm 0 25 mm fused silica capillary column the polysaccharide and protein concentrations were determined by the phenol sulfuric acid and lowry methods respectively lowry et al 1951 masuko et al 2005 the uv vis absorption spectra 200 800 nm of the smps were measured using a uv 2700 spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cuvette the specific uv254 absorbance suva254 and the ratio of spectral slopes sr were calculated following the previous definitions helms et al 2008 weishaar et al 2003 which have been utilized to roughly estimate the aromaticity and apparent molecular weight of smps respectively the absorbance slope index asi was determined according to the definition reported by maqbool et al 2017a which is capable of evaluating average molecular weight of the humic substances from microbial activity it has been reported that the uv vis absorbance in the wavelength range of 250 270 nm could be appropriate for estimation of smps in biological treatment processes carvallo et al 2007 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 thus the integration of absorption intensity of 250 270 nm 1 nm resolution was involved to represent the concentration of the total smps tsmps arbitrary units a u helms et al 2008 2 3 2 fluorescence eems parafac and self organizing maps som analyses fluorescence eems of the smps were acquired with a fluorescence spectrometer aqualog uv 800 horiba jobin yvon japan by scanning the samples over excitation and emission wavelengths from 220 to 400 nm at 5 nm intervals and from 248 58 to 830 59 nm with a 4 pixels i e 2 36 nm scanning step respectively the bandpass and resolution were set at 5 nm and the integration time was 1 s to minimize the complexation between metal ions and smps the ph of the samples was adjusted to 3 0 0 2 using 0 2 m hcl prior to measurement baghoth et al 2011 eems of ultrapure water obtained after every six measurements were subtracted from the smp samples to remove the raman scatter peaks the fluorescence intensity of the smp samples was normalized based on the raman unit equivalent r u both the biological index bix and humification index hix were calculated following the methods provided by hansen et al 2016 which reflect the extents of endogenous production and humification of dissolved organic matter dom respectively parafac modeling was performed on a combined eem dataset of 78 collected smp samples using matlab r2014 with the domflour toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 the model is able to decompose the eems of samples to several distinct fluorescence components based on residual analyses sum of squared error and split half analyses ultimately a 5 component model was determined in this study the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax obtained by parafac analyses can be used to quantitatively study the changes in each fluorescence component in the smp samples kohonen s som is an unsupervised self learning artificial neutral network capable of converting complex three dimensional fluorescence data

measurement a quality control qc sample was prepared by mixing 10 µl of each smp extraction sample to monitor the stability of the system and reliability of the data the details about uplc ms operation and data analysis were provided as text s1 in the supporting information si 2 4 ultrafiltration uf experiments the membrane fouling propensities of smps were evaluated on a stirred dead end system msc050 mosu corp china with an effective membrane area of 7 1 cm2 commercial flat sheet hydrophilic poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes microdyn nadir corp germany with molecular weight cut

residual impurities all the toc concentrations of the smp samples were diluted and controlled at 5 0 mg l 1 ph 7 4 0 1 before filtration to avoid the effects of different toc concentration on membrane fouling potential the filtration pressure was controlled at 80 kpa by a pressure regulator type 10 bellofram corp usa and the stirring speed in the cell was kept at 150 rpm to alleviate concentration polarization the permeate flux was continuously recorded by an electronic scale with a data login system the filtration experiment stopped when 450 ml permeate solution was collected all experiments were conducted in triplicate the details about the calculation of unified membrane fouling index umfi and membrane fouling resistance rf m 1 can be found in si text s2 the fouled membranes were then subjected to physical and chemical cleaning to study the reversibility of the fouling physical cleaning was carried out by ultrasonic cleaning the fouled membranes for 3 min followed by ultrapure

exhibited carbon source dependent properties fig 1 a the growth curves of e coli with glucose and acetate as carbon sources showed exponential stationary and senescent phases at 1 8 h 8 14 h and 14 24 h and 2 10 h 10 14 h and 14 24 h respectively compared with acetate the utilization of glucose was faster the glucose concentration remarkably decreased in the exponential phase while a sharp decrease in the acetate concentration occurred after 4 h of growth fig s1 a slight production and accumulation of acetate in glucose medium during the first 10 h of growth was observed likely because acetate was an extracellular co product of e coli during aerobic fermentation eiteman and altman 2006 the decreases in the doc concentrations were consistent with the utilization of glucose and acetate fig s2 a the slight increase in the doc concentrations in the senescent phase was attributable to the release of intracellular organic components induced by cell lysis a previous study had reported that when microorganisms undergone endogenous respiration cell lysis would happen resulting in the release of eps that could be further hydrolysed into smps ng et al 2006 in another study high concentrations of fulvic like fluorescent component were observed in an acetate fed sbr during endogenous phase which was associated with the intracellular proteins released from disrupted cells ly et al 2019 as shown in fig s2 b e coli cultured in glucose medium produced a considerable amount of proteins along with the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase resulting from fast glucose utilization eiteman and altman 2006 oh et al 2002 then the protein contents of smps produced in both media increased gradually towards a stable stage in the senescent phase it is apparent that the generation of smps was carbon source dependent and higher tsmps were produced throughout the whole growth lifecycle in glucose medium than in acetate medium fig 1 b the utilization of glucose might be more energetically favorable in comparison with the degradation of acetate which led to higher production of smps kunacheva et al 2020 kuo et al 1996 overall tsmps collected from both media increased gradually as the incubation time increased and reached the maximum values in the stationary phase some fluctuations in tsmps in the stationary and senescent phases may be associated with the consumption and transformation of biodegradable components as well as the release of intracellular organic matter by the decay of microorganisms jiang et al 2008 the suva254 values rapidly increased as the microorganisms grew from the late exponential phase to the stationary phase regardless of the carbon source fig 1 c mainly attributable to the formation of smps rich in aromatic structures upon microbial metabolism ly et al 2019 the suva254 values of smps grown in glucose medium reached a relatively steady state after 10 h of cultivation while those grown in acetate medium decreased in the senescent phase due to the degradation of smps in the biomass endogenous phase tian et al 2011 contrary to the variations in suva254 the sr values decreased gradually as the microorganisms grew from the exponential phase to the stationary phase indicating that metabolites with larger molecular weights accumulated slowly in both media the slight increase in sr values in the senescent phase was mainly due to the degradation of metabolites i e the utilization or breakup of large size biopolymers tian et al 2011 the higher asi values of glucose fed smps from the exponential phase to the stationary phase 0 to 10 h indicated that the smps formed in glucose medium contained a high fraction of humics with large molecular weights during this period maqbool et al 2017b fig s3 lc ocd analyses showed that the major organic fractions in the exponential phase were lmw organics regardless of the carbon source with increasing cultivation time biopolymers and humic substances started to accumulate in the stationary and senescent phases fig s4 and s5 in comparison with acetate fed cultures glucose fed cultures produced more biopolymers in the senescent phase the apparent molecular weight of smps gradually increased with substrate utilization which was consistent with the sr results fig 1 d in addition the hydrophobic fraction of smps consistently increased with the growth of microorganisms in both media which might be related to the increase in the contents of proteins and aromatic substances 3 2 dynamic variations of fluorescent dom components at different carbon sources five fluorescent dom fdom components including humic like c1 fulvic like c2 c4 and tryptophan like c5 substances were identified using eem parafac modeling table s1 and fig s6 which were associated with microbial activity as reported in the literature carstea et al 2016 ly et al 2018 ni et al 2010 yu et al 2015 the dynamic variations of each fdom component upon cultivation at different carbon sources were tracked using fmax fig 2 it was apparent that the fates of the fdom components were dependent on the carbon source glucose fed smps had higher contents of humic substances c1 c4 than acetate fed ones while smps collected from both media exhibited similar contents of tryptophan like substances c5 the c3 components in glucose fed smps sharply increased from the exponential phase to the stationary phase while those in acetate fed smps increased slowly the c1 c2 and c4 components exhibited similar variation trends which gradually increased during cultivation in glucose medium and reached the maximum fluorescence intensity in the senescent phase 22 h this finding indicates that humic substances could be derived not only from metabolism but also from cell lysis ly et al 2018 the enrichment of humic substances was reported to be closely associated with microbial humification processes in the biological treatments maqbool et al 2016 as shown by the increase in hix values fig s7 the discrepancy in humics was likely a consequence of different metabolic pathways of e coli upon exposure to different carbon sources mccarty and rittmann 2001 e coli utilizes glucose through the phosphotransferase system the extracellular glucose can be converted to intracellular glucose 6 phosphate followed by metabolism via the glycolytic pathway to produce energy and biosynthesize precursors on the other hand e coli uptakes acetate and converts it to acetyl coa which is further metabolized via the glyoxylate shunt and tri carboxylic acid cycle oh et al 2002 as the acetate was known to reduce biosynthesis rate of dna rna protein and lipid less substances were often observed in acetate fed cultures in comparison with those in glucose fed ones eiteman and altman 2006 the fmax fluctuations of the c1 c4 components from the stationary phase to the senescent phase revealed that these generated humics could be utilized by microorganisms under substrate deficient conditions or transformed into species without fluorophores ly et al 2018 unlike the dynamic trends of the humic substances the microbial protein like component c5 displayed a consistent increasing trend over the growth period under both carbon source conditions the fmax values of c5 displayed a stable increase from the exponential phase to the stationary phase under both carbon source conditions which were consistent with the protein concentration results fig s2 b then their slight decrease in the senescent phase might be associated with the utilization of proteins by microorganisms in endogenous respiration resulting in the enrichment of humic substances maqbool et al 2017b thus c5 should be an important component of bap dominated smps som analysis is a promising tool used for the classification and clustering of smps or dom and it is capable of visualizing variations of fluorophores of e coli at various growth stages cuss and guéguen 2016 the unified distance matrix u matrix color map fig s8 a can display the degree of difference between adjoining units by the color difference normally dark blue suggests similarity between neighboring units while dark red indicates a large difference in the intensity of fluorescence compositions the best matching unit bmu map fig s8 b presents the distribution of similar samples combining u matrix and bmu maps it can be inferred that the smp samples cultivated from the lag phase to the exponential phase within 4 h located in the blue area in the top right corner in fig s8 a had similar fluorescence compositions regardless of the carbon source likewise the smps generated in the stationary and senescent phases in acetate medium located in the blue area in the left middle had similar characteristics in our previous study a combination of u matrix and bmu maps visually exhibited seasonal changes in the fluorescence compositions of leachate during membrane bioreactor nanofiltration treatment yang et al 2019 herein the smp samples were further classified into 5 clusters based on a secondary clustering algorithm e g k means and bmu fig s8 c the characteristics of smps formed in the early stage of the growth curves were similar with the extension of the growth cycle the carbon sources played a significant role in the large difference in the features of smps the component planes as one of the most useful features of som can visualize the distributions of five parafac components across the entire sample set fig 3 cuss and guéguen 2016 components 1 2 and 4 exhibited similar variation trends with fluorescence intensities increasing from the top right corner to the bottom left corner while component 3 was enhanced from the top left corner to the bottom right corner component 5 exhibited a remarkably different variation trends from the others which showed the strongest fluorescence intensity located at the left middle part combining the k means clusters and component planes results it can be seen that fewer fluorophores were formed in the cluster i and ii the definitions of the clusters were provided in the fig s8 smps in cluster v contained more humic substances than those in cluster iii and smps in both clusters iii and v were rich in tryptophan like components the component planes visually displayed that the humic substances were more abundant in smp samples produced in the senescent phase in glucose medium than in those produced in acetate medium which was consistent with the above fmax results fig 2 the decrease in tryptophan like components in glucose fed smps in the late senescent phase component 5 in cluster v indicated that the proteinaceous compounds were more easily utilized and transformed into humic like substances in endogenous respiration maqbool et al 2017b 3 3 molecular characterization of smps in various growth phases uplc q exactive ms is a very powerful tool to identify the metabolic components of smps the molecular compositions of smps in various growth phases of e coli cultured in both media were analyzed by uplc q exactive ms and after analysis approximately 1790 molecular compositions in the form of c c h h n n o o s s p p in the m z range of 80 to 1200 were assigned it has been reported that metabolite identification via lc ms based methods is highly dependent on the selected database and normally only small amounts of compounds are identified due to the limited entries of molecular information in the database feng et al 2015 tipthara et al 2017 to fully understand the compositions of metabolites an alternative data processing method is needed the van krevelen vk diagram as a very useful graphical tool has been widely used to visualize the complex chemical compositions of dom in wastewater soil and plant biomass extracts and cloud samples bianco et al 2018 this study is the first to employ a vk diagram for metabolite analysis by defining the cut offs of the elemental h c and o c ratios on the y axis and x axis respectively the vk diagrams of the metabolites of e coli in various growth phases cultured with different carbon sources can be divided into seven regions and each region corresponds to a specific compound class table s2 and fig s9 the vk diagrams revealed that the lipids like alipatic peptides like and carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules crams like were the most abundant classes in all the samples while fewer compounds belonged to the unsaturated hydrocarbons carbohydrates like aromatic structures and highly oxygenated compounds hocs classes the saturated species are in the upper left part of the diagram fewer carbohydrates like compounds were identified because of their poor ionization in the negative electrospray ionization mode to intuitively track the dynamic changes of the metabolites of e coli in different growth phases a normalization data processing method was adopted to compare the compositions of two adjacent phases fig 4 the differential metabolites between the growth phases were defined by the criteria of a fold change fc 2 and p values 0 05 student s t test as previously suggested theriot et al 2014 the fold changes of all the metabolites were calculated in r using the ggplot function within the package ggplot2 team 2020 moreover the fc distribution and numbers of compounds that were significantly changed in each vk class were summarized and analyzed using r fig s10 and s11 regardless of the carbon source as the microorganisms entered the stationary phase from the exponential phase g4 vs g8 and a6 vs a12 most components of smps increased fig s10 compared with the glucose fed case smps formed in acetate medium contained more crams peptides like aromatic and carbohydrates like components crams consist of carboxylated alicyclic compounds with large molecular weights peptides are building blocks of proteins which are composed of amino acid residues lipids like compounds are normally cell membrane components bianco et al 2018 all these substances are associated with microbiological activity as the microorganisms entered the senescent phase most of the compositions did not change significantly see the white circle in fig 4 b and d in the glucose fed cases g8 vs g18 some components in crams lipids like unsaturated hydrocarbons and aromatic classes decreased due to the utilization of smps in endogenous respiration while some hoc components increased fig s10 hocs are oxidized species cluster including polyphenolic compounds containing hydroxyl and carboxylic groups li et al 2019 the increase in hoc components might be related to the transformation of proteinaceous compounds into humic like substances during endogenous respiration which was consistent with the eem results in acetate fed cases a12 vs a18 partial crams and lipids like components decreased while carbohydrates like components increased carbohydrates like compounds contain carbohydrate lipid and acetate groups bianco et al 2018 which should be derived from cell debris ly et al 2019 3 4 roles of smps in uf membrane fouling regardless of the carbon source the fouling potentials of smps collected in different growth phases followed the order of senescent phase 18 h stationary phase 8 or 12 h exponential phase 4 or 6 h as presented in fig 5 a and b the corresponding umfi values were 19 9 9 1 and 1 1 10 3 m2 l for smps collected from glucose medium and 19 7 13 9 and 2 4 10 3 m2 l for smps collected from acetate medium respectively fig s12 in the exponential phase the smps were a mixture of uaps and remaining substrates while in the stationary and senescent phases the smps consisted of uap dominated components and bap dominated components respectively the bap dominated smps had much higher fouling potentials than the uap dominated smps fig s12 the flux recovery rates of the membrane by physical cleaning were 68 53 and 22 for smps collected in the exponential stationary and senescent phases from glucose medium and 54 8 and 9 for those produced in acetate medium respectively fig 5 c and d chemical cleaning can completely recover the performances of glucose smp fouled membranes however for the acetate fed cases only the performance of the membrane fouled by exponential phase smps was completely recovered indicating that for glucose carbon source smps that formed throughout the lifecycle were responsible for irremovable membrane fouling while for acetate smps formed in the stationary and senescent phases resulted in irreversible membrane fouling meng et al 2009 although the tsmps generated in the glucose medium for both uap and bap dominated smps were slightly higher than those with acetate as carbon source smps that formed in the acetate medium showed a higher membrane fouling propensity this finding suggests that organic carbon sources can change the biochemical compositions of smps by affecting the metabolic pathways of microorganisms thus affecting their membrane fouling behaviors the pure water permeability of the naclo cleaned membrane was slightly higher than that of the pristine membrane in glucose fed smp cases likely due to the enlargement of the pore size and surface modification by the chemical detergent zhao et al 2017 4 discussion 4 1 carbon source and growth phase dependent properties of smps smps are organic complexes consisting of substrate metabolites and released compounds from cell lysis which are the major organic foulants in membrane based biological wastewater treatment processes jarusutthirak and amy 2007 given the complex bacterial community in an activated sludge system previous reports on the effects of several operation parameters e g carbon source c n ratio temperature and sludge retention time on the characteristics of smps might be contradictory to each other hu et al 2019 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 ly et al 2019 ly et al 2018 maddela et al 2018 herein we used a pure culture to investigate the effects of the carbon source and growth phase on smp abundance and composition at both the compound and molecular levels and attempted to link these factors to membrane fouling our results revealed that smp production and properties were carbon source and incubation time dependent the utilization of glucose was faster than acetate in the early exponential phase likely because of the faster adaptation of e coli to glucose this finding was different from a previous study where the acetate utilization rate was faster than the glucose utilization rate in a sequencing batch reactor with a complex bacterial community ly et al 2019 in fact the presence of short chain acids were reported to reduce the biosynthesis rate of rna dna protein and lipid of e coli which might affect the transcription translation machinery in e coli eiteman and altman 2006 compared with glucose as carbon source e coli consumes more resources for metabolism at the cost of growth when cultured with acetate oh et al 2002 the tsmps generated in glucose medium were higher than those produced in acetate medium which was ascribed to the higher free energy yielded by glucose a higher free energy can promote the production of biomass as evidenced by the higher doc concentration of glucose fed smp samples kunacheva et al 2020 kuo et al 1996 fig s2 in general generation and release of smps accompany substrate uptake meanwhile biodegradable smps can also serve as substrates for the new production of biomass jarusutthirak and amy 2007 in the exponential phase smps were a mixture of uaps and remaining substrates with low molecular weights fewer fluorophores and lower hydrophobicity as the microorganisms grew into the stationary phase the substrates were gradually used up and uaps became the dominant components biopolymers and humic substances with higher molecular weights and hydrophobicity gradually increased in the senescent phase baps appeared to be the major components under substrate deficient conditions maqbool et al 2017a tian et al 2011 in the senescent phase the glucose fed smps had more humic substances than the acetate fed smps possibly because of the utilization and transformation of proteinaceous compounds into humic substances in endogenous respiration maqbool et al 2017b normally uaps can be directly utilized by microorganisms while baps need to undergo a transformation into readily biodegradable dom for subsequent consumption by microorganisms under substrate deficient conditions tian et al 2011 these explain the fluctuations of the fmax values observed for c1 c4 components during the stationary and senescent phases at the molecular level smps formed in acetate medium contained more crams peptides like aromatic and carbohydrates like components in comparison with those with glucose as the carbon source in the stationary and senescent phases which played a significant role in irreversible membrane fouling as discussed below 4 2 membrane fouling mechanism smps formed in various growth phases played a significant role in membrane fouling behavior fig 5 to further investigate the fouling mechanism of smps four classic filtration models including complete blockage intermediate blocking cake filtration and standard blocking were compared fig s13 and s14 for smps collected in the exponential phases consisting of uaps and remaining substrates standard blocking appeared to be the main fouling mechanism because of their smaller molecular size these small molecules readily adsorbed and accumulated on the walls of membrane pores resulting in the decline of permeate flux ly et al 2019 tian et al 2011 with the growth of microorganisms uap and bap dominated smps gradually aggravated membrane fouling the cake filtration model became the main fouling mechanism moreover a standard blocking model with a good fit might also be the fouling mechanism of smps collected in the stationary and senescent phases the uap and bap dominated smps induced severe membrane fouling could be explained by the following aspects first more biopolymer and humic fractions of smps were enriched along with the growth of microorganisms fig s4 which could elevate the membrane fouling potential ly et al 2019 second the molecular weight of smps gradually increased enhancing their gelating ability teng et al 2020 third the hydrophobic components in smps gradually increased aggravating membrane fouling due to the enhancement of hydrophobic interactions between foulants and the membrane zheng et al 2014 the formation of a cake layer by adsorption and deposition of large molecules such as biopolymers and humics on the membrane surface significantly increased the filtration resistance tian et al 2011 tian et al 2013 last but not least from the molecular level point of view the membrane fouling potentials of smps were related to their unique chemical compositions during the stationary and senescent phases i e uap and bap rich smps crams and peptides like components increased markedly crams are organics rich in carboxylic groups which readily interact with di multivalent cations to form cation stabilized fouling layers independent of the type of membrane via cation bridging effects maddela et al 2018 zheng et al 2014 at ph 7 7 5 the electrostatic attraction between positively charged peptides and the negatively charged membrane surface could strengthen the fouling effect moreover the intermolecular interactions between peptides through hydrophobic residues may further enhance the adsorption of peptides like compounds on the membrane surface persico et al 2017 compared with the glucose fed cases smps formed in acetate medium showed a higher membrane fouling propensity likely because they contained more crams peptides like aromatic and carbohydrates like components cation carbohydrates complexation also contributed to severe membrane fouling xin et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 4 3 environmental implications the mbrs market has been increasing significantly during the last few decades due to its merits of a small footprint excellent effluent quality and high nutrient removal efficiency shi et al 2020 xiao et al 2014 however membrane fouling inevitably occurs meng et al 2020 the frequent chemical cleaning increases the operation cost and shortens the membrane lifetime in this study we found that the production and properties of smps were highly dependent on the organic carbon substrate and growth phase this can to a certain extent update our understanding of both smp formation and membrane fouling mechanisms for instance the specific chemical compositions of smps largely determined the fouling type such as irremovable and irreversible fouling our results could provide implications for real mbr applications for example a previous study showed that a large amount of biomacromolecules including colloids and smps with larger molecular weight were produced by the sludge during nutrients deficiency period in deceleration growth phase in a mbr which resulted in severe membrane fouling zhou et al 2012 in our study the tsmps also reached the maximum values at the beginning of stationary phase fig 1 b which was consistent with the above mbr case the previous study showed that the biomacromolecules produced in the deceleration growth phase had higher fouling rate than those produced in the exponential and stationary phases while our results suggested that smps produced in the stationary and senescent phases had higher fouling potential it should be noted that the concentrations of biomacromolecules produced in different growth phases varied greatly in the real mbr ranging from 42 6 stationary growth phase to 229 1 deceleration growth phase mg l zhou et al 2012 thus both quantity and quality of biomacromolecules contributed to membrane fouling a higher concentration of smps could interact with membrane surface strongly to form a gel layer resulting in severe membrane fouling wu et al 2020 in contrast our study focused on the effects of smps compositions on the fouling potential by controlling the toc of smps at a constant value our findings could provide fundamental understanding about the impacts of smps chemical compositions on the fouling mechanisms moreover smps with larger molecular weight was found to present higher fouling potential in a real mbr due to their increased gelating ability teng et al 2020 which was consistent with our results overall our current findings can be extrapolated to the study of smps in real mbrs in mbr operations an effective fouling control strategy could be achieved by optimizing the sludge retention time srt to regulate the microbial growth phases and further control smp concentrations and compositions currently glucose and acetate are widely used as carbon sources for enhancing denitrification in wwtps our findings could provide instructive opinions for the selection of carbon sources for denitrification in wwtps in this study it was found that glucose can lead to the production of more smps in comparison with acetate which can affect the effluent quality of wwtps after being discharged into the environment the adsorption and deposition of smps onto environmental surfaces will affect subsequent environmental phenomena such as carbon cycling competition adsorption of cations and interfacial interactions among contaminants li et al 2018 for instance we found that the smps formed in different growth phases had different adsorption capabilities on sio2 and al2o3 surfaces fig s15 and s16 suggesting that the deposition capabilities of smps on environmental surfaces were largely related to bacterial growth stages and carbon sources further studies should be conducted to clearly understand the fate of smps in natural aquatic environments in addition optimizing biological processes and improving effluent quality could potentially reduce the impacts of smps on the environment 5 conclusions this study systematically investigated the influences of organic carbon source and growth phase on the chemical natures of smps of a model strain e coli the roles of smps in membrane fouling were also comprehensively explored the conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the smp production and properties were carbon source and growth phase dependent smp contents generated in glucose medium were higher than those produced in acetate medium in the exponential phase smps consisted of uaps and remaining substrates while in the stationary and senescent phases uaps and baps were the main constituents respectively 2 the eem parafac results showed that glucose fed smps had higher concentrations of humic fluorescence components than acetate fed smps van krevelen diagrams revealed that the smps cultured in both media were rich in crams peptides like lipids like and unsaturated hydrocarbon compounds compared with glucose fed smps smps collected in acetate medium contained more crams peptides like aromatic and carbohydrates like components 3 smps played a significant role in membrane fouling behavior during uf standard blocking and cake filtration were the main fouling mechanisms for the filtration of smps collected in the exponential and stationary senescent phases respectively bap dominated smps had much higher fouling potentials than the uap dominated ones the higher membrane fouling propensity of acetate fed smps was largely related to their unique compositions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

17191,the complexity of production process and chemical compositions of soluble microbial products smps largely limits the understanding of membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors mbrs herein we used a model single strain escherichia coli to better understand the chemical natures of smps and their roles in membrane fouling the effects of carbon source and growth phase on the chemical compositions of smps were identified at both the compound and molecular levels by using advanced techniques including excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis eem parafac size exclusion chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection lc ocd and untargeted ultra performance liquid chromatography q exactive mass spectrometry uplc q exactive ms subsequently the roles of smps in the propensity of membrane fouling during ultrafiltration uf were studied the results showed that the chemical compositions and fouling potentials of smps were carbon source and growth phase dependent in the exponential phase smps mainly consisted of utilization associated products uaps and remaining substrates as the microorganism progressed into the stationary and senescent phases uaps and biomass associated products baps were the main components respectively the smp contents generated in glucose medium were higher than those generated in acetate medium and higher abundances of humic fluorescent components were observed in glucose fed smps van krevelen diagrams of the uplc ms results revealed that acetate fed smps contained more carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules peptides like aromatic and carbohydrates like components than glucose fed smps in the stationary and senescent phases these components played a significant role in irreversible membrane fouling as evidenced in uf experiments standard blocking and cake filtration were the main fouling mechanisms for the filtration of smps collected in the exponential and stationary senescent phases respectively our findings highlight linkages between smp compositions and membrane fouling at both the compound and molecular levels and suggest that both the carbon source and growth phase strongly determine the production potential chemical nature and fouling behavior of smps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords soluble microbial products escherichia coli carbon source growth lifecycle membrane fouling 1 introduction membrane fouling is the major bottleneck for the wide application of membrane bioreactors mbrs meng et al 2009 and increases the operation cost and reduces membrane lifetime soluble microbial products smps are known to be the main source of membrane foulants in mbrs jarusutthirak and amy 2006 2007 kunacheva et al 2020 and are a complex mixture consisting of proteins polysaccharides amino acids humic substances etc hu et al 2019 tian et al 2011 in general smps can be categorized into two groups utilization associated products uaps and biomass associated products baps uaps are produced from substrate metabolism and biomass growth while baps are associated with biomass decay and cell lysis during the endogenous phase kunacheva and stuckey 2014 ni et al 2010 thus the growth stages of microbes can largely determine the compositions of smps the production and transformation of smps in biological systems are usually complex the relative abundance and chemical compositions of smps are largely influenced by various factors such as carbon source c n ratio sludge retention time organic loading rate and growth phase hu et al 2019 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 ly et al 2019 ly et al 2018 maqbool et al 2017a zhou et al 2012 organic carbon source as the main energy source markedly determine the metabolism of microorganisms and smp production for example smps generated in a sodium acetate fed sequencing batch reactor sbr contained higher concentrations of protein like fluorescent components and large sized aliphatic biopolymers among the three sbrs fed with different carbon sources i e sodium acetate glucose and starch ly et al 2019 the nature of carbon source could also regulate the biosynthetic pathway of free extracellular polysaccharides and the monomeric saccharide composition fructose fed reactor produced less total free extracellular polysaccharides than those in the glucose grown cultures le and stuckey 2017 in addition when toxic phenol was used as carbon source more carbon flowed into the extracellular components resulting in higher smps formation potentials than those with acetate as carbon source wu et al 2018 uaps are normally the dominant smp composition under a substrate sufficient condition while extracellular or intracellular polymeric substances eps or ips can be consumed by their own producers as an alternative substrate when substrate is deficient resulting in the enrichment of baps maqbool et al 2017a therefore these previous efforts further suggest that carbon sources and biomass growth phases should be taken in full consideration when exploring the production and chemical traits of smps it should be noted that the so called uaps and baps are normally obtained or classified according to the overall evolution of the biomass concentrations of a mixed culture nonetheless the bacterial species in a mixed culture have quite different growth rates with a doubling time ranging from a couple of minutes to a couple of days gray et al 2019 long et al 2020 thus the production of uaps and baps is strongly bacteria species dependent one of our previous studies showed that bacterial strains belonging to a given genus bacillus had quite different eps production potentials and thus different fouling behaviors maddela et al 2018 the eps of the medium and high fouling strains had higher concentrations of polysaccharide and protein components such as α 1 4 glycosidic bond and amide ii groups in comparison with those of low fouling strains moreover the eps of the medium and high fouling strains had higher gelling capabilities due to the presence of unique components such as uronic acids and o acetyl previous studies showed that operation conditions could affect the metabolism of microorganisms influencing the reactor performance and the production of smps and eps zhou et al 2012 for example the day night temperature differences dntd in a mbr could affect functional bacteria e g the growth of nitrospina nitrite oxidizing bacteria and tetrasphaera phosphate accumulating organisms were inhibited by dntd operation zhang et al 2018 the exposure to oxidation chemicals such as naclo can induce the release of eps by microorganisms cai and liu 2016 compared with escherichia coli e coli and mycobacterium aurum staphylococcus epidermidis produced a significant higher amount of eps under naclo exposure helbling and vanbriesen 2007 these findings further corroborate the significance of bacterial species on smp and eps formation thus the major motivation of this work is to reveal smp production at the bacterial species level to provide clear information regarding the characteristics of smps and their membrane fouling potential in addition to the complex formation or source of smps their complex chemical nature is another factor limiting the understanding of the compositions and behaviors of smps to date smps are mainly characterized or identified at the compound level such as hydrophilicity hydrophobicity fractions shi et al 2018 molecular weight distributions huber et al 2011 ly et al 2019 fluorescent components and functional groups kunacheva and stuckey 2014 ly et al 2018 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 compound level characterization largely limits knowledge regarding the membrane fouling mechanism of smps if individual smp compounds can be identified then it would be possible to track the dynamic changes of smps at the molecular level and clearly reveal their membrane fouling mechanisms ni et al 2010 untargeted ultra performance liquid chromatography q exactive mass spectrometry uplc q exactive ms based metabolomics has been widely applied to complex biological samples hou et al 2012 this approach is capable of distinguishing individual organic compound enabling the identification of the components of smps at the molecular level lc ms based approaches have been applied to identify and compare components of smps from different phases of anaerobic digestion kunacheva et al 2020 tipthara et al 2017 we expect that characterizing the smp profiles of model species at both the compound and molecular levels will provide new insights into the membrane fouling mechanism of smps under different conditions therefore the objective of this study is to use a model strain e coli to systematically explore the effects of carbon source and growth phase on the chemical compositions of smps at both the compound and molecular levels and to reveal their roles in membrane fouling during ultrafiltration e coli as a model strain has been widely used in eps and membrane fouling studies eboigbodin and biggs 2008 hilal et al 2004 the complete genome sequence of e coli is currently available which can provide information for reconstructing its complete metabolic networks edwards et al 2001 therein the utilization of different carbon sources by e coli has been reported eiteman and altman 2006 oh et al 2002 which might help to fundamentally understand its smps production thus the e coli was chosen as a model strain in this study glucose and sodium acetate were selected as the carbon sources in this study as they had different substrate utilization rates and metabolic pathways by e coli it has been reported that acetic acid was an extracellular co product of e coli during aerobic fermentation eiteman and altman 2006 although such short chain acid also serves as a carbon source of e coli it might reduce the biosynthesis rate of several proteins in addition glucose and acetate are widely used carbon sources for enhancing denitrification in wastewater treatment plants wwtps thus investigating the effects of carbon source on chemical compositions of smps and their membrane fouling mechanisms was of significance for membrane fouling control in mbr applications the dynamic changes in the chemical compositions of smps of e coli in various growth phases were characterized using advanced analyses including fluorescence excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis eem parafac size exclusion chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection lc ocd and uplc q exactive ms finally the membrane fouling propensity of smps collected from e coli at various growth phases in different media was investigated and compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ethanol methanol isopropanol acetonitrile hplc grade or equivalent glucose sodium acetate and all other inorganic salts of the minimal 9 m9 culture medium were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa ultrapure water obtained from a milli q system merck millipore usa was used for preparing all aqueous solutions all the chemicals were used without any purification 2 2 cultivation of e coli and smps extraction gram negative e coli atcc25922 was obtained from guangdong microbial culture collection center gdmcc china the e coli strains were first activated in luria bertani lb medium then the activated e coli strains were subcultured in m9 media with different carbon sources five times according to the procedure reported by goldford et al 2018 specifically two kinds of m9 media compositions g l 1 na2po4 7h2o 12 8 kh2po4 3 nacl 0 5 nh4cl 1 mgso4 0 24 cacl2 0 01 with 1000 mg cod l of glucose and sodium acetate as carbon sources were used for e coli strain cultivation fifty millimeter cultures with 45 ml m9 media and 5 ml e coli strains were allowed to grow for 24 h at 150 rpm at 37 c during the fifth cultivation a small amount of cultured samples was collected every two hours and their optical densities od600 were measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv2700 shimadzu japan to determine the growth curves all experiments were conducted in triplicate then the smps were collected by centrifuging the above collected cultures at 3500 rpm for 15 min followed by filtering the supernatant through a 0 45 µm acetate cellulose membrane filter the bacterial growth in these two media presented different growth curves fig 1 a hence the samples collected at 4 8 and 18 h were representative of exponential stationary and senescent phases of growth in the glucose medium and are denoted as g4 g8 and g18 respectively analogously the samples collected at 6 12 18 h were representative of growth in acetate medium and are denoted as a6 a12 and a18 respectively all the smp samples were stored in a 80 c refrigerator for further analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chemical analysis and uv vis spectroscopy the dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of the smps were determined using a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan the concentration of acetate was measured using a gas chromatograph gc 2014c shimadzu japan equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 30 cm 0 25 mm 0 25 mm fused silica capillary column the polysaccharide and protein concentrations were determined by the phenol sulfuric acid and lowry methods respectively lowry et al 1951 masuko et al 2005 the uv vis absorption spectra 200 800 nm of the smps were measured using a uv 2700 spectrophotometer with a 1 cm quartz cuvette the specific uv254 absorbance suva254 and the ratio of spectral slopes sr were calculated following the previous definitions helms et al 2008 weishaar et al 2003 which have been utilized to roughly estimate the aromaticity and apparent molecular weight of smps respectively the absorbance slope index asi was determined according to the definition reported by maqbool et al 2017a which is capable of evaluating average molecular weight of the humic substances from microbial activity it has been reported that the uv vis absorbance in the wavelength range of 250 270 nm could be appropriate for estimation of smps in biological treatment processes carvallo et al 2007 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 thus the integration of absorption intensity of 250 270 nm 1 nm resolution was involved to represent the concentration of the total smps tsmps arbitrary units a u helms et al 2008 2 3 2 fluorescence eems parafac and self organizing maps som analyses fluorescence eems of the smps were acquired with a fluorescence spectrometer aqualog uv 800 horiba jobin yvon japan by scanning the samples over excitation and emission wavelengths from 220 to 400 nm at 5 nm intervals and from 248 58 to 830 59 nm with a 4 pixels i e 2 36 nm scanning step respectively the bandpass and resolution were set at 5 nm and the integration time was 1 s to minimize the complexation between metal ions and smps the ph of the samples was adjusted to 3 0 0 2 using 0 2 m hcl prior to measurement baghoth et al 2011 eems of ultrapure water obtained after every six measurements were subtracted from the smp samples to remove the raman scatter peaks the fluorescence intensity of the smp samples was normalized based on the raman unit equivalent r u both the biological index bix and humification index hix were calculated following the methods provided by hansen et al 2016 which reflect the extents of endogenous production and humification of dissolved organic matter dom respectively parafac modeling was performed on a combined eem dataset of 78 collected smp samples using matlab r2014 with the domflour toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 the model is able to decompose the eems of samples to several distinct fluorescence components based on residual analyses sum of squared error and split half analyses ultimately a 5 component model was determined in this study the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax obtained by parafac analyses can be used to quantitatively study the changes in each fluorescence component in the smp samples kohonen s som is an unsupervised self learning artificial neutral network capable of converting complex three dimensional fluorescence data

components was carried out using the som toolbox in matlab r2014 according to the previously reported procedures bieroza et al 2012 cuss and guéguen 2016 to better visualize the influence of carbon sources and growth phases on smp characteristics 26 samples 13 samples from glucose medium and 13 samples from acetate medium were subjected to som analyses 2 3 3 size exclusion chromatography

measurement a quality control qc sample was prepared by mixing 10 µl of each smp extraction sample to monitor the stability of the system and reliability of the data the details about uplc ms operation and data analysis were provided as text s1 in the supporting information si 2 4 ultrafiltration uf experiments the membrane fouling propensities of smps were evaluated on a stirred dead end system msc050 mosu corp china with an effective membrane area of 7 1 cm2 commercial flat sheet hydrophilic poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes microdyn nadir corp germany with molecular weight cut

residual impurities all the toc concentrations of the smp samples were diluted and controlled at 5 0 mg l 1 ph 7 4 0 1 before filtration to avoid the effects of different toc concentration on membrane fouling potential the filtration pressure was controlled at 80 kpa by a pressure regulator type 10 bellofram corp usa and the stirring speed in the cell was kept at 150 rpm to alleviate concentration

triplicate and the student s t test was performed to analyze the difference significance in the metrics 3 results 3 1 biochemical properties of smps in various growth phases the growth of e coli exhibited carbon source dependent properties fig 1 a the growth curves of e coli with glucose and acetate as carbon sources showed exponential stationary and senescent phases at 1 8 h 8 14 h and 14 24 h and 2 10 h 10 14 h and 14 24 h respectively compared with acetate the utilization of glucose was faster the glucose concentration remarkably decreased in the exponential phase while a sharp decrease in the acetate concentration occurred after 4 h of growth fig s1 a slight production and accumulation of acetate in glucose medium during the first 10 h of growth was observed likely because acetate was an extracellular co product of e coli during aerobic fermentation eiteman and altman 2006 the decreases in the doc concentrations were consistent with the utilization of glucose and acetate fig s2 a the slight increase in the doc concentrations in the senescent phase was attributable to the release of intracellular organic components induced by cell lysis a previous study had reported that when microorganisms undergone endogenous respiration cell lysis would happen resulting in the release of eps that could be further hydrolysed into smps ng et al 2006 in another study high concentrations of fulvic like fluorescent component were observed in an acetate fed sbr during endogenous phase which was associated with the intracellular proteins released from disrupted cells ly et al 2019 as shown in fig s2 b e coli cultured in glucose medium produced a considerable amount of proteins along with the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase resulting from fast glucose utilization eiteman and altman 2006 oh et al 2002 then the protein contents of smps produced in both media increased gradually towards a stable stage in the senescent phase it is apparent that the generation of smps was carbon source dependent and higher tsmps were produced throughout the whole growth lifecycle in glucose medium than in acetate medium fig 1 b the utilization of glucose might be more energetically favorable in comparison with the degradation of acetate which led to higher production of smps kunacheva et al 2020 kuo et al 1996 overall tsmps collected from both media increased gradually as the incubation time increased and reached the maximum values in the stationary phase some fluctuations in tsmps in the stationary and senescent phases may be associated with the consumption and transformation of biodegradable components as well as the release of intracellular organic matter by the decay of microorganisms jiang et al 2008 the suva254 values rapidly increased as the microorganisms grew from the late exponential phase to the stationary phase regardless of the carbon source fig 1 c mainly attributable to the formation of smps rich in aromatic structures upon microbial metabolism ly et al 2019 the suva254 values of smps grown in glucose medium reached a relatively steady state after 10 h of cultivation while those grown in acetate medium decreased in the senescent phase due to the degradation of smps in the biomass endogenous phase tian et al 2011 contrary to the variations in suva254 the sr values decreased gradually as the microorganisms grew from the exponential phase to the stationary phase indicating that metabolites with larger molecular weights accumulated slowly in both media the slight increase in sr values in the senescent phase was mainly due to the degradation of metabolites i e the utilization or breakup of large size biopolymers tian et al 2011 the higher asi values of glucose fed smps from the exponential phase to the stationary phase 0 to 10 h indicated that the smps formed in glucose medium contained a high fraction of humics with large molecular weights during this period maqbool et al 2017b fig s3 lc ocd analyses showed that the major organic fractions in the exponential phase were lmw organics regardless of the carbon source with increasing cultivation time biopolymers and humic substances started to accumulate in the stationary and senescent phases fig s4 and s5 in comparison with acetate fed cultures glucose fed cultures produced more biopolymers in the senescent phase the apparent molecular weight of smps gradually increased with substrate utilization which was consistent with the sr results fig 1 d in addition the hydrophobic fraction of smps consistently increased with the growth of microorganisms in both media which might be related to the increase in the contents of proteins and aromatic substances 3 2 dynamic variations of fluorescent dom components at different carbon sources five fluorescent dom fdom components including humic like c1 fulvic like c2 c4 and tryptophan like c5 substances were identified using eem parafac modeling table s1 and fig s6 which were associated with microbial activity as reported in the literature carstea et al 2016 ly et al 2018 ni et al 2010 yu et al 2015 the dynamic variations of each fdom component upon cultivation at different carbon sources were tracked using fmax fig 2 it was apparent that the fates of the fdom components were dependent on the carbon source glucose fed smps had higher contents of humic substances c1 c4 than acetate fed ones while smps collected from both media exhibited similar contents of tryptophan like substances c5 the c3 components in glucose fed smps sharply increased from the exponential phase to the stationary phase while those in acetate fed smps increased slowly the c1 c2 and c4 components exhibited similar variation trends which gradually increased during cultivation in glucose medium and reached the maximum fluorescence intensity in the senescent phase 22 h this finding indicates that humic substances could be derived not only from metabolism but also from cell lysis ly et al 2018 the enrichment of humic substances was reported to be closely associated with microbial humification processes in the biological treatments maqbool et al 2016 as shown by the increase in hix values fig s7 the discrepancy in humics was likely a consequence of different metabolic pathways of e coli upon exposure to different carbon sources mccarty and rittmann 2001 e coli utilizes glucose through the phosphotransferase system the extracellular glucose can be converted to intracellular glucose 6 phosphate followed by metabolism via the glycolytic pathway to produce energy and biosynthesize precursors on the other hand e coli uptakes acetate and converts it to acetyl coa which is further metabolized via the glyoxylate shunt and tri carboxylic acid cycle oh et al 2002 as the acetate was known to reduce biosynthesis rate of dna rna protein and lipid less substances were often observed in acetate fed cultures in comparison with those in glucose fed ones eiteman and altman 2006 the fmax fluctuations of the c1 c4 components from the stationary phase to the senescent phase revealed that these generated humics could be utilized by microorganisms under substrate deficient conditions or transformed into species without fluorophores ly et al 2018 unlike the dynamic trends of the humic substances the microbial protein like component c5 displayed a consistent increasing trend over the growth period under both carbon source conditions the fmax values of c5 displayed a stable increase from the exponential phase to the stationary phase under both carbon source conditions which were consistent with the protein concentration results fig s2 b then their slight decrease in the senescent phase might be associated with the utilization of proteins by microorganisms in endogenous respiration resulting in the enrichment of humic substances maqbool et al 2017b thus c5 should be an important component of bap dominated smps som analysis is a promising tool used for the classification and clustering of smps or dom and it is capable of visualizing variations of fluorophores of e coli at various growth stages cuss and guéguen 2016 the unified distance matrix u matrix color map fig s8 a can display the degree of difference between adjoining units by the color difference normally dark blue suggests similarity between neighboring units while dark red indicates a large difference in the intensity of fluorescence compositions the best matching unit bmu map fig s8 b presents the distribution of similar samples combining u matrix and bmu maps it can be inferred that the smp samples cultivated from the lag phase to the exponential phase within 4 h located in the blue area in the top right corner in fig s8 a had similar fluorescence compositions regardless of the carbon source likewise the smps generated in the stationary and senescent phases in acetate medium located in the blue area in the left middle had similar characteristics in our previous study a combination of u matrix and bmu maps visually exhibited seasonal changes in the fluorescence compositions of leachate during membrane bioreactor nanofiltration treatment yang et al 2019 herein the smp samples were further classified into 5 clusters based on a secondary clustering algorithm e g k means and bmu fig s8 c the characteristics of smps formed in the early stage of the growth curves were similar with the extension of the growth cycle the carbon sources played a significant role in the large difference in the features of smps the component planes as one of the most useful features of som can visualize the distributions of five parafac components across the entire sample set fig 3 cuss and guéguen 2016 components 1 2 and 4 exhibited similar variation trends with fluorescence intensities increasing from the top right corner to the bottom left corner while component 3 was enhanced from the top left corner to the bottom right corner component 5 exhibited a remarkably different variation trends from the others which showed the strongest fluorescence intensity located at the left middle part combining the k means clusters and component planes results it can be seen that fewer fluorophores were formed in the cluster i and ii the definitions of the clusters were provided in the fig s8 smps in cluster v contained more humic substances than those in cluster iii and smps in both clusters iii and v were rich in tryptophan like components the component planes visually displayed that the humic substances were more abundant in smp samples produced in the senescent phase in glucose medium than in those produced in acetate medium which was consistent with the above fmax results fig 2 the decrease in tryptophan like components in glucose fed smps in the late senescent phase component 5 in cluster v indicated that the proteinaceous compounds were more easily utilized and transformed into humic like substances in endogenous respiration maqbool et al 2017b 3 3 molecular characterization of smps in various growth phases uplc q exactive ms is a very powerful tool to identify the metabolic components of smps the molecular compositions of smps in various growth phases of e coli cultured in both media were analyzed by uplc q exactive ms and after analysis approximately 1790 molecular compositions in the form of c c h h n n o o s s p p in the m z range of 80 to 1200 were assigned it has been reported that metabolite identification via lc ms based methods is highly dependent on the selected database and normally only small amounts of compounds are identified due to the limited entries of molecular information in the database feng et al 2015 tipthara et al 2017 to fully understand the compositions of metabolites an alternative data processing method is needed the van krevelen vk diagram as a very useful graphical tool has been widely used to visualize the complex chemical compositions of dom in wastewater soil and plant biomass extracts and cloud samples bianco et al 2018 this study is the first to employ a vk diagram for metabolite analysis by defining the cut offs of the elemental h c and o c ratios on the y axis and x axis respectively the vk diagrams of the metabolites of e coli in various growth phases cultured with different carbon sources can be divided into seven regions and each region corresponds to a specific compound class table s2 and fig s9 the vk diagrams revealed that the lipids like alipatic peptides like and carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules crams like were the most abundant classes in all the samples while fewer compounds belonged to the unsaturated hydrocarbons carbohydrates like aromatic structures and highly oxygenated compounds hocs classes the saturated species are in the upper left part of the diagram fewer carbohydrates like compounds were identified because of their poor ionization in the negative electrospray ionization mode to intuitively track the dynamic changes of the metabolites of e coli in different growth phases a normalization data processing method was adopted to compare the compositions of two adjacent phases fig 4 the differential metabolites between the growth phases were defined by the criteria of a fold change fc 2 and p values 0 05 student s t test as previously suggested theriot et al 2014 the fold changes of all the metabolites were calculated in r using the ggplot function within the package ggplot2 team 2020 moreover the fc distribution and numbers of compounds that were significantly changed in each vk class were summarized and analyzed using r fig s10 and s11 regardless of the carbon source as the microorganisms entered the stationary phase from the exponential phase g4 vs g8 and a6 vs a12 most components of smps increased fig s10 compared with the glucose fed case smps formed in acetate medium contained more crams peptides like aromatic and carbohydrates like components crams consist of carboxylated alicyclic compounds with large molecular weights peptides are building blocks of proteins which are composed of amino acid residues lipids like compounds are normally cell membrane components bianco et al 2018 all these substances are associated with microbiological activity as the microorganisms entered the senescent phase most of the compositions did not change significantly see the white circle in fig 4 b and d in the glucose fed cases g8 vs g18 some components in crams lipids like unsaturated hydrocarbons and aromatic classes decreased due to the utilization of smps in endogenous respiration while some hoc components increased fig s10 hocs are oxidized species cluster including polyphenolic compounds containing hydroxyl and carboxylic groups li et al 2019 the increase in hoc components might be related to the transformation of proteinaceous compounds into humic like substances during endogenous respiration which was consistent with the eem results in acetate fed cases a12 vs a18 partial crams and lipids like components decreased while carbohydrates like components increased carbohydrates like compounds contain carbohydrate lipid and acetate groups bianco et al 2018 which should be derived from cell debris ly et al 2019 3 4 roles of smps in uf membrane fouling regardless of the carbon source the fouling potentials of smps collected in different growth phases followed the order of senescent phase 18 h stationary phase 8 or 12 h exponential phase 4 or 6 h as presented in fig 5 a and b the corresponding umfi values were 19 9 9 1 and 1 1 10 3 m2 l for smps collected from glucose medium and 19 7 13 9 and 2 4 10 3 m2 l for smps collected from acetate medium respectively fig s12 in the exponential phase the smps were a mixture of uaps and remaining substrates while in the stationary and senescent phases the smps consisted of uap dominated components and bap dominated components respectively the bap dominated smps had much higher fouling potentials than the uap dominated smps fig s12 the flux recovery rates of the membrane by physical cleaning were 68 53 and 22 for smps collected in the exponential stationary and senescent phases from glucose medium and 54 8 and 9 for those produced in acetate medium respectively fig 5 c and d chemical cleaning can completely recover the performances of glucose smp fouled membranes however for the acetate fed cases only the performance of the membrane fouled by exponential phase smps was completely recovered indicating that for glucose carbon source smps that formed throughout the lifecycle were responsible for irremovable membrane fouling while for acetate smps formed in the stationary and senescent phases resulted in irreversible membrane fouling meng et al 2009 although the tsmps generated in the glucose medium for both uap and bap dominated smps were slightly higher than those with acetate as carbon source smps that formed in the acetate medium showed a higher membrane fouling propensity this finding suggests that organic carbon sources can change the biochemical compositions of smps by affecting the metabolic pathways of microorganisms thus affecting their membrane fouling behaviors the pure water permeability of the naclo cleaned membrane was slightly higher than that of the pristine membrane in glucose fed smp cases likely due to the enlargement of the pore size and surface modification by the chemical detergent zhao et al 2017 4 discussion 4 1 carbon source and growth phase dependent properties of smps smps are organic complexes consisting of substrate metabolites and released compounds from cell lysis which are the major organic foulants in membrane based biological wastewater treatment processes jarusutthirak and amy 2007 given the complex bacterial community in an activated sludge system previous reports on the effects of several operation parameters e g carbon source c n ratio temperature and sludge retention time on the characteristics of smps might be contradictory to each other hu et al 2019 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 ly et al 2019 ly et al 2018 maddela et al 2018 herein we used a pure culture to investigate the effects of the carbon source and growth phase on smp abundance and composition at both the compound and molecular levels and attempted to link these factors to membrane fouling our results revealed that smp production and properties were carbon source and incubation time dependent the utilization of glucose was faster than acetate in the early exponential phase likely because of the faster adaptation of e coli to glucose this finding was different from a previous study where the acetate utilization rate was faster than the glucose utilization rate in a sequencing batch reactor with a complex bacterial community ly et al 2019 in fact the presence of short chain acids were reported to reduce the biosynthesis rate of rna dna protein and lipid of e coli which might affect the transcription translation machinery in e coli eiteman and altman 2006 compared with glucose as carbon source e coli consumes more resources for metabolism at the cost of growth when cultured with acetate oh et al 2002 the tsmps generated in glucose medium were higher than those produced in acetate medium which was ascribed to the higher free energy yielded by glucose a higher free energy can promote the production of biomass as evidenced by the higher doc concentration of glucose fed smp samples kunacheva et al 2020 kuo et al 1996 fig s2 in general generation and release of smps accompany substrate uptake meanwhile biodegradable smps can also serve as substrates for the new production of biomass jarusutthirak and amy 2007 in the exponential phase smps were a mixture of uaps and remaining substrates with low molecular weights fewer fluorophores and lower hydrophobicity as the microorganisms grew into the stationary phase the substrates were gradually used up and uaps became the dominant components biopolymers and humic substances with higher molecular weights and hydrophobicity gradually increased in the senescent phase baps appeared to be the major components under substrate deficient conditions maqbool et al 2017a tian et al 2011 in the senescent phase the glucose fed smps had more humic substances than the acetate fed smps possibly because of the utilization and transformation of proteinaceous compounds into humic substances in endogenous respiration maqbool et al 2017b normally uaps can be directly utilized by microorganisms while baps need to undergo a transformation into readily biodegradable dom for subsequent consumption by microorganisms under substrate deficient conditions tian et al 2011 these explain the fluctuations of the fmax values observed for c1 c4 components during the stationary and senescent phases at the molecular level smps formed in acetate medium contained more crams peptides like aromatic and carbohydrates like components in comparison with those with glucose as the carbon source in the stationary and senescent phases which played a significant role in irreversible membrane fouling as discussed below 4 2 membrane fouling mechanism smps formed in various growth phases played a significant role in membrane fouling behavior fig 5 to further investigate the fouling mechanism of smps four classic filtration models including complete blockage intermediate blocking cake filtration and standard blocking were compared fig s13 and s14 for smps collected in the exponential phases consisting of uaps and remaining substrates standard blocking appeared to be the main fouling mechanism because of their smaller molecular size these small molecules readily adsorbed and accumulated on the walls of membrane pores resulting in the decline of permeate flux ly et al 2019 tian et al 2011 with the growth of microorganisms uap and bap dominated smps gradually aggravated membrane fouling the cake filtration model became the main fouling mechanism moreover a standard blocking model with a good fit might also be the fouling mechanism of smps collected in the stationary and senescent phases the uap and bap dominated smps induced severe membrane fouling could be explained by the following aspects first more biopolymer and humic fractions of smps were enriched along with the growth of microorganisms fig s4 which could elevate the membrane fouling potential ly et al 2019 second the molecular weight of smps gradually increased enhancing their gelating ability teng et al 2020 third the hydrophobic components in smps gradually increased aggravating membrane fouling due to the enhancement of hydrophobic interactions between foulants and the membrane zheng et al 2014 the formation of a cake layer by adsorption and deposition of large molecules such as biopolymers and humics on the membrane surface significantly increased the filtration resistance tian et al 2011 tian et al 2013 last but not least from the molecular level point of view the membrane fouling potentials of smps were related to their unique chemical compositions during the stationary and senescent phases i e uap and bap rich smps crams and peptides like components increased markedly crams are organics rich in carboxylic groups which readily interact with di multivalent cations to form cation stabilized fouling layers independent of the type of membrane via cation bridging effects maddela et al 2018 zheng et al 2014 at ph 7 7 5 the electrostatic attraction between positively charged peptides and the negatively charged membrane surface could strengthen the fouling effect moreover the intermolecular interactions between peptides through hydrophobic residues may further enhance the adsorption of peptides like compounds on the membrane surface persico et al 2017 compared with the glucose fed cases smps formed in acetate medium showed a higher membrane fouling propensity likely because they contained more crams peptides like aromatic and carbohydrates like components cation carbohydrates complexation also contributed to severe membrane fouling xin et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 4 3 environmental implications the mbrs market has been increasing significantly during the last few decades due to its merits of a small footprint excellent effluent quality and high nutrient removal efficiency shi et al 2020 xiao et al 2014 however membrane fouling inevitably occurs meng et al 2020 the frequent chemical cleaning increases the operation cost and shortens the membrane lifetime in this study we found that the production and properties of smps were highly dependent on the organic carbon substrate and growth phase this can to a certain extent update our understanding of both smp formation and membrane fouling mechanisms for instance the specific chemical compositions of smps largely determined the fouling type such as irremovable and irreversible fouling our results could provide implications for real mbr applications for example a previous study showed that a large amount of biomacromolecules including colloids and smps with larger molecular weight were produced by the sludge during nutrients deficiency period in deceleration growth phase in a mbr which resulted in severe membrane fouling zhou et al 2012 in our study the tsmps also reached the maximum values at the beginning of stationary phase fig 1 b which was consistent with the above mbr case the previous study showed that the biomacromolecules produced in the deceleration growth phase had higher fouling rate than those produced in the exponential and stationary phases while our results suggested that smps produced in the stationary and senescent phases had higher fouling potential it should be noted that the concentrations of biomacromolecules produced in different growth phases varied greatly in the real mbr ranging from 42 6 stationary growth phase to 229 1 deceleration growth phase mg l zhou et al 2012 thus both quantity and quality of biomacromolecules contributed to membrane fouling a higher concentration of smps could interact with membrane surface strongly to form a gel layer resulting in severe membrane fouling wu et al 2020 in contrast our study focused on the effects of smps compositions on the fouling potential by controlling the toc of smps at a constant value our findings could provide fundamental understanding about the impacts of smps chemical compositions on the fouling mechanisms moreover smps with larger molecular weight was found to present higher fouling potential in a real mbr due to their increased gelating ability teng et al 2020 which was consistent with our results overall our current findings can be extrapolated to the study of smps in real mbrs in mbr operations an effective fouling control strategy could be achieved by optimizing the sludge retention time srt to regulate the microbial growth phases and further control smp concentrations and compositions currently glucose and acetate are widely used as carbon sources for enhancing denitrification in wwtps our findings could provide instructive opinions for the selection of carbon sources for denitrification in wwtps in this study it was found that glucose can lead to the production of more smps in comparison with acetate which can affect the effluent quality of wwtps after being discharged into the environment the adsorption and deposition of smps onto environmental surfaces will affect subsequent environmental phenomena such as carbon cycling competition adsorption of cations and interfacial interactions among contaminants li et al 2018 for instance we found that the smps formed in different growth phases had different adsorption capabilities on sio2 and al2o3 surfaces fig s15 and s16 suggesting that the deposition capabilities of smps on environmental surfaces were largely related to bacterial growth stages and carbon sources further studies should be conducted to clearly understand the fate of smps in natural aquatic environments in addition optimizing biological processes and improving effluent quality could potentially reduce the impacts of smps on the environment 5 conclusions this study systematically investigated the influences of organic carbon source and growth phase on the chemical natures of smps of a model strain e coli the roles of smps in membrane fouling were also comprehensively explored the conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows 1 the smp production and properties were carbon source and growth phase dependent smp contents generated in glucose medium were higher than those produced in acetate medium in the exponential phase smps consisted of uaps and remaining substrates while in the stationary and senescent phases uaps and baps were the main constituents respectively 2 the eem parafac results showed that glucose fed smps had higher concentrations of humic fluorescence components than acetate fed smps van krevelen diagrams revealed that the smps cultured in both media were rich in crams peptides like lipids like and unsaturated hydrocarbon compounds compared with glucose fed smps smps collected in acetate medium contained more crams peptides like aromatic and carbohydrates like components 3 smps played a significant role in membrane fouling behavior during uf standard blocking and cake filtration were the main fouling mechanisms for the filtration of smps collected in the exponential and stationary senescent phases respectively bap dominated smps had much higher fouling potentials than the uap dominated ones the higher membrane fouling propensity of acetate fed smps was largely related to their unique compositions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

steroids exceeding 1 showing high risks to aquatic organisms the findings from this study showed that there is a wide presence of steroid hormones especially some synthetic steroids in animal wastes posing potential ecological risks and these steroids should be removed before discharge to the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords steroid hormones swine farm wastewater treatment system animal wastes excretion 1 introduction like most typical concentrated animal feeding operations swine farms can be major sources of steroid hormone release to the environment along with natural steroid hormones some synthetic steroid hormones such as dehydroprogesterone dgt medroxyprogesterone acetate mpa and melengestrol acetate mga used as growth promoters or for other purposes could also be excreted with their metabolites during the feeding process kelly mortensen and pedersen 2007 lõhmus and kender 2007 some studies have documented the reproductive and behavioral effects on test organisms associated with exposure to various steroid hormones at ng l levels including interfering with gene expression inhibiting enzyme activity gender differentiation reproductive organ development and reduced reproductive ability jiang et al 2019 robinson et al 2017 runnalls et al 2013 shi et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 thus the steroid hormones released from swine farms pose potential ecological risks to organisms in the environment in recent years with the frequent detection of steroid hormones in the environment increasing attention has been given to steroid hormones contained in animal farm wastes some studies have pointed out that the amounts of steroid hormones released from animal farms may be comparable or even exceed the human sources kolodziej et al 2004 johnson et al 2006 liu et al 2012b liu et al 2015 research on steroid hormones in the animal farming environment has been predominantly focused on estrogens johnson et al 2006 reported that the daily estrogen emission equivalent of a pig is approximately several times of a human zheng et al 2008 found that the levels of total estrogens in dairy farms can decrease by two orders of magnitude after treatments in sequential lagoon systems zheng et al 2008 however studies on the occurrence and removal of steroid hormones other than estrogens especially synthetic ones in the wastewaters and feces of swine farms are still limited our previous studies showed that the animal waste disposal systems used in china are primarily relatively simple systems such as a lagoon or anaerobic digester combined with a biogas tank or fish pond liu et al 2012 liu et al 2015 while the eu and china have banned the use of certain steroid hormones in the livestock feeding process in order to prevent steroid hormone residues in animal products hooijerink et al 2003 nielen et al 2003 lõhmus and kender 2007 yang et al 2009 many farmers ignore regulations and illegally use some banned synthetic steroid hormones to increase profit yang et al 2009 those synthetic steroid hormones and their metabolites along with endogenous steroid hormones are co excreted by the animals thus causing potential adverse effects to environmental organisms swine production inchina reached 451 million heads in 2016 accounting for 45 9 of the world s total annual swine output national bureau of statistics of china 2018 associated with this industry large amounts of swine waste are discharged into the environment in order to minimize environmental contamination it is essential to treat the wastewater and feces in swine farms before discharge previous studies have reported the detection of high levels of androgens and progestogens in feces and wastewater from swine farms in china liu et al 2012b liu et al 2015 however research on the sources distribution and fate as well as the removal of androgens progestogens and glucocorticoids in large scale swine farms especially those equipped with an integrated wastewater treatment system wts is still very limited the objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence fate and removal of various steroid hormones in two large scale swine farms with integrated wtss in south china these two wtss are the anaerobic digester a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic lagoons oxidation fish ponds system farm lc and the up flow anaerobic sludge reaction bed uasb two stage series a o 2 oxidation fish ponds system farm st this investigation also involves assessing the origin of synthetic steroid hormones in these two swine farms and the contribution of swine farms to steroid hormones in the environment the results from this study can help better understand the effectiveness of the integrated wtss and further optimize the waste disposal facilities of swine farms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals forty steroid hormones were chosen as the target compounds including 14 androgens with 6 endogenous ones 4 androstene 3 17 dione also known as

are collected piled later the collected feces and dewatered sludge in the two farms are transported for composting it should be noted that this kind of integrated wtss are only equipped on large scale farms the process flow charts and sampling sites are shown in fig 1 feces wastewater and sludge samples were collected in three replicates for this study sampling campaigns were carried out on july 6 7 farm lc and farm st august 23 24 farm st september 9 10 farm lc and october 26 27 2016 farm lc and farm st time integrated composite wastewater samples from the two wtss were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles in two consecutive days 24h composites with methanol 5 v v and 4m h2so4 adjust the ph to 2 added in order to suppress microbial activities the sludge and feces samples in three replicates were collected in the middle of the day as grab samples and thoroughly mixed with 2 g sodium azide was added into each sample to inhibit microbial activities the collected samples were put in coolers and transported back to the laboratory and then stored at 4 c in the dark prior to further processing the water samples were processed within 48 h while the solid samples were freeze dried and then kept at 18 c in the dark until extraction 2 3 sample extraction and instrumental analysis forty target steroids in all collected samples were extracted and analyzed according to our previous method liu et al 2011 briefly the aqueous samples 1 l each were filtered and spiked with 100 ng l internal standard mixture then extracted by solid phase extraction spe using waters oasis hlb cartridges 500 mg 6 ml which were pre conditioned consecutively by 10 ml methanol and 10 ml milli q water the cartridges were dried and eluted each with 12 ml of ethyl acetate after the spe process the eluents were then dried under a gentle nitrogen stream re dissolved each with 1 ml of methanol and finally stored in a 2 ml amber glass vial after filtering through a 0 22 mm membrane filter an ultrasonic extraction method was applied to extract the target steroid hormones from solid samples all sludge and feces samples were freeze dried homogenized and spiked with an internal standard mixture then centrifuged after ultra sonication extraction with ethyl acetate as the extracting solution the ultra sonication extraction and centrifugation were repeated three times the centrifuged supernatants were concentrated and re dissolved each in 1 ml of methanol and finally stored in a 2 ml amber glass vial after filtering through a 0 22 mm membrane filter all extracts were analyzed by ultra high liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uhplc ms ms after further purification with glass wool silica gel columns details given in si an agilent 1200 lc agilent 6460 qqq with

instrumental conditions can be found in the supporting information si and our previous work liu et al 2011 liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 2 4 estimation of steroids in feces and flush water mass estimation of target steroid hormones in feces and flush water were used to evaluate the mass contribution of swine metabolic emissions to steroid hormones in the environment estimating steroids in feces was based on the swine population and the daily production and water content of swine feces the estimated steroids in flush water were calculated by the average daily flush water volume and the detected steroid concentrations for a detailed estimation method please refer to si 2 5 mass loading calculation the aqueous phase removal rate of a target steroid in the wts unit was calculated by the following equation 1 r aqueous c inf i c eff i c inf 100 where cinf is the concentration of a target steroid in the influent ng l raqueous cinf i and ceff i represent the aqueous removal rate and the concentrations ng l of the target steroid in the incoming and outgoing water of the selected treatment unit respectively the mass loadings of target steroids in farms lc and st were calculated based on their concentrations in influent effluent sludge and feces by the following equations 2 w inf c inf q i 10 3 3 w eff c eff q e 10 3 4 w sludge c sludge q s 10 3 5 w feces c maunre q m 10 3 where winf mg d weff mg d wsludge mg d wfeces mg d represent the daily mass loadings of each steroid in the influent effluent dewatered sludge and feces respectively cinf ng l ceff ng l csludge ng g and cfeces ng g represent the concentrations of target steroid in the influent effluent dewatered sludge and feces respectively qi m3 d and qe m3 d are the average daily flows of influent and effluent of each wts while qs kg d and qm kg d are the average dry weight of dewatered sludge and swine feces in farm lc or farm st per day respectively 2 6 ecological risk assessment the risk quotient rq approach was applied in ecological risk assessment for steroid hormones in the final effluent for this method rqs are calculated by dividing exposure estimates by the acute and chronic ecotoxicity values based on european commission technical guidance document by using eq 6 ec 2003 6 rq mec pnec where mec means the measured environmental concentration and pnec represents the predicted no effect concentration of a chemical according to the risk ranking criteria 0 01 rq 0 1 0 1 rq 1 and rq 1 indicate low risk medium risk and high risk respectively hernando et al 2006 the pnec value can be calculated using the aquatic acute median effective concentration ec50 or chronic no observed effect concentration noec values of a chemical ec 2003 for those steroids detected in the effluents the obtained pnec values are given in si table s6 s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and potential risks of detected steroids hormones in the swine farms thirty one of 40 target steroid hormones were detected in the wastewater across all treating units of farms lc and st including 12 androgens 17 progestogens and 2 glucocorticoids the detected concentrations of target steroids in farm lc ranged from 0 12 0 05 ng l mpa to 2 900 201 ng l 5α dhp fig 2 table s3 while five endogenous androgens 5α dht add aed eadr and ttr three endogenous progestogens 5α dhp hp and p and the endogenous glucocorticoid cortisol were detected all other detected steroids were synthetic the endogenous steroids such as add aed eadr p and 5α dhp possessed relatively high concentrations from tens to tens of thousands of ng l and relatively high detection frequencies with detection in almost every treatment unit across three sampling times among them aed add and p could be found in every treatment stage similar to farm lc 31 target steroids were detected in the wastewater of farm st with concentrations ranging from 0 12 0 03 ng l mpa to 11 200 201 ng l 5α dhp fig 2 table s4 endogenous steroids such as aed add and p could also be detected in every treatment stage of farm st indicating the ubiquity of these three natural steroids in the animal feeding environment in addition to natural steroid hormones synthetic steroids such as 17α hpa 17β bol dpn mga mpa and s also had relatively high detection frequencies in both wtss and were detected at least once in each treatment stage twenty seven target steroids were detected in the influents of both farms lc and st with the types slightly different the androgen 17α bol was found in the influent of farm st but not in farm lc while the progestin et was not detected in the influent of farm st but detected in the farm lc natural endogenous steroid hormones dominated in both influents while the levels generally higher in farm st than in farm lc the highest concentration of p detected in a previous study was as high as 3 510 ng l liu et al 2012a which was much higher than that in the influent of farm lc 708 ng l but close to that in farm st 3 340 ng l however in another study liu et al 2015 the detected concentration of p in the influent of wts of the studied swine farm was 480 ng l similar to that in farm lc the difference in farm size and the number of sows could explain the different detected concentrations the difference in steroid concentration between the initial flush water and the influent of wts might also explain the detected concentration difference the concentration of steroids was high in the initial flush water but later decreased because of the microbial degradation process during the transport to wts through pipelines therefore the length of pipelines from piggeries to the storage tank of wtss and the residence time in the pipelines might affect the detection of certain steroid hormones in the present study we took the water samples from the influent of biogas digester lc and the influent of uasb tank st as flush water samples the initial flush water in these two farms was inaccessible therefore the detected concentrations of target steroids were most likely lower than they should have been the concentrations of other detected natural steroids such as add and aed were of the same order of magnitude as previous studies liu et al 2012a liu et al 2015 along with endogenous steroids synthetic progestin ntra had relatively high concentrations in the influents of both farms lc 358 5 78 ng l and st 730 132 ng l a total of 22 target steroids were detected in the feces with 19 being detected in farm lc and 17 in farm st as shown in fig 3 and table s5 most of those 22 detected steroids were synthetic with relatively low concentrations ranging from 0 85 0 06 ng g 17β bol to 21 7 4 53 ng g lngt natural steroids dominated the detected steroids with higher concentrations than those of synthetic origins 5α dhp possessed the highest detection concentrations in both farms lc 7 000 1620 ng g and st 2 070 1250 ng g the abundance of 5α dhp in these two farms may be mainly related to these two swine farms population structure these two selected farms primary business is high quality piglet breeding and the sows in stock are all pregnant according to literature dombroski et al 1997 scholtz et al 2014 the levels of 5α dhp in the bodies of vertebrates during pregnancy especially the late stage of pregnancy could up to tens of ng ml which might be the main reason for the high detection concentration of 5α dhp in the present study following 5α dhp endogenous steroids such as p eadr aed and add also had relatively high detection concentrations in feces ranging from hundreds to thousands of ng g the detected and dominant steroids in the feces of both farms were similar while the levels in farm st were lower in general it is worth noting that even with a smaller farm scale the detected levels of steroids in feces of farm lc were higher than farm st such a situation might be due to the difference in feeding regimen and dietary composition of these two farms possibly influencing metabolism and conjugate formation of the target steroid hormones also the difference in the solid liquid separator s treating technique in the wtss of the two farms may explain the differences incomplete separation would result in fecal residue persisting in the subsequent treatment system with the wastewater thus causing the concentrations of target steroids to be higher in the aqueous phase and lower in the feces the higher concentrations of target steroids detected in the dewatered sludge of farm st appear to support this possibility sixteen target steroids were detected in the dewatered sludge of the two farms with ten in farm lc and fifteen in farm st the concentrations of most detected steroids were a few ng g eadr 5α dhp and p were dominant among the detected steroids with concentrations up to 850 40 0 ng g 456 26 4 ng g and 122 4 35 ng g in farm lc and concentrations up to 1 110 167 ng g 1 330 223 ng g and 110 13 1 ng g in farm st respectively the detected concentration of prel in farm st was as high as 247 73 0 ng g after treatment by the wtss some target steroid hormones had been completely removed and the concentrations of most detected hormones were significantly reduced in the aqueous phase however some target steroid hormones remained in the effluent and were transported to the receiving environment a total of 18 target steroids were detected in the effluent of farm lc and 12 were synthetic while 20 target steroids including 12 synthetics were found in farm st 5α dhp still dominated with its concentration as high as 22 1 5 05 ng l lc and 76 5 9 22 ng l st while the concentrations of other detected steroids ranged from a few tenths to several ng l some steroids such as 5α dht mfst et and mgt were not detected in the influent but later found in the subsequent treatment process and the effluent this situation might be due to the following possible reasons the matrix interference effect weakened when the sewage became cleaner in the following process sections and made those compounds detectable or they were transformed from other steroids with similar structures the rqs for the detected steroid hormones in the effluents were calculated based on their estimated pnec values and the highest mec values for each compound as the worst case scenario tables s6 s7 it can be seen from fig 4 that most of the synthetic steroid hormones in the effluent would possess high environmental risks especially for synthetic androgens such as 17α tbl 17β tbl 5α dht and mt whose rq values were far greater than 1 ranged from 12 4 to 801 other synthetic progestins in the effluents would also pose medium to high risks the adverse effects of synthetic steroid hormones on aquatic organisms have been reported ankley et al 2003 found that exposure to 17β tbl at concentrations higher than 0 027 μg l for 21 days would significantly reduce the fecundity of fathead minnow sone et al 2005 reported that exposure to mt 0 1 10 μg l or 17β tbl 1 10 μg l after 28 d would induce masculinization of adult mosquitofish females and stimulate precocious spermatogenesis in the testes of males and the formation of ovotestes in females after long term exposure to 17α tbl of 120 ng l robinson et al 2017 observed adverse effects on the fecundity of fathead minnow after a 14 days and a 21 days exposure to dht panter et al 2004 found that the number of nuptial tubercles in fathead minnow was significantly increased and the plasma vtg concentrations were significantly elevated in male fish but inhibited in female fish jiang et al 2019 conducted experiments to expose zebrafish danio rerio embryos to 2 8 27 6 and 289 8 ng l dydrogesterone for 140 days and found it led to male biased zebrafish sex ratios according to the research of shi et al 2019 the exposure to 42 0 ng l 1 of mpa caused a 60 proportion of male zebrafish therefore the detected high rq steroids in the effluents would have much higher ecological risks to aquatic fish in the oxidation fish ponds of these two farms and they might further pose ecological risks to aquatic organisms in the receiving environments it should be noted that this was a simple risk assessment with limited toxicity data and the risks from each compound may change when more toxicity data are available in the future in addition it is unclear how the presence of multiple steroids could affect cumulative organismal risk further research is needed to understand specific biological effects in the receiving environments 3 2 source analysis of synthetic steroids in the swine farms in livestock farms synthetic steroids are used as veterinary drugs or anabolic preparations such as nortestosterone ntr stanozolol s trenbolone acetate tba and melengestrol acetate mga lange et al 2002 kang et al 2008 fragkaki et al 2009 kaklamanos et al 2009 liu et al 2012b among the steroid hormones detected in farms lc and st although endogenous hormones dominated various synthetic steroids were also detected twenty two synthetic steroids including seven androgens 14 progestogens and one glucocorticoid were detected in the wastewater and a total of 14 synthetic steroids were detected in the feces including five androgens seven progestogens and two glucocorticoids according to the literature boldenone a synthetic androgen that is commonly used as a growth promoter has been found in feces and flush water samples sangiorgi et al 2005 arioli et al 2008 in recent years the use of bol in the animal breeding industry has been banned by the eu however research by arioli et al 2008 pointed out that boldenone in feces can interconvert with endogenous androgens like add under some circumstances therefore it is not clear whether the bol detected in this study were naturally produced or a metabolite from the pharmaceuticals besides bol androgens such as 4 oha 17β tbl and s also had relatively high detection frequencies and concentrations 4 oha is commonly used as an aromatase inhibitor in positive breast cancer therapy khubieh et al 1987 zilembo et al 1993 it is uncommon to detect such high concentrations of 4 oha in farms and may be due to exogenous usage for therapeutic purposes during pig breeding liu et al 2012b 17β tbl and 17α tbl are metabolic products of growth promoter tba and can be excreted via feces from implanted animals khan et al 2008 the detected trenbolone α and β forms indicates the presence of tba implanted swine in these two farms liu et al 2012b as a synthetic derivate of ttr s can improve appetite cause weight gain and enhance muscle strength davidson and plumb 2003 and typically used as a performance enhancer or growth promoter in the veterinary field deshmukh et al 2011 unlike its precursor ttr s has only been detected in the aquatic environment if in veterinary use medical treatment or illegally used by athletes deshmukh et al 2011 the detection of s in farms is rare and s s detection in our study was likely due to administration during swine breeding along with androgens various synthetic progestogens were detected in the farms lc and st the levels of ntra dgt cmd mpa cpra and 19 ntd were relatively high in the wastewater samples while lngt and dpn were abundant in the feces synthetic progestogens are commonly used in the animal breeding industry for animal rut control contraception and fattening halnan 1965 kelly mortensen and pedersen 2007 lõhmus and kender 2007 however only the usages of synthetic steroids tba and mga were officially approved in the animal breeding industry by fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations in contrast all kinds of steroid hormones are forbidden in agriculture animal breeding by the eu passantino 2012 animal experiments indicated that synthetic progestogens such as cpra mpa ntra lngt and hpa are potentially cancerogenic finkel et al 1973 detection of dgt ntra and cmd were hints of exogenous addition of progestogen drugs other exogenous progestogens detected with relatively high or low concentrations may have stemmed from the transformation of parent compounds by microbial transformation jenkins et al 2003 janeczko and skoczowski 2005 lee et al 2007 carson et al 2008 studies on synthetic progestogens in the environment to date are limited and need further exploration due to their inhibitory effects on inflammatory allergic and immunological diseases glucocorticoids are widely used in veterinary medicine synthetic prel was detected in the feces of farm lc with concentrations at 21 6 3 10 ng g which is similar to that in a previous study which was 32 0 ng g liu et al 2012a at present there are very few studies of glucocorticoids in animal breeding farms some research pointed out that under the action of biological dehydrogenase crn in feces was metabolized to prel arioli et al 2010 like bol it is unclear if the detected prel was exogenously added or produced endogenously as the source of crn was unknown in the literature synthetic steroid hormones such as bol prednisone and prednisolone which can be endogenous in some cases are referred to as pseudo endogenous hormones or gray substances scarth et al 2009 therefore the origin of these substances in the environmental matrices cannot be definitively determined 3 3 excretion of steroids hormones in swine farms and their release to environment steroid hormones in livestock farms are discharged via animal feces and urine after metabolism in the present study two methods were used to estimate the steroid hormones in swine farms they were estimated emissions of steroid hormones from swine farms based on the farm animals and the mass loadings of steroid hormones based on the wtss of the swine farms these two estimation methods can reflect the contribution of swine farms to steroid hormone pollution in the environment from different aspects according to the estimation methods introduced in si combined with the detected concentrations of each target steroid and the necessary information of farms lc and st the amounts of steroid hormones discharged through feces and urine in the two swine farms were estimated and are listed in table 1 the daily estimated masses of steroids in farm lc from fecal excretion and flush water were 445 μg d pig for androgens 2 470 μg d pig for progestogens 9 75 μg d pig for glucocorticoids and the estimated masses of steroids in farm st for androgens progestogens and glucocorticoids were 363 μg d pig 865 μg d pig and 0 19 μg d pig respectively the total estimated daily excretions of these three kinds of steroids in the two swine farms amounted to 5 850 mg d and 3 560 mg d in the present study the amounts of steroid hormones excreted by the sow through feces were higher than that via urine which is consistent with the literature results liu et al 2012a it is also the reason that despite higher sow stock and higher detected steroid levels in the flush water of farm st its total contribution of steroid hormones was still lower than that of farm lc in the present study the estimated average daily amounts of progestogens excreted per sow through flush water and feces of these two swine farms were 4 940 mg lc and 2 510 mg st respectively these estimates were in a similar range to 3160 mg and 8286 mg from the previous studies liu et al 2012b liu et al 2015 the reasons for the difference were mainly due to the difference in the farm scale the structure of the main group and the target steroids liu et al 2012a estimated the daily amounts of several natural steroid hormones discharged by standardized individuals the daily excretions of aed eard and p in that research were 1 9 μg d 115 μg d and 57 5 μg d respectively in the present study the average daily emissions of those steroids of a normalized sow were 41 5 μg d 268 μg d and 661 μg d respectively which were much higher than the average daily emissions of those steroids per capita liu et al 2012a in addition the average daily emissions of 5α dhp and add per sow were as high as 982 μg d and 85 7 μg d which was noteworthy the mass loadings of target steroid hormones detected in the wtss of both farms are shown in table s8 and fig 5 it can be seen from the results that the average daily total mass loadings of the three classes of steroid hormones in the influents of farms lc and st were 680 mg d and 3 040 mg d respectively several natural steroid hormones were predominant in the influent including 5α dhp add aed eadr and p with their average daily mass loadings up to 175 mg d 133 mg d 75 8 mg d 203 mg d 54 9 mg d farm lc and 1550 mg d 200 mg d 97 5 mg d 680 mg d 358 mg d farm st respectively in the effluent the average daily total mass loadings of the three classes of steroid hormones in farms lc and st were 1 27 mg d and 6 59 mg d respectively with 5α dhp aed add and prel contributing the most it can be seen that the average daily mass loadings of steroid hormones in the wts of farm st were higher than those of farm lc whether in influent or effluent in the feces of farms lc and st the daily average total mass loadings of the target steroid hormones were 2 850 mg d and 1 180 mg d respectively in farm lc progestogens 5α dhp and p were the largest mass loading contributors in feces with their daily average mass loadings up to 1 290 mg d and 1 170 mg d androgens such as eadr and add also had relatively high daily average mass loadings of 228 mg d and 92 mg d respectively similar to farm lc 5α dhp 655 mg d eadr 259 mg d and p 179 mg d contributed the most in the total mass loading of steroids in the feces of farm st the mass loadings of target steroids in the dewatered sludge were significantly lower than those of the influent and feces the total daily average mass loadings of the target steroid hormones in the dewatered sludge of farms lc and st were 29 mg d and 81 8 mg d among them the dominant contributors were 5α dhp and eadr with their daily average mass loadings up to 11 3 mg d and 13 6 mg d respectively lc and 40 2 mg d and 30 6 mg d respectively st while the contribution of other steroids was much less the mass loading of prel in farm st was relatively high 4 53 mg d with its contribution close to the natural p 4 45 mg d as shown in table s8 and fig 5 in farms lc and st the total mass loadings of the target steroid hormones discharged via urine and feces were 1 29 kg yr and 1 54 kg yr respectively although the values of total mass loadings of steroid hormones in the two swine farms were similar their sources were quite different in farm lc 19 3 of the steroid hormones came from urine and 80 6 came from feces while in farm st 72 1 of steroid hormones came from urine and feces contributed 28 0 the significant difference between the two farms was mainly attributed to the extremely high concentration of 5α dhp in urine from farm st as well as the concentration differences of predominant steroid hormones such as p and eadr in urine and feces from these two farms after the treatment the total mass loadings of the three classes of steroid hormones in the effluents of farms lc and st were significantly reduced to only 0 46 g yr lc and 2 41 g yr st showing the critical role of the integrated wtss in reducing the pollution level of steroid hormones transported to the environment from swine farms however those kinds of integrated wtss in the present study were not common in animal feeding farms according to the ministry of housing and urban rural development of china in 2016 only 22 of the livestock wastewater was discharged after treatment while nearly 80 was discharged directly to the receiving environments china is a large animal husbandry country with vast amounts of livestock production in our study we estimated the total amount of progestogens produced by sows in 2016 and which was as high as 22 700 kg if there was 80 of untreated livestock wastewater then the estimated amount of progestogens produced by sows and finally discharged into the environment in this research could reach 18 160 kg year which is much higher than that discharged from domestic wastewater treatment plants liu et al 2012a current farm waste management in china is still relatively backward and those integrated wastewater treatment systems in the present study are only found in some large scale farms for most small and medium sized livestock farms in rural areas their wastewater treatment efficiencies are much lower than those in urban areas in summary environmental pollution with steroid hormones from the animal breeding industry to the environment is more significant than that resulting from human sources 3 4 evaluation of the steroid hormones removal in different wastewater treatment systems aqueous phase removal rates for the detected steroids in farm lc were from 200 to 100 table 2 table s9 with most of the target compounds removed efficiently the removal efficiencies for total androgens and progestogens were favorable final removal rates exceeding 99 while the removal of glucocorticoids was less effective with negative removal rates for most glucocorticoids all detected androgens were effectively removed with nearly all of them having removal rates exceeding 95 exception the synthetic androgen s 89 3 the removal efficiencies of progestogens were slightly worse than that of androgens with an actual negative removal rate for the synthetic progestin mga 200 natural progestogens showed better removal than synthetic progestogens with removal rates 90 compared to removal rates of the synthetic progestogens dpn and et of only 16 7 and 19 6 the removal rates of target steroids in farm st ranged from 252 1 to 100 table s10 similar to farm lc most steroids were efficiently removed the final removal rates of androgens and progestogens all exceeded 99 while the lowest removal rate negative was found for glucocorticoids compared with farm lc the wts of farm st was less effective in the removal of androgens the lowest removal rates of 17β tbl and 17α tbl in farm st were 78 1 and 89 3 while their removal rates were 100 in farm lc in contrast farm st possessed better performance in removing progestogens when compared to farm lc overall the two wtss had relatively sound effects on removing target hormones with the final removal rates of total detected steroids exceeded 99 while for certain steroids such as 17β tbl 17α tbl crl and prel or certain types of steroid hormones such as androgens and glucocorticoids the removal performance of farm st was relatively low when comparing with farm lc therefore in comparison the wts in farm lc was more effective than the wts in farm st in removing steroid hormones in this study the three classes of target steroid hormones were effectively eliminated in the wtss of farms lc and st with total removal efficiencies exceeding 99 5 and 99 6 in many other studies the wastewater treatment facilities equipped in the livestock farms were simple mainly consisting of waste lagoons sedimentation tanks and biogas tanks arnon et al 2008 liu et al 2012b liu et al 2012c liu et al 2015 however liu et al 2015 pointed out that the removal of steroid hormones especially progestogens by a pure waste lagoon alone is limited only 30 40 while the lagoon biogas digester system can significantly remove steroid hormones and subsequent oxidation fish ponds can further dilute the levels of steroid hormones before discharge into the surrounding environments liu et al 2015 the wtss in the present study are integrated systems with four stages primary treatment primary sedimentation tank secondary biological treatment biogas digester or uasb third stage disinfection process and fourth stage dilution process oxidation fish ponds the detected steroids were well removed after the treatment by wts indicating that these two integrated treatment facilities can effectively prevent the massive amounts of steroid hormones in animal breeding wastewater from being transported to the receiving environments studies have pointed out that the principal removal mechanisms of steroid hormones during wastewater treatment are adsorption degradation and advanced oxidation liu et al 2009 liu et al 2015 the part of volatilization loss is negligible based on the physical and chemical properties of steroid hormones it can be seen from tables s9 s10 that the removal of the steroids mainly occurred in the biochemical units biogas digesters and uasb tanks through microbial degradation along with additional adsorption by the biogas digester filler the treatment units using flocculation and precipitation or ultraviolet sterilization had no apparent effects on the removal of steroid hormones while the subsequently connected oxidation ponds further diluted the concentrations and reduced their residual environmental levels liu et al 2015 in the present study it can be seen that steroid hormone efficiencies of wts in farm lc especially some synthetic progestogens are better than those of farm st by comparing the removal rates of certain steroids this may be due to the adsorption of progestogens by biogas digester fillers in addition to biodegradation liu et al 2015 besides the hrt of wts in farm lc was longer which was beneficial to removing steroids by microorganisms in the biochemical units what s more the difference in the microorganism communities in the biochemical units was also a possible reason for the removal efficiency difference of the two wtss from tables s9 s10 there is a clear indication that among all treatment units in each wts biogas digesters and uasb tank possessed better performance in removing steroid hormones compared with traditional waste lagoons the hydraulic retention time of these two anaerobic fermentation units in the present study is more prolonged allowing for more contact time with microorganisms particulate matter to degrade and adsorb steroid hormones in the wastewater nevertheless more research is needed to better understand the influencing factors of steroid hormone removal in the wtss of livestock farms 4 conclusion the results from this investigation showed the presence of 31 and 22 out of 40 target steroid hormones in the wastewater and feces of two large scale swine farms with integrated wtss some synthetic steroid hormones were detected indicating possible exogenous addition the emission of steroid hormones from swine farms was assessed and the emission amounts of steroids such as aed add eadr p and 5α dhp were found much higher than those discharged by human sewage both wtss in the swine farms can remove steroid hormones efficiently in comparison the anaerobic digester a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic lagoon system performed better than the uasb a o 2 double anoxic oxic lagoon system in terms of steroids removal efficiency despite the high removal efficiencies in wtss several synthetic steroids with high rqs were detected in the effluents suggesting high risks to aquatic organisms further research is needed to understand specific biological effects in the receiving environments the findings from this study suggest that swine farms are an important source of steroids in the environment and proper treatment facilities should be applied to reduce the potential ecological risks declaration

17192,steroid hormones are endocrine disrupting chemicals that can cause adverse effects even at trace levels the information about steroid hormones in animal wastes is still very limited here we investigated the occurrence and fate of fourteen androgens twenty one progestogens and five glucocorticoids in farm luo cheng lc and farm shui tai st with integrated wastewater treatment systems wtss in south china these two integrated systems have four stages primary treatment primary sedimentation tank secondary biological treatment biogas digester and up flow anaerobic sludge reaction bed uasb third stage disinfection process and fourth stage dilution and further biodegradation process oxidation fish ponds lagoons a total of 31 target steroid hormones were detected in the wastewater of the two swine farms with concentrations ranging from 0 12 ng l medroxyprogesterone acetate mpa to 11 200 ng l 5α dihydroprogesterone 5α dhp a total of 22 target steroid hormones were detected in feces of which 19 were detected in farm lc and 17 in farm st some of these detected steroids were synthetic chemicals which might be parent chemicals from exogenous addition or their metabolites or transformation products from other natural steroids the steroids excretion of sows in swine farms were estimated with some steroids such as androstenedione aed 41 5 μg d epiandrosterone eadr 268 μg d progesterone p 661 μg d and 5α dhp 982μg d having much higher values than those from human bodies both wtss in the swine farms could effectively remove the target steroid hormones with the removal rates of most targets exceeding 90 in comparison the anaerobic digester a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic lagoon system performed better in removing steroids than the up flow anaerobic sludge reaction bed uasb two stage series a o 2 oxidation fish ponds system however there were still 22 steroid hormones including 14 synthetic ones detected in the effluent with the risk quotients of most synthetic steroids exceeding 1 showing high risks to aquatic organisms the findings from this study showed that there is a wide presence of steroid hormones especially some synthetic steroids in animal wastes posing potential ecological risks and these steroids should be removed before discharge to the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords steroid hormones swine farm wastewater treatment system animal wastes excretion 1 introduction like most typical concentrated animal feeding operations swine farms can be major sources of steroid hormone release to the environment along with natural steroid hormones some synthetic steroid hormones such as dehydroprogesterone dgt medroxyprogesterone acetate mpa and melengestrol acetate mga used as growth promoters or for other purposes could also be excreted with their metabolites during the feeding process kelly mortensen and pedersen 2007 lõhmus and kender 2007 some studies have documented the reproductive and behavioral effects on test organisms associated with exposure to various steroid hormones at ng l levels including interfering with gene expression inhibiting enzyme activity gender differentiation reproductive organ development and reduced reproductive ability jiang et al 2019 robinson et al 2017 runnalls et al 2013 shi et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 thus the steroid hormones released from swine farms pose potential ecological risks to organisms in the environment in recent years with the frequent detection of steroid hormones in the environment increasing attention has been given to steroid hormones contained in animal farm wastes some studies have pointed out that the amounts of steroid hormones released from animal farms may be comparable or even exceed the human sources kolodziej et al 2004 johnson et al 2006 liu et al 2012b liu et al 2015 research on steroid hormones in the animal farming environment has been predominantly focused on estrogens johnson et al 2006 reported that the daily estrogen emission equivalent of a pig is approximately several times of a human zheng et al 2008 found that the levels of total estrogens in dairy farms can decrease by two orders of magnitude after treatments in sequential lagoon systems zheng et al 2008 however studies on the occurrence and removal of steroid hormones other than estrogens especially synthetic ones in the wastewaters and feces of swine farms are still limited our previous studies showed that the animal waste disposal systems used in china are primarily relatively simple systems such as a lagoon or anaerobic digester combined with a biogas tank or fish pond liu et al 2012 liu et al 2015 while the eu and china have banned the use of certain steroid hormones in the livestock feeding process in order to prevent steroid hormone residues in animal products hooijerink et al 2003 nielen et al 2003 lõhmus and kender 2007 yang et al 2009 many farmers ignore regulations and illegally use some banned synthetic steroid hormones to increase profit yang et al 2009 those synthetic steroid hormones and their metabolites along with endogenous steroid hormones are co excreted by the animals thus causing potential adverse effects to environmental organisms swine production inchina reached 451 million heads in 2016 accounting for 45 9 of the world s total annual swine output national bureau of statistics of china 2018 associated with this industry large amounts of swine waste are discharged into the environment in order to minimize environmental contamination it is essential to treat the wastewater and feces in swine farms before discharge previous studies have reported the detection of high levels of androgens and progestogens in feces and wastewater from swine farms in china liu et al 2012b liu et al 2015 however research on the sources distribution and fate as well as the removal of androgens progestogens and glucocorticoids in large scale swine farms especially those equipped with an integrated wastewater treatment system wts is still very limited the objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence fate and removal of various steroid hormones in two large scale swine farms with integrated wtss in south china these two wtss are the anaerobic digester a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic lagoons oxidation fish ponds system farm lc and the up flow anaerobic sludge reaction bed uasb two stage series a o 2 oxidation fish ponds system farm st this investigation also involves assessing the origin of synthetic steroid hormones in these two swine farms and the contribution of swine farms to steroid hormones in the environment the results from this study can help better understand the effectiveness of the integrated wtss and further optimize the waste disposal facilities of swine farms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals forty steroid hormones were chosen as the target compounds including 14 androgens with 6 endogenous ones 4 androstene 3 17 dione also known as

are collected piled later the collected feces and dewatered sludge in the two farms are transported for composting it should be noted that this kind of integrated wtss are only equipped on large scale farms the process flow charts and sampling sites are shown in fig 1 feces wastewater and sludge samples were collected in three replicates for this study sampling campaigns were carried out on july 6 7 farm lc and farm st august 23 24 farm st september 9 10 farm lc and october 26 27 2016 farm lc and farm st time integrated composite wastewater samples from the two wtss were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles in two consecutive days 24h composites with methanol 5 v v and 4m h2so4 adjust the ph to 2 added in order to suppress microbial activities the sludge and feces samples in three replicates were collected in the middle of the day as grab samples and thoroughly mixed with 2 g sodium azide was added into each sample to inhibit microbial activities the collected samples were put in coolers and transported back to the laboratory and then stored at 4 c in the dark prior to further processing the water samples were processed within 48 h while the solid samples were freeze dried and then kept at 18 c in the dark until extraction 2 3 sample extraction and instrumental analysis forty target steroids in all collected samples were extracted and analyzed according to our previous method liu et al 2011 briefly the aqueous samples 1 l each were filtered and spiked with 100 ng l internal standard mixture then extracted by solid phase extraction spe using waters oasis hlb cartridges 500 mg 6 ml which were pre conditioned consecutively by 10 ml methanol and 10 ml milli q water the cartridges were dried and eluted each with 12 ml of ethyl acetate after the spe process the eluents were then dried under a gentle nitrogen stream re dissolved each with 1 ml of methanol and finally stored in a 2 ml amber glass vial after filtering through a 0 22 mm membrane filter an ultrasonic extraction method was applied to extract the target steroid hormones from solid samples all sludge and feces samples were freeze dried homogenized and spiked with an internal standard mixture then centrifuged after ultra sonication extraction with ethyl acetate as the extracting solution the ultra sonication extraction and centrifugation were repeated three times the centrifuged supernatants were concentrated and re dissolved each in 1 ml of methanol and finally stored in a 2 ml amber glass vial after filtering through a 0 22 mm membrane filter all extracts were analyzed by ultra high liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uhplc ms ms after further purification with glass wool silica gel columns details given in si an agilent 1200 lc agilent 6460 qqq with

instrumental conditions can be found in the supporting information si and our previous work liu et al 2011 liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 2 4 estimation of steroids in feces and flush water mass estimation of target steroid hormones in feces and flush water were used to evaluate the mass contribution of swine metabolic emissions to steroid hormones in the environment estimating steroids in feces was based on the swine population and the daily production and water content of swine feces the estimated steroids in flush water were calculated by the average daily flush water volume and the detected steroid concentrations for a detailed estimation method please refer to si 2 5 mass loading calculation the aqueous phase removal rate of a target steroid in the wts unit was calculated by the following equation 1 r aqueous c inf i c eff i c inf 100 where cinf is the concentration of a target steroid in the influent ng l raqueous cinf i and ceff i represent the aqueous removal rate and the concentrations ng l of the target steroid in the incoming and outgoing water of the selected treatment unit respectively the mass loadings of target steroids in farms lc and st were calculated based on their concentrations in influent effluent sludge and feces by the following equations 2 w inf c inf q i 10 3 3 w eff c eff q e 10 3 4 w sludge c sludge q s 10 3 5 w feces c maunre q m 10 3 where winf mg d weff mg d wsludge mg d wfeces mg d represent the daily mass loadings of each steroid in the influent effluent dewatered sludge and feces respectively cinf ng l ceff ng l csludge ng g and cfeces ng g represent the concentrations of target steroid in the influent effluent dewatered sludge and feces respectively qi m3 d and qe m3 d are the average daily flows of influent and effluent of each wts while qs kg d and qm kg d are the average dry weight of dewatered sludge and swine feces in farm lc or farm st per day respectively 2 6 ecological risk assessment the risk quotient rq approach was applied in ecological risk assessment for steroid hormones in the final effluent for this method rqs are calculated by dividing exposure estimates by the acute and chronic ecotoxicity values based on european commission technical guidance document by using eq 6 ec 2003 6 rq mec pnec where mec means the measured environmental concentration and pnec represents the predicted no effect concentration of a chemical according to the risk ranking criteria 0 01 rq 0 1 0 1 rq 1 and rq 1 indicate low risk medium risk and high risk respectively hernando et al 2006 the pnec value can be calculated using the aquatic acute median effective concentration ec50 or chronic no observed effect concentration noec values of a chemical ec 2003 for those steroids detected in the effluents the obtained pnec values are given in si table s6 s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and potential risks of detected steroids hormones in the swine farms thirty one of 40 target steroid hormones were detected in the wastewater across all treating units of farms lc and st including 12 androgens 17 progestogens and 2 glucocorticoids the detected concentrations of target steroids in farm lc ranged from 0 12 0 05 ng l mpa to 2 900 201 ng l 5α dhp fig 2 table s3 while five endogenous androgens 5α dht add aed eadr and ttr three endogenous progestogens 5α dhp hp and p and the endogenous glucocorticoid cortisol were detected all other detected steroids were synthetic the endogenous steroids such as add aed eadr p and 5α dhp possessed relatively high concentrations from tens to tens of thousands of ng l and relatively high detection frequencies with detection in almost every treatment unit across three sampling times among them aed add and p could be found in every treatment stage similar to farm lc 31 target steroids were detected in the wastewater of farm st with concentrations ranging from 0 12 0 03 ng l mpa to 11 200 201 ng l 5α dhp fig 2 table s4 endogenous steroids such as aed add and p could also be detected in every treatment stage of farm st indicating the ubiquity of these three natural steroids in the animal feeding environment in addition to natural steroid hormones synthetic steroids such as 17α hpa 17β bol dpn mga mpa and s also had relatively high detection frequencies in both wtss and were detected at least once in each treatment stage twenty seven target steroids were detected in the influents of both farms lc and st with the types slightly different the androgen 17α bol was found in the influent of farm st but not in farm lc while the progestin et was not detected in the influent of farm st but detected in the farm lc natural endogenous steroid hormones dominated in both influents while the levels generally higher in farm st than in farm lc the highest concentration of p detected in a previous study was as high as 3 510 ng l liu et al 2012a which was much higher than that in the influent of farm lc 708 ng l but close to that in farm st 3 340 ng l however in another study liu et al 2015 the detected concentration of p in the influent of wts of the studied swine farm was 480 ng l similar to that in farm lc the difference in farm size and the number of sows could explain the different detected concentrations the difference in steroid concentration between the initial flush water and the influent of wts might also explain the detected concentration difference the concentration of steroids was high in the initial flush water but later decreased because of the microbial degradation process during the transport to wts through pipelines therefore the length of pipelines from piggeries to the storage tank of wtss and the residence time in the pipelines might affect the detection of certain steroid hormones in the present study we took the water samples from the influent of biogas digester lc and the influent of uasb tank st as flush water samples the initial flush water in these two farms was inaccessible therefore the detected concentrations of target steroids were most likely lower than they should have been the concentrations of other detected natural steroids such as add and aed were of the same order of magnitude as previous studies liu et al 2012a liu et al 2015 along with endogenous steroids synthetic progestin ntra had relatively high concentrations in the influents of both farms lc 358 5 78 ng l and st 730 132 ng l a total of 22 target steroids were detected in the feces with 19 being detected in farm lc and 17 in farm st as shown in fig 3 and table s5 most of those 22 detected steroids were synthetic with relatively low concentrations ranging from 0 85 0 06 ng g 17β bol to 21 7 4 53 ng g lngt natural steroids dominated the detected steroids with higher concentrations than those of synthetic origins 5α dhp possessed the highest detection concentrations in both farms lc 7 000 1620 ng g and st 2 070 1250 ng g the abundance of 5α dhp in these two farms may be mainly related to these two swine farms population structure these two selected farms primary business is high quality piglet breeding and the sows in stock are all pregnant according to literature dombroski et al 1997 scholtz et al 2014 the levels of 5α dhp in the bodies of vertebrates during pregnancy especially the late stage of pregnancy could up to tens of ng ml which might be the main reason for the high detection concentration of 5α dhp in the present study following 5α dhp endogenous steroids such as p eadr aed and add also had relatively high detection concentrations in feces ranging from hundreds to thousands of ng g the detected and dominant steroids in the feces of both farms were similar while the levels in farm st were lower in general it is worth noting that even with a smaller farm scale the detected levels of steroids in feces of farm lc were higher than farm st such a situation might be due to the difference in feeding regimen and dietary composition of these two farms possibly influencing metabolism and conjugate formation of the target steroid hormones also the difference in the solid liquid separator s treating technique in the wtss of the two farms may explain the differences incomplete separation would result in fecal residue persisting in the subsequent treatment system with the wastewater thus causing the concentrations of target steroids to be higher in the aqueous phase and lower in the feces the higher concentrations of target steroids detected in the dewatered sludge of farm st appear to support this possibility sixteen target steroids were detected in the dewatered sludge of the two farms with ten in farm lc and fifteen in farm st the concentrations of most detected steroids were a few ng g eadr 5α dhp and p were dominant among the detected steroids with concentrations up to 850 40 0 ng g 456 26 4 ng g and 122 4 35 ng g in farm lc and concentrations up to 1 110 167 ng g 1 330 223 ng g and 110 13 1 ng g in farm st respectively the detected concentration of prel in farm st was as high as 247 73 0 ng g after treatment by the wtss some target steroid hormones had been completely removed and the concentrations of most detected hormones were significantly reduced in the aqueous phase however some target steroid hormones remained in the effluent and were transported to the receiving environment a total of 18 target steroids were detected in the effluent of farm lc and 12 were synthetic while 20 target steroids including 12 synthetics were found in farm st 5α dhp still dominated with its concentration as high as 22 1 5 05 ng l lc and 76 5 9 22 ng l st while the concentrations of other detected steroids ranged from a few tenths to several ng l some steroids such as 5α dht mfst et and mgt were not detected in the influent but later found in the subsequent treatment process and the effluent this situation might be due to the following possible reasons the matrix interference effect weakened when the sewage became cleaner in the following process sections and made those compounds detectable or they were transformed from other steroids with similar structures the rqs for the detected steroid hormones in the effluents were calculated based on their estimated pnec values and the highest mec values for each compound as the worst case scenario tables s6 s7 it can be seen from fig 4 that most of the synthetic steroid hormones in the effluent would possess high environmental risks especially for synthetic androgens such as 17α tbl 17β tbl 5α dht and mt whose rq values were far greater than 1 ranged from 12 4 to 801 other synthetic progestins in the effluents would also pose medium to high risks the adverse effects of synthetic steroid hormones on aquatic organisms have been reported ankley et al 2003 found that exposure to 17β tbl at concentrations higher than 0 027 μg l for 21 days would significantly reduce the fecundity of fathead minnow sone et al 2005 reported that exposure to mt 0 1 10 μg l or 17β tbl 1 10 μg l after 28 d would induce masculinization of adult mosquitofish females and stimulate precocious spermatogenesis in the testes of males and the formation of ovotestes in females after long term exposure to 17α tbl of 120 ng l robinson et al 2017 observed adverse effects on the fecundity of fathead minnow after a 14 days and a 21 days exposure to dht panter et al 2004 found that the number of nuptial tubercles in fathead minnow was significantly increased and the plasma vtg concentrations were significantly elevated in male fish but inhibited in female fish jiang et al 2019 conducted experiments to expose zebrafish danio rerio embryos to 2 8 27 6 and 289 8 ng l dydrogesterone for 140 days and found it led to male biased zebrafish sex ratios according to the research of shi et al 2019 the exposure to 42 0 ng l 1 of mpa caused a 60 proportion of male zebrafish therefore the detected high rq steroids in the effluents would have much higher ecological risks to aquatic fish in the oxidation fish ponds of these two farms and they might further pose ecological risks to aquatic organisms in the receiving environments it should be noted that this was a simple risk assessment with limited toxicity data and the risks from each compound may change when more toxicity data are available in the future in addition it is unclear how the presence of multiple steroids could affect cumulative organismal risk further research is needed to understand specific biological effects in the receiving environments 3 2 source analysis of synthetic steroids in the swine farms in livestock farms synthetic steroids are used as veterinary drugs or anabolic preparations such as nortestosterone ntr stanozolol s trenbolone acetate tba and melengestrol acetate mga lange et al 2002 kang et al 2008 fragkaki et al 2009 kaklamanos et al 2009 liu et al 2012b among the steroid hormones detected in farms lc and st although endogenous hormones dominated various synthetic steroids were also detected twenty two synthetic steroids including seven androgens 14 progestogens and one glucocorticoid were detected in the wastewater and a total of 14 synthetic steroids were detected in the feces including five androgens seven progestogens and two glucocorticoids according to the literature boldenone a synthetic androgen that is commonly used as a growth promoter has been found in feces and flush water samples sangiorgi et al 2005 arioli et al 2008 in recent years the use of bol in the animal breeding industry has been banned by the eu however research by arioli et al 2008 pointed out that boldenone in feces can interconvert with endogenous androgens like add under some circumstances therefore it is not clear whether the bol detected in this study were naturally produced or a metabolite from the pharmaceuticals besides bol androgens such as 4 oha 17β tbl and s also had relatively high detection frequencies and concentrations 4 oha is commonly used as an aromatase inhibitor in positive breast cancer therapy khubieh et al 1987 zilembo et al 1993 it is uncommon to detect such high concentrations of 4 oha in farms and may be due to exogenous usage for therapeutic purposes during pig breeding liu et al 2012b 17β tbl and 17α tbl are metabolic products of growth promoter tba and can be excreted via feces from implanted animals khan et al 2008 the detected trenbolone α and β forms indicates the presence of tba implanted swine in these two farms liu et al 2012b as a synthetic derivate of ttr s can improve appetite cause weight gain and enhance muscle strength davidson and plumb 2003 and typically used as a performance enhancer or growth promoter in the veterinary field deshmukh et al 2011 unlike its precursor ttr s has only been detected in the aquatic environment if in veterinary use medical treatment or illegally used by athletes deshmukh et al 2011 the detection of s in farms is rare and s s detection in our study was likely due to administration during swine breeding along with androgens various synthetic progestogens were detected in the farms lc and st the levels of ntra dgt cmd mpa cpra and 19 ntd were relatively high in the wastewater samples while lngt and dpn were abundant in the feces synthetic progestogens are commonly used in the animal breeding industry for animal rut control contraception and fattening halnan 1965 kelly mortensen and pedersen 2007 lõhmus and kender 2007 however only the usages of synthetic steroids tba and mga were officially approved in the animal breeding industry by fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations in contrast all kinds of steroid hormones are forbidden in agriculture animal breeding by the eu passantino 2012 animal experiments indicated that synthetic progestogens such as cpra mpa ntra lngt and hpa are potentially cancerogenic finkel et al 1973 detection of dgt ntra and cmd were hints of exogenous addition of progestogen drugs other exogenous progestogens detected with relatively high or low concentrations may have stemmed from the transformation of parent compounds by microbial transformation jenkins et al 2003 janeczko and skoczowski 2005 lee et al 2007 carson et al 2008 studies on synthetic progestogens in the environment to date are limited and need further exploration due to their inhibitory effects on inflammatory allergic and immunological diseases glucocorticoids are widely used in veterinary medicine synthetic prel was detected in the feces of farm lc with concentrations at 21 6 3 10 ng g which is similar to that in a previous study which was 32 0 ng g liu et al 2012a at present there are very few studies of glucocorticoids in animal breeding farms some research pointed out that under the action of biological dehydrogenase crn in feces was metabolized to prel arioli et al 2010 like bol it is unclear if the detected prel was exogenously added or produced endogenously as the source of crn was unknown in the literature synthetic steroid hormones such as bol prednisone and prednisolone which can be endogenous in some cases are referred to as pseudo endogenous hormones or gray substances scarth et al 2009 therefore the origin of these substances in the environmental matrices cannot be definitively determined 3 3 excretion of steroids hormones in swine farms and their release to environment steroid hormones in livestock farms are discharged via animal feces and urine after metabolism in the present study two methods were used to estimate the steroid hormones in swine farms they were estimated emissions of steroid hormones from swine farms based on the farm animals and the mass loadings of steroid hormones based on the wtss of the swine farms these two estimation methods can reflect the contribution of swine farms to steroid hormone pollution in the environment from different aspects according to the estimation methods introduced in si combined with the detected concentrations of each target steroid and the necessary information of farms lc and st the amounts of steroid hormones discharged through feces and urine in the two swine farms were estimated and are listed in table 1 the daily estimated masses of steroids in farm lc from fecal excretion and flush water were 445 μg d pig for androgens 2 470 μg d pig for progestogens 9 75 μg d pig for glucocorticoids and the estimated masses of steroids in farm st for androgens progestogens and glucocorticoids were 363 μg d pig 865 μg d pig and 0 19 μg d pig respectively the total estimated daily excretions of these three kinds of steroids in the two swine farms amounted to 5 850 mg d and 3 560 mg d in the present study the amounts of steroid hormones excreted by the sow through feces were higher than that via urine which is consistent with the literature results liu et al 2012a it is also the reason that despite higher sow stock and higher detected steroid levels in the flush water of farm st its total contribution of steroid hormones was still lower than that of farm lc in the present study the estimated average daily amounts of progestogens excreted per sow through flush water and feces of these two swine farms were 4 940 mg lc and 2 510 mg st respectively these estimates were in a similar range to 3160 mg and 8286 mg from the previous studies liu et al 2012b liu et al 2015 the reasons for the difference were mainly due to the difference in the farm scale the structure of the main group and the target steroids liu et al 2012a estimated the daily amounts of several natural steroid hormones discharged by standardized individuals the daily excretions of aed eard and p in that research were 1 9 μg d 115 μg d and 57 5 μg d respectively in the present study the average daily emissions of those steroids of a normalized sow were 41 5 μg d 268 μg d and 661 μg d respectively which were much higher than the average daily emissions of those steroids per capita liu et al 2012a in addition the average daily emissions of 5α dhp and add per sow were as high as 982 μg d and 85 7 μg d which was noteworthy the mass loadings of target steroid hormones detected in the wtss of both farms are shown in table s8 and fig 5 it can be seen from the results that the average daily total mass loadings of the three classes of steroid hormones in the influents of farms lc and st were 680 mg d and 3 040 mg d respectively several natural steroid hormones were predominant in the influent including 5α dhp add aed eadr and p with their average daily mass loadings up to 175 mg d 133 mg d 75 8 mg d 203 mg d 54 9 mg d farm lc and 1550 mg d 200 mg d 97 5 mg d 680 mg d 358 mg d farm st respectively in the effluent the average daily total mass loadings of the three classes of steroid hormones in farms lc and st were 1 27 mg d and 6 59 mg d respectively with 5α dhp aed add and prel contributing the most it can be seen that the average daily mass loadings of steroid hormones in the wts of farm st were higher than those of farm lc whether in influent or effluent in the feces of farms lc and st the daily average total mass loadings of the target steroid hormones were 2 850 mg d and 1 180 mg d respectively in farm lc progestogens 5α dhp and p were the largest mass loading contributors in feces with their daily average mass loadings up to 1 290 mg d and 1 170 mg d androgens such as eadr and add also had relatively high daily average mass loadings of 228 mg d and 92 mg d respectively similar to farm lc 5α dhp 655 mg d eadr 259 mg d and p 179 mg d contributed the most in the total mass loading of steroids in the feces of farm st the mass loadings of target steroids in the dewatered sludge were significantly lower than those of the influent and feces the total daily average mass loadings of the target steroid hormones in the dewatered sludge of farms lc and st were 29 mg d and 81 8 mg d among them the dominant contributors were 5α dhp and eadr with their daily average mass loadings up to 11 3 mg d and 13 6 mg d respectively lc and 40 2 mg d and 30 6 mg d respectively st while the contribution of other steroids was much less the mass loading of prel in farm st was relatively high 4 53 mg d with its contribution close to the natural p 4 45 mg d as shown in table s8 and fig 5 in farms lc and st the total mass loadings of the target steroid hormones discharged via urine and feces were 1 29 kg yr and 1 54 kg yr respectively although the values of total mass loadings of steroid hormones in the two swine farms were similar their sources were quite different in farm lc 19 3 of the steroid hormones came from urine and 80 6 came from feces while in farm st 72 1 of steroid hormones came from urine and feces contributed 28 0 the significant difference between the two farms was mainly attributed to the extremely high concentration of 5α dhp in urine from farm st as well as the concentration differences of predominant steroid hormones such as p and eadr in urine and feces from these two farms after the treatment the total mass loadings of the three classes of steroid hormones in the effluents of farms lc and st were significantly reduced to only 0 46 g yr lc and 2 41 g yr st showing the critical role of the integrated wtss in reducing the pollution level of steroid hormones transported to the environment from swine farms however those kinds of integrated wtss in the present study were not common in animal feeding farms according to the ministry of housing and urban rural development of china in 2016 only 22 of the livestock wastewater was discharged after treatment while nearly 80 was discharged directly to the receiving environments china is a large animal husbandry country with vast amounts of livestock production in our study we estimated the total amount of progestogens produced by sows in 2016 and which was as high as 22 700 kg if there was 80 of untreated livestock wastewater then the estimated amount of progestogens produced by sows and finally discharged into the environment in this research could reach 18 160 kg year which is much higher than that discharged from domestic wastewater treatment plants liu et al 2012a current farm waste management in china is still relatively backward and those integrated wastewater treatment systems in the present study are only found in some large scale farms for most small and medium sized livestock farms in rural areas their wastewater treatment efficiencies are much lower than those in urban areas in summary environmental pollution with steroid hormones from the animal breeding industry to the environment is more significant than that resulting from human sources 3 4 evaluation of the steroid hormones removal in different wastewater treatment systems aqueous phase removal rates for the detected steroids in farm lc were from 200 to 100 table 2 table s9 with most of the target compounds removed efficiently the removal efficiencies for total androgens and progestogens were favorable final removal rates exceeding 99 while the removal of glucocorticoids was less effective with negative removal rates for most glucocorticoids all detected androgens were effectively removed with nearly all of them having removal rates exceeding 95 exception the synthetic androgen s 89 3 the removal efficiencies of progestogens were slightly worse than that of androgens with an actual negative removal rate for the synthetic progestin mga 200 natural progestogens showed better removal than synthetic progestogens with removal rates 90 compared to removal rates of the synthetic progestogens dpn and et of only 16 7 and 19 6 the removal rates of target steroids in farm st ranged from 252 1 to 100 table s10 similar to farm lc most steroids were efficiently removed the final removal rates of androgens and progestogens all exceeded 99 while the lowest removal rate negative was found for glucocorticoids compared with farm lc the wts of farm st was less effective in the removal of androgens the lowest removal rates of 17β tbl and 17α tbl in farm st were 78 1 and 89 3 while their removal rates were 100 in farm lc in contrast farm st possessed better performance in removing progestogens when compared to farm lc overall the two wtss had relatively sound effects on removing target hormones with the final removal rates of total detected steroids exceeded 99 while for certain steroids such as 17β tbl 17α tbl crl and prel or certain types of steroid hormones such as androgens and glucocorticoids the removal performance of farm st was relatively low when comparing with farm lc therefore in comparison the wts in farm lc was more effective than the wts in farm st in removing steroid hormones in this study the three classes of target steroid hormones were effectively eliminated in the wtss of farms lc and st with total removal efficiencies exceeding 99 5 and 99 6 in many other studies the wastewater treatment facilities equipped in the livestock farms were simple mainly consisting of waste lagoons sedimentation tanks and biogas tanks arnon et al 2008 liu et al 2012b liu et al 2012c liu et al 2015 however liu et al 2015 pointed out that the removal of steroid hormones especially progestogens by a pure waste lagoon alone is limited only 30 40 while the lagoon biogas digester system can significantly remove steroid hormones and subsequent oxidation fish ponds can further dilute the levels of steroid hormones before discharge into the surrounding environments liu et al 2015 the wtss in the present study are integrated systems with four stages primary treatment primary sedimentation tank secondary biological treatment biogas digester or uasb third stage disinfection process and fourth stage dilution process oxidation fish ponds the detected steroids were well removed after the treatment by wts indicating that these two integrated treatment facilities can effectively prevent the massive amounts of steroid hormones in animal breeding wastewater from being transported to the receiving environments studies have pointed out that the principal removal mechanisms of steroid hormones during wastewater treatment are adsorption degradation and advanced oxidation liu et al 2009 liu et al 2015 the part of volatilization loss is negligible based on the physical and chemical properties of steroid hormones it can be seen from tables s9 s10 that the removal of the steroids mainly occurred in the biochemical units biogas digesters and uasb tanks through microbial degradation along with additional adsorption by the biogas digester filler the treatment units using flocculation and precipitation or ultraviolet sterilization had no apparent effects on the removal of steroid hormones while the subsequently connected oxidation ponds further diluted the concentrations and reduced their residual environmental levels liu et al 2015 in the present study it can be seen that steroid hormone efficiencies of wts in farm lc especially some synthetic progestogens are better than those of farm st by comparing the removal rates of certain steroids this may be due to the adsorption of progestogens by biogas digester fillers in addition to biodegradation liu et al 2015 besides the hrt of wts in farm lc was longer which was beneficial to removing steroids by microorganisms in the biochemical units what s more the difference in the microorganism communities in the biochemical units was also a possible reason for the removal efficiency difference of the two wtss from tables s9 s10 there is a clear indication that among all treatment units in each wts biogas digesters and uasb tank possessed better performance in removing steroid hormones compared with traditional waste lagoons the hydraulic retention time of these two anaerobic fermentation units in the present study is more prolonged allowing for more contact time with microorganisms particulate matter to degrade and adsorb steroid hormones in the wastewater nevertheless more research is needed to better understand the influencing factors of steroid hormone removal in the wtss of livestock farms 4 conclusion the results from this investigation showed the presence of 31 and 22 out of 40 target steroid hormones in the wastewater and feces of two large scale swine farms with integrated wtss some synthetic steroid hormones were detected indicating possible exogenous addition the emission of steroid hormones from swine farms was assessed and the emission amounts of steroids such as aed add eadr p and 5α dhp were found much higher than those discharged by human sewage both wtss in the swine farms can remove steroid hormones efficiently in comparison the anaerobic digester a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic lagoon system performed better than the uasb a o 2 double anoxic oxic lagoon system in terms of steroids removal efficiency despite the high removal efficiencies in wtss several synthetic steroids with high rqs were detected in the effluents suggesting high risks to aquatic organisms further research is needed to understand specific biological effects in the receiving environments the findings from this study suggest that swine farms are an important source of steroids in the environment and proper treatment facilities should be applied to reduce the potential ecological risks declaration

17193,due to the increasing diversity of organic contaminants discharged into anoxic water environments reactivity prediction is necessary for chemical persistence evaluation for water treatment and risk assessment purposes almost all quantitative structure activity relationships qsars that describe rates of contaminant transformation apply only to narrowly defined relatively homogenous families of reactants e g dechlorination of alkyl halides in this work we develop predictive models for abiotic reduction of 60 organic compounds with diverse reducible functional groups including nitroaromatic compounds nacs aliphatic nitro compounds ancs aromatic n oxides anos isoxazoles isxs polyhalogenated alkanes phas sulfoxides and sulfones sos and others rate constants for their reduction were measured using a model reductant system fe ii tiron qualitatively the rates followed the order nacs anos isxs phas ancs sos to develop qsars both conventional chemical descriptor based and machine learning ml based approaches were investigated conventional univariate qsars based on a molecular descriptor e lumo energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gave good correlations within classes multivariate qsars combining e lumo with abraham descriptors for physico chemical properties gave slightly improved correlations within classes for ncs and nacs but little improvement in correlation within other classes or among classes the ml model obtained covers reduction rates for all classes of compounds and all of the conditions studied with the prediction accuracy similar to those of the conventional qsars for individual classes r2 0 41 0 98 for univariate qsars 0 71 0 94 for multivariate qsars and 0 83 for the ml model both approaches required a scheme for a priori classification of the compounds for model training this work offers two alternative modeling approaches to comprehensive abiotic reactivity prediction for persistence evaluation of organic compounds in anoxic water environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords qsars fe ii reductant abiotic reduction kinetics machine learning organic contaminants 1 introduction reduction is one of the primary transformation pathways for organic contaminants in anoxic water environments such as aquifers lake sediments and anaerobic bioreactors in these reducing environments abiotic reduction rates vary with the structure and properties of the contaminants the reaction conditions and the type of reductant many different organic contaminants can be discharged into natural and engineered water environments for example groundwater can be polluted by explosives at military bases kim and strathmann 2007 or insecticide and pesticide residues from agricultural activities naka et al 2006 when these contaminants leach down to subsurface water due to natural rainfall and agricultural irrigation in addition the wide application of chlorinated solvents in home care or as industrial solvents moran et al 2007 and the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water treatment plants chen et al 2018 emphasize the increasing diversity of organic contaminants in anoxic water environments as a result chemical persistence evaluation for water treatment and environmental risk assessment is required to mitigate potential risks to human and natural environments reactivity is one of the most important aspects in water treatment and risk assessment therefore reactivity prediction is necessary to prevent adverse impacts caused by organic pollution so far most kinetic studies on reductive transformation of organic contaminants have focused on three classes of compounds nitro compounds ncs naka et al 2006 nitrogen oxygen containing compounds nocs chen and zhang 2013 and polyhalogenated alkanes phas lyman et al 2000 macalady et al 1986 bussan and strathmann 2007 ncs contain the reducible nitro group s no2 including both substituted nitroaromatics nacs and aliphatic nitro compounds ancs nacs are commonly found among pesticides and munitions naka et al 2006 while ancs include neonicotinoids nitroamines nitrosoamines and most explosives kim and strathmann 2007 nocs contain the nitrogen oxygen single bond n o and can be further divided into aromatic n oxides anos isoxazoles isxs hydroxylamines and oximes chen et al 2016 nocs have been often used as pesticides pharmaceuticals and industrial chemical intermediates and can form as transformation intermediates during wastewater treatment chen et al 2018 polyhalogenated organics with reducible halogen atoms x f cl br are the largest class of organic compounds that can be reduced biotically with some of the phas being highly toxic subsurface contaminants torralba sanchez et al 2020 given the enormous diversity of organic contaminants and that most of the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar studies concentrate on the oxidation of environmental contaminants in natural and engineered systems lee and von gunten 2012 there is interest in development of comprehensive predictive models for the reductive reactivity of all potentially reducible compounds a major aspect of most research on reductive transformation of contaminants is the measurement of reaction rates once reaction rate data are available for multiple contaminants they can be subjected to correlation analysis which serves multiple purposes tratnyek et al 2017 tratnyek and macalady 1998 at a minimum correlation analysis can serve to verify the consistency and accuracy of the data ultimately correlation analysis can be a powerful diagnostic tool for evaluating mechanisms by which molecular structures influence reactivity however the main goal of correlation analysis usually is the development of qsars that can be used to predict reaction rate constants where reliable data are not available for this purpose the value of qsars increases with the breadth of their applicability this is however contrary to many qsar studies which tend to prioritize model accuracy over breadth and achieve this by narrowing the scope to reactants that are structurally similar and descriptors that are closely related to the expected reaction mechanism tratnyek et al 2017 examples of highly accurate qsars for narrow sets of reactants and mechanistically exact descriptors are common for reduction rates of several classes of organic compounds the nacs system i e substituted nitrobenzenes is prototypical with numerous studies demonstrating good correlations between reduction rate constants and one electron reduction potentials e 1 gorski et al 2010 klausen et al 1995 salter blanc et al 2015 stewart et al 2018 recently the nacs were used to demonstrate the utility of a related descriptor gibbs free energy of hydrogen atom attachment di toro et al 2019 murillo gelvez et al 2019 for phas the most comprehensive qsar is the one developed for the reduction rates of c1 and c2 phas with electron transfer mediators such as iron porphyrin and mercaptojuglone and chemical descriptors including the bond dissociation energy standard free energy of one electron reduction g and e lumo perlinger et al 2000 for the complexation facilitated reduction of anos by fe ii tiron complex the electron affinity no bond length and atomic spin density were tested as descriptors for qsar analysis but no relationships between the descriptor variables and kinetics data were found chen et al 2016 chen and zhang 2013 despite the success of prior work at developing qsars for reduction kinetics of narrowly defined sets of contaminants and reaction conditions few studies have tried to expand the scope of qsar applicability to more diverse types of molecular structures or reaction conditions tratnyek et al 2017 the several exceptions to this illustrate the many challenges li et al 2019 miehr et al 2004 in order to develop qsars that can be applied to diverse reactants and reaction conditions more advanced models appear to be necessary these could involve multivariate linear models such as the response surface conceptual model proposed in tratnyek et al 2017 classical dimensionality reduction methods such as the principle component analysis used by katseanes et al 2017 or the machine learning ml method among them ml has been a dominant approach in predictive modeling in many fields in recent years due to the preponderance of big data alpaydin 2020 smola and vishwanathan 2008 prediction driven ml is advantageous in developing predictive models because ml algorithms aim to automatically learn patterns from a large amount of data and make accurate prediction with a rich set of input features hutter et al 2019 parish and duraisamy 2016 another advantage of ml is that it requires minimal assumptions about the relationship between the predictors and response variables alpaydin 2020 the latter would work particularly well when an increasing number of diverse organic contaminants are involved in qsar development because there are likely unknown non linear relationships between the complex contaminant structures and reactivity for example borhani et al 2016 used multiple linear regression and a neural network to develop qsars for 457 contaminants toward the oh radical and found that the model developed by the neural network had higher predictive performance we recently successfully used three ml algorithms to develop accurate qsars for 1000 organic contaminants toward oh zhong et al 2021 zhong et al 2020 2021 however no studies have employed ml to develop predictive models for contaminant reduction the overall goal of this research was to develop a flexible all inclusive predictive model that can describe rates of abiotic reduction of as wide a range of aqueous organic compounds as possible in pursuit of this goal this research aimed to i build a uniquely comprehensive dataset for the reduction kinetics of potentially reducible organic compounds in the same reduction system ii obtain an inclusive model that incorporates all of the investigated chemical classes under various conditions within the same reduction system iii investigate possible factors influencing the model performance and iv compare the conventional uni or multi variate qsars with those obtained by the ml approach to accomplish the first two objectives we chose fe ii tiron complexes as our model system because this reductant the soluble 1 2 fe ii tiron complex fel2 6 in particular has several advantages over other reductants e g hydroquinones it behaves analogously to mineral surface associated fe ii while being more reactive and easier to work with li et al 2019 in addition the effect of the major reductant fel2 6 on reduction rates is well understood and a quantitative method for normalizing first order rate constants is well calibrated bussan and strathmann 2007 naka et al 2006 with the selected model reductant we examined the reduction rates of 60 compounds including 12 nacs 8 ancs 12 anos 7 isxs 14 phas 3 sos 2 nitroso compounds n hydroxylamine pnhoh and pentachlorophenol pcp we then applied different training dataset to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the conventional molecular descriptor based qsar and ml approach multiple influencing factors on the model development were investigated such as the effects of chemical grouping chemical diversity chemical descriptor type of rate constant and size of the kinetics database through the development of predictive tools for abiotic reactivity this work attempts to provide the much needed prediction of the reductive reactivity of all potentially reducible contaminants and investigates the applicability and predictive performance of multiple methods such tools are critical for supporting the environmental protection agency s chemical transformation simulator cts which is a web based tool available to the public at https qed epacdx net cts for predicting environmental and biological transformation pathways and physicochemical properties of organic chemicals the results of this research will directly support the development of a cts module consisting of qsars for the calculation of rate constants for abiotic reduction for a diverse set of chemicals under a variety of reducing conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials a full list of studied compounds and their analytical methods are given in table a 1 and text a 1 respectively 2 2 chemical grouping for development of a comprehensive predictive model the chemical list was designed to the full range of environmentally relevant classes of compounds with reducible functional groups to classify these compounds we tested two grouping methods table 1 the first method g1 4 has four chemical classes ncs nocs phas and other reducible compounds orcs described below in the second grouping approach g2 6 we refined ncs to include nacs and ancs and nocs to anos and isxs phas remains unchanged but can be divided into c1 and c2 compounds the project scope also includes at least one representative compound for other major chemical classes for example pnhoh and pcp to represent hydroxylamines and polyhalogenated aromatics respectively the latter compounds are labelled as orcs and include sulfoxides and sulfones sos nitroso compounds i e ndma and tnx hydroxylamines and halogenated aromatics the detailed assignment of compounds to groups is given in table a 1 grouping also was a necessary data preprocessing step for development of ml based qsars for this we applied the same grouping strategies but added 2 new groups by excluding orcs from g1 4 and g2 6 namely g1 3 and g2 5 table 1 since the mixed and uncharacterized chemical diversity in orcs would introduce more uncertainty and diversity our recent study showed that grouped chemicals based on their structures can achieve better predictive performance and unbiased evaluation on the model performance 2 3 reduction experiments for organic compounds reduction experiments were conducted in batch reactors with constant stirring inside an oxygen free glovebox fe ii free controls were examined simultaneously to account for non reduction processes typical reaction conditions were ph 5 1 8 0 10 50 μm organic compound 0 5 2 or 10 mm fe ii 5 10 or 50 mm tiron 0 2 m nacl and 50 mm buffer mops buffer for ph 6 5 8 0 and acetate buffer for ph 5 1 6 0 the concentration of fel2 6 fel2 6 was manipulated by varying the concentrations of fe2 tiron nacl or the solution ph to obtain pseudo first order kinetics for compound reduction a stable concentration of fel2 6 was achieved by addition of excess fe ii and tiron at a fixed ph kinetics measurement was not affected by the organic buffers reacting with the reducing agent because no reaction was observed in control reactors data not shown additional experimental details can be found in text a 2 2 4 kinetic analysis and data sets the observed pseudo first order rate constants k obs were obtained by linear regression of ln c vs time as illustrated in fig a 1 left column the fits generally were very good r2 0 98 next k obs was normalized to a fixed reductant concentration details in text a 3 so that we can directly compare the reactivity of different compounds the normalized k obs is referred to as k 1 norm hereafter both k obs and k 1 norm are first order rate constants and are denoted as k 1 to obtain an accurate measure of the reactivity the speciation of fe ii tiron must be considered the general relationship between k obs and different fe ii tiron species is described by the classical kinetic model in eq 1 naka et al 2006 1 k o b s k i f e l i n i where k i denotes the bimolecular rate constant for individual feli species feli m 1 s 1 is the molar concentration of the corresponding species and n i denotes the reaction order of species feli n i has almost always been assumed to be 1 in the relevant literature curtis and reinhard 1994 murillo gelvez et al 2019 schwarzenbach et al 1990 tratnyek and macalady 1989 but this is not necessarily correct in all cases previous work bussan and strathmann 2007 kim and strathmann 2007 naka et al 2006 has shown that fel2 6 is the predominant reactive iron species in the reduction of nacs nitramines and nitroso compounds and phas by fe ii tiron which yields the simplified kinetic model eq 2 2 k o b s k 2 f e l 2 6 where k 2 is the second order rate constant however other research chen et al 2018 2016 chen and zhang 2013 li et al 2019 suggested there may be complexation facilitated reduction which could cause the apparent reaction order of fel2 6 n to differ from 1 for some compounds or other fe ii ligand complexes kim et al 2009 to accommodate this possibility we considered a more general bimolecular kinetic model 3 k o b s k 2 f e l 2 6 n which also recognizes fel2 6 as the predominant reactive species but allows varying reaction orders of fel2 6 when reacting with different compounds because n values differ for different compounds we cannot use k 2 values to directly compare compound reactivity at least two values of k obs were experimentally measured for most compounds so the method for obtaining k 2 and n was by logarithmically fitting the data to eq 4 where the slope is the apparent reaction order n with respect to fel2 6 and the intercept gives k 2 4 log k o b s n log f e l 2 6 log k 2 based on this modified kinetic model eq 3 we verified fel2 6 being the predominant species for all the compounds investigated in this study by observing strong correlations between log k obs and log fel2 6 as shown in fig a 1 right column moreover data points of experiments table a 2 where fe ii concentration tiron concentration ph or ionic strength is varied all fall on the same line indicating that the redox reactivity of fe ii is indeed dominated by fel2 6 all of these k results k obs k 1 norm k 2 and fitted values of reaction order n are summarized in tables a 2 3 2 5 conventional qsars the full rationale for selection of descriptors and details on how each descriptor was obtained are provided in text a 4 all of the obtained descriptor data are summarized in table a 4 correlations between the rate constants and individual descriptors were evaluated by visual inspection those with promise were fit by linear regression and the results were evaluated with the usual qualitative and statistical criteria for evaluating qsars tratnyek and macalady 1998 conventional qsars were developed with 3 kinetics datasets k obs k 1 norm and k 2 and 2 grouping methods g1 4 and g2 6 a univariate qsar covering all the chemical classes with e lumo was considered but there was no correlation across such a diverse range of functional groups r2 value of 0 29 with all the data points so this result is not shown however dividing the data into chemical classes gave acceptable univariate qsars with some of the molecular descriptors especially e lumo table a 5 all the successful qsars were then applied to predict reduction rates of various organic compounds and these are used to compare the accuracy among different models in the discussion section given the diversity of compounds in the training set for this study it seemed appropriate to try combining the conventional approach of univariate qsars for reactivity described above with the poly parameter linear free energy relationship pp lfer approach that often is used to model physicochemical properties pan and zhang 2014 we did this by combining the molecular reactivity descriptor e lumo table a 4 with abraham descriptors for physicochemical properties from the ufz database tables a 6 and performing step wise multiple regression on all of these data the results of multivariate qsars are summarized in table a 7 9 2 6 ml qsars we first obtained the smiles of all the organic contaminants by the chemdraw program and then obtained their molecular fingerprints mf by the rdkit package in python mf are compound representations that encode the types of atoms and how they are connected in each compound they were created using the same method as described in our recent article zhong et al 2020 we also illustrated mf by an example in that study for predicting k 1 norm and k 2 only mf were used as the input into ml while for predicting k obs the reaction conditions including the concentrations of compound fe ii and tiron ionic strength and ph were combined with their mf as the inputs into ml in order to determine an appropriate ml algorithm for model development 11 different ml algorithms from the sklearn package were first prescreened using their default hyperparameters these values can be found in https scikit learn org stable modules classes html for the dataset of g2 6 because g2 6 has the finest groups for each kinetic parameter i e k obs k 1 norm and k 2 the dataset of g2 6 was split into the training and test datasets with a ratio of 0 9 and 0 1 based on stratified sampling that is randomly choosing 90 and 10 of the compounds from each chemical class then the 11 different ml algorithms were trained on the training dataset and their predictive performance was tested on the test dataset to optimize the hyperparameters for the selected algorithm more details of the hyperparameters in table a 10 the training dataset was further split 5 times with the same ratio 0 9 0 1 from each chemical class to form 5 groups i e 5 cross validation in which each group contained one training and one validation dataset the hyperparameters were optimized on these 5 groups and the corresponding validation dataset was used to control overfitting to further control overfitting we applied early stopping during the training process in which the training process will be stopped once the predictive performance on the test dataset is not improved within 100 epoches the optimum hyperparameters were obtained by minimizing the average root mean square error rmse of all the 5 validation datasets using the bayesian optimization algorithm with the optimized hyperparameters the selected algorithm was retrained on the original training dataset to obtain the final model the overall performance of the final model was then evaluated by applying it to the test dataset the optimal parameters of the mf were also obtained by the bayesian optimization algorithm the same modeling process was repeated to obtain 4 separate models for log k obs with the 4 grouping methods mentioned above all the optimum hyperparameter values for these 4 grouping methods are listed in table a11 after the best grouping method and algorithm were determined we also replaced mf with e lumo calculated in this study to test the influence of different chemical representations on the obtained model the above code will be uploaded to github http github com a widely used web based service for code sharing review and management of open source projects using the best ml model we conducted applicability domain analysis to evaluate if reliable predictions can be made for compounds and conditions this was achieved by comparing the similarity between the feature matrix in the training data set and that of a new compound in the test dataset if a compound in the test dataset was over a pre set similarity threshold this compound was defined as outside the applicability domain and removed from the test dataset the rmse and r2 values for the test dataset were then recalculated generally the optimum similarity threshold is the one that achieves the minimum rmsetest here we used the cosine similarity that calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors details of this approach in our recent work zhang et al 2020 the higher the similarity threshold the narrower the applicability of the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 general reactivity analysis a summary of the normalized rate constants log k 1 norm for all classes of compounds studied is shown in fig 1 a among the different chemical classes i the reactivity of the compounds ranges more than 11 5 orders of difference from the lowest ndma 8 05 to the highest tnt 3 46 where the largest variation appears in anos of 7 6 orders and the smallest occurs in isxs of around 3 0 orders ii the reactivity of nacs 1 94 to 3 46 is much higher than that of ancs 6 63 to 1 11 iii although both anos and isxs contain the nitrogen oxygen single bond and have similar mean reactivity the reactivity of anos tends to vary over a much wider range iv phas present a similar range of reactivity and mean value as isxs and v the average reactivity of the examined chemical classes follows the order of nacs anos isxs phas ancs after combining nacs and ancs into ncs and anos and isxs into nocs the average reactivity of the combined group decreases to 1 47 2 70 and 3 10 for ncs nocs and phas respectively fig a 2 a comparison using log k 2 displays a reactivity pattern similar to log k 1 norm fig a 3 comparing the log k 1 norm values of nacs and ancs both of which contain nitro group s we observed aromatic nacs are more reactive than aliphatic ancs presumably because the aromatic ring tends to stabilize the accepted electrons through resonance effects in general electron withdrawing groups increased the nacs activity the more electron withdrawing groups attached to the aromatic ring the more reactive the nitro group is e g 2 4 dnt and tnt for the nocs both anos and isxs have moderate degradation rates the anos can be divided into three subclasses based on their structural features and the reactivity drops in the order of n oxides with 2 no bonds cdx tdqe mqxdo odx qxcx pyrazine n oxides mqxo and pyz pyridine n oxides pi qu and pyd over the full range of compounds studied the reaction order with respect to fel2 6 varied from 0 23 to 1 427 fig 1 b and table a 3 in most cases interestingly the more reactive compounds had larger n fig a 4 this might arise from faster formation of the initial reduction product s that might also react with fel2 6 leading to a larger observed reaction order of fel2 6 moreover it has been shown that some isxs can complex with fe ii tiron which might increase its apparent reduction rate e g amx chen et al 2018 as most of the rate constants of phas are reported at a nearly identical condition bussan and strathmann 2007 we did not conduct additional kinetic experiments for these compounds so measured values of n are not available in general it is evident that c1 phas are relatively more reactive than c2 alkanes and greater halogenation results in higher reactivity the low degradation rates for so reduction indicates that this class will be the most resistant to reduction in anoxic environments 3 2 correlation analysis with k 2 the usual approach to correlation analysis of chemical reactivity data is to prefer k 2 over k 1 because operational factors should be factored out of k 2 so that the correlations are tighter and the resulting qsars have greater generality tratnyek et al 2017 tratnyek and macalady 1998 however there are scenarios where more aggregate measures of reactivity are appropriate and may even yield more useful qsars a typical example of this is when the reactant is a complex environmental material such as anaerobic sediments zhang and weber 2013 the fe ii tiron model system used in this study is suitable for extraction of rigorously defined values of k 2 using the same type of analysis that has been done in some studies of contaminant reduction by hydroquinones murillo gelvez et al 2019 in this case that analysis would require fitting eq 1 to data for k obs measured at enough conditions to resolve the contribution of all fe ii tiron species with significant reactivity and determine their order of reaction with the parent compound unfortunately this was impractical because of the very large number of parent compounds 60 included in the scope of this study therefore we applied the modified kinetic model eq 3 to calculate k 2 with the proved assumption that the reactivity of fel2 6 accounts for majority of the overall reactivity and its order of reaction n varies with compounds the resulting estimates of k 2 were used in correlation analysis with different chemical descriptors while some weak correlations were obtained table a 5 they were much less satisfactory than those obtained with k 1 based qsars which are discussed below this result can be interpreted as evidence that the substantial variability in n for fel2 6 fig 1 b caused significant inaccuracies in the dataset 3 3 correlation analysis and conventional qsars with k 1 norm exploratory correlation analysis was performed between log k 1 norm and all descriptor variables correlations not shown but detailed descriptors in text a 4 and the most promising results were obtained between log k 1 norm and e lumo fig 2 there was little difference between correlations obtained with e lumo from the four levels of theory calculated table a 4 so only the results for the most commonly used theory b3lyp are shown qualitatively fig 2 shows little indication of correlation across the whole dataset but fairly strong linear relationships are evident within most groups of compounds nacs ancs anos and phas it has been suggested that e gap the difference between e lumo and e homo the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital might be a molecular descriptor of even greater generality than e lumo because it represents overall susceptibility to changes in electron density i e molecular hardness miehr et al 2004 however e gap only gave a good correlation with k 1 norm for anos table a 5 so was not pursued further the other descriptor of electronic properties that we were able to compute for almost all compound was e sparc termed e half in the current version of sparc but this gave inferior correlations for most chemical classes except for isxs and so is not shown for the groups of compounds that gave good correlations to e lumo linear regression was performed to obtain conventional univariate qsars the fits and fitted slopes are shown in fig 2 and detailed fitting statistics are given in table a 5 although fitting both families containing nitro groups ncs nacs and ancs together gave a good linear fit r2 0 92 this fit is not shown because fig 2 clearly suggests the two families form distinct correlations fitting nacs and ancs separately provided similarly good correlations r2 0 81 and 0 98 respectively with significantly different slopes 7 67 1 11 for nacs vs 11 99 0 88 for ancs this difference in slope suggests that k 1 norm for ancs is more sensitive to substituent effects than nacs presumably due to delocalization of electron density into the aromatic ring of the latter group as with the ncs the overall class of halogenated compounds phas did not give a meaningful correlation but dividing the data into more homogenous subgroups did the subgroups of c1 and c2 compounds gave reasonable linear fits r2 0 41 and 0 93 respectively with very different slopes 0 82 0 47 for c1 vs 12 46 1 48 for c2 note that the relatively low r2 for c1 phas is mainly due to lower number of data points and that r2 can be increased to 0 75 by replacing e lumo b3lyp with e lumo pbe the implication that dechlorination rates of c2 phas are more sensitive to structural difference than c1 phas is consistent with previous work using iron porphyrin as the reductant perlinger et al 2000 1998 the correlation for anos was statistically satisfactory mainly because it spanned the widest range of k 1 norm and e lumo a few compounds deviated significantly but were not treated as outliers although isxs also contain the n o moiety just like anos a poor correlation was observed between the reactivity and molecular descriptors this is because e lumo is more strongly associated with electron transfer and less strongly associated with electron donor acceptor interactions like complexation including other descriptors that can capture the extent of chemical complexation would provide better qsars the only univariate correlation with e sparc was obtained for isxs r2 0 63 for k 1 norm 0 35 for k 2 no qsars were obtained for the three sulfur containing compounds in orcs as they are too resistant to reduction based on the r2 for the univariate qsars obtained for ncs anos isxs and phas the capability of e lumo to explain the reductive reactivity of the organic compounds follows the order of ncs anos phas isxs this trend is consistent with the diversity in reaction mechanisms that are expected for each class chemical reduction of all nitro aromatics undergoes a similar pathway through nitrosobenzenes n hydroxylamino intermediates to anilines as for nocs a possible reason for the smaller r2 is the unignorable impact of complexation on the chemical reactivity as the different types of complexation formed before during electron transfer can alter the reaction pathways chen et al 2018 2016 chen and zhang 2013 apparently the effect of complexation on reactivity is more influential for isxs than for anos thus isxs display a smaller r2 than anos furthermore multiple degradation pathways also exist for phas such as nucleophilic substitution x philic reaction direct r x bond cleavage and bimolecular elimination perlinger et al 2000 and it has been shown that resolving these can lead to better qsars arnold and roberts 2000 cwiertny et al 2010 in an effort to coalesce the group specific correlations shown in fig 2 into one more globally applicable qsar we investigated combining one of the descriptors of electronic properties e lumo b3lyp with the abraham descriptors that are widely used in pp lfers for physico chemical properties e g partition coefficients of organic compounds using only abraham descriptors obtained from the ufz lser database table a 6 and step wise multivariate regression on log k 1 norm we obtained no statistically significant pp lfers table a 7 as expected combining e lumo with abraham descriptors in multivariate regression on k 1 norm for each class of compounds that gave good correlations to e lumo alone resulted in marginally improved fitting statistics r2 from 0 92 to 0 94 for ncs and from 0 81 to 0 86 for nacs in table a 8 more importantly this hybrid approach to correlation analysis did not help to produce a qsar that applies across the families of compounds studied these results confirm that the types of solute solvent interactions represented by abraham parameters have little or no role in determining the reactivity of compounds in the system used in this study one other approach to correlation analysis using multivariate linear regression would be to include operational variable such as ph or reactant concentration as descriptor variables rather than trying to correct for them in the response variable to illustrate this we used log k obs instead of the log k 1 norm and performed stepwise multivariate regression against one electronic property e lumo and reactant concentrations ionic strength and ph for each class of compounds ph proved to be a statistically significant descriptor however the resulting r2 decreased in most cases although it increased somewhat for nacs and phas after incorporating operational variables table a 9 note that the selection of the response variable k obs vs k 1 norm depends on the type of model to be developed and the amount of data points available for the model development 3 4 ml models the ml models fig 3 a obtained with the same response variable data sets used above k 1 norm and k 2 gave relatively poor results lowest rmse 1 19 random forest table a 12 because there were too few data k 1 norm and k 2 46 and 52 to be sufficiently representative however using log k obs 278 data points gave much better fits lowest rmse 0 43 random forest thus the results demonstrated that 1 random forest was the optimal algorithms for predicting k obs and 2 predicting k 1 norm and k 2 was much worse than k obs hence the following work focused on using random forest to predict k obs once the best performing algorithm random forest and k value log k obs were determined the impact of grouping method and chemical diversity on prediction was examined fig 3 b the more refined grouping g2 6 vs g1 4 yielded lower rmse indicating that well defined chemical classes can improve ml model performance especially when there is a relatively small data size in addition orcs is a group of compounds containing various functional groups the ml models obtained with or without orcs g2 6 and g1 4 vs g2 5 and g1 3 gave mixed results because of two conflicting effects more diversity in the training set should help improve the ml model fitting but the large unclassified chemical diversity in orcs adds to the uncertainty the model must accommodate overall the ml modeling results illustrate that expanding the size of the input database refined grouping based on chemical structural features and characterizing categorizing the diversity of reducible functional groups covered in the training data set are required to obtain reliable ml based models when replacing mf with e lumo as the chemical representation rmse of the obtained ml models are significantly greater 0 42 vs 0 69 0 80 table a 13 because this single molecular descriptor cannot capture all the involved chemical diversity then we combined e lumo with mf as the inputs to investigate if including e lumo could improve the predictive performance the mf e lumo based model showed a slightly better predictive performance with rmse 0 41 this result indicated that including different chemical representations indeed capture more features which impacts the model performance moreover based on the applicability domain analysis table a 14 the best performing model based on mf and the log k obs dataset with g2 6 as the grouping method yields the lowest threshold of 0 50 above which a reasonable predictive accuracy is expected and is hence the most widely applicable because the size of the dataset is still relatively small for ml modeling future work is needed to examine additional compounds so a more robust model can be built 3 5 comparison between conventional qsars and ml models fig 3 c compares the best conventional qsars and ml model both the univariate and multivariate qsars demonstrate similar reasonable predictions to those of the ml model except that the prediction for ano from the univariate qsar shows more deviation from the 1 1 line because of a lower r2 0 64 of the obtained correlation the univariate qsars give r2 ranging from 0 41 to 0 98 while multivariate qsars have better model performance with r2 between 0 71 and 0 94 compared to the conventional approach the ml model presents reasonable prediction with r2 of 0 83 we also calculated the ratio of predicted over experimental log k values to obtain a better understanding of the model performance as shown in table a 15 nearly all predictions by the developed models are within a factor of 1 2 2 compared to the experimental values except for nacs and anos whose predictions are mostly within a factor of 1 3 3 8 out of 12 for nacs 8 out of 10 for anos the two approaches in this work for qsar development have distinct advantages and disadvantages both approaches have the same pre requisite for chemical classification where users need to categorize organic compounds but separate qsars are needed for different chemical classes whereas only one unified ml model is enough a defining characteristic of the conventional qsar approach is that correlations are obtained using chemical descriptor data as the independent variable s and only compounds for which the descriptor data are available can be used in the model chemical descriptor data can be obtained by direct measurements e g half wave potential empirical values e g hammett constants and or in silico calculations e g e lumo while these descriptor data contribute chemical information obtaining complete and reliable sets of descriptor data for qsar development can require considerable effort and expertise when applying the obtained qsars for prediction purposes the reliance on chemical descriptor data can become an obstacle in contrast ml models can be developed based on versatile chemical representations beyond molecular descriptors such as mf used in this study which are of particular interest because only basic chemical structure information is required the two types of models also differ in how environmental conditions are considered in the model conventional qsars factor reaction conditions out of the response variable before correlation analysis i e use k 2 rather than k obs this is effective for well structured datasets but is impractical for much of the data from complex environmental systems in contrast our approach to incorporating environmental conditions in the ml model can directly use raw reactivity data i e k obs and include reaction conditions as predictor variables which does not involve a priori assumptions about the kinetic model and therefore allows more accurate prediction this also makes it more practical to apply ml over a wide range of compounds reactions and conditions also the predictive power of the resulting ml model will be robust if the training dataset is large and diverse enough in addition to the characteristics of qsar and ml models described above there is an overarching issue that concerns the transparency of the models qsars are transparent in that they are relatively easy to document visualize and interpret in terms of how different physicochemical and structural properties affect the reactivity in contrast ml models are comparatively opaque or black box in that the relationship between model output and chemical processes usually is left undefined recently however we have verified that ml models can be physically meaningful zhong et al 2021 but mechanistic interpretation and validation of ml models is not yet a common practice overall both the conventional chemical descriptor based qsars and ml based models are valuable tools in reactivity prediction because of a growing number of organic contaminants discharged into natural and engineered water environments there is an increasing demand for chemical persistence evaluation for potential water treatment consideration however conducting kinetics studies for every organic contaminant in different water environments is time consuming and labor intensive this research provides two much needed models for the prediction of abiotic reduction by a soluble fe ii reductant in this context our ongoing research focuses on developing more comprehensive predictive models covering different fe ii reductants for anoxic water treatment and persistence evaluation 4 conclusions this work develops the most comprehensive models for the prediction of reductive reactivity with the largest number of organic compounds covering the most diverse range of reducible functional groups it ranks the reactivity of 60 organic contaminants toward reduction by fe ii tiron complex which can be used to evaluate the environmental persistence of different chemical classes in anoxic water environments the developed predictive models are established using two approaches namely the conventional chemical descriptor based qsar and ml based on the obtained models we compared the two modeling approaches for environmental applications in short both approaches need pre classification of chemicals prior to model development and both approaches are capable of providing reasonable predictions but with different advantages and disadvantages overall this study offers two types of versatile modeling approaches for comprehensive reactivity prediction of

17193,due to the increasing diversity of organic contaminants discharged into anoxic water environments reactivity prediction is necessary for chemical persistence evaluation for water treatment and risk assessment purposes almost all quantitative structure activity relationships qsars that describe rates of contaminant transformation apply only to narrowly defined relatively homogenous families of reactants e g dechlorination of alkyl halides in this work we develop predictive models for abiotic reduction of 60 organic compounds with diverse reducible functional groups including nitroaromatic compounds nacs aliphatic nitro compounds ancs aromatic n oxides anos isoxazoles isxs polyhalogenated alkanes phas sulfoxides and sulfones sos and others rate constants for their reduction were measured using a model reductant system fe ii tiron qualitatively the rates followed the order nacs anos isxs phas ancs sos to develop qsars both conventional chemical descriptor based and machine learning ml based approaches were investigated conventional univariate qsars based on a molecular descriptor e lumo energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gave good correlations within classes multivariate qsars combining e lumo with abraham descriptors for physico chemical properties gave slightly improved correlations within classes for ncs and nacs but little improvement in correlation within other classes or among classes the ml model obtained covers reduction rates for all classes of compounds and all of the conditions studied with the prediction accuracy similar to those of the conventional qsars for individual classes r2 0 41 0 98 for univariate qsars 0 71 0 94 for multivariate qsars and 0 83 for the ml model both approaches required a scheme for a priori classification of the compounds for model training this work offers two alternative modeling approaches to comprehensive abiotic reactivity prediction for persistence evaluation of organic compounds in anoxic water environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords qsars fe ii reductant abiotic reduction kinetics machine learning organic contaminants 1 introduction reduction is one of the primary transformation pathways for organic contaminants in anoxic water environments such as aquifers lake sediments and anaerobic bioreactors in these reducing environments abiotic reduction rates vary with the structure and properties of the contaminants the reaction conditions and the type of reductant many different organic contaminants can be discharged into natural and engineered water environments for example groundwater can be polluted by explosives at military bases kim and strathmann 2007 or insecticide and pesticide residues from agricultural activities naka et al 2006 when these contaminants leach down to subsurface water due to natural rainfall and agricultural irrigation in addition the wide application of chlorinated solvents in home care or as industrial solvents moran et al 2007 and the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water treatment plants chen et al 2018 emphasize the increasing diversity of organic contaminants in anoxic water environments as a result chemical persistence evaluation for water treatment and environmental risk assessment is required to mitigate potential risks to human and natural environments reactivity is one of the most important aspects in water treatment and risk assessment therefore reactivity prediction is necessary to prevent adverse impacts caused by organic pollution so far most kinetic studies on reductive transformation of organic contaminants have focused on three classes of compounds nitro compounds ncs naka et al 2006 nitrogen oxygen containing compounds nocs chen and zhang 2013 and polyhalogenated alkanes phas lyman et al 2000 macalady et al 1986 bussan and strathmann 2007 ncs contain the reducible nitro group s no2 including both substituted nitroaromatics nacs and aliphatic nitro compounds ancs nacs are commonly found among pesticides and munitions naka et al 2006 while ancs include neonicotinoids nitroamines nitrosoamines and most explosives kim and strathmann 2007 nocs contain the nitrogen oxygen single bond n o and can be further divided into aromatic n oxides anos isoxazoles isxs hydroxylamines and oximes chen et al 2016 nocs have been often used as pesticides pharmaceuticals and industrial chemical intermediates and can form as transformation intermediates during wastewater treatment chen et al 2018 polyhalogenated organics with reducible halogen atoms x f cl br are the largest class of organic compounds that can be reduced biotically with some of the phas being highly toxic subsurface contaminants torralba sanchez et al 2020 given the enormous diversity of organic contaminants and that most of the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar studies concentrate on the oxidation of environmental contaminants in natural and engineered systems lee and von gunten 2012 there is interest in development of comprehensive predictive models for the reductive reactivity of all potentially reducible compounds a major aspect of most research on reductive transformation of contaminants is the measurement of reaction rates once reaction rate data are available for multiple contaminants they can be subjected to correlation analysis which serves multiple purposes tratnyek et al 2017 tratnyek and macalady 1998 at a minimum correlation analysis can serve to verify the consistency and accuracy of the data ultimately correlation analysis can be a powerful diagnostic tool for evaluating mechanisms by which molecular structures influence reactivity however the main goal of correlation analysis usually is the development of qsars that can be used to predict reaction rate constants where reliable data are not available for this purpose the value of qsars increases with the breadth of their applicability this is however contrary to many qsar studies which tend to prioritize model accuracy over breadth and achieve this by narrowing the scope to reactants that are structurally similar and descriptors that are closely related to the expected reaction mechanism tratnyek et al 2017 examples of highly accurate qsars for narrow sets of reactants and mechanistically exact descriptors are common for reduction rates of several classes of organic compounds the nacs system i e substituted nitrobenzenes is prototypical with numerous studies demonstrating good correlations between reduction rate constants and one electron reduction potentials e 1 gorski et al 2010 klausen et al 1995 salter blanc et al 2015 stewart et al 2018 recently the nacs were used to demonstrate the utility of a related descriptor gibbs free energy of hydrogen atom attachment di toro et al 2019 murillo gelvez et al 2019 for phas the most comprehensive qsar is the one developed for the reduction rates of c1 and c2 phas with electron transfer mediators such as iron porphyrin and mercaptojuglone and chemical descriptors including the bond dissociation energy standard free energy of one electron reduction g and e lumo perlinger et al 2000 for the complexation facilitated reduction of anos by fe ii tiron complex the electron affinity no bond length and atomic spin density were tested as descriptors for qsar analysis but no relationships between the descriptor variables and kinetics data were found chen et al 2016 chen and zhang 2013 despite the success of prior work at developing qsars for reduction kinetics of narrowly defined sets of contaminants and reaction conditions few studies have tried to expand the scope of qsar applicability to more diverse types of molecular structures or reaction conditions tratnyek et al 2017 the several exceptions to this illustrate the many challenges li et al 2019 miehr et al 2004 in order to develop qsars that can be applied to diverse reactants and reaction conditions more advanced models appear to be necessary these could involve multivariate linear models such as the response surface conceptual model proposed in tratnyek et al 2017 classical dimensionality reduction methods such as the principle component analysis used by katseanes et al 2017 or the machine learning ml method among them ml has been a dominant approach in predictive modeling in many fields in recent years due to the preponderance of big data alpaydin 2020 smola and vishwanathan 2008 prediction driven ml is advantageous in developing predictive models because ml algorithms aim to automatically learn patterns from a large amount of data and make accurate prediction with a rich set of input features hutter et al 2019 parish and duraisamy 2016 another advantage of ml is that it requires minimal assumptions about the relationship between the predictors and response variables alpaydin 2020 the latter would work particularly well when an increasing number of diverse organic contaminants are involved in qsar development because there are likely unknown non linear relationships between the complex contaminant structures and reactivity for example borhani et al 2016 used multiple linear regression and a neural network to develop qsars for 457 contaminants toward the oh radical and found that the model developed by the neural network had higher predictive performance we recently successfully used three ml algorithms to develop accurate qsars for 1000 organic contaminants toward oh zhong et al 2021 zhong et al 2020 2021 however no studies have employed ml to develop predictive models for contaminant reduction the overall goal of this research was to develop a flexible all inclusive predictive model that can describe rates of abiotic reduction of as wide a range of aqueous organic compounds as possible in pursuit of this goal this research aimed to i build a uniquely comprehensive dataset for the reduction kinetics of potentially reducible organic compounds in the same reduction system ii obtain an inclusive model that incorporates all of the investigated chemical classes under various conditions within the same reduction system iii investigate possible factors influencing the model performance and iv compare the conventional uni or multi variate qsars with those obtained by the ml approach to accomplish the first two objectives we chose fe ii tiron complexes as our model system because this reductant the soluble 1 2 fe ii tiron complex fel2 6 in particular has several advantages over other reductants e g hydroquinones it behaves analogously to mineral surface associated fe ii while being more reactive and easier to work with li et al 2019 in addition the effect of the major reductant fel2 6 on reduction rates is well understood and a quantitative method for normalizing first order rate constants is well calibrated bussan and strathmann 2007 naka et al 2006 with the selected model reductant we examined the reduction rates of 60 compounds including 12 nacs 8 ancs 12 anos 7 isxs 14 phas 3 sos 2 nitroso compounds n hydroxylamine pnhoh and pentachlorophenol pcp we then applied different training dataset to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the conventional molecular descriptor based qsar and ml approach multiple influencing factors on the model development were investigated such as the effects of chemical grouping chemical diversity chemical descriptor type of rate constant and size of the kinetics database through the development of predictive tools for abiotic reactivity this work attempts to provide the much needed prediction of the reductive reactivity of all potentially reducible contaminants and investigates the applicability and predictive performance of multiple methods such tools are critical for supporting the environmental protection agency s chemical transformation simulator cts which is a web based tool available to the public at https qed epacdx net cts for predicting environmental and biological transformation pathways and physicochemical properties of organic chemicals the results of this research will directly support the development of a cts module consisting of qsars for the calculation of rate constants for abiotic reduction for a diverse set of chemicals under a variety of reducing conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials a full

designed to the full range of environmentally relevant classes of compounds with reducible functional groups to classify these compounds we tested two grouping methods table 1 the first method g1 4 has four chemical classes ncs nocs phas and other reducible compounds orcs described below in the second grouping approach g2 6 we refined ncs to include nacs and ancs and nocs to anos and isxs phas remains unchanged but can be divided into c1 and c2 compounds the project scope also includes at least one representative compound for other major chemical classes for example pnhoh and pcp to represent hydroxylamines and polyhalogenated aromatics respectively the latter compounds are labelled as orcs and include sulfoxides and sulfones sos nitroso compounds i e ndma and tnx hydroxylamines and halogenated aromatics the detailed assignment of compounds to groups is given in table a 1 grouping also was a necessary data preprocessing step for development of ml based qsars for this we applied the same grouping strategies but added 2 new groups by excluding orcs from g1 4 and g2 6 namely g1 3 and g2 5 table 1 since the mixed and uncharacterized chemical diversity in orcs would introduce more uncertainty and diversity our recent study showed that grouped chemicals based on their structures can achieve better predictive performance and unbiased evaluation on the model performance 2 3 reduction experiments for organic compounds reduction experiments were conducted in batch reactors with constant stirring inside an oxygen free glovebox fe ii free controls were examined simultaneously to account for non reduction processes typical reaction conditions were ph 5 1 8 0 10 50 μm organic compound 0 5 2 or 10 mm fe ii 5 10 or 50 mm tiron 0 2 m nacl and 50 mm buffer mops buffer for ph 6 5 8 0 and acetate buffer for ph 5 1 6 0 the concentration of fel2 6 fel2 6 was manipulated by varying the concentrations of fe2 tiron nacl or the solution ph to obtain pseudo first order kinetics for compound reduction a stable concentration of fel2 6 was achieved by addition of excess fe ii and tiron at a fixed ph kinetics measurement was not affected by the organic buffers reacting with the reducing agent because no reaction was observed in control reactors data not shown additional experimental details can be found in text a 2 2 4 kinetic analysis and data sets the observed pseudo first order rate constants k obs were obtained by linear regression of ln c vs time as illustrated in fig a 1 left column the fits generally were very good r2 0 98 next k obs was normalized to a fixed reductant concentration details in text a 3 so that we can directly compare the reactivity of different compounds the normalized k obs is referred to as k 1 norm hereafter both k obs and k 1 norm are first order rate constants and are denoted as k 1 to obtain an accurate measure of the reactivity the speciation of fe ii tiron must be considered the general relationship between k obs and different fe ii tiron species is described by the classical kinetic model in eq 1 naka et al 2006 1 k o b s k i f e l i n i where k i denotes the bimolecular rate constant for individual feli species feli m 1 s 1 is the molar concentration of the corresponding species and n i denotes the reaction order of species feli n i has almost always been assumed to be 1 in the relevant literature curtis and reinhard 1994 murillo gelvez et al 2019 schwarzenbach et al 1990 tratnyek and macalady 1989 but this is not necessarily correct in all cases previous work bussan and strathmann 2007 kim and strathmann 2007 naka et al 2006 has shown that fel2 6 is the predominant reactive iron species in the reduction of nacs nitramines and nitroso compounds and phas by fe ii tiron which yields the simplified kinetic model eq 2 2 k o b s k 2 f e l 2 6 where k 2 is the second order rate constant however other research chen et al 2018 2016 chen and zhang 2013 li et al 2019 suggested there may be complexation facilitated reduction which could cause the apparent reaction order of fel2 6 n to differ from 1 for some compounds or other fe ii ligand complexes kim et al 2009 to accommodate this possibility we considered a more general bimolecular kinetic model 3 k o b s k 2 f e l 2 6 n which also recognizes fel2 6 as the predominant reactive species but allows varying reaction orders of fel2 6 when reacting with different compounds because n values differ for different compounds we cannot use k 2 values to directly compare compound reactivity at least two values of k obs were experimentally measured for most compounds so the method for obtaining k 2 and n was by logarithmically fitting the data to eq 4 where the slope is the apparent reaction order n with respect to fel2 6 and the intercept gives k 2 4 log k o b s n log f e l 2 6 log k 2 based on this modified kinetic model eq 3 we verified fel2 6 being the predominant species for all the compounds investigated in this study by observing strong correlations between log k obs and log fel2 6 as shown in fig a 1 right column moreover data points of experiments table a 2 where fe ii concentration tiron concentration ph or ionic strength is varied all fall on the same line indicating that the redox reactivity of fe ii is indeed dominated by fel2 6 all of these k results k obs k 1 norm k 2 and fitted values of reaction order n are summarized in tables a 2 3 2 5 conventional qsars the full rationale for selection of descriptors and details on how each descriptor was obtained are provided in text a 4 all of the obtained descriptor data are summarized in table a 4 correlations between the rate constants and individual descriptors were evaluated by visual inspection those with promise were fit by linear regression and the results were evaluated with the usual qualitative and statistical criteria for evaluating qsars tratnyek and macalady 1998 conventional qsars were developed with 3 kinetics datasets k obs k 1 norm and k 2 and 2 grouping methods g1 4 and g2 6 a univariate qsar covering all the chemical classes with e lumo was considered but there was no correlation across such a diverse range of functional groups r2 value of 0 29 with all the data points so this result is not shown however dividing the data into chemical classes gave acceptable univariate qsars with some of the molecular descriptors especially e lumo table a 5 all the successful qsars were then applied to predict reduction rates of various organic compounds and these are used to compare the accuracy among different models in the discussion section given the diversity of compounds in the training set for this study it seemed appropriate to try combining the conventional approach of univariate qsars for reactivity described above with the poly parameter linear free energy relationship pp lfer approach that often is used to model physicochemical properties pan and zhang 2014 we did this by combining the molecular reactivity descriptor e lumo table a 4 with abraham descriptors for physicochemical properties from the ufz database tables a 6 and performing step wise multiple regression on all of these data the results of multivariate qsars are summarized in table a 7 9 2 6 ml qsars we first obtained the smiles of all the organic contaminants by the chemdraw program and then obtained their molecular fingerprints mf by the rdkit package in python mf are compound representations that encode the types of atoms and how they are connected in each compound they were created using the same method as described in our recent article zhong et al 2020 we also illustrated mf by an example in that study for predicting k 1 norm and k 2 only mf were used as the input into ml while for predicting k obs the reaction conditions including the concentrations of compound fe ii and tiron ionic strength and ph were combined with their mf as the inputs into ml in order to determine an appropriate ml algorithm for model development 11 different ml algorithms from the sklearn package were first prescreened using their default hyperparameters these values can be found in https scikit learn org stable modules classes html for the dataset of g2 6 because g2 6 has the finest groups for each kinetic parameter i e k obs k 1 norm and k 2 the dataset of g2 6 was split into the training and test datasets with a ratio of 0 9 and 0 1 based on stratified sampling that is randomly choosing 90 and 10 of the compounds from each chemical class then the 11 different ml algorithms were trained on the training dataset and their predictive performance was tested on the test dataset to optimize the hyperparameters for the selected algorithm more details of the hyperparameters in table a 10 the training dataset was further split 5 times with the same ratio 0 9 0 1 from each chemical class to form 5 groups i e 5 cross validation in which each group contained one training and one validation dataset the hyperparameters were optimized on these 5 groups and the corresponding validation dataset was used to control overfitting to further control overfitting we applied early stopping during the training process in which the training process will be stopped once the predictive performance on the test dataset is not improved within 100 epoches the optimum hyperparameters were obtained by minimizing the average root mean square error rmse of all the 5 validation datasets using the bayesian optimization algorithm with the optimized hyperparameters the selected algorithm was retrained on the original training dataset to obtain the final model the overall performance of the final model was then evaluated by applying it to the test dataset the optimal parameters of the mf were also obtained by the bayesian optimization algorithm the same modeling process was repeated to obtain 4 separate models for log k obs with the 4 grouping methods mentioned above all the optimum hyperparameter values for these 4 grouping methods are listed in table a11 after the best grouping method and algorithm were determined we also replaced mf with e lumo calculated in this study to test the influence of different chemical representations on the obtained model the above code will be uploaded to github http github com a widely used web based service for code sharing review and management of open source projects using the best ml model we conducted applicability domain analysis to evaluate if reliable predictions can be made for compounds and conditions this was achieved by comparing the similarity between the feature matrix in the training data set and that of a new compound in the test dataset if a compound in the test dataset was over a pre set similarity threshold this compound was defined as outside the applicability domain and removed from the test dataset the rmse and r2 values for the test dataset were then recalculated generally the optimum similarity threshold is the one that achieves the minimum rmsetest here we used the cosine similarity that calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors details of this approach in our recent work zhang et al 2020 the higher the similarity threshold the narrower the applicability of the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 general reactivity analysis a summary of the normalized rate constants log k 1 norm for all classes of compounds studied is shown in fig 1 a among the different chemical classes i the reactivity of the compounds ranges more than 11 5 orders of difference from the lowest ndma 8 05 to the highest tnt 3 46 where the largest variation appears in anos of 7 6 orders and the smallest occurs in isxs of around 3 0 orders ii the reactivity of nacs 1 94 to 3 46 is much higher than that of ancs 6 63 to 1 11 iii although both anos and isxs contain the nitrogen oxygen single bond and have similar mean reactivity the reactivity of anos tends to vary over a much wider range iv phas present a similar range of reactivity and mean value as isxs and v the average reactivity of the examined chemical classes follows the order of nacs anos isxs phas ancs after combining nacs and ancs into ncs and anos and isxs into nocs the average reactivity of the combined group decreases to 1 47 2 70 and 3 10 for ncs nocs and phas respectively fig a 2 a comparison using log k 2 displays a reactivity pattern similar to log k 1 norm fig a 3 comparing the log k 1 norm values of nacs and ancs both of which contain nitro group s we observed aromatic nacs are more reactive than aliphatic ancs presumably because the aromatic ring tends to stabilize the accepted electrons through resonance effects in general electron withdrawing groups increased the nacs activity the more electron withdrawing groups attached to the aromatic ring the more reactive the nitro group is e g 2 4 dnt and tnt for the nocs both anos and isxs have moderate degradation rates the anos can be divided into three subclasses based on their structural features and the reactivity drops in the order of n oxides with 2 no bonds cdx tdqe mqxdo odx qxcx pyrazine n oxides mqxo and pyz pyridine n oxides pi qu and pyd over the full range of compounds studied the reaction order with respect to fel2 6 varied from 0 23 to 1 427 fig 1 b and table a 3 in most cases interestingly the more reactive compounds had larger n fig a 4 this might arise from faster formation of the initial reduction product s that might also react with fel2 6 leading to a larger observed reaction order of fel2 6 moreover it has been shown that some isxs can complex with fe ii tiron which might increase its apparent reduction rate e g amx chen et al 2018 as most of the rate constants of phas are reported at a nearly identical condition bussan and strathmann 2007 we did not conduct additional kinetic experiments for these compounds so measured values of n are not available in general it is evident that c1 phas are relatively more reactive than c2 alkanes and greater halogenation results in higher reactivity the low degradation rates for so reduction indicates that this class will be the most resistant to reduction in anoxic environments 3 2 correlation analysis with k 2 the usual approach to correlation analysis of chemical reactivity data is to prefer k 2 over k 1 because operational factors should be factored out of k 2 so that the correlations are tighter and the resulting qsars have greater generality tratnyek et al 2017 tratnyek and macalady 1998 however there are scenarios where more aggregate measures of reactivity are appropriate and may even yield more useful qsars a typical example of this is when the reactant is a complex environmental material such as anaerobic sediments zhang and weber 2013 the fe ii tiron model system used in this study is suitable for extraction of rigorously defined values of k 2 using the same type of analysis that has been done in some studies of contaminant reduction by hydroquinones murillo gelvez et al 2019 in this case that analysis would require fitting eq 1 to data for k obs measured at enough conditions to resolve the contribution of all fe ii tiron species with significant reactivity and determine their order of reaction with the parent compound unfortunately this was impractical because of the very large number of parent compounds 60 included in the scope of this study therefore we applied the modified kinetic model eq 3 to calculate k 2 with the proved assumption that the reactivity of fel2 6 accounts for majority of the overall reactivity and its order of reaction n varies with compounds the resulting estimates of k 2 were used in correlation analysis with different chemical descriptors while some weak correlations were obtained table a 5 they were much less satisfactory than those obtained with k 1 based qsars which are discussed below this result can be interpreted as evidence that the substantial variability in n for fel2 6 fig 1 b caused significant inaccuracies in the dataset 3 3 correlation analysis and conventional qsars with k 1 norm exploratory correlation analysis was performed between log k 1 norm and all descriptor variables correlations not shown but detailed descriptors in text a 4 and the most promising results were obtained between log k 1 norm and e lumo fig 2 there was little difference between correlations obtained with e lumo from the four levels of theory calculated table a 4 so only the results for the most commonly used theory b3lyp are shown qualitatively fig 2 shows little indication of correlation across the whole dataset but fairly strong linear relationships are evident within most groups of compounds nacs ancs anos and phas it has been suggested that e gap the difference between e lumo and e homo the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital might be a molecular descriptor of even greater generality than e lumo because it represents overall susceptibility to changes in electron density i e molecular hardness miehr et al 2004 however e gap only gave a good correlation with k 1 norm for anos table a 5 so was not pursued further the other descriptor of electronic properties that we were able to compute for almost all compound was e sparc termed e half in the current version of sparc but this gave inferior correlations for most chemical classes except for isxs and so is not shown for the groups of compounds that gave good correlations to e lumo linear regression was performed to obtain conventional univariate qsars the fits and fitted slopes are shown in fig 2 and detailed fitting statistics are given in table a 5 although fitting both families containing nitro groups ncs nacs and ancs together gave a good linear fit r2 0 92 this fit is not shown because fig 2 clearly suggests the two families form distinct correlations fitting nacs and ancs separately provided similarly good correlations r2 0 81 and 0 98 respectively with significantly different slopes 7 67 1 11 for nacs vs 11 99 0 88 for ancs this difference in slope suggests that k 1 norm for ancs is more sensitive to substituent effects than nacs presumably due to delocalization of electron density into the aromatic ring of the latter group as with the ncs the overall class of halogenated compounds phas did not give a meaningful correlation but dividing the data into more homogenous subgroups did the subgroups of c1 and c2 compounds gave reasonable linear fits r2 0 41 and 0 93 respectively with very different slopes 0 82 0 47 for c1 vs 12 46 1 48 for c2 note that the relatively low r2 for c1 phas is mainly due to lower number of data points and that r2 can be increased to 0 75 by replacing e lumo b3lyp with e lumo pbe the implication that dechlorination rates of c2 phas are more sensitive to structural difference than c1 phas is consistent with previous work using iron porphyrin as the reductant perlinger et al 2000 1998 the correlation for anos was statistically satisfactory mainly because it spanned the widest range of k 1 norm and e lumo a few compounds deviated significantly but were not treated as outliers although isxs also contain the n o moiety just like anos a poor correlation was observed between the reactivity and molecular descriptors this is because e lumo is more strongly associated with electron transfer and less strongly associated with electron donor acceptor interactions like complexation including other descriptors that can capture the extent of chemical complexation would provide better qsars the only univariate correlation with e sparc was obtained for isxs r2 0 63 for k 1 norm 0 35 for k 2 no qsars were obtained for the three sulfur containing compounds in orcs as they are too resistant to reduction based on the r2 for the univariate qsars obtained for ncs anos isxs and phas the capability of e lumo to explain the reductive reactivity of the organic compounds follows the order of ncs anos phas isxs this trend is consistent with the diversity in reaction mechanisms that are expected for each class chemical reduction of all nitro aromatics undergoes a similar pathway through nitrosobenzenes n hydroxylamino intermediates to anilines as for nocs a possible reason for the smaller r2 is the unignorable impact of complexation on the chemical reactivity as the different types of complexation formed before during electron transfer can alter the reaction pathways chen et al 2018 2016 chen and zhang 2013 apparently the effect of complexation on reactivity is more influential for isxs than for anos thus isxs display a smaller r2 than anos furthermore multiple degradation pathways also exist for phas such as nucleophilic substitution x philic reaction direct r x bond cleavage and bimolecular elimination perlinger et al 2000 and it has been shown that resolving these can lead to better qsars arnold and roberts 2000 cwiertny et al 2010 in an effort to coalesce the group specific correlations shown in fig 2 into one more globally applicable qsar we investigated combining one of the descriptors of electronic properties e lumo b3lyp with the abraham descriptors that are widely used in pp lfers for physico chemical properties e g partition coefficients of organic compounds using only abraham descriptors obtained from the ufz lser database table a 6 and step wise multivariate regression on log k 1 norm we obtained no statistically significant pp lfers table a 7 as expected combining e lumo with abraham descriptors in multivariate regression on k 1 norm for each class of compounds that gave good correlations to e lumo alone resulted in marginally improved fitting statistics r2 from 0 92 to 0 94 for ncs and from 0 81 to 0 86 for nacs in table a 8 more importantly this hybrid approach to correlation analysis did not help to produce a qsar that applies across the families of compounds studied these results confirm that the types of solute solvent interactions represented by abraham parameters have little or no role in determining the reactivity of compounds in the system used in this study one other approach to correlation analysis using multivariate linear regression would be to include operational variable such as ph or reactant concentration as descriptor variables rather than trying to correct for them in the response variable to illustrate this we used log k obs instead of the log k 1 norm and performed stepwise multivariate regression against one electronic property e lumo and reactant concentrations ionic strength and ph for each class of compounds ph proved to be a statistically significant descriptor however the resulting r2 decreased in most cases although it increased somewhat for nacs and phas after incorporating operational variables table a 9 note that the selection of the response variable k obs vs k 1 norm depends on the type of model to be developed and the amount of data points available for the model development 3 4 ml models the ml models fig 3 a obtained with the same response variable data sets used above k 1 norm and k 2 gave relatively poor results lowest rmse 1 19 random forest table a 12 because there were too few data k 1 norm and k 2 46 and 52 to be sufficiently representative however using log k obs 278 data points gave much better fits lowest rmse 0 43 random forest thus the results demonstrated that 1 random forest was the optimal algorithms for predicting k obs and 2 predicting k 1 norm and k 2 was much worse than k obs hence the following work focused on using random forest to predict k obs once the best performing algorithm random forest and k value log k obs were determined the impact of grouping method and chemical diversity on prediction was examined fig 3 b the more refined grouping g2 6 vs g1 4 yielded lower rmse indicating that well defined chemical classes can improve ml model performance especially when there is a relatively small data size in addition orcs is a group of compounds containing various functional groups the ml models obtained with or without orcs g2 6 and g1 4 vs g2 5 and g1 3 gave mixed results because of two conflicting effects more diversity in the training set should help improve the ml model fitting but the large unclassified chemical diversity in orcs adds to the uncertainty the model must accommodate overall the ml modeling results illustrate that expanding the size of the input database refined grouping based on chemical structural features and characterizing categorizing the diversity of reducible functional groups covered in the training data set are required to obtain reliable ml based models when replacing mf with e lumo as the chemical representation rmse of the obtained ml models are significantly greater 0 42 vs 0 69 0 80 table a 13 because this single molecular descriptor cannot capture all the involved chemical diversity then we combined e lumo with mf as the inputs to investigate if including e lumo could improve the predictive performance the mf e lumo based model showed a slightly better predictive performance with rmse 0 41 this result indicated that including different chemical representations indeed capture more features which impacts the model performance moreover based on the applicability domain analysis table a 14 the best performing model based on mf and the log k obs dataset with g2 6 as the grouping method yields the lowest threshold of 0 50 above which a reasonable predictive accuracy is expected and is hence the most widely applicable because the size of the dataset is still relatively small for ml modeling future work is needed to examine additional compounds so a more robust model can be built 3 5 comparison between conventional qsars and ml models fig 3 c compares the best conventional qsars and ml model both the univariate and multivariate qsars demonstrate similar reasonable predictions to those of the ml model except that the prediction for ano from the univariate qsar shows more deviation from the 1 1 line because of a lower r2 0 64 of the obtained correlation the univariate qsars give r2 ranging from 0 41 to 0 98 while multivariate qsars have better model performance with r2 between 0 71 and 0 94 compared to the conventional approach the ml model presents reasonable prediction with r2 of 0 83 we also calculated the ratio of predicted over experimental log k values to obtain a better understanding of the model performance as shown in table a 15 nearly all predictions by the developed models are within a factor of 1 2 2 compared to the experimental values except for nacs and anos whose predictions are mostly within a factor of 1 3 3 8 out of 12 for nacs 8 out of 10 for anos the two approaches in this work for qsar development have distinct advantages and disadvantages both approaches have the same pre requisite for chemical classification where users need to categorize organic compounds but separate qsars are needed for different chemical classes whereas only one unified ml model is enough a defining characteristic of the conventional qsar approach is that correlations are obtained using chemical descriptor data as the independent variable s and only compounds for which the descriptor data are available can be used in the model chemical descriptor data can be obtained by direct measurements e g half wave potential empirical values e g hammett constants and or in silico calculations e g e lumo while these descriptor data contribute chemical information obtaining complete and reliable sets of descriptor data for qsar development can require considerable effort and expertise when applying the obtained qsars for prediction purposes the reliance on chemical descriptor data can become an obstacle in contrast ml models can be developed based on versatile chemical representations beyond molecular descriptors such as mf used in this study which are of particular interest because only basic chemical structure information is required the two types of models also differ in how environmental conditions are considered in the model conventional qsars factor reaction conditions out of the response variable before correlation analysis i e use k 2 rather than k obs this is effective for well structured datasets but is impractical for much of the data from complex environmental systems in contrast our approach to incorporating environmental conditions in the ml model can directly use raw reactivity data i e k obs and include reaction conditions as predictor variables which does not involve a priori assumptions about the kinetic model and therefore allows more accurate prediction this also makes it more practical to apply ml over a wide range of compounds reactions and conditions also the predictive power of the resulting ml model will be robust if the training dataset is large and diverse enough in addition to the characteristics of qsar and ml models described above there is an overarching issue that concerns the transparency of the models qsars are transparent in that they are relatively easy to document visualize and interpret in terms of how different physicochemical and structural properties affect the reactivity in contrast ml models are comparatively opaque or black box in that the relationship between model output and chemical processes usually is left undefined recently however we have verified that ml models can be physically meaningful zhong et al 2021 but mechanistic interpretation and validation of ml models is not yet a common practice overall both the conventional chemical descriptor based qsars and ml based models are valuable tools in reactivity prediction because of a growing number of organic contaminants discharged into natural and engineered water environments there is an increasing demand for chemical persistence evaluation for potential water treatment consideration however conducting kinetics studies for every organic contaminant in different water environments is time consuming and labor intensive this research provides two much needed models for the prediction of abiotic reduction by a soluble fe ii reductant in this context our ongoing research focuses on developing more comprehensive predictive models covering different fe ii reductants for anoxic water treatment and persistence evaluation 4 conclusions this work develops the most comprehensive models for the prediction of reductive reactivity with the largest number of organic compounds covering the most diverse range of reducible functional groups it ranks the reactivity of 60 organic contaminants toward reduction by fe ii tiron complex which can be used to evaluate the environmental persistence of different chemical classes in anoxic water environments the developed predictive models are established using two approaches namely the conventional chemical descriptor based qsar and ml based on the obtained models we compared the two modeling approaches for environmental applications in short both approaches need pre classification of chemicals prior to model development and both approaches are capable of providing reasonable predictions but with different advantages and disadvantages overall this study offers two types of versatile modeling approaches for comprehensive reactivity prediction of

17194,water clarity expressed as secchi disk depth sdd reflects light transmission capacity of a water body and influences growth of aquatic plants aquatic organisms and primary productivity here we calibrated and validated a general model based on landsat series data for deriving sdd of various inland waters across china the quality of remotely sensed reflectance products from different landsat series images was assessed using in situ reflectance measurements the results indicated that the products in the visible bands are the most robust and stable to estimate sdd for inland waters subsequently a simple power function model based on red band was built using 887 pairs of in situ sdd measurements and concurrent landsat images the model was validated with an independent dataset of 246 sdd measurements and the results showed that the mean relative error and normalized root mean square error were 34 2 and 55 4 respectively finally the model was applied to landsat images acquired between 2016 and 2018 to investigate the sdd spatial distribution of all lakes with water area 10 km2 total 641 lakes in china the estimation results demonstrated that the eastern plain lake zone and northeast plain lake zone have relatively low sdd with multiyear average sdd of 0 56 0 17 m and 0 47 0 29 m respectively the yunnan guizhou plateau lake zone and tibetan plateau lake zone have relatively high sdd with multiyear average sdd of 1 48 0 86 m and 1 30 0 83 m respectively the results indicated that the proposed model exhibits strong ability to accurately construct sdd coverage for various lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water transparency estimation landsat empirical model lakes in china 1 introduction water clarity is characterized for the depth at which a standard white and black secchi disk disappears from view when lowered into the water and thus commonly expressed as secchi disk depth sdd fee et al 1996 sdd is a comprehensive proxy for trophic state of aquatic ecosystems and provides a practical measure of water quality because it is controlled by suspended matter algae and dissolved organic matter in the water column lisi and hein 2019 sdd governs underwater light field and thereby influences growth of aquatic plants aquatic organisms and primary productivity zhang et al 2015 the most accurate and commonly used manner of documenting sdd is ship based sampling however the traditional ship based observation method is insufficient at certain temporal and spatial scales for trend analysis especially for inland waters located in remote areas collection of sdd would still be nearly impossible without aquatic vehicles the tight relationships between optically active constituents and sdd provide possibility to capture sdd information through remote sensing approach lee et al 2015 remote sensing has been widely used to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of sdd at regional scale with different approaches and various satellite data preisendorfer 1986 olmanson et al 2008 doron et al 2011 lee et al 2015 there are three approaches for remote sensing of sdd including analytical tyler 1968 preisendorfer 1986

diffuse attenuation k d m 1 and beam attenuation c m 1 in the water gallegos et al 2011 lee et al 2015 lee et al 2016 in analytical methods satellite images are preprocessed to achieve accurate atmospheric correction using the corresponding radiative transfer models before mapping sdd the analytical methods require strict theoretical derivation and are challenging because instantaneous atmospheric conditions and initial parameter values are difficult to acquire giardino et al 2007 in semi analytical methods hyperspectral scanner data from in situ measurements airborne images and satellite hyperspectral images are usually applied to establish the reflectance curve of the studied water body the spectral bands corresponding to sdd value are then determined according to the characteristics of the reflectance curve abd elrahman et al 2011 the most commonly used semi analytical methods involve deriving the absorption and backscattering coefficients of water substances such as suspended matter algae and dissolved organic matter from the water surface reflectance gordon et al 1988 lee et al 2016 these derived parameters are then used to calculate k d or other related parameters such as turbidity and total suspended matter concentration tsm the semi analytical methods have complex parameterization processes and high spectral resolution requirements for satellite data which severely limited their application for deriving water clarity cao et al 2017 the empirical relationships between k d c sdd and reflectance in visible or near infrared nir wavelengths of a single band band ratios or multiple bands can simplify the calculation of the sdd from remote sensing signals kratzer et al 2008 however the band selection usually varied with the optical properties of water environment and it is challenge to generate a uniform estimation model for various types of water based on limited datasets for example alikas and kratzer 2017 suggested that the less absorbing portions in short visible wavelengths are more suitable for clear ocean water however wang et al 2009 and shi et al 2015 showed that for optically complex waters the reference band should be in the red part of the spectrum rather than in the green which is only appropriate for case 1 waters kabiri and moradi 2016 noted that the combination of linear terms of several single bands and band ratios could increase the precision of the model in coastal water mainstream ocean color satellites such as the coastal zone color scanner czcs sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris and geostationary ocean color imager goci have been widely used to monitor quality of inland waters doron et al 2011 binding et al 2015 feng et al 2019 xu et al 2019 ocean color satellites can provide high temporal resolution and multichannel remotely sensed data however the spatial resolution of ocean color satellite sensors is coarse and most inland water are too small to be mapped the sentinel satellite data were characterized with high temporal 1 4 day and spatial resolution 10 m while it only operates 6 years in contrast the unique 30 m spatial resolution and long term records of landsat data enable the high spatial resolution and long term mapping of lake sdd previous studies have empirically developed several models based on landsat series data to map sdd for inland and coastal waters olmanson et al 2008 dona et al 2014 page et al 2019 however the calibration and validation datasets used in these studies are collected from one two or a few lakes within a small geographical region failing to generate a uniform model for the systematic assessment of sdd at continental global scale therefore we attempt to assess the quality of remotely sensed reflectance products from different landsat series images construct a general sdd model at the continental scale 105 106 km2 based on extensive in situ sdd and landsat remote sensing reflectance from 225 china lakes and explore the spatial variation of lake sdd in china from 1986 to 2018 the sdd variation of lakes are often early warning indicators of significant local regional or global changes understanding sdd patterns is necessary for designing effective management and remediation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area according to the lake origin topography geomorphology and climatic characteristics the lakes in china have been divided into five lake zones 1 the tibetan plateau lake zone tpl 2 the inner mongolia xinjiang lake zone imxl 3 the eastern plain lake zone epl 4 the northeast plain lake zone npl and 5 the yunnan guizhou plateau lake zone ygpl wang and dou 1998 the tpl and imxl are located in internal drainage systems in arid or semiarid climate regions the other three zones npl ygpl and epl are external drainage systems in the asian monsoon climate region ma et al 2010 the tpl has the largest water surface area 41 832 km2 and number of lakes 1055 based on the most recent national lake investigation from 2005 2006 ma et al 2010 moreover the tpl has the fast growing and newest lakes due to annual snow accumulation and accelerated glacial melting zhang et al 2019 most tpl lakes are oligotrophic with high sdd values liu et al 2017 because of the high elevation 4000 m and sparse population of the tpl region the water environment in this region is almost unaffected by human activities zhang et al 2019 in contrast the epl and imxl have a moderate water surface area 21 053 km2 12 590 km2 and a moderate number of lakes 634 514 based on the most recent national lake investigation from 2005 2006 ma et al 2010 moreover many lakes have shrunk or vanished due to agricultural activities lake reclamation the expansion of lake side development and enclosures in the epl and imxl ma et al 2010 additionally the water quality of many epl lakes has deteriorated due to intensive anthropogenic activities in the past decades for example long term satellite investigations indicated that the sdd of lakes taihu hongzehu and liangzihu decreased at rates of 0 5 cm yr 0 9 cm yr and 5 0 cm yr shi et al 2018 xu et al 2018 li et al 2019 in response to chemical fertilizer use wastewater discharge and sand dredging activities respectively the current decrease in aquatic vegetation caused by urbanization and tourism development may accelerate the deterioration of water quality and shift from the macrophyte dominated ecosystem to phytoplankton dominated ecosystem zhang et al 2017 the npl and ygpl have a relatively small water surface area 4700 km2 1240 km2 and a small number of lakes 425 65 compared with the other regions based on the most recent national lake investigation from 2005 2006 ma et al 2010 most npl lakes are characterized by shallow depths and low water clarity duan et al 2009 npl lakes are mainly surrounded by agricultural cropland and forest areas zhang et al 2019 the physicochemical properties of lakes are strongly related to the land cover around lakes zhao et al 2017 ygpl is characterized by a long water exchange cycle and vulnerable ecosystem zhang et al 2019 recently many lakes in ygpl are suffering from accelerating eutrophication zhou et al 2016 the phytoplankton and zoobenthos macroinvertebrate species richness have also significantly decreased zhou et al 2016 increasing human activities such as land reclamation and agricultural practices may aggravate the changes in these lakes zhou et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 2 2 sampling sites and sdd measurements four datasets of the in situ sdd were collected table s1 1 864 pairs of in situ measured sdd and landsat images for 170 lakes from the second nationwide lake investigation from 2005 to 2010 73 pairs in 22 npl lakes 750 pairs in 98 epl lakes 7 pairs in 3 imxl lakes and 34 pairs in 9 ygpl lakes 2 319 pairs of in situ measured sdd and landsat images for 39 epl lakes from traditional sampling performed between 2017 and 2018 3 774 pairs of in situ measured sdd and images collected from routine site specific observations of lake qiandaohu n 255 lake taihu n 431 lake fuxianhu n 52 and lake luguhu n 36 and 4 354 pairs of in situ measured sdd and images collected from the literatures 70 pairs in 7 npl lakes 36 pairs in 29 ygpl lakes 201 pairs in 6 imxl lakes and 47 pairs in 25 tpl lakes a total of 2311 pairs of in situ measured sdd and landsat remote sensing reflectance data from the five geographic lake zones in china were used to calibrate and validate the sdd model fig 1 the time interval between in situ measurements and satellite observations ranged from 0 to 76 days the lake area ranged from 1 km2 to 4000 km2 and the water depth ranged from 1 m to 150 m measurement of sdd at the sampling stations shown in fig 1 was undertaken using a circular white and black disk with 30 cm diameter on the shady side of the boat to avoid direct sunlight reflections from the water surface helcom 2017 at each station the depth at which the secchi disk cannot be observed by the human eye of an observer when deployed in the water is recorded as an sdd value fee et al 1996 the in situ sdd were collected between 9 00 and 16 00 beijing time china to avoid the effect of low sunlight the detailed information of the field data was shown in table s1 2 3 in situ measured remote sensing reflectance the water spectra measurements included 6 field campaigns in lake dongpinghu dianshanhu gaoyouhu longwangshan reservoir taihu and yangchenghu that were synchronized with landsat 7 9 field campaigns in lake dongpinghu dianshanhu gaoyouhu hanzhou bay qiandaohu shijiuhu taipinghu wabanghu and yangchenghu that were synchronized with landsat 8 table s2 fig s1 the measured waters cover a wide range of sdd from clear to turbid and highly turbid water we therefore used the in situ measurements from these waters to evaluate the performance of landsat reflectance products and previously published sdd models the spectra measurements were obtained between 10 00 and 15 00 beijing time china total upwelling and downwelling radiance were collected with an analytical spectral devices spectrometer asd inc boulder co the spectra ranged from 350 nm to 1050 nm at 1 nm intervals the first downwelling radiance measurement from the reference panel l p1 λ 0 was collected prior to hydrologic and atmospheric spectral collection the total radiance above water surface ls w λ 0 were measured at a nadir view angle of 30 45 and an azimuth angle of 90 135 after measuring the water spectra the spectrometer was rotated upwards to 90 120 to measure the downwelling sky radiance l sky λ finally the second downwelling radiance measurement from the reference panel l p2 λ 0 was collected the average of two measurements of downwelling radiance from the reference panel l p λ 0 were used to calibrate the upwelling radiance the remote sensing reflectance above the water surface r rs λ 0 were calculated by the ratio of the upwelling water leaving radiance l w λ 0 to the downwelling irradiance e d λ 0 according to the formulas as 1 r rs λ 0 l w λ 0 e d λ 0 the l w λ 0 was derived according to the formulas as 2 l w λ 0 l sw λ 0 r sky l sky λ where r sky is the reflectance of skylight at the water air interface the r sky was taken as 2 2 for calm weather 2 5 for wind speed of up to 5 m s and 2 6 2 8 for wind speed of about to 10 m s tang et al 2004 the e d λ 0 was related to the averaged radiance of reference panel l p λ 0 according to the following formula 3 e d λ 0 π l p λ 0 ρ ρ λ where the ρ ρ λ is the reflectance of the reference panel 2 4 image acquisition and processing this study used landsat 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli surface reflectance images of the entire country from the google earth engine platform gorelick et al 2017 the surface reflectance images were atmospherically corrected from raw digital values in landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps and landsat surface reflectance code lasrc software schmidt et al 2013 ledaps and lasrc requires a variety of atmospheric inputs such as 6s model outputs the digital elevation the surface pressure total column ozone temperature and water vapor to constrain the atmospheric model kalnay et al 1996 for each image a quality control band was assigned to remove the cloud shadow and snow pixels the solar azimuth and zenith angles of each image were used with the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model dem to simulate and remove terrain shadows in the google earth engine platform farr et al 2007 the remote sensing reflectance r rs was obtained by dividing the surface reflectance by π 3 14 the global water occupancy frequency dataset was used to identify lake surfaces pekel et al 2016 and the dataset was generated using more than 3865 000 scenes from landsat tm etm and oli between 1984 and 2015 the dataset contains 30 m spatial resolutions with information on water occurrence frequency absolute change in occurrence between two specific epochs 1985 1990 2010 2015 and seasonality variation we retained the original frequency values and assumed occurrence frequencies of 75 in identifying permanent water surfaces the occurrence frequencies of 75 have been reported to be appropriate for identifying permanent water surfaces in the united states of america zou et al 2018 water surfaces were then clipped by enlarged lake boundaries of china with a 2 km buffer to separate the permanent lake surfaces from rivers and ponds these cloud free landsat 8 images in the nonfreezing period from june to october between 1986 and 2018 were then clipped by the extracted lake boundaries and mosaiced to obtain a contiguous region of the lakes in china we finally generated an averaged sdd map for 641 lakes in china with water area 10 km2 in recent period of 2016 2018 2 5 model calibration and validation to determine sensitive band for model calibration and validation the matching pairs of in situ and landsat observations were selected following the rules 1 the time interval between in situ and landsat observations was set within 1 day 2 the spatial window was set with 3 3 pixel centered over the in situ site 3 the matching pairs were selected where the euphotic depth is obviously lower than water depth to avoid the reflectance contribution from lake bottom 4 the matching pairs were selected under stable weather conditions for example the wind speed was low 5 m s and no precipitation occurred in a few days before the transit of the satellite feng et al 2019 olmanson et al 2008 found that the model coefficient did not change significantly when the time gap between the in situ measurement and satellite transit increased within a few days and that a large dataset of ground observations with long time gaps did not reduce the accuracy but offset some of the loss of correlation we also found that more ground observations with longer time gaps improved the calibration of the sdd model when in situ data were insufficient for example for comparisons of models with time gaps of 3 and 7 days the number of ground observations in tpl increased from 10 to 41 but the r 2 value decreased from 0 80 to 0 72 and the normalized root mean square error nrmse decreased from 61 2 to 53 6 this result occurs because the water clarity or sdd does not exhibit large fluctuations under stable hydrometeor conditions within a given time interval especially for tpl lakes which are less affected by human activity when compared with npl and epl lakes stadelmann et al 2001 zhang et al 2019 to clarify the impact of time intervals on the accuracy of sdd estimation in china we evaluated the accuracy of the models at different time intervals and finally selected the single band or band combination with the highest accuracy to construct the remote sensing estimation model for lakes in china 2 6 statistical analyses the mean value calculations linear and nonlinear regressions and t test were performed in matlab r2012a software the t tests with p 0 05 were reported as significant to evaluate the performance of the surface remote sensing reflectance and sdd model we used the determination coefficient r 2 mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and nrmse in this study 4 mre 100 1 n i 1 n x esti i x meas i x esti i 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n x esti i x meas i 2 6 nrmse 100 1 n i 1 n x esti i x meas i 2 1 n i 1 n x meas i where xesti and xmeas are the estimated and measured values respectively and n is the number of values included in the calculation 3 results 3 1 distribution of in situ sdd our sdd dataset was distributed in the five lake zones with the sdd values ranging from 0 04 to 14 m with a median value of 0 54 m and mean sdd value of 1 23 1 96 m the order of mean and median sdd in the five lake zones is as follows tpl mean 4 47 m median 3 20 m imxl 2 73 m 2 01 m ygpl 1 41 m 0 79 m epl 0 67 m 0 48 m npl 0 40 m 0 27 m specially the tpl has generally high sdd with smaller coefficient of variation when compared with other zones table 1 3 2 validation of the landsat reflectance products in this study landsat reflectance products from several lakes in china were assessed by in situ measured remote sensing reflectance the result showed that both types of r rs displayed similar variation trends at the different wavelengths fig 2 the sampling information and accuracy mean relative error mre of r rs at each band were listed in the table s2 the r rs from the landsat 7 and landsat 8 products were consistent to the in situ measured reflectance values and the uncertainty levels in visible bands deep blue 11 17 blue 10 77 green 9 57 and red 8 72 could be acceptable according to previous studies uncertainty 10 30 guanter et al 2010 xu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 thus the products can be used for remote sensing estimations of water quality in inland waters 3 3 model calibration and validation the r 2 between the remote sensing reflectance of six landsat bands and concurrent in situ sdd with an interval of 1 day tends to increase with the wavelength in the visible band and the highest correlation was observed between the sdd and remote sensing reflectance in the red band the r 2 then significantly decreases in the nir and swir bands four different mathematical formulations linear exponential logarithmic and power law formulations were used to model the in situ measured sdd and landsat remote sensing reflectance the results indicated that the power function model exhibited better performance than the other models fig 3 a in addition the estimation accuracy was closely related to the interval between the imaging and sampling time within 12 days interval our dataset results showed the r 2 gradually decreased within the time interval fig 3b when the time interval was more than 12 days the accuracy of the model tended to decrease slightly with increasing time interval but maintain a low accuracy the accuracy of the model was inversely related to the time interval a large time interval yielded high error resulting from the inconsistency between the imaging and sampling times which influenced model calibration however if the time interval is too small only a few samples will be included for model calibration which may reduce the accuracy and stability of the model tables s3 s5 show the r 2 of the models with a single band or band combination within time intervals of 3 7 and 10 days the results indicate that when the time interval is within 7 days the estimation model not only achieves satisfied accuracy but also ensures that sufficient numbers of sample pairs from the five lake zones tpl 41 ygpl 107 imxl 121 epl 776 and npl 88 are included with this interval time 7 days the r 2 values of the power function model based on the red band of landsat reflectance for the five lake zones in eq 7 ranged from 0 68 to 0 83 and r 2 0 70 for the entire dataset fig 4 indicating a consistent and strong relationship between the in situ measured and landsat derived sdd the scatter points were mainly within the 95 predictive interval for each lake zone and combined dataset fig 4 indicating that the in situ measured and landsat derived sdd results are comparable 7 sdd 0 0046 r rs red 1 26 the dataset used for model calibration contains 887 sample pairs and the sdd values ranged from 0 01 to 14 m with a mean value of 1 57 1 95 m fig 5 a the dataset used for model validation included 246 sample pairs and the sdd values ranged from 0 05 to 6 70 m with a mean value of 1 51 1 74 m fig 5b for the validation dataset the regression plots closely match the 1 1 line and all scatter points are within the 95 predictive interval in addition the r 2 mre and nrmse are 0 73 34 2 and 55 4 respectively thus a power function model based on the red band of landsat reflectance provides a reliable estimate of the sdd and the combined database provides a reasonable estimate for each lake zone 3 4 sdd mapping of lakes in china as an example we detected the spatial characteristics of sdd in the nonfreezing period from june to october between 2016 and 2018 using cloud free landsat 8 images and generated an averaged sdd map for lakes in china with water area 10 km2 in this period fig 6 a f the average sdd of the five zones and all lakes in china were summarized graphically in histogram plots fig 6g the epl n 130 and npl n 49 have relatively low sdd with multiyear average sdd of 0 56 0 17 m and 0 47 0 29 m respectively the ygpl n 13 and tpl n 380 have relatively high sdd with multiyear average sdd of 1 48 0 86 m and 1 30 0 83 m respectively the imxl n 69 and all lakes in china n 641 have moderate sdd values with multiyear average sdd of 0 82 0 57 m and 1 03 0 73 m respectively fig 6 the statistics of lakes with water area larger than 10 km2 in four categories of sdd 0 0 5 m 0 5 1 m 1 2 m and 2 9 m fig 6h indicate that most lakes in npl 83 epl 60 and imxl 40 have an average sdd less than 0 5 m while most lake 31 in tpl have an average sdd between 1 and 2 m and more than half of ygml lakes have an average sdd value between 0 5 1 m from the perspective of lakes in china 40 of lakes have an average sdd value less than 0 5 m and the number of lakes shows decreasing trend with the increase of transparency 4 discussion 4 1 model implication and comparison the reflectance in the red region shows satisfactory accuracy in estimating the sdd of lakes in china in this spectral region the total absorption coefficient is almost immune to particle variation and is primarily associated with pure water therefore the r rs variability in this spectral region is dominated by the backscattering coefficient of particles b bp which is directly proportional to the particle concentration or inversely proportional to sdd nechad et al 2010 loisel et al 2014 previous studies have shown that red spectra based models can be used to estimate sdd and the related parameters such as turbidity tsm concentration and diffuse attenuation coefficient with good accuracy in moderately turbid lakes reservoirs and coastal waters kratzer et al 2008 shi et al 2015 hou et al 2017 using the red spectra as a reference band could reduce the rmse and increase the r 2 in deriving sdd and the related parameters nechad et al 2010 alikas and kratzer 2017 martinez et al 2015 indicated that the dispersion of k d λ at 650 nm remained relatively stable across the entire tsm range and a close linear relationship was found between k d 650 and tsm in all of the studied rivers and floodplain lakes of the amazon basin alikas and kratzer 2017 noted that the reflectance in the short visible spectra provides accurate sdd estimations in clear ocean waters and that the small amount of optical substances may result in maximum light penetration in this spectral region however the maximum light penetration shifts towards the red spectra in turbid waters at maximum light penetration the total absorption coefficient is constant and dominated by pure water under this condition the particulate concentration and related parameters can be correctly derived from remote sensing reflectance to understand how the reflectance error will influence the sdd estimation we artificially introduced the error of 5 into r rs red the result in table s6 showed that the mre variation of the sdd estimation in each lake zone and the entire china were no more than 6 when the error was introduced into r rs red indicating that the established model was robust for lakes in china these findings show that the derived sdd based on the red band model is reasonably accurate and can be used to produce other remote sensing products such as the tsm concentration and diffuse attenuation coefficient the sensitivity indices in previous studies were used to construct the relationship between r rs λ and the sdd and the performance of these adjusted models dekker and peters 1993 allee and johnson 1999 harma et al 2001 cózar et al 2005 wu et al 2008 olmanson et al 2008 mancino et al 2009 wu et al 2009 duan et al 2009 allan et al 2011 doron et al 2011 guan et al 2011 mccullough et al 2013 dona et al 2014 olmanson et al 2015 binding et al 2015 was compared table 2 in summary the models based on the green and red bands of landsat reflectance such as the single band models dekker and peters 1993 wu et al 2009 the exponential model dona et al 2014 the band ratio model mancino et al 2009 and the combined model olmanson et al 2008 worked well for lakes in china finally we compared the above models with the model constructed in this paper the results indicate that the model constructed in this paper has obvious advantages in terms of the r 2 and or the rmse the semi analytical method was used to derive the sdd by calculating the absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient of suspended matter a p λ and b bp λ the improved quasi analytical model qaa table s7 was applied to turbid water to derive a p λ and b bp λ by altering the reference wavelength to 710 nm le et al 2009 fig 7 compares the in situ measured sdd and the improved qaa derived a p 490 b bp 490 and 1 a p 490 c b bp 490 values for hangzhou bay fig 7a c lake taihu fig 7d f and lake qiandaohu fig 7g i the c in the combination of 1 a p 490 c b bp 490 is the optimal fitting coefficient which can be obtained by multivariate linear fitting between the in situ sdd and qaa derived a p 490 and b bp 490 values the results indicate that the improved qaa derived a p 490 value is significantly correlated with the in situ measured sdd values in hangzhou bay and lake qiandaohu p 0 001 the mre rmse and nrmse between the a p 490 derived and in situ sdd were 37 0 09 m and 42 for hangzhou bay and 31 1 42 m and 29 for lake qiandaohu respectively however the improved qaa derived a p 490 is not significantly correlated with the in situ sdd in lake taihu p 0 4 the improved qaa derived b bp 490 value is significantly correlated with the in situ measured sdd values in hangzhou bay lake taihu and lake qiandaohu p 0 001 the mre rmse and nrmse between the b bp 490 derived and in situ sdd were 48 0 09 m and 39 for hangzhou bay 22 0 12 m and 23 for lake taihu and 16 1 04 m and 21 for lake qiandaohu respectively the ln 1 sdd is significantly correlated with the 1 a p 490 c b bp 490 values in hangzhou bay mre 19 rmse 0 32 m 1 and nrmse 19 fig 7c lake taihu mre 28 rmse 0 26 m 1 and nrmse 27 fig 7f and lake qiandaohu mre 18 rmse 0 21 m 1 and nrmse 14 fig 7i in summary the improved qaa le et al 2009 can be used to derive b bp 490 in the clear lake qiandaohu turbid lake taihu and highly turbid hangzhou bay the qaa derived a p 490 and b bp 490 values could be combined to estimate the sdd with high accuracy however the improved qaa le et al 2009 requires in situ iops as input which was difficult to obtain for the large numbers of lakes in addition the fitting coefficient of c varies for different lakes therefore it is challenge to apply the improved qaa le et al 2009 at large scale recently lee et al 2016 successfully developed a new semi analytical algorithm for sdd estimation based on landsat 8 data however the new algorithm requires two narrow bands in the blue region as inputs therefore the traditional bands of landsat series data cannot meet the requirements of model construction for some semi analytical methods in contrast the empirical models do not require in situ iops and two narrow bands in the blue region as inputs in addition the empirical models have fewer measurement uncertainties than the semi analytical models that are based on inherent optical parameters our empirical model is developed based on extensive in situ sdd and landsat remote sensing reflectance which has obvious advantages in term of accuracy and applicability when compared with previously published empirical models 4 2 consistency of the landsat estimation results to evaluate the comparability of the landsat series images in assessing sdd variations we examined the estimated sdd of the lake water in the overlapping areas of two adjacent images in tpl the tpl lakes are relatively unaffected by human activity zhang et al 2019 therefore the water clarity does not exhibit large fluctuations under stable hydrometeor conditions within a period of a couple of days the sdd results from the landsat 5 tm images on october 5 2011 and the landsat 8 oli images on october 21 2017 were selected for comparison with the results from the landsat 7 etm images on october 6 2011 and october 22 2017 fig 8 because the compared images were quasi synchronized within one day of each other we deemed that the water sdd conditions remained the same for both images fig 8 shows the overlap area of the images and a scatterplot with a regression of the landsat derived sdd values from the overlapping area the model coefficients were different for the three sensors nonetheless the agreement between the landsat 5 7 and 8 derived sdd values was very strong r 2 0 94 for landsat 5 vs 7 r 2 0 95 for landsat 8 vs 7 fig 8c d indicating that the estimated sdd results from landsat 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli images are highly comparable thus the use of landsat series data with the proposed model can provide accurate long term coverage of sdd in lakes in china 4 3 advantage and limitations of the model our empirical model is developed based on extensive in situ sdd and landsat remote sensing reflectance the calibration and validation datasets in this model are collected from different types of water within a large geographical region indicating that the model could be hopefully used for the systematic assessment of sdd at continental global scale the model is a simple power function model based on red band which was equipped on almost all current earth resources satellite and ocean color satellite platforms the experience learned from this study could be used in many current earth resources satellite data such as sentinel 2 gao fen series and hj a b and the next generation of landsat satellite data landsat 9 to derive spatial and temporal sdd distributions in inland lakes of china the characteristics of the earth resources satellite data and the upcoming landsat 9 are similar to those of landsat 5 7 8 e g multispectral radiometry from ultraviolet to near infrared and red band spectral was included with numerous improvements high spatial resolution and shorter revisit time these satellites are appropriate for developing sdd estimation models for various inland waters especially for the water with small water surface however some limitations and challenges may be encountered in practical application firstly the bottom reflectance of optically deep waters contributes significantly to remote sensing reflectance spectra which may cause sdd to be underestimated in model calibration and validation the matching pairs were selected where the euphotic depth is obviously lower than water depth to avoid the reflectance contribution from lake bottom however it should be cautioned that some errors and uncertainties will be inevitably introduced in the application of the model to optically deep waters techniques for partitioning shallow water remote sensing reflectance into water column and bottom reflectance spectra in order to remove bottom contributions therefore are highly desirable and challenging doron et al 2011 in addition the developed model is applicable for lakes with similar optical characteristics for highly productive waters and macrophyte dominated waters the model may overestimate the sdd to some degree from the underestimated surface reflectance due to the strong absorption of macrophyte and cyanobacteria kutser 2004 silva et al 2008 therefore we would advise that special care should be taken when applying the model to assess highly productive or grassy waters in addition to these limitations it is likely that absorption from dissolved organic matter may cause some variation in the model coefficients and may introduce some uncertainties in sdd estimations for lakes in china especially after heavy rainfall events it is therefore necessary to exclude the effects of rainfall events to map spatiotemporal sdd distribution additional uncertainty in sdd estimation will be driven by spatiotemporal variability in the inherent optical properties iops in each lake system the detailed difference in the iops of lakes and the corresponding contribution to uncertainty in retrieval may be neglected in macroscale water quality monitoring further work should focus on iops variability in each lake system and identify the factors that influence model construction and sdd variation depending on the trophic status and depth of lakes 5 conclusion the remote sensing reflectance values from the landsat 7 and landsat 8 products were consistent to the in situ measured reflectance values at various wavelengths exhibiting high accuracy in the visible band the power function model based on the red band of landsat reflectance yielded high accuracy in estimating the sdd of lakes in china although the qaa derived a p 490 and b bp 490 values were combined to estimate the sdd with high accuracy the qaa requires in situ iops as input which were difficult to obtain for large numbers of lakes in addition the fitting coefficient of c varies for different lakes which limited the wide application of the algorithm the high consistency of sdd values from landsat 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli data indicated that the combination of landsat series data and the proposed model could result in an accurate long term estimation of the sdd in lakes in china the estimation results showed sdd ranged from less than 0 1 m to more than 10 m with an average value of 1 03 0 73 m for 641 lakes with water area 10 km2 in china during the period of june to october between 2016 and 2018 the epl and npl have relatively low sdd with multiyear average sdd of 0 56 0 17 m and 0 47 0 29 m respectively the ygpl and tpl have relatively high sdd

17194,water clarity expressed as secchi disk depth sdd reflects light transmission capacity of a water body and influences growth of aquatic plants aquatic organisms and primary productivity here we calibrated and validated a general model based on landsat series data for deriving sdd of various inland waters across china the quality of remotely sensed reflectance products from different landsat series images was assessed using in situ reflectance measurements the results indicated that the products in the visible bands are the most robust and stable to estimate sdd for inland waters subsequently a simple power function model based on red band was built using 887 pairs of in situ sdd measurements and concurrent landsat images the model was validated with an independent dataset of 246 sdd measurements and the results showed that the mean relative error and normalized root mean square error were 34 2 and 55 4 respectively finally the model was applied to landsat images acquired between 2016 and 2018 to investigate the sdd spatial distribution of all lakes with water area 10 km2 total 641 lakes in china the estimation results demonstrated that the eastern plain lake zone and northeast plain lake zone have relatively low sdd with multiyear average sdd of 0 56 0 17 m and 0 47 0 29 m respectively the yunnan guizhou plateau lake zone and tibetan plateau lake zone have relatively high sdd with multiyear average sdd of 1 48 0 86 m and 1 30 0 83 m respectively the results indicated that the proposed model exhibits strong ability to accurately construct sdd coverage for various lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water transparency estimation landsat empirical model lakes in china 1 introduction water clarity is characterized for the depth at which a standard white and black secchi disk disappears from view when lowered into the water and thus commonly expressed as secchi disk depth sdd fee et al 1996 sdd is a comprehensive proxy for trophic state of aquatic ecosystems and provides a practical measure of water quality because it is controlled by suspended matter algae and dissolved organic matter in the water column lisi and hein 2019 sdd governs underwater light field and thereby influences growth of aquatic plants aquatic organisms and primary productivity zhang et al 2015 the most accurate and commonly used manner of documenting sdd is ship based sampling however the traditional ship based observation method is insufficient at certain temporal and spatial scales for trend analysis especially for inland waters located in remote areas collection of sdd would still be nearly impossible without aquatic vehicles the tight relationships between optically active constituents and sdd provide possibility to capture sdd information through remote sensing approach lee et al 2015 remote sensing has been widely used to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of sdd at regional scale with different approaches and various satellite data preisendorfer 1986 olmanson et al 2008 doron et al 2011 lee et al 2015 there are three approaches for remote sensing of sdd including analytical tyler 1968 preisendorfer 1986 semi analytical gordon et al 1984 doron et al 2007 wang et al 2009 gallegos et al 2011 lee et al 2015 lee et al 2016 and empirical methods wu et al 2008 olmanson et al 2008 mancino et al 2009 wu et al 2009 duan et al 2009 allan et al 2011 doron et al 2011 guan et al 2011 mccullough et al 2013 dona et al 2014 olmanson et al 2015 binding et al 2015 theoretically sdd is inversely proportional to diffuse attenuation k d m 1 and beam attenuation c m 1 in the water gallegos et al 2011 lee et al 2015 lee et al 2016 in analytical methods satellite images are preprocessed to achieve accurate atmospheric correction using the corresponding radiative transfer models before mapping sdd the analytical methods require strict theoretical derivation and are challenging because instantaneous atmospheric conditions and initial parameter values are difficult to acquire giardino et al 2007 in semi analytical methods hyperspectral scanner data from in situ measurements airborne images and satellite hyperspectral images are usually applied to establish the reflectance curve of the studied water body the spectral bands corresponding to sdd value are then determined according to the characteristics of the reflectance curve abd elrahman et al 2011 the most commonly used semi analytical methods involve deriving the absorption and backscattering coefficients of water substances such as suspended matter algae and dissolved organic matter from the water surface reflectance gordon et al 1988 lee et al 2016 these derived parameters are then used to calculate k d or other related parameters such as turbidity and total suspended matter concentration tsm the semi analytical methods have complex parameterization processes and high spectral resolution requirements for satellite data which severely limited their application for deriving water clarity cao et al 2017 the empirical relationships between k d c sdd and reflectance in visible or near infrared nir wavelengths of a single band band ratios or multiple bands can simplify the calculation of the sdd from remote sensing signals kratzer et al 2008 however the band selection usually varied with the optical properties of water environment and it is challenge to generate a uniform estimation model for various types of water based on limited datasets for example alikas and kratzer 2017 suggested that the less absorbing portions in short visible wavelengths are more suitable for clear ocean water however wang et al 2009 and shi et al 2015 showed that for optically complex waters the reference band should be in the red part of the spectrum rather than in the green which is only appropriate for case 1 waters kabiri and moradi 2016 noted that the combination of linear terms of several single bands and band ratios could increase the precision of the model in coastal water mainstream ocean color satellites such as the coastal zone color scanner czcs sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris and geostationary ocean color imager goci have been widely used to monitor quality of inland waters doron et al 2011 binding et al 2015 feng et al 2019 xu et al 2019 ocean color satellites can provide high temporal resolution and multichannel remotely sensed data however the spatial resolution of ocean color satellite sensors is coarse and most inland water are too small to be mapped the sentinel satellite data were characterized with high temporal 1 4 day and spatial resolution 10 m while it only operates 6 years in contrast the unique 30 m spatial resolution and long term records of landsat data enable the high spatial resolution and long term mapping of lake sdd previous studies have empirically developed several models based on landsat series data to map sdd for inland and coastal waters olmanson et al 2008 dona et al 2014 page et al 2019 however the calibration and validation datasets used in these studies are collected from one two or a few lakes within a small geographical region failing to generate a uniform model for the systematic assessment of sdd at continental global scale therefore we attempt to assess the quality of remotely sensed reflectance products from different landsat series images construct a general sdd model at the continental scale 105 106 km2 based on extensive in situ sdd and landsat remote sensing reflectance from 225 china lakes and explore the spatial variation of lake sdd in china from 1986 to 2018 the sdd variation of lakes are often early warning indicators of significant local regional or global changes understanding sdd patterns is necessary for designing effective management and remediation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area according to the lake origin topography geomorphology and climatic characteristics the lakes in china have been divided into five lake zones 1 the tibetan plateau lake zone tpl 2 the inner mongolia xinjiang lake zone imxl 3 the eastern plain lake zone epl 4 the northeast plain lake zone npl and 5 the yunnan guizhou plateau lake zone ygpl wang and dou 1998 the tpl and imxl are located in internal drainage systems in arid or semiarid climate regions the other three zones npl ygpl and epl are external drainage systems in the asian monsoon climate region ma et al 2010 the tpl has the largest water surface area 41 832 km2 and number of lakes 1055 based on the most recent national lake investigation from 2005 2006 ma et al 2010 moreover the tpl has the fast growing and newest lakes due to annual snow accumulation and accelerated glacial melting zhang et al 2019 most tpl lakes are oligotrophic with high sdd values liu et al 2017 because of the high elevation 4000 m and sparse population of the tpl region the water environment in this region is almost unaffected by human activities zhang et al 2019 in contrast the epl and imxl have a moderate water surface area 21 053 km2 12 590 km2 and a moderate number of lakes 634 514 based on the most recent national lake investigation from 2005 2006 ma et al 2010 moreover many lakes have shrunk or vanished due to agricultural activities lake reclamation the expansion of lake side development and enclosures in the epl and imxl ma et al 2010 additionally the water quality of many epl lakes has deteriorated due to intensive anthropogenic activities in the past decades for example long term satellite investigations indicated that the sdd of lakes taihu hongzehu and liangzihu decreased at rates of 0 5 cm yr 0 9 cm yr and 5 0 cm yr shi et al 2018 xu et al 2018 li et al 2019 in response to chemical fertilizer use wastewater discharge and sand dredging activities respectively the current decrease in aquatic vegetation caused by urbanization and tourism development may accelerate the deterioration of water quality and shift from the macrophyte dominated ecosystem to phytoplankton dominated ecosystem zhang et al 2017 the npl and ygpl have a relatively small water surface area 4700 km2 1240 km2 and a small number of lakes 425 65 compared with the other regions based on the most recent national lake investigation from 2005 2006 ma et al 2010 most npl lakes are characterized by shallow depths and low water clarity duan et al 2009 npl lakes are mainly surrounded by agricultural cropland and forest areas zhang et al 2019 the physicochemical properties of lakes are strongly related to the land cover around lakes zhao et al 2017 ygpl is characterized by a long water exchange cycle and vulnerable ecosystem zhang et al 2019 recently many lakes in ygpl are suffering from accelerating eutrophication zhou et al 2016 the phytoplankton and zoobenthos macroinvertebrate species richness have also significantly decreased zhou et al 2016 increasing human activities such as land reclamation and agricultural practices may aggravate the changes in these lakes zhou et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 2 2 sampling sites and sdd measurements four datasets of the in situ sdd were collected table s1 1 864 pairs of in situ measured sdd and landsat images for 170 lakes from the second nationwide lake investigation from 2005 to 2010 73 pairs in 22 npl lakes 750 pairs in 98 epl lakes 7 pairs in 3 imxl lakes and 34 pairs in 9 ygpl lakes 2 319 pairs of in situ measured sdd and landsat images for 39 epl lakes from traditional sampling performed between 2017 and 2018 3 774 pairs of in situ measured sdd and images collected from routine site specific observations of lake qiandaohu n 255 lake taihu n 431 lake fuxianhu n 52 and lake luguhu n 36 and 4 354 pairs of in situ measured sdd and images collected from the literatures 70 pairs in 7 npl lakes 36 pairs in 29 ygpl lakes 201 pairs in 6 imxl lakes and 47 pairs in 25 tpl lakes a total of 2311 pairs of in situ measured sdd and landsat remote sensing reflectance data from the five geographic lake zones in china were used to calibrate and validate the sdd model fig 1 the time interval between in situ measurements and satellite observations ranged from 0 to 76 days the lake area ranged from 1 km2 to 4000 km2 and the water depth ranged from 1 m to 150 m measurement of sdd at the sampling stations shown in fig 1 was undertaken using a circular white and black disk with 30 cm diameter on the shady side of the boat to avoid direct sunlight reflections from the water surface helcom 2017 at each station the depth at which the secchi disk cannot be observed by the human eye of an observer when deployed in the water is recorded as an sdd value fee et al 1996 the in situ sdd were collected between 9 00 and 16 00 beijing time china to avoid the effect of low sunlight the detailed information of the field data was shown in table s1 2 3 in situ measured remote sensing reflectance the water spectra measurements included 6 field campaigns in lake dongpinghu dianshanhu gaoyouhu longwangshan reservoir taihu and yangchenghu that were synchronized with landsat 7 9 field campaigns in lake dongpinghu dianshanhu gaoyouhu hanzhou bay qiandaohu shijiuhu taipinghu wabanghu and yangchenghu that were synchronized with landsat 8 table s2 fig s1 the measured waters cover a wide range of sdd from clear to turbid and highly turbid water we therefore used the in situ measurements from these waters to evaluate the performance of landsat reflectance products and previously published sdd models the spectra measurements were obtained between 10 00 and 15 00 beijing time china total upwelling and downwelling radiance were collected with an analytical spectral devices spectrometer asd inc boulder co the spectra ranged from 350 nm to 1050 nm at 1 nm intervals the first downwelling radiance measurement from the reference panel l p1 λ 0 was collected prior to hydrologic and atmospheric spectral collection the total radiance above water surface ls w λ 0 were measured at a nadir view angle of 30 45 and an azimuth angle of 90 135 after measuring the water spectra the spectrometer was rotated upwards to 90 120 to measure the downwelling sky radiance l sky λ finally the second downwelling radiance measurement from the reference panel l p2 λ 0 was collected the average of two measurements of downwelling radiance from the reference panel l p λ 0 were used to calibrate the upwelling radiance the remote sensing reflectance above the water surface r rs λ 0 were calculated by the ratio of the upwelling water leaving radiance l w λ 0 to the downwelling irradiance e d λ 0 according to the formulas as 1 r rs λ 0 l w λ 0 e d λ 0 the l w λ 0 was derived according to the formulas as 2 l w λ 0 l sw λ 0 r sky l sky λ where r sky is the reflectance of skylight at the water air interface the r sky was taken as 2 2 for calm weather 2 5 for wind speed of up to 5 m s and 2 6 2 8 for wind speed of about to 10 m s tang et al 2004 the e d λ 0 was related to the averaged radiance of reference panel l p λ 0 according to the following formula 3 e d λ 0 π l p λ 0 ρ ρ λ where the ρ ρ λ is the reflectance of the reference panel 2 4 image acquisition and processing this study used landsat 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli surface reflectance images of the entire country from the google earth engine platform gorelick et al 2017 the surface reflectance images were atmospherically corrected from raw digital values in landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps and landsat surface reflectance code lasrc software schmidt et al 2013 ledaps and lasrc requires a variety of atmospheric inputs such as 6s model outputs the digital elevation the surface pressure total column ozone temperature and water vapor to constrain the atmospheric model kalnay et al 1996 for each image a quality control band was assigned to remove the cloud shadow and snow pixels the solar azimuth and zenith angles of each image were used with the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model dem to simulate and remove terrain shadows in the google earth engine platform farr et al 2007 the remote sensing reflectance r rs was obtained by dividing the surface reflectance by π 3 14 the global water occupancy frequency dataset was used to identify lake surfaces pekel et al 2016 and the dataset was generated using more than 3865 000 scenes from landsat tm etm and oli between 1984 and 2015 the dataset contains 30 m spatial resolutions with information on water occurrence frequency absolute change in occurrence between two specific epochs 1985 1990 2010 2015 and seasonality variation we retained the original frequency values and assumed occurrence frequencies of 75 in identifying permanent water surfaces the occurrence frequencies of 75 have been reported to be appropriate for identifying permanent water surfaces in the united states of america zou et al 2018 water surfaces were then clipped by enlarged lake boundaries of china with a 2 km buffer to separate the permanent lake surfaces from rivers and ponds these cloud free landsat 8 images in the nonfreezing period from june to october between 1986 and 2018 were then clipped by the extracted lake boundaries and mosaiced to obtain a contiguous region of the lakes in china we finally generated an averaged sdd map for 641 lakes in china with water area 10 km2 in recent period of 2016 2018 2 5 model calibration and validation to determine sensitive band for model calibration and validation the matching pairs of in situ and landsat observations were selected following the rules 1 the time interval between in situ and landsat observations was set within 1 day 2 the spatial window was set with 3 3 pixel centered over the in situ site 3 the matching pairs were selected where the euphotic depth is obviously lower than water depth to avoid the reflectance contribution from lake bottom 4 the matching pairs were selected under stable weather conditions for example the wind speed was low 5 m s and no precipitation occurred in a few days before the transit of the satellite feng et al 2019 olmanson et al 2008 found that the model coefficient did not change significantly when the time gap between the in situ measurement and satellite transit increased within a few days and that a large dataset of ground observations with long time gaps did not reduce the accuracy but offset some of the loss of correlation we also found that more ground observations with longer time gaps improved the calibration of the sdd model when in situ data were insufficient for example for comparisons of models with time gaps of 3 and 7 days the number of ground observations in tpl increased from 10 to 41 but the r 2 value decreased from 0 80 to 0 72 and the normalized root mean square error nrmse decreased from 61 2 to 53 6 this result occurs because the water clarity or sdd does not exhibit large fluctuations under stable hydrometeor conditions within a given time interval especially for tpl lakes which are less affected by human activity when compared with npl and epl lakes stadelmann et al 2001 zhang et al 2019 to clarify the impact of time intervals on the accuracy of sdd estimation in china we evaluated the accuracy of the models at different time intervals and finally selected the single band or band combination with the highest accuracy to construct the remote sensing estimation model for lakes in china 2 6 statistical analyses the mean value calculations linear and nonlinear regressions and t test were performed in matlab r2012a software the t tests with p 0 05 were reported as significant to evaluate the performance of the surface remote sensing reflectance and sdd model we used the determination coefficient r 2 mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse and nrmse in this study 4 mre 100 1 n i 1 n x esti i x meas i x esti i 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n x esti i x meas i 2 6 nrmse 100 1 n i 1 n x esti i x meas i 2 1 n i 1 n x meas i where xesti and xmeas are the estimated and measured values respectively and n is the number of values included in the calculation 3 results 3 1 distribution of in situ sdd our sdd dataset was distributed in the five lake zones with the sdd values ranging from 0 04 to 14 m with a median value of 0 54 m and mean sdd value of 1 23 1 96 m the order of mean and median sdd in the five lake zones is as follows tpl mean 4 47 m median 3 20 m imxl 2 73 m 2 01 m ygpl 1 41 m 0 79 m epl 0 67 m 0 48 m npl 0 40 m 0 27 m specially the tpl has generally high sdd with smaller coefficient of variation when compared with other zones table 1 3 2 validation of the landsat reflectance products in this study landsat reflectance products from several lakes in china were assessed by in situ measured remote sensing reflectance the result showed that both types of r rs displayed similar variation trends at the different wavelengths fig 2 the sampling information and accuracy mean relative error mre of r rs at each band were listed in the table s2 the r rs from the landsat 7 and landsat 8 products were consistent to the in situ measured reflectance values and the uncertainty levels in visible bands deep blue 11 17 blue 10 77 green 9 57 and red 8 72 could be acceptable according to previous studies uncertainty 10 30 guanter et al 2010 xu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 thus the products can be used for remote sensing estimations of water quality in inland waters 3 3 model calibration and validation the r 2 between the remote sensing reflectance of six landsat bands and concurrent in situ sdd with an interval of 1 day tends to increase with the wavelength in the visible band and the highest correlation was observed between the sdd and remote sensing reflectance in the red band the r 2 then significantly decreases in the nir and swir bands four different mathematical formulations linear exponential logarithmic and power law formulations were used to model the in situ measured sdd and landsat remote sensing reflectance the results indicated that the power function model exhibited better performance than the other models fig 3 a in addition the estimation accuracy was closely related to the interval between the imaging and sampling time within 12 days interval our dataset results showed the r 2 gradually decreased within the time interval fig 3b when the time interval was more than 12 days the accuracy of the model tended to decrease slightly with increasing time interval but maintain a low accuracy the accuracy of the model was inversely related to the time interval a large time interval yielded high error resulting from the inconsistency between the imaging and sampling times which influenced model calibration however if the time interval is too small only a few samples will be included for model calibration which may reduce the accuracy and stability of the model tables s3 s5 show the r 2 of the models with a single band or band combination within time intervals of 3 7 and 10 days the results indicate that when the time interval is within 7 days the estimation model not only achieves satisfied accuracy but also ensures that sufficient numbers of sample pairs from the five lake zones tpl 41 ygpl 107 imxl 121 epl 776 and npl 88 are included with this interval time 7 days the r 2 values of the power function model based on the red band of landsat reflectance for the five lake zones in eq 7 ranged from 0 68 to 0 83 and r 2 0 70 for the entire dataset fig 4 indicating a consistent and strong relationship between the in situ measured and landsat derived sdd the scatter points were mainly within the 95 predictive interval for each lake zone and combined dataset fig 4 indicating that the in situ measured and landsat derived sdd results are comparable 7 sdd 0 0046 r rs red 1 26 the dataset used for model calibration contains 887 sample pairs and the sdd values ranged from 0 01 to 14 m with a mean value of 1 57 1 95 m fig 5 a the dataset used for model validation included 246 sample pairs and the sdd values ranged from 0 05 to 6 70 m with a mean value of 1 51 1 74 m fig 5b for the validation dataset the regression plots closely match the 1 1 line and all scatter points are within the 95 predictive interval in addition the r 2 mre and nrmse are 0 73 34 2 and 55 4 respectively thus a power function model based on the red band of landsat reflectance provides a reliable estimate of the sdd and the combined database provides a reasonable estimate for each lake zone 3 4 sdd mapping of lakes in china as an example we detected the spatial characteristics of sdd in the nonfreezing period from june to october between 2016 and 2018 using cloud free landsat 8 images and generated an averaged sdd map for lakes in china with water area 10 km2 in this period fig 6 a f the average sdd of the five zones and all lakes in china were summarized graphically in histogram plots fig 6g the epl n 130 and npl n 49 have relatively low sdd with multiyear average sdd of 0 56 0 17 m and 0 47 0 29 m respectively the ygpl n 13 and tpl n 380 have relatively high sdd with multiyear average sdd of 1 48 0 86 m and 1 30 0 83 m respectively the imxl n 69 and all lakes in china n 641 have moderate sdd values with multiyear average sdd of 0 82 0 57 m and 1 03 0 73 m respectively fig 6 the statistics of lakes with water area larger than 10 km2 in four categories of sdd 0 0 5 m 0 5 1 m 1 2 m and 2 9 m fig 6h indicate that most lakes in npl 83 epl 60 and imxl 40 have an average sdd less than 0 5 m while most lake 31 in tpl have an average sdd between 1 and 2 m and more than half of ygml lakes have an average sdd value between 0 5 1 m from the perspective of lakes in china 40 of lakes have an average sdd value less than 0 5 m and the number of lakes shows decreasing trend with the increase of transparency 4 discussion 4 1 model implication and comparison the reflectance in the red region shows satisfactory accuracy in estimating the sdd of lakes in china in this spectral region the total absorption coefficient is almost immune to particle variation and is primarily associated with pure water therefore the r rs variability in this spectral region is dominated by the backscattering coefficient of particles b bp which is directly proportional to the particle concentration or inversely proportional to sdd nechad et al 2010 loisel et al 2014 previous studies have shown that red spectra based models can be used to estimate sdd and the related parameters such as turbidity tsm concentration and diffuse attenuation coefficient with good accuracy in moderately turbid lakes reservoirs and coastal waters kratzer et al 2008 shi et al 2015 hou et al 2017 using the red spectra as a reference band could reduce the rmse and increase the r 2 in deriving sdd and the related parameters nechad et al 2010 alikas and kratzer 2017 martinez et al 2015 indicated that the dispersion of k d λ at 650 nm remained relatively stable across the entire tsm range and a close linear relationship was found between k d 650 and tsm in all of the studied rivers and floodplain lakes of the amazon basin alikas and kratzer 2017 noted that the reflectance in the short visible spectra provides accurate sdd estimations in clear ocean waters and that the small amount of optical substances may result in maximum light penetration in this spectral region however the maximum light penetration shifts towards the red spectra in turbid waters at maximum light penetration the total absorption coefficient is constant and dominated by pure water under this condition the particulate concentration and related parameters can be correctly derived from remote sensing reflectance to understand how the reflectance error will influence the sdd estimation we artificially introduced the error of 5 into r rs red the result in table s6 showed that the mre variation of the sdd estimation in each lake zone and the entire china were no more than 6 when the error was introduced into r rs red indicating that the established model was robust for lakes in china these findings show that the derived sdd based on the red band model is reasonably accurate and can be used to produce other remote sensing products such as the tsm concentration and diffuse attenuation coefficient the sensitivity indices in previous studies were used to construct the relationship between r rs λ and the sdd and the performance of these adjusted models dekker and peters 1993 allee and johnson 1999 harma et al 2001 cózar et al 2005 wu et al 2008 olmanson et al 2008 mancino et al 2009 wu et al 2009 duan et al 2009 allan et al 2011 doron et al 2011 guan et al 2011 mccullough et al 2013 dona et al 2014 olmanson et al 2015 binding et al 2015 was compared table 2 in summary the models based on the green and red bands of landsat reflectance such as the single band models dekker and peters 1993 wu et al 2009 the exponential model dona et al 2014 the band ratio model mancino et al 2009 and the combined model olmanson et al 2008 worked well for lakes in china finally we compared the above models with the model constructed in this paper the results indicate that the model constructed in this paper has obvious advantages in terms of the r 2 and or the rmse the semi analytical method was used to derive the sdd by calculating the absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient of suspended matter a p λ and b bp λ the improved quasi analytical model qaa table s7 was applied to turbid water to derive a p λ and b bp λ by altering the reference wavelength to 710 nm le et al 2009 fig 7 compares the in situ measured sdd and the improved qaa derived a p 490 b bp 490 and 1 a p 490 c b bp 490 values for hangzhou bay fig 7a c lake taihu fig 7d f and lake qiandaohu fig 7g i the c in the combination of 1 a p 490 c b bp 490 is the optimal fitting coefficient which can be obtained by multivariate linear fitting between the in situ sdd and qaa derived a p 490 and b bp 490 values the results indicate that the improved qaa derived a p 490 value is significantly correlated with the in situ measured sdd values in hangzhou bay and lake qiandaohu p 0 001 the mre rmse and nrmse between the a p 490 derived and in situ sdd were 37 0 09 m and 42 for hangzhou bay and 31 1 42 m and 29 for lake qiandaohu respectively however the improved qaa derived a p 490 is not significantly correlated with the in

a p 490 and b bp 490 values could be combined to estimate the sdd with high accuracy however the improved qaa le et al 2009 requires in situ iops as input which was difficult to obtain for the large numbers of lakes in addition the fitting coefficient of c varies for different lakes therefore it is challenge to apply the improved qaa le et al 2009 at large scale recently lee et al 2016 successfully developed a new semi analytical algorithm for sdd estimation based on landsat 8 data however the new algorithm requires two narrow bands in the blue region as inputs therefore the traditional bands of landsat series data cannot meet the requirements of model construction for some semi analytical methods in contrast the empirical models do not require in situ iops and two narrow bands in the blue region as inputs in addition the empirical models have fewer measurement uncertainties than the semi analytical models that are based on inherent optical parameters our empirical model is developed based on extensive in situ sdd and landsat remote sensing reflectance which has obvious advantages in term of accuracy and applicability when compared with previously published empirical models 4 2 consistency of the landsat estimation results to evaluate the comparability of the landsat series images in assessing sdd variations we examined the estimated sdd of the lake water in the overlapping areas of two adjacent images in tpl the tpl lakes are relatively unaffected by human activity zhang et al 2019 therefore the water clarity does not exhibit large fluctuations under stable hydrometeor conditions within a period of a couple of days the sdd results from the landsat 5 tm images on october 5 2011 and the landsat 8 oli images on october 21 2017 were selected for comparison with the results from the landsat 7 etm images on october 6 2011 and october 22 2017 fig 8 because the compared images were quasi synchronized within one day of each other we deemed that the water sdd conditions remained the same for both images fig 8 shows the overlap area of the images and a scatterplot with a regression of the landsat derived sdd values from the overlapping area the model coefficients were different for the three sensors nonetheless the agreement between the landsat 5 7 and 8 derived sdd values was very strong r 2 0 94 for landsat 5 vs 7 r 2 0 95 for landsat 8 vs 7 fig 8c d indicating that the estimated sdd results from landsat 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli images are highly comparable thus the use of landsat series data with the proposed model can provide accurate long term coverage of sdd in lakes in china 4 3 advantage and limitations of the model our empirical model is developed based on extensive in situ sdd and landsat remote sensing reflectance the calibration and validation datasets in this model are collected from different types of water within a large geographical region indicating that the model could be hopefully used for the systematic assessment of sdd at continental global scale the model is a simple power function model based on red band which was equipped on almost all current earth resources satellite and ocean color satellite platforms the experience learned from this study could be used in many current earth resources satellite data such as sentinel 2 gao fen series and hj a b and the next generation of landsat satellite data landsat 9 to derive spatial and temporal sdd distributions in inland lakes of china the characteristics of the earth resources satellite data and the upcoming landsat 9 are similar to those of landsat 5 7 8 e g multispectral radiometry from ultraviolet to near infrared and red band spectral was included with numerous improvements high spatial resolution and shorter revisit time these satellites are appropriate for developing sdd estimation models for various inland waters especially for the water with small water surface however some limitations and challenges may be encountered in practical application firstly the bottom reflectance of optically deep waters contributes significantly to remote sensing reflectance spectra which may cause sdd to be underestimated in model calibration and validation the matching pairs were selected where the euphotic depth is obviously lower than water depth to avoid the reflectance contribution from lake bottom however it should be cautioned that some errors and uncertainties will be inevitably introduced in the application of the model to optically deep waters techniques for partitioning shallow water remote sensing reflectance into water column and bottom reflectance spectra in order to remove bottom contributions therefore are highly desirable and challenging doron et al 2011 in addition the developed model is applicable for lakes with similar optical characteristics for highly productive waters and macrophyte dominated waters the model may overestimate the sdd to some degree from the underestimated surface reflectance due to the strong absorption of macrophyte and cyanobacteria kutser 2004 silva et al 2008 therefore we would advise that special care should be taken when applying the model to assess highly productive or grassy waters in addition to these limitations it is likely that absorption from dissolved organic matter may cause some variation in the model coefficients and may introduce some uncertainties in sdd estimations for lakes in china especially after heavy rainfall events it is therefore necessary to exclude the effects of rainfall events to map spatiotemporal sdd distribution additional uncertainty in sdd estimation will be driven by spatiotemporal variability in the inherent optical properties iops in each lake system the detailed difference in the iops of lakes and the corresponding contribution to uncertainty in retrieval may be neglected in macroscale water quality monitoring further work should focus on iops variability in each lake system and identify the factors that influence model construction and sdd variation depending on the trophic status and depth of lakes 5 conclusion the remote sensing reflectance values from the landsat 7 and landsat 8 products were consistent to the in situ measured reflectance values at various wavelengths exhibiting high accuracy in the visible band the power function model based on the red band of landsat reflectance yielded high accuracy in estimating the sdd of lakes in china although the qaa derived a p 490 and b bp 490 values were combined to estimate the sdd with high accuracy the qaa requires in situ iops as input which were difficult to obtain for large numbers of lakes in addition the fitting coefficient of c varies for different lakes which limited the wide application of the algorithm the high consistency of sdd values from landsat 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli data indicated that the combination of landsat series data and the proposed model could result in an accurate long term estimation of the sdd in lakes in china the estimation results showed sdd ranged from less than 0 1 m to more than 10 m with an average value of 1 03 0 73 m for 641 lakes with water area 10 km2 in china during the period of june to october between 2016 and 2018 the epl and npl have relatively low sdd with multiyear average sdd of 0 56 0 17 m and 0 47 0 29 m respectively the ygpl and tpl have relatively high sdd with multiyear average sdd of 1 48 0 86 m and 1 30 0 83 m respectively authors contribution yibo zhang and yunlin zhang designed the structure and wrote the paper kun shi designed the experiments and
