jujube shells for the dye sorption for consecutive sorption desorption cycles was also studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 date stones and jujube shells preparation dactylifera date stones and ziziphus lotus jujube shells were collected from tinghir south east of morocco the materials were washed with distilled water and placed in an oven at 105 c for 24 h the biosorbents were ground using a laboratory mill sm10 retsch and then sieved to size 50 100 μm on laboratory sieve as200 shaker 2 2 congo red solutions preparation 1 g of cr powder dissolving in 1 l of distilled water for preparing the stock solution of cr all working cr solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solution 1 g l the physicochemical properties of congo red are detailed in table 1 2 3 biosorption experiments the biosorption experiments were conducted in 200 ml erlenmeyer flasks in batch mode the maximum biosorption of cr onto ds and js in optimal conditions 0 3 g of ds or js at size 50 100 μm was shaken with 50 ml of 100 mg l cr dye solution at ph 4 and 50 c for 90 min after completing the experiment the cr solution was ﬁltered through centrifuging at 3500 rpm for 5 min the concentrations of dye samples were measured at the maximum wavelength λ max 498 nm fig 1 using a uv vis spectrophotometer 2300 techcomp and via standard calibration curve the percentage biosorption was calculated using the following eq 1 1 b i o s o r p t i o n c 0 c e c 0 100 where c 0 mg l and c e mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of cr solution 2 4 desorption experiments after the biosorption in optimal conditions the dye loaded biosorbent dried in an oven for 24 h at 60 c desorption experiments were conducted in100 ml erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 20 ml of eluents solution 0 35 g of date stones congo red ds cr or jujube shells congo red js cr was stirred in 20 ml of hydroxide sodium solution naoh at concentration 0 02 m for ds cr and 0 04 m for js cr the mixture was stirred at 21 c for 40 min the biosorbent was separated from the mixture by centrifuging at 3500 rpm for 5 min the concentration desorbed c d of cr was determined by spectrophotometer uv vis desorption behavior of cr was studied in batch experiment such as different eluents hydrochloric acid hcl nitric acid hno3 sulfuric acid h2so4 phosphoric acid h3po4 hydroxide sodium naoh potassium hydroxide koh sodium bicarbonate nahco3 sodium carbonate na2co3 deionized water h2o methanol water ch3oh ethanol water c2h5oh and acetone water c3h6o eluent volume 10 40 ml concentration of eluent 0 01 0 06 m contact time 10 120 min and temperature 10 50 c desorption was calculated as follows 2 d e s o r p t i o n c d c a 100 where c a mg l and c d mg l are concentrations biosorbed and desorbed of cr dye respectively 2 5 regeneration and reusability of biosorbents regeneration of the sorbent is an important step in order to check economically the feasibility of biosorption process gupta et al 2020 reusability of the ds and js was studied by executing biosorption and desorption steps repeatedly in optimal conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 factors affecting dye desorption 3 1 1 effect of different eluents the desorption of cr from ds cr and js cr was tested with different eluents 0 2 m hcl 0 2 m 0 2 m hno3 0 2 m h2so4 0 2 m h3po4 0 2 m naoh 0 2 m koh 0 2 m nahco3 0 2 m na2co3 h2o 25 ch3oh h2o 25 c2h5oh h2o and 25 c3h6o h2o the results obtained are presented in fig 2 as seen from fig 2 hno3 and naoh and solutions indicate the minimum 48 44 and 43 29 and maximum 88 16 and 73 35 desorption percentages of cr respectively the reason of minimum amount of cr dye desorption by hno3 solution may be due to the formation of colored complex between eluent and desorbed cr dye in the experimental solution and difﬁculty of measuring dye concentration in optimum wavelength of 498 nm the number of positively charged sites on the biomass increases under acidic conditions it can increase the desorption efﬁciency of cr dye due to the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged sites on the biosorbent and anionic dye molecules vijayaraghavan et al 2008 thereafter naoh solution was selected to desorb of cr from dye loaded biosorbents in the rest of this study 3 1 2 effect of eluent volume the effect of different volumes 10 40 ml of 0 2 m naoh on desorption efﬁciency of cr dye from ds cr and js cr was studied while temperature and contact time were kept constant at 21 c and 120 min respectively the results obtained are presented in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3 cr dye desorption efﬁciency increased from 68 13 to 91 79 for ds cr and 55 23 84 88 for js cr with an increase in the eluent volume between 10 and 20 ml the reasons for this observation can be attributed to the fact that the increasing eluent volume provided a more effective interaction between the aqueous and solid phases after 20 ml of eluent volume the desorption efﬁciency starts to decrease can be explained by decrease in the effect of breaking the interactions between biosorbents and cr dye at higher eluent volume 3 1 3 effect of eluent concentration six different concentrations 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 04 0 05 and 0 06 m were selected to study the effect of naoh concentration on desorption of cr from ds cr and js cr the results obtained at 21 c and 120 min are presented in fig 4 it is noted that desorption efficiency increases with increasing naoh concentration until 0 02 m for ds cr and 0 04 m for js cr this increasing may be due to increasing oh ions concentration which lead to the increase of dye desorption efﬁciency similar results obtained by bhaumik et al kim et al and munagapati et al bhaumik et al 2013 kim et al 2019 munagapati and kim 2017 after the naoh concentrations 0 02 m for ds cr and 0 04 m for js cr the desorption decreases which suggests that higher strength of naoh is not favorable for cr desorption 3 1 4 effect of contact time the contact time effect on the cr dye desorption from ds cr and ds cr using naoh solution at concentration 0 02 m for ds cr and 0 04 m for js cr is shown in fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5 the desorption efficiency of cr from the dye statured biosorbent increased sharply within the 40 min rapid phase after this time the dye desorption was relatively small slower phase chang et al 2016 desorption equilibrium was achieved within 40 min with 92 05 for ds cr and 83 81 for js cr this rapid increase of desorption in the first phase can be explained by the presence at the beginning of a large number of oh ions that are available for desorption of the dye molecules rapid phase over time these oh ions become insufficient which causes forces between the solute molecules on the surface of the solid slower phase 3 1 5 effect of temperature 20 ml of naoh at concentration 0 02 m for ds cr and 0 04 m for js cr with 0 35 g of dye loaded biosorbents were carried at contact time 40 min for different temperatures 10 20 30 40 and 50 c and the results are depicted in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the desorption efficiency of cr increases from 83 13 to 92 89 for ds cr and from 77 18 to 86 27 for js cr with increasing of the temperature from 10 to 50 c it may produce swelling effect within the internal structure of ds cr and js cr allowing to the naoh molecule to penetrate more the increasing efficiency desorption with increasing temperature clearly suggests the endothermic nature of the ongoing desorption processes bentahar et al 2017 el messaoudi et al 2016a 3 2 comparative study with previous reported in literature desorption studies can help elucidating the mechanism of an adsorption process chen and zhao 2009 the rate desorption of cr from the loaded dye prepared samples were compared with previously reported results and listed in table 2 indicating that excellent desorption of cr from the dye loaded date stones and jujube shells using naoh eluent 3 3 regeneration and reusability of biosorbents the regeneration and reusability of the ds and js for the cr dye biosorption in optimal conditions was investigated by a repeated biosorption desorption process using naoh solution and the results are depicted in fig 7 the regeneration input revealed that removal of cr dye was dropped to 73 24 and 67 22 using ds and js adsorbents after four biosorption desorption cycles respectively this implied that the ion exchange and electrostatic attraction be dominant in adsorption process zhang et al 2014 hence the biosorption efficiency reduced approximately 21 69 and 30 66 after four cycles using ds and js biosorbents respectively these imply its potential application for the amputation of cr dye from wastewater systems the performance of dye biosorption desorption by the date stones and jujube shells was compared with the previous study and the results are presented in table 3 the date stones and jujube shells were successfully recycled for four successive biosorption desorption cycles indicating its high reusability 3 4 biosorption and desorption mechanisms fig 8 shows the proposed biosorption and desorption mechanisms of cr onto from date stones or jujube shells at ph 4 the biosorption of cr onto ds and js can be explained via van der waals electrostatic h bonding and hydrophobic interactions between oh and cooh groups present at ds or js surface and so3 groups and d nitrogen containing functional groups of cr newcombe and drikas 1997 desorption is the reverse reaction of adsorption it is about breaking these interactions between the biosorbent and the dye 4 conclusion the present study reports the results of cr dye desorption efﬁciency using different acids bases alcohols and organic solvents from date stones and jujube shells the effect of different operating variables on desorption efﬁciency were also investigated the desorption efﬁciency was 93 79 for ds cr and 88 27 for js cr using naoh solution the result indicates that h ion exchange takes place in the acidic medium with adsorbed cr dye molecules on the surface of ds and js dye desorption percentage increased by increasing volume of naoh solution until 20 ml contact time temperature and concentration of eluent until 0 02 m for ds cr and 0 04 m for js cr the reusability of biosorbents during four consecutive biosorption desorption cycles was successfully achieved the ﬁndings of this study suggests that studied date and jujube shells can favorably be used as environmentally friendly and efﬁcient sorbents for the removal of anionic dyes from aqueous solution declaration of

12001,the physico chemical parameters of the groundwater of 28 villages belonging to 7 community development blocks of dindori district india were assessed during monsoon july 15th september 2017 and winter december 2017 january 2018 season standard methods of a p h a were followed for analysis and interpretation of results the mean values of ph iron and sulphate exceeded the desirable limit prescribed by the bureau of indian standard groundwater sample of village chanda is not suitable for drinking and domestic purpose as it contains higher values of tds nitrate and sulphate as compared to permissible limit of the b i s anova indicates a significant difference between the monsoon and winter period values of temperature and total dissolved solids at α 0 05 the rest of the parameters of both the periods did not differ significantly the duncan s multiple range test indicates that harmonic mean of temperature sulphate tds and bod of all the seven blocks were homogenous at α 0 05 and rest of the parameters showed 2 to 3 subsets of different blocks the coefficient of correlation revealed strong positive correlation between calcium hardness and tds nitrate and tds iron and tds sulphate and tds bod and iron the high negative correlation was observed between sulphate and iron sulphate and nitrate some of the parameters were moderately and some were poorly correlated with each other graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater physico chemical parameters drinking water desirable limit 1 introduction groundwater is defined as fresh water from rains melting of ice and snow that seaps into the soil and is stored between pore spaces fractures and joints found in within rocks and other geological formations it is found in the aquifer deep in empty spaces in soils and cracks of rocks under the ground a layer of rock or any kind of geological formation that is sufficiently porous to store water and permeable enough to transmit water in quantities that can be economically exploited is called an aquifer chilton 1996 the aquifers are classified into 4 types i e confined artesian semi unconfined leaky unconfined and semi unconfined salako and adepelum 2018 an aquifer that is confined or overlain of two layers of rock or clay that are impermeable does not transmit water in appreciable amount is called confined aquifer in this stratum water pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure the semi confined aquifer is bounded above by a semi pervious and below by an impervious layer when the upper surface water table of an aquifer is open to atmosphere through permeable material it is called unconfined aquifer the wells are drilled into the aquifers and water can be pumped out the water in aquifers is replenished by drainage through the soil the groundwater in an unconfined or semi confined aquifer is more vulnerable to contamination from surface pollutants as compared to that in confined aquifers mahmoud et al 2019 the groundwater resources are being utilized for drinking irrigation and industrial purposes in addition to this groundwater contains a variety of dissolved inorganic chemical constituents in various concentrations resulting from chemical and biochemical interactions between water and geological material central groundwater board 2010 w h o 2011 and b i s 2012 present the standards for drinking water on the basis of physico chemical characteristics and microbiological contaminants groundwater is more suitable due to its natural and ubiquitous occurrence well protected from surficial contaminants and pollutants anim gyampo et al 2018 it has therefore become the most preferred source of sustainable water supply to meet domestic agricultural and industrial needs of humans in rural sub urban and urban settings in almost all developing countries anim gyampo et al 2019 due to increase in population industrialization use of fertilizers in the agriculture and man made activity the quality of the groundwater may be deteriorated the water quality and suitability for use are determined by its test odor color and concentration of organic and inorganic matter the inorganic chemicals hold a greater as contaminants in drinking water in comparison to organic chemicals the inorganic contaminants including salinity chloride fluoride nitrate and iron are important in determining the suitability of groundwater for drinking purpose laxmi et al 2016 jena and sinha 2017 the villagers of dindori district do not have properly treated potable water supply in their houses they depend upon the groundwater sources like bore well dug well and hand pumps to meet their drinking domestic and irrigational requirement the poor water quality may pose a risk to human health keeping this view the present study was aimed to evaluate the water quality parameters in order to assess the suitability of groundwater for drinking and domestic usages of the local inhabitants the study will be helpful to local administration for the adoption of suitable strategy for the supply of drinking water as per norms of bureau of indian standards 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area madhya pradesh is located in central region of india it has year round tropical climate characterized by warm days and cooler evenings the climate of dindori district is fairly pleasant except later part of summer season that has high atmospheric temperature and low relative humidity the climatic year consists of five distinct seasons viz spring february march summer april 15th june rainy 16th june 15th september autumn 16th september november and winter december january december and or january are the coldest month having minimum mean temperature of 10 4 c may is the hottest month with mean daily maximum temperature of 43 c the annual average total rainfall of the district is 704 7 mm dindori district is located at an average height of 1100 m above mean sea level in the maikal mountain ranges in the eastern part of madhya pradesh bordering the state of chhattisgarh in south the district is situated between the latitudes 220 27 and 230 22 north and longitude 800 30 and 810 44 east directorate of census operations madhya pradesh 2011 the area is underlain by various geological formations ranging in age from achaean to recent there are four distinct water bearing formations in the area viz i alluvium ii basaltic lava flows deccan trap iii intertrappean infratrappean bed and iv granite central groundwater board 2013 alluvium covers area along narmada river alluvium comprises clay silt and gravel pebbles and fine to medium grains the granular zone occurs at 16 0 18 0 m b g l meter below ground level the groundwater in alluvium generally occurs under unconfined condition at shallow depth up to 22 m b g l the basaltic lava flows is the main water bearing formation of the area in this zone groundwater occurs in the weathered mantle joints fractured and other zones of weakness under confined to semi confined and unconfined conditions intertrappean bed the lameta formation is a sedimentary rock formation consisting of sand stone and lime stone its depth varies from 18 to 45 m b g l infratrappean beds are late cretaceous fossiliferous lime stone beds the granites and gneisses in un weathered conditions have less than 1 porosity and cannot hold water however the broken and fractured rocks permit percolation of surface water the pre monsoon depth of water level of this area ranges from 3 15 to 12 35 m b g l and that of post monsoon ranges from 5 2 to 16 80 m b g l the district consists of mixed red and black soils the study was conducted at 28 villages belonging to seven community development blocks namely dindori shahpura mehadwani amarpur bajag karanjiya and samnapur of dindori district of madhya pradesh state fig 1 the hand pumps bore wells and dug wells which were functional and continuously in use directly or indirectly for the drinking and domestic purposes were selected for this study the other criteria which were kept in mind for the selection of water source include i wells closure to pollution sources like waste water drains garbage dump sites and ii wells suspected for natural contaminants like fluoride iron nitrate etc 2 2 sample collection a total of 28 samples of groundwater from 28 villages were collected during each period i e monsoon july 15th september 2017 and winter december 2017 january 2018 in order to analyze the color odor temperature ph total dissolved solids t d s calcium hardness chloride fluoride iron nitrate sulphate and biochemical oxygen demand b o d the triplicate set of collected water from each location constituted a sample the water samples were collected after pumping for 10 15 min in order to remove stagnant water one liter of groundwater was collected in pre cleaned plastic bottle and 300 ml in each of the two b o d bottles from a water source the dissolved oxygen in the b o d bottle was fixed at each site by adding 1 ml mnso4 solution followed by 1 ml alkali iodide azide reagent the collected samples were transported to the laboratory the ambient temperature during transportation in the monsoon season was between 27 and 30 c and 18 20 c in the winter the collection bottles were pre cleaned by soaking them in dilute hcl washing with tape water for the removal of hcl and finally rinsing with double distilled water 2 3 water analysis the apparent color was determined by observing the sample in transparent glass bottle and odor by sense of smelling the sample during the sampling the temperature ph and total dissolved solids were measured at the site by using portable water analyzer 371 systronics india ltd samples for chemical analysis were processed according to the methods of a p h a 2005 the calcium hardness edta titrametric method chloride argentometric titration fluoride spadns method iron spectrophotometric method visiscan 167 systronics nitrate uv spectrophotometric method sulphate turbidometric method and bod bottle incubation for 5 days at 20 c dissolved oxygen by azide modification of winkler method were analyzed within 24 h of sampling at public health engineering laboratory shahpura jabalpur and also at the department of p g studies and research in biological science rani durgavati university jabalpur m p 2 4 statistical analysis the mean of the triplicate set of each sampling station for a particular physico chemical parameters as well as of 28 sampling stations of each season was calculated the standard deviation of each parameter was worked out by including the values of all the 28 sampling stations of a season to assess the variability of data the one way analysis of variance was carried out to assess the significant different between monsoon and winter values of each parameter at α 0 05 duncan s multiple range test was performed to assess the spatial homogeneity in harmonic mean of a particular parameter in 7 community development blocks of the district pearson s coefficient of correlation to assess the degree of relationship between two parameters was calculated by using the 56 mean values of both the seasons the statistical tests were performed by using statistical package for social sciences spss software of international business machines corporation 3 results and discussion the physico chemical parameters viz color odor temperature ph total dissolved solids calcium hardness chloride fluorides iron nitrate sulphate and biochemical oxygen demand of the groundwater collected during monsoon and winter season are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively 3 1 apparent color and odor all the water samples of monsoon and winter seasons except of aadiwashi boys hostel chanda were colorless and odorless the hand pump water of this location was turbid brown and odorless this turbid water contains suspended matter and ions which on being exposed to air precipitate readily and give a brown color the oxidized form of manganese and iron causes dark brown or black stains lide 2020 thus chanda water is prima facie objectionable for drinking and direct consumption for domestic purpose it is utilized by the people after settlement of the suspended particles followed by filtration the assessment of odor depends upon the stimulation of the human receptor cells which are located in the nasal cavity of the person the sense of smell is more sensitive than the best analytical method for odor w h o 1984 2011 3 2 temperature the temperature of groundwater samples ranges from 27 0 to 27 8 c with an average of 27 4 c in monsoon and from 27 6 to 30 1 c mean 28 8 c during winter season the data indicate significant difference in the groundwater temperature of monsoon and winter season the temperature of the earth below 9 m is relatively constant throughout the year the high specific heat of water and the insulating effect of soil and rock can mitigate the effect of climate and maintain groundwater at a relatively steady temperature ansari and salahuddin 2013 reported minimum temperature of groundwater during january 17 1 c and maximum during june 30 8 c at ghazipur district of uttar pradesh india thus groundwater of dindori district has significantly higher temperature mean 28 8 c in winter as compared to that of ghazipur district of uttar pradesh the increase in temperature decreases the potability of water because carbon dioxide and other volatile gases which impart test are expelled at elevated temperature karunakaran et al 2009 it is desirable to have the temperature of drinking water not exceeding 15 c as the palatability of water is enhanced by its coolness 3 3 potential of hydrogen ph the ph value ranged from 6 2 to 8 5 with a mean of 7 3 in monsoon season and from 5 8 to 7 8 with a mean of 6 9 in winter season this indicates that groundwater of the study area is acidic to alkaline within the permissible limits i e 6 5 to 8 5 of b i s 2012 the lower value of ph in winter season as compared to monsoon season might be due to the mixing of rain water to groundwater the acidic nature of water may result from carbonic acid deposit formed via reaction of co2 with rain water tiwari et al 2015 the carbonic acid may be transported from soil surface to form deposit in groundwater over a period of time the alkaline ph of the groundwater may be due to the presence of lime stone in the concerned sampling stations that changes in its soluble form i e calcium bicarbonate under anaerobic condition the water having high alkalinity may cause swelling of hair fibers and gastro intestinal irritation rose 1986 the acidic water may cause damage to the cells of mucous membrane eyes and skin meinharadth 2006 the acidic water also cause corrosion of metals used in water supply 3 4 total dissolved solids tds the total dissolved solids is a measure of the combined content of all organic and inorganic substances contained in water in molecular ionized or micro granular suspended forms the total dissolved solids tds content fluctuated from 220 to 2260 mg l with a mean of 389 mg l during monsoon and from 250 to 2620 mg l with a mean of 396 mg l during winter period the tds contents of all the sampling stations except of aadiwashi boys hostel chanda were within the desirable limit of 500 mg l prescribed by b i s 2012 data indicate that groundwater of chanda in both the periods exceeded the permissible limits of tds 2000 mg l it is therefore not suitable for drinking and domestic usage the higher value of tds in water samples of village chanda is an indication of saline water which may be attributed to the presence of natural solutes via dissolution of soil and weathering slightly lower values of tds in monsoon season as compared to winter season have also been reported by other scientists from different regions of india mishra and shukla 2016 chandra et al 2017 atekwanaa et al 2004 from university of delaware united states of america reported that higher tds content may result i organoleptism in humans and ii reduction in performance of pipes filters and valves due to scale accumulations 3 5 calcium hardness the water hardness refers to the total concentration of polyvalent cations present in water the divalent cations like calcium and magnesium are main cause of hardness the iron manganese strontium etc also contribute to hardness of water calcium hardness is measured as concentration of calcium carbonate in the present study it ranged from 105 to 535 mg l with a mean of 192 mg l during monsoon and 150 540 mg l with a mean 221 mg l during winter period a total of 13 locations of both the seasons exceeded desirable limit 200 mg l but all the locations fell within the permissible limit 600 mg l of b i s 2012 the higher value of calcium hardness may be due to the presence of limestone and granitic terrain in the study area that contains high content of the calcium on the contrary groundwater of indore city of madhya pradesh has low calcium hardness ranging from 6 to 96 mg l gurjar et al 2013 3 6 chloride cl the maximum value of chloride i e 520 and 450 mg l were recorded in village nevsa during the monsoon and winter periods respectively the chloride concentration of the village chanda 360 mg l ranked second manikpur 290 mg l the third and rai 265 mg l the forth in order of merit in the winter season the monsoon samples of village chanda 450 mg l ranked second followed by nighori 310 mg l jaitpuri 305 mg l kisalpuri 255 mg l mehadwani kaneri and manikpur each 320 mg l exceeded the desirable limit of 250 mg l the chloride content of all other samples was within the desirable limit of bis chloride is usually present as nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 in all types of water in varying concentration these molecules enter in water by solvent action of water on salts present in soil and rocks from polluting material like sewage and trade wastes undergoing leaching shaikh and mandre 2009 chloride is a stable water components whose concentration is uninterrupted by biological and physico chemical processes chlorides have been investigated as an essential ingredient for activities involving human body metabolism mohsin et al 2013 higher concentration of chloride in water may lead to i laxative effect ii metallic pipe damage and iii unsuitability of water for agriculture irrigation raviprakash and krishna 1989 song et al 2017 3 7 fluoride f the mean fluoride content was 1 01 mg l and 0 99 mg l in the monsoon and winter periods respectively approximately 57 samples 16 samples in monsoon and 15 in winter have slightly higher values than the desirable limit 1 0 mg l but below the permissible limit 1 5 mg l of who 2011 the fluoride content of jaitpuri in winter 2 30 mg l and of chanda 1 65 mg l in monsoon exceeded the permissible limit fluoride is abundant in the earth s crust i e approximately 625 mg kg and occurs as a negatively charge fluoride ions f in water ali et al 2016 the fluoride in groundwater is mostly geogenic in nature the major minerals of fluoride found in hard rocks are fluorite apatite topoz lepidolite tremolite amphibole micas sellaite villamite and certain clay etc its availability is not only due to the presence of minerals but also due to the hydro geological conditions like groundwater circulation and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers that contribute more towards the mobilization of fluoride in groundwater yousefi et al 2018 the anthropogenic sources like industrial waste use of extensive fertilizers and bricks kilin may also contribute to fluoride contamination of groundwater ali et al 2016 alkaline groundwater generally tends to solubilize fluoride minerals central groundwater board 2013 reported fluoride content ranging from 0 02 to 1 85 mg l in the groundwater samples of dindori district hari babu et al 2016 also reported low fluoride concentration 0 652 2 11 mg l in groundwater samples of ysr kadapa district of andhra pradesh india ali et al 2019 reviewed the fluoride content in groundwater of india they concluded that pooled concentration of fluoride of india is around 2 37 mg l with 95 confidence interval of 1 46 3 28 mg l which is higher than the w h o and b i s permissible limits of 1 5 mg l the fluoride concentration up to 1 0 mg l in water is beneficial for strengthening teeth enamels but higher concentration for longer period may cause dental and skeletal fluorosis sezgin et al 2018 3 8 8 iron fe fe iron is the fourth most abundant elements by mass in the earth s crust in water it occurs mainly in ferrous or ferric state iron exists in its natural form as ores magnetite taconite and hematite in rocks soil and minerals making about 5 of earth s crust lide 2020 the mean value of iron content during monsoon and winter period was 0 61 mg l and 0 72 mg l respectively that is higher than the desirable 0 3 mg l and permissible limit 0 3 mg l of b i s 2012 the observed iron concentration above the permissible limits could be linked to i weathering of minerals and rocks of iron in the soil and ii dissolution of iron natural deposits into aquifers via leaching the iron content higher than the b i s standard has also been reported by other scientists central groundwater board 2010 ramkrishniah et al 2009 the consumption of drinking water containing high iron content may result haemosiderosis and many other neuro degenerative diseases nagendrappa et al 2000 brewer 2009 3 9 nitrate no 3 the nitrate content of surveyed water sources in both the seasons ranged from 2 2 mg l village samnapur to 85 0 mg l village chanda the average values of nitrate content were 21 7 mg l and 17 4 mg l in the monsoon and winter seasons respectively all the samples except of chanda has lower values of nitrate content as compared to b i s standard i e 45 0 mg l central groundwater board 2013 reported nitrate content ranging from 5 to 41 mg l in groundwater samples of dindori district dwivedi and tripathi 2017 reported the nitrate content ranging from 0 09 to 6 47 mg l from different sites of central india nitrate is the highly oxidized form of nitrogen compound that usually occur in natural water it is end product of decomposition of organic nitrogen material nitrate in groundwater primarily originate from fertilizers sewage and manure storage due to percolation into ground its excess level can cause methemoglobinemia or blue baby disease bruning fann and kanatime 1993 and hypertension in adults mkadmi et al 2018 nitrate does not normally cause health problem unless it is reduced to nitrite 3 10 sulphate so 4 the average values of sulphate content i e 251 0 and 232 0 mg l of the monsoon and winter seasons exceeded desirable limit 200 mg l of b i s 2012 the sulphate content of amarpur viz 490 mg l in monsoon and 450 mg l in winter and of chanda 740 mg l in monsoon and 620 mg l in winter exceeded the permissible limit of 400 mg l the possible sources of sulphate in the groundwater include pyrite fes2 gypsum percolated fertilizer and sewage sulphates come in water due to the i oxidation of their ores and ii h2s produced by some bacteria like chlorothiobacteria and rhodothiobacteria their ions exist naturally in water with little or no health implications recorded so far within the permissible range the accumulation of sulphate in water may lead to increase in water ph causing acidosis asamoah and amorin 2011 the elevated concentration of sulphate 500 mg l may cause laxative effects w h o 2011 the intake of water having high sulphate content may result in gastro intestinal problems in humans sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate exert a cathartic action in human beings subramani et al 2010 3 11 biochemical oxygen demand bod biochemical oxygen demand is a measure of oxygen required by microbes to degrade organic matter under aerobic condition bod indicates the nature and extent of pollution and also about the water quality average bod of the monsoon and winter period of the present study was 1 24 mg l and 1 28 mg l respectively this indicates that groundwater samples of the study area have some biochemicals microbial content that consume the dissolved oxygen kushram 2016 in her study of dindori town groundwater reported 3 5 29 0 mg l bod gawle et al 2019 from the same 28 water sources of dindori district reported bod values less than 2 mg l during the pre monsoon april june 2018 and post monsoon period september november 2018 however bod of groundwater samples from other zones of central india ranges from 3 07 to 19 17 mg l dwivedi and tripathi 2017 the bod value less than 2 mg l indicate the pristine water quality the water having bod less than 5 mg l is permissible for human consumption a p h a 2005 3 12 statistical analysis the standard deviation of temperature ph fluoride and iron of the 28 sampling stations have lower values as compared to others which indicate the less variability in the data of these parameters one way analysis of variance indicate that there was a significant difference in the monsoon and winter values of temperature and total dissolved solids at α 0 05 the rest of the parameters of both the periods did not differ significantly the spatial homogeneity of harmonic means of a particular physico chemical parameter in 7 different community development blocks is assessed by duncan s multiple range test table 3 all the 7 means each of temperature sulphate and bod of different community development c d blocks were homogenous at 0 05 level of significance for tds all the six c d blocks except bajag were homogeneous the community development block bajag karangiya and samnapur have homogeneous higher values of harmonic mean of calcium hardness the rest of the 4 blocks belong to second subset having lower values the c d block amarpur had higher flouride content hm 1 31 mg l the rest 6 blocks belong to second subset having values less than 1 14 mg l the bajag and shahpura blocks are in the one group due to having higher iron content in the groundwater the other 5 blocks belong to second subset in terms of nitrate content c d block bajag and dindori belong to one group having higher concentration and rest of the 5 block belong to other homogeneous group having lower value pearson s co efficient of correlation r reveals relationship between minimum of two continuous variables with value ranging from 1 to 1 strong correlation exists between parameters when r 0 7 while moderate when r ranges between 0 5 and 0 7 and poor when r 0 5 the parameters that strongly correlated positively r 0 7 with one another include calcium hardness and tds iron and tds nitrate and tds sulphate and tds iron and tds bod and iron the moderate positive correlation r between 0 5 and 0 7 was observed between fluoride and tds bod and tds iron and calcium hardness iron and nitrate the poor positive correlation r 0 5 was observed between chloride and tds nitrate and calcium hardness sulphate and calcium hardness bod and calcium hardness fluoride and chloride iron and chloride nitrate and chloride bod and chloride fluoride and iron nitrate and fluoride bod and fluoride bod and nitrate and bod and sulphate the positive correlation may be due to the geochemical composition of water bearing stratum that have enough quantity of the related minerals under the same hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer this condition is responsible for the simultaneous release of the positively related minerals yousefi et al 2018 the high negative correlation r 0 5 was observed between the sulphate and iron sulphate and nitrate the insignificant correlation was observed between several other parameters table 4 the oxidation reduction reaction and ion exchange in the groundwater aquifer system may be responsible for negative correlation between the minerals subba rao 2002 however popoola et al 2019 investigated the groundwater quality of lagos metropolis nigeria and did not find negative correlation between physico chemical parameters of the groundwater samples which include ph ec do tds bod cod anions cl no 3 so2 4 and po3 4 and heavy metals cu zn pb mn fe co cd and cr 4 conclusion an analysis of standard deviation indicates that temperature ph bod iron and fluoride values of both the period show less variation as compared to other parameters the one way anova at α 0 05 indicates no significant difference in monsoon and winter values of calcium hardness chloride fluoride iron nitrate sulphate and bod the temperature and total dissolved solids of both the periods differ significantly on the basis of concentration the chemical parameters may be ordered as tds sulphate chloride calcium hardness nitrate fluoride iron in monsoon and tds sulphate calcium hardness chloride nitrate fluoride iron in winter period approximately 57 of total samples exhibited slightly higher values of one or more parameters than the desirable limit i e amount up to that a particular parameter can be present in drinking water but below the permissible limit amount of a particular parameter up to which water can be consumed in the absence of alternate source as prescribed by the bureau of indian standards the process of water filtration for these water sources may be adopted for getting drinking water the groundwater of chanda village showed turbidity and exceeded the permissible limit of total dissolved solids in both periods this water is therefore not suitable for drinking and domestic purposes the duncan s multiple range test indicates that harmonic mean of temperature sulphate tds and bod of all the seven community development blocks were homogenous at α 0 05 and rest of the parameters show 2 to 3 subsets of different blocks the homogenous subset may have similar geo chemical composition of water bearing strata the pearson s coefficient of correlation revealed strong positive correlation between calcium hardness and tds nitrate and tds sulphate and tds iron and tds bod and iron the high negative correlation was observed between sulphate and iron sulphate and nitrate some of the parameters were moderately and some were poorly correlated with each other there is no distance related uniform pattern regarding changes in the physico chemical parameters of the groundwater the results of the present study are satisfactory the groundwater analysis of heavy metals cadmium chromium copper lead manganese nickel and zinc and minerals like arsenic and potassium that may pose the

other graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater physico chemical parameters drinking water desirable limit 1 introduction groundwater is defined as fresh water from rains melting of ice and snow that seaps into the soil and is stored between pore spaces fractures and joints found in within rocks and other geological formations it is found in the aquifer deep in empty spaces in soils and cracks of rocks under the ground a layer of rock or any kind of geological formation that is sufficiently porous to store water and permeable enough to transmit water in quantities that can be economically exploited is called an aquifer chilton 1996 the aquifers are classified into 4 types i e confined artesian semi unconfined leaky unconfined and semi unconfined salako and adepelum 2018 an aquifer that is confined or overlain of two layers of rock or clay that are impermeable does not transmit water in appreciable amount is called confined aquifer in this stratum water pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure the semi confined aquifer is bounded above by a semi pervious and below by an impervious layer when the upper surface water table of an aquifer is open to atmosphere through permeable material it is called unconfined aquifer the wells are drilled into the aquifers and water can be pumped out the water in aquifers is replenished by drainage through the soil the groundwater in an unconfined or semi confined aquifer is more vulnerable to contamination from surface pollutants as compared to that in confined aquifers mahmoud et al 2019 the groundwater resources are being utilized for drinking irrigation and industrial purposes in addition to this groundwater contains a variety of dissolved inorganic chemical constituents in various concentrations resulting from chemical and biochemical interactions between water and geological material central groundwater board 2010 w h o 2011 and b i s 2012 present the standards for drinking water on the basis of physico chemical characteristics and microbiological contaminants groundwater is more suitable due to its natural and ubiquitous occurrence well protected from surficial contaminants and pollutants anim gyampo et al 2018 it has therefore become the most preferred source of sustainable water supply to meet domestic agricultural and industrial needs of humans in rural sub urban and urban settings in almost all developing countries anim gyampo et al 2019 due to increase in population industrialization use of fertilizers in the agriculture and man made activity the quality of the groundwater may be deteriorated the water quality and suitability for use are determined by its test odor color and concentration of organic and inorganic matter the inorganic chemicals hold a greater as contaminants in drinking water in comparison to organic chemicals the inorganic contaminants including salinity chloride fluoride nitrate and iron are important in determining the suitability of groundwater for drinking purpose laxmi et al 2016 jena and sinha 2017 the villagers of dindori district do not have properly treated potable water supply in their houses they depend upon the groundwater sources like bore well dug well and hand pumps to meet their drinking domestic and irrigational requirement the poor water quality may pose a risk to human health keeping this view the present study was aimed to evaluate the water quality parameters in order to assess the suitability of groundwater for drinking and domestic usages of the local inhabitants the study will be helpful to local administration for the adoption of suitable strategy for the supply of drinking water as per norms of bureau of indian standards 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area madhya pradesh is

i e monsoon july 15th september 2017 and winter december 2017 january 2018 in order to analyze the color odor temperature ph total dissolved solids t d s calcium hardness chloride fluoride iron nitrate sulphate and biochemical oxygen demand b o d the triplicate set of collected water from each location constituted a sample the water samples were collected after pumping for 10 15 min in order to remove stagnant water one liter of groundwater was collected in pre cleaned plastic bottle and 300 ml in each of the two b o d bottles from a water source the dissolved oxygen in the b o d bottle was fixed at each site by adding 1 ml mnso4 solution followed by 1 ml alkali iodide azide reagent the collected samples were transported to the laboratory the ambient temperature during transportation in the monsoon season was between 27 and 30 c and 18 20 c in the winter the collection bottles were pre cleaned by soaking them in dilute hcl washing with tape water for the removal of hcl and finally rinsing with double distilled water 2 3 water analysis the apparent color was determined by observing the sample in transparent glass bottle and odor by sense of smelling the sample during the sampling the temperature ph and total dissolved solids were measured at the site by using portable water analyzer 371 systronics india ltd samples for chemical analysis were processed according to the methods of a p h a 2005 the calcium hardness edta titrametric method chloride argentometric titration fluoride spadns method iron spectrophotometric method visiscan 167 systronics nitrate uv spectrophotometric method sulphate turbidometric method and bod bottle incubation for 5 days at 20 c dissolved oxygen by azide modification of winkler method were analyzed within 24 h of sampling at public health engineering laboratory shahpura jabalpur and also at the department of p g studies and research in biological science rani durgavati university jabalpur m p 2 4 statistical analysis the mean of the triplicate set of each sampling station for a particular physico chemical parameters as well as of 28 sampling stations of each season was calculated the standard deviation of each parameter was worked out by including the values of all the 28 sampling stations of a season to assess the variability of data the one way analysis of variance was carried out to assess the significant different between monsoon and winter values of each parameter at α 0 05 duncan s multiple range test was performed to assess the spatial homogeneity in harmonic mean of a particular parameter in 7 community development blocks of the district pearson s coefficient of correlation to assess the degree of relationship between two parameters was calculated by using the 56 mean values of both the seasons the statistical tests were performed by using statistical package for social sciences spss software of international business machines corporation 3 results and discussion the physico chemical parameters viz color odor temperature ph total dissolved solids calcium hardness chloride fluorides iron nitrate sulphate and biochemical oxygen demand of the groundwater collected during monsoon and winter season are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively 3 1 apparent color and odor all the water samples of monsoon and winter seasons except of aadiwashi boys hostel chanda were colorless and odorless the hand pump water of this location was turbid brown and odorless this turbid water contains suspended matter and ions which on being exposed to air precipitate readily and give a brown color the oxidized form of manganese and iron causes dark brown or black stains lide 2020 thus chanda water is prima facie objectionable for drinking and direct consumption for domestic purpose it is utilized by the people after settlement of the suspended particles followed by filtration the assessment of odor depends upon the stimulation of the human receptor cells which are located in the nasal cavity of the person the sense of smell is more sensitive than the best analytical method for odor w h o 1984 2011 3 2 temperature the temperature of groundwater samples ranges from 27 0 to 27 8 c with an average of 27 4 c in monsoon and from 27 6 to 30 1 c mean 28 8 c during winter season the data indicate significant difference in the groundwater temperature of monsoon and winter season the temperature of the earth below 9 m is relatively constant throughout the year the high specific heat of water and the insulating effect of soil and rock can mitigate the effect of climate and maintain groundwater at a relatively steady temperature ansari and salahuddin 2013 reported minimum temperature of groundwater during january 17 1 c and maximum during june 30 8 c at ghazipur district of uttar pradesh india thus groundwater of dindori district has significantly higher temperature mean 28 8 c in winter as compared to that of ghazipur district of uttar pradesh the increase in temperature decreases the potability of water because carbon dioxide and other volatile gases which impart test are expelled at elevated temperature karunakaran et al 2009 it is desirable to have the temperature of drinking water not exceeding 15 c as the palatability of water is enhanced by its coolness 3 3 potential of hydrogen ph the ph value ranged from 6 2 to 8 5 with a mean of 7 3 in monsoon season and from 5 8 to 7 8 with a mean of 6 9 in winter season this indicates that groundwater of the study area is acidic to alkaline within the permissible limits i e 6 5 to 8 5 of b i s 2012 the lower value of ph in winter season as compared to monsoon season might be due to the mixing of rain water to groundwater the acidic nature of water may result from carbonic acid deposit formed via reaction of co2 with rain water tiwari et al 2015 the carbonic acid may be transported from soil surface to form deposit in groundwater over a period of time the alkaline ph of the groundwater may be due to the presence of lime stone in the concerned sampling stations that changes in its soluble form i e calcium bicarbonate under anaerobic condition the water having high alkalinity may cause swelling of hair fibers and gastro intestinal irritation rose 1986 the acidic water may cause damage to the cells of mucous membrane eyes and skin meinharadth 2006 the acidic water also cause corrosion of metals used in water supply 3 4 total dissolved solids tds the total dissolved solids is a measure of the combined content of all organic and inorganic substances contained in water in molecular ionized or micro granular suspended forms the total dissolved solids tds content fluctuated from 220 to 2260 mg l with a mean of 389 mg l during monsoon and from 250 to 2620 mg l with a mean of 396 mg l during winter period the tds contents of all the sampling stations except of aadiwashi boys hostel chanda were within the desirable limit of 500 mg l prescribed by b i s 2012 data indicate that groundwater of chanda in both the periods exceeded the permissible limits of tds 2000 mg l it is therefore not suitable for drinking and domestic usage the higher value of tds in water samples of village chanda is an indication of saline water which may be attributed to the presence of natural solutes via dissolution of soil and weathering slightly lower values of tds in monsoon season as compared to winter season have also been reported by other scientists from different regions of india mishra and shukla 2016 chandra et al 2017 atekwanaa et al 2004 from university of delaware united states of america reported that higher tds content may result i organoleptism in humans and ii reduction in performance of pipes filters and valves due to scale accumulations 3 5 calcium hardness the water hardness refers to the total concentration of polyvalent cations present in water the divalent cations like calcium and magnesium are main cause of hardness the iron manganese strontium etc also contribute to hardness of water calcium hardness is measured as concentration of calcium carbonate in the present study it ranged from 105 to 535 mg l with a mean of 192 mg l during monsoon and 150 540 mg l with a mean 221 mg l during winter period a total of 13 locations of both the seasons exceeded desirable limit 200 mg l but all the locations fell within the permissible limit 600 mg l of b i s 2012 the higher value of calcium hardness may be due to the presence of limestone and granitic terrain in the study area that contains high content of the calcium on the contrary groundwater of indore city of madhya pradesh has low calcium hardness ranging from 6 to 96 mg l gurjar et al 2013 3 6 chloride cl the maximum value of chloride i e 520 and 450 mg l were recorded in village nevsa during the monsoon and winter periods respectively the chloride concentration of the village chanda 360 mg l ranked second manikpur 290 mg l the third and rai 265 mg l the forth in order of merit in the winter season the monsoon samples of village chanda 450 mg l ranked second followed by nighori 310 mg l jaitpuri 305 mg l kisalpuri 255 mg l mehadwani kaneri and manikpur each 320 mg l exceeded the desirable limit of 250 mg l the chloride content of all other samples was within the desirable limit of bis chloride is usually present as nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 in all types of water in varying concentration these molecules enter in water by solvent action of water on salts present in soil and rocks from polluting material like sewage and trade wastes undergoing leaching shaikh and mandre 2009 chloride is a stable water components whose concentration is uninterrupted by biological and physico chemical processes chlorides have been investigated as an essential ingredient for activities involving human body metabolism mohsin et al 2013 higher concentration of chloride in water may lead to i laxative effect ii metallic pipe damage and iii unsuitability of water for agriculture irrigation raviprakash and krishna 1989 song et al 2017 3 7 fluoride f the mean fluoride content was 1 01 mg l and 0 99 mg l in the monsoon and winter periods respectively approximately 57 samples 16 samples in monsoon and 15 in winter have slightly higher values than the desirable limit 1 0 mg l but below the permissible limit 1 5 mg l of who 2011 the fluoride content of jaitpuri in winter 2 30 mg l and of chanda 1 65 mg l in monsoon exceeded the permissible limit fluoride is abundant in the earth s crust i e approximately 625 mg kg and occurs as a negatively charge fluoride ions f in water ali et al 2016 the fluoride in groundwater is mostly geogenic in nature the major minerals of fluoride found in hard rocks are fluorite apatite topoz lepidolite tremolite amphibole micas sellaite villamite and certain clay etc its availability is not only due to the presence of minerals but also due to the hydro geological conditions like groundwater circulation and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers that contribute more towards the mobilization of fluoride in groundwater yousefi et al 2018 the anthropogenic sources like industrial waste use of extensive fertilizers and bricks kilin may also contribute to fluoride contamination of groundwater ali et al 2016 alkaline groundwater generally tends to solubilize fluoride minerals central groundwater board 2013 reported fluoride content ranging from 0 02 to 1 85 mg l in the groundwater samples of dindori district hari babu et al 2016 also reported low fluoride concentration 0 652 2 11 mg l in groundwater samples of ysr kadapa district of andhra pradesh india ali et al 2019 reviewed the fluoride content in groundwater of india they concluded that pooled concentration of fluoride of india is around 2 37 mg l with 95 confidence interval of 1 46 3 28 mg l which is higher than the w h o and b i s permissible limits of 1 5 mg l the fluoride concentration up to 1 0 mg l in water is beneficial for strengthening teeth enamels but higher concentration for longer period may cause dental and skeletal fluorosis sezgin et al 2018 3 8 8 iron fe fe iron is the fourth most abundant elements by mass in the earth s crust in water it occurs mainly in ferrous or ferric state iron exists in its natural form as ores magnetite taconite and hematite in rocks soil and minerals making about 5 of earth s crust lide 2020 the mean value of iron content during monsoon and winter period was 0 61 mg l and 0 72 mg l respectively that is higher than the desirable 0 3 mg l and permissible limit 0 3 mg l of b i s 2012 the observed iron concentration above the permissible limits could be linked to i weathering of minerals and rocks of iron in the soil and ii dissolution of iron natural deposits into aquifers via leaching the iron content higher than the b i s standard has also been reported by other scientists central groundwater board 2010 ramkrishniah et al 2009 the consumption of drinking water containing high iron content may result haemosiderosis and many other neuro degenerative diseases nagendrappa et al 2000 brewer 2009 3 9 nitrate no 3 the nitrate content of surveyed water sources in both the seasons ranged from 2 2 mg l village samnapur to 85 0 mg l village chanda the average values of nitrate content were 21 7 mg l and 17 4 mg l in the monsoon and winter seasons respectively all the samples except of chanda has lower values of nitrate content as compared to b i s standard i e 45 0 mg l central groundwater board 2013 reported nitrate content ranging from 5 to 41 mg l in groundwater samples of dindori district dwivedi and tripathi 2017 reported the nitrate content ranging from 0 09 to 6 47 mg l from different sites of central india nitrate is the highly oxidized form of nitrogen compound that usually occur in natural water it is end product of decomposition of organic nitrogen material nitrate in groundwater primarily originate from fertilizers sewage and manure storage due to percolation into ground its excess level can cause methemoglobinemia or blue baby disease bruning fann and kanatime 1993 and hypertension in adults mkadmi et al 2018 nitrate does not normally cause health problem unless it is reduced to nitrite 3 10 sulphate so 4 the average values of sulphate content i e 251 0 and 232 0 mg l of the monsoon and winter seasons exceeded desirable limit 200 mg l of b i s 2012 the sulphate content of amarpur viz 490 mg l in monsoon and 450 mg l in winter and of chanda 740 mg l in monsoon and 620 mg l in winter exceeded the permissible limit of 400 mg l the possible sources of sulphate in the groundwater include pyrite fes2 gypsum percolated fertilizer and sewage sulphates come in water due to the i oxidation of their ores and ii h2s produced by some bacteria like chlorothiobacteria and rhodothiobacteria their ions exist naturally in water with little or no health implications recorded so far within the permissible range the accumulation of sulphate in water may lead to increase in water ph causing acidosis asamoah and amorin 2011 the elevated concentration of sulphate 500 mg l may cause laxative effects w h o 2011 the intake of water having high sulphate content may result in gastro intestinal problems in humans sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate exert a cathartic action in human beings subramani et al 2010 3 11 biochemical oxygen demand bod biochemical oxygen demand is a measure of oxygen required by microbes to degrade organic matter under aerobic condition bod indicates the nature and extent of pollution and also about the water quality average bod of the monsoon and winter period of the present study was 1 24 mg l and 1 28 mg l respectively this indicates that groundwater samples of the study area have some biochemicals microbial content that consume the dissolved oxygen kushram 2016 in her study of dindori town groundwater reported 3 5 29 0 mg l bod gawle et al 2019 from the same 28 water sources of dindori district reported bod values less than 2 mg l during the pre monsoon april june 2018 and post monsoon period september november 2018 however bod of groundwater samples from other zones of central india ranges from 3 07 to 19 17 mg l dwivedi and tripathi 2017 the bod value less than 2 mg l indicate the pristine water quality the water having bod less than 5 mg l is permissible for human consumption a p h a 2005 3 12 statistical analysis the standard deviation of temperature ph fluoride and iron of the 28 sampling stations have lower values as compared to others which indicate the less variability in the data of these parameters one way analysis of variance indicate that there was a significant difference in the monsoon and winter values of temperature and total dissolved solids at α 0 05 the rest of the parameters of both the periods did not differ significantly the spatial homogeneity of harmonic means of a particular physico chemical parameter in 7 different community development blocks is assessed by duncan s multiple range test table 3 all the 7 means each of temperature sulphate and bod of different community development c d blocks were homogenous at 0 05 level of significance for tds all the six c d blocks except bajag were homogeneous the community development block bajag karangiya and samnapur have homogeneous higher values of harmonic mean of calcium hardness the rest of the 4 blocks belong to second subset having lower values the c d block amarpur had higher flouride content hm 1 31 mg l the rest 6 blocks belong to second subset having values less than 1 14 mg l the bajag and shahpura blocks are in the one group due to having higher iron content in the groundwater the other 5 blocks belong to second subset in terms of nitrate content c d block bajag and dindori belong to one group having higher concentration and rest of the 5 block belong to other homogeneous group having lower value pearson s co efficient of correlation r reveals relationship between minimum of two continuous variables with value ranging from 1 to 1 strong correlation exists between parameters when r 0 7 while moderate when r ranges between 0 5 and 0 7 and poor when r 0 5 the parameters that strongly correlated positively r 0 7 with one another include calcium hardness and tds iron and tds nitrate and tds sulphate and tds iron and tds bod and iron the moderate positive correlation r between 0 5 and 0 7 was observed between fluoride and tds bod and tds iron and calcium hardness iron and nitrate the poor positive correlation r 0 5 was observed between chloride and tds nitrate and calcium hardness sulphate and calcium hardness bod and calcium hardness fluoride and chloride iron and chloride nitrate and chloride bod and chloride fluoride and iron nitrate and fluoride bod and fluoride bod and nitrate and bod and sulphate the positive correlation may be due to the geochemical composition of water bearing stratum that have enough quantity of the related minerals under the same hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer this condition is responsible for the simultaneous release of the positively related minerals yousefi et al 2018 the high negative correlation r 0 5 was observed between the sulphate and iron sulphate and nitrate the insignificant correlation was observed between several other parameters table 4 the oxidation reduction reaction and ion exchange in the groundwater aquifer system may be responsible for negative correlation between the minerals subba rao 2002 however popoola et al 2019 investigated the groundwater quality of lagos metropolis nigeria and did not find negative correlation between physico chemical parameters of the groundwater samples which include ph ec do tds bod cod anions cl no 3 so2 4 and po3 4 and heavy metals cu zn pb mn fe co cd and cr 4 conclusion an analysis of standard deviation indicates that temperature ph bod iron and fluoride values of both the period show less variation as compared to other parameters the one way anova at α 0 05 indicates no significant difference in monsoon and winter values of calcium hardness chloride fluoride iron nitrate sulphate and bod the temperature and total dissolved solids of both the periods differ significantly on the basis of concentration the chemical parameters may be ordered as tds sulphate chloride calcium hardness nitrate fluoride iron in monsoon and tds sulphate calcium hardness chloride nitrate fluoride iron in winter period approximately 57 of total samples exhibited slightly higher values of one or more parameters than the desirable limit i e amount up to that a particular parameter can be present in drinking water but below the permissible limit amount of a particular parameter up to which water can be consumed in the absence of alternate source as prescribed by the bureau of indian standards the process of water filtration for these water sources may be adopted for getting drinking water the groundwater of chanda village showed turbidity and exceeded the permissible limit of total dissolved solids in both periods this water is therefore not suitable for drinking and domestic purposes the duncan s multiple range test indicates that harmonic mean of temperature sulphate tds and bod of all the seven community development blocks were homogenous at α 0 05 and rest of the parameters show 2 to 3 subsets of different blocks the homogenous subset may have similar geo chemical composition of water bearing strata the pearson s coefficient of correlation revealed strong positive correlation between calcium hardness and tds nitrate and tds sulphate and tds iron and tds bod and iron the high negative correlation was observed between sulphate and iron sulphate and nitrate some of the parameters were moderately and some were poorly correlated with each other there is no distance related uniform pattern regarding changes in the physico chemical parameters of the groundwater the results of the present study are satisfactory the groundwater analysis of heavy metals cadmium chromium copper lead manganese nickel and zinc and minerals like arsenic and potassium that may pose the

12002,the aim of this study is to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater salinity in al batinah governorate a sultanate of oman and the strategies to manage and control this problem in an effective way around 58 000 water wells were investigated based on their operational status and type between 1990 and 2018 the groundwater salinity levels in the area were classified into five categories based on the electrical conductivity ec these categories include fresh water or excellent irrigation water low salinity water moderate salinity water high salinity water and very high salinity water a salinity map was created to track the changes in groundwater salinity over time in the study area the results show that water salinity increases over time due to the increase in urbanization and over pumping of water from these wells the increase in water salinity has a negative impact on the sustainability of the society and the economy particularly on the agricultural sector and hence effective government measurements are required to reduce these negative effects graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater salinity sustainable development electrical conductivity government policy al batinah area 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of water for billions of people around the world and it influences sustainable socioeconomic development of every community sahour et al 2020 gašparović and singh 2020 ferchichi et al 2018 gleeson et al 2012 over the past few decades the sustainability of this natural resource has been threatened in many parts of the world due to its increasing demand and overexploitation motevalli et al 2019 rawat et al 2018a wada et al 2010 specifically the groundwater quality and water flow patterns in the coastal aquifers have witnessed erratic changes due to excessive withdrawal and overexploitation leading to the encroachment by seawater intrusion to coastal aquifers and the increase in groundwater salinity shi et al 2020 argamasilla et al 2017 werner et al 2013a bouchaou et al 2009 groundwater salinization is more significant in arid and semi arid areas that have limited freshwater resources furthermore the groundwater salinity in these areas is considered a major environmental issue that needs a special attention mosaffa et al 2021 choudri et al 2015a this phenomenon which is a dynamic process and is either induced by humans or occurs naturally has adverse economic consequences affects the quality of drinking water and ecological health and makes different negative impacts on crop growth and productivity and hence it can lead to land degradation sahour et al 2020 abu alnaeem et al 2018 gholami et al 2017 in arid and semi arid areas the availability of good quality water is extremely low in comparison to its utilization consequently the demand for groundwater exceeds the supply quantities which results in the utilization of saline groundwater in huge quantities with consequences of salinization and desertification mosaffa et al 2021 ferchichi et al 2018 furthermore water salinity is a significant factor in soil salinity which is considered one of the important reasons for desertification in arid and semi arid areas al yahyai and khan 2015 choudri et al 2015a al belushi 2003 hence timely detection of groundwater salinity and the assessment and monitoring of its severity level and extent have become essential to mitigate the negative effects of this phenomenon mitigating the negative impact of groundwater salinity will help in conserving non renewable land and water resources as well as in minimizing the losses to crops and environment estevez et al 2019 allbed and kumar 2013 salt water since it is heavier usually occurs as a wedge beneath fresh water abu alnaeem et al 2018 song et al 2018 salt and fresh water mix in the diffusion zone or transition zone and hence water becomes more saline downwards and toward the sea the presence of a transition zone illustrates the existence of a significant circulation of seawater into and out of the aquifer majeed and muhammad 2019 song et al 2018 the saline water is prevented from moving further inland because of the formation of a natural barrier due to a continuous movement of fresh water through the zone the flow of fresh groundwater to the sea is maintained by limited pumping of water from wells achieved by recharge in the upper parts of the aquifers the tradition zone holds a fairly constant position canedo arguelles et al 2019 jia et al 2017 on the other hand the groundwater level falls when excessive pumping alters this equilibrium mainly near the coast where the flow of fresh water is reduced the transition zone in this case will move inland and upwards therefore the water pumped from wells near the coast progressively becomes more saline abu alnaeem et al 2018 jia et al 2017 the groundwater salinization is a common significant environmental and socioeconomic problem particularly in highly populated coastal areas abu alnaeem et al 2018 maguette et al 2017 the salinization problem can be attributed to natural factors and anthropic activities the natural factors include but not limited to climate hydrodynamic conditions seawater intrusion infiltration from surface saline water and wastewater topographic relief interaction of water with rocks low annual precipitation geology upward intrusion of brines from deeper aquifers impact of adjacent aquifers and saline water up coning caused by groundwater overexploitation the anthropic activities include but not limited to intensive farming activities large scale irrigation urban expansion improper sewage disposal and septic tank leachate overexploitation of groundwater and unplanned industrialization abd

et al 2015 molla et al 2015 zghibi et al 2014 sherif et al 2012 park et al 2012 datta et al 2009 furthermore the spatiotemporal development of salinity has been detected by using the geographic information system gis mosaffa et al 2021 gašparović and singh 2020 maliqi et al 2020 ferchichi et al 2018 abu alnaeem et al 2018 arslan 2012 mosaffa et al 2021 investigated the source of salinity in groundwater by using stable isotope tracers and the gis in the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan aquifers located in the urmia basin northwest iran the use of isotope tracers was effective to observe the effect of basin geology and groundwater salinity the study found that evaporation and dissolution of evaporation rocks in the study area were greatly effective in isotopic concentrations sahour et al 2020 mapped the spatial distribution of groundwater salinity in the southern coastal aquifer of the caspian sea they used the statistical and machine learning techniques by utilizing the available hydrogeology and hydrometeorology data they considered different variables affecting the groundwater salinity e g the distance from the sea mean annual evaporation the depth of the water table mean annual precipitation aquifer transmissivity and elevation they found that aquifer transmissivity was the most significant factor to affect the groundwater salinity in the study area park et al 2012 investigated the seawater intrusion into a coastal aquifer system in korea by using the groundwater modeling system and a multidimensional hydrodynamic dispersion model they found that seawater intrusion could be reduced if saltwater extraction was carried out in a range of 30 50 of the groundwater pumping rate different studies have been conducted to assess the groundwater and soil salinity in oman in general and in al batinah in particular most of these studies have focused on assessing the soil salinity rather than groundwater salinity al rahbi et al 2019 investigated the salinity intrusion in al batinah area by using the color aerial imaging with an unmanned aerial vehicle they found an adverse relationship between the soil ec and the distance from the seashore in addition they found that intensive pumping from a fresh groundwater zone and evaporation from a saline phreatic surface lead to a trough in the water table no fresh groundwater recharge into the sea caused by the resistivity traverses perpendicular to the shoreline kacimov et al 2005 considered different elements to study the seawater intrusion such as the catchment sizes water densities incident freshwater level in mountains intensities of fresh groundwater pumping sea level hydraulic conductivity and evaporation rates they found that pumping salt water from an intruded part of the aquifer could mitigate the seawater intrusion to fresh groundwater in al batinah area the higher solute concentration and density of seawater compared to fresh groundwater have been found to be the main reasons of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers this intrusion process is exacerbated due to the high extraction of fresh groundwater in over pumped catchments furthermore the seawater intrusion occurs due to the penetration of saline tongue landward from an interface between the coastal aquifer and seawater kacimov et al 2005 the fresh groundwater seeping to the sea from a higher elevation zone in the upper part of a coastal catchment stymies the tongue propagation al belushi 2003 analyzed the factors of desertification in al batinah where the study was based to classify the soil types in the area and investigate the characteristics of these soils to determine if some soil types speed up the process of desertification in the area the study also took into consideration the mapping of the groundwater salinity for different catchment locations in the study area the study found that groundwater in al batinah governorate particularly the areas near the coastal zone was severely affected by the seawater intrusion the study also concluded that the relationship between the soil salinity and water salinity in the study area was the result of irrigation practices bajjali 2003 analyzed the quality of groundwater for 20 000 wells in oman by using gis he found that the most affected area was al batinah governorate particularly the coastal area where the groundwater salinity ranged between 4000 and 35 000 mg l ppm al barwani and helmi 2006 mapped the groundwater salinity levels by using the gis and autocad in the coastal area of al batinah plain the map was based on groundwater ec surveys conducted by the ministry of regional municipalities and water resources between 1984 and 2005 the study concluded that the cultivated land was reduced by 7 between 2000 and 2005 the study also found that the salinity water moved 12 km toward inland in different parts of al batinah governorate particularly in barka the ministry of agriculture and fisheries developed the oman salinity strategy in 2012 to consider groundwater and soil salinization socioeconomic impacts and feasible managerial and institutional responses the report discussed different strategies policies and management approaches to overcome salinity problems in al batinah area the groundwater salinity problem has increased due to limited supplies of fresh water and a tremendous increase in the use of saline groundwater in agriculture maf and icba 2012 the agricultural sector is significant for food security objective in oman the area under cultivation in the area has decreased by about 1800 feddans units of area a year since 1997 maf and icba 2012 which is of great concern for policymakers the agricultural sector contributes to the economic growth through job creation improvement in rural income diversification of the national income the sector is considered a strong barrier against rural migration naifer et al 2011 the agricultural sector in the study area depends mainly on irrigation and hence the availability of water rather than the availability of suitable soils is the main constraint in the expansion of the agricultural area under cultivation hussain et al 2010 groundwater is a primary natural water resource in this area therefore its management is crucial for the agricultural sector economic development and the benefit of the future generation however the systematic over abstraction of groundwater resources has many negative consequences such as the groundwater salinization collapse of traditional irrigation and aquifer depletion in coastal areas currently the country is increasingly dependent on non conventional water sources such as desalination and treated wastewater to bridge the gap between the supply and demand abulibdeh and zaidan 2020 al rahbi et al 2019 sana et al 2013 hussain et al 2010 the aim of this study is to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater salinity in al batinah governorate the sultanate of oman and the ways to manage and control this problem in an effective way around 58 000 water wells were investigated based on their operational status and type between 1990 and 2018 the groundwater salinity levels will be examined based on the ec of the water in addition the study aims to study the appropriate measures that the authorities could encounter to mitigate this phenomenon to reduce the negative social and economic impact on the residents of the study area 2 study area 2 1 geographical setting al batinah plain extends in nearly 300 km northwest of the capital city muscat and along the west shore of the gulf of oman it is located at the foot of the western hajar mountains in the northeastern part of the sultanate as shown in fig 1 it extends from the northwest to southeast trends in a crescent shape al hatrushi 2014 this plain is the second most dense area in the country after the capital muscat it has witnessed a rapid increase in population growth and socioeconomic activities such as intensive urbanization coastal tourism projects active ports infrastructure development agricultural development and industrial activities al rahbi et al 2019 choudri et al 2015b this growth has resulted in elevating the pressure on natural resources and the subsequent increase in the demand for freshwater use further leading to an extensive pumping of fresh groundwater furthermore these activities have resulted in environmental challenges such as seawater intrusion water and soil salinization and desertification lawley et al 2016 choudri et al 2016 consequently the subsequent lowering of the water table has led to the creation of an unbalanced situation between saline water and fresh water this in turn causes seawater intrusion al batinah plain is the most fertile area in the sultanate of oman and the largest agricultural area covering around 24 of the total cultivated area this is the most concentrated farming area of oman with about 52 of land under cultivation which accounts for 65 of the omani agricultural production of crops such as vegetables dates and forage choudri et al 2013 2015a al batinah is one of the richest areas of fresh groundwater in the country the plain is the main source of fresh water in this area and a favorable region for groundwater occurrence which is crucial for agricultural economy of the country al batinah governorate accounts for 52 of the national agricultural water demand but provides 38 of the nation s renewable water resources maf and icba 2012 consequently the local agricultural demand exceeds the supply by 58 leading to critical water shortage in the area al rahbi et al 2019 furthermore the groundwater level in this area has witnessed a severe decline due to the industrial endeavors urbanization and the increase in irrigation resulting in the significant seawater intrusion al rahbi et al 2019 maf and icba 2012 in the recent decades the agricultural activities have increased manifold due to the availability of modern pumping facilities and resulting in the depletion of the fresh groundwater consequently the increased groundwater salinity has adversely affected the agricultural sector in the area and the country maf and icba 2012 furthermore the prolonged droughts have negatively affected the fresh groundwater level by increasing the extracted water from aquifers the seawater intrusion and well depletion are other challenges for al batinah s water resources as these processes increase the water salinity chitrakar and sana 2016 al ismaily and probert 1998 the salinity problems in the study area are of the two following categories i soil salinity in areas supplied by fresh water caused by improper irrigation management this type of salinity can be reversed unless the soil is significantly damaged through improved drainage and better soil water management by using fresh water ii groundwater salinity caused by the imbalance between abstracted fresh groundwater and what is naturally available this imbalance allows the inflow of seawater into coastal aquifers this results in salinizing the irrigated water sources this type of salinization is difficult to reverse as the chemistry of the groundwater aquifer is frequently irreversibly changed however bringing the groundwater system back into balance can slow down the rate of seawater intrusion in addition this requires a reduction in fresh groundwater use in the affected areas 2 2 climate settings according to koppen geiger climate classification the sultanate of oman is classified as tropical and subtropical desert climate bwh the country is characterized by two seasons summer and winter the summer that extends between april and october is scorching while winter is characterized by warmth and low humidity the air temperature varies depending on the location and altitude with a mean annual temperature ranging between 32 c and 38 c and around 17 8 c in the mountains the precipitation is limited and erratic with an average annual rainfall of about 100 mm al rahbi et al 2019 al hatrushi 2014 kwarteng et al 2009 although the rainfall is scanty it is the only source of natural water replenishment and is considered the main source for recharging the groundwater aquifers in the study area the relative humidity is very high in the coastal areas throughout the year and reaches a maximum of 99 in summers furthermore the evapotranspiration rate is around 1 29 m year al rahbi et al 2019 al hatrushi et al 2014 2 3 geological and hydrogeological settings the sultanate of oman is located near the northeastern edge of the arabian plate hawassina bed formed the bed of ocean in the late cretaceous period in general the country is divided into three geological provinces namely the oman mountains in the north the low lying al huqf in the central part and the dhofar mountains in the southwest kwarteng et al 2016 al hatrushi et al 2014 hanna 1995 the geology of al batinah coastal plain is coupled with the geology of the north oman mountains see fig 2 these mountains are composed of tectonically emplaced paleozoic and mesozoic continental margin and tethys deep sea sediments along with a slab of cretaceous oceanic crust and mantle popularly known as samail ophiolites kwarteng et al 2016 robertson 1990 lithologically the northern oman mountains are composed of three consecutive main rock units in addition to quaternary sediments kwarteng et al 2016 hanna 1995 the base rock units consist of the autochthonous sequence which are the oldest rocks exposed in the mountains and are composed of the precambrian crystalline basement of the arabian platform in addition these base rocks are composed of the precambrian crystalline basement of the arabian platform and the pre permian shelf carbonates known as the hajar super group sequence overlying the autochthonous sequence is the allochthonous sequence which consists of samail ophiolites hawasnah complex and metamorphic rocks sandwiched between them overlying the allochthonous sequence is the late tertiary and quaternary deposits that include gravel terraces and fans in the alluvial plains slopes and aeolian deposits the surface deposits along the coastline consist of a mixture of terrestrial and marine deposits including he raised beaches alluvial gravel coral terraces and aeolian sands kwarteng et al 2016 based on the geological setting and rock type the al batinah area can be divided into two major parts kwarteng et al 2009 2016 al hatrushi et al 2014 1 the mountains which are composed of hard rocks mainly igneous overlain by ophiolite sediments with some sandstones and conglomerates underlain by several thrust sheets of pelagic sediments and tertiary limestone and 2 the al batinah plain which has been formed over millions of years by the effect of natural processes such as weathering and rainfall the rainfall on mountains is an important element that contributes to building up the plain by spreading sediments furthermore the complex patterns of clay and gravel have been formed in valley channels the plain is composed of coarse gravels and boulders with occasional cemented beds al batinah plain can be divided into two main zones 1 the piedmont zone which consists of several alluvial terraces of fluvial origin of limited extent and 2 the surface of the plain which is composed of coarse sand and gravel along with alluvial terraces that elevate around 600 m above the sea level numerous valleys descending from mountains and meandering to drain in the gulf of oman have dissected the surface the modern valley gravel acts as a major conduit to the upper catchment s reaches in al batinah plain furthermore these modern valley gravels which reach 50 m in thickness are the location of the major water bearing formation second the valley fans prevail at lower reaches forming the coastal plain the coastal zone is less than 20 m above the sea level and the surface mainly consists of terrestrial and marine coarse to fine sands furthermore the sand dunes and sabkhas exist near the coast the coastal alluvium extends up to the depth of 600 m of poorly sorted silts sands and gravels the alluvial deposits become finer toward the interfluve area between the systems of braided channels as well as toward the coastal area in the northern batinah coastal plain the groundwater occurs in both the alluvium and the underlying upper fars formation from where less than 1 of the current abstraction originates al hatrushi 2016 al hatrushi et al 2014 on the other hand groundwater occurs in alluvium aquifer in the southern al batinah coastal plain hydrogeologically they are divided into three parts namely upper gravels clayey gravels and cemented gravels al barwani and helmi 2006 the upper gravel is comprised of low lands or piedmont zone which constitutes the main productive zone where thickness increases toward the sea hydraulically this unit is affected by the cementation with calcium carbonate grain size and the degree of sorting however its storage and transmissivity are generally good the transmissivity value ranges between 550 m2 day in the southern part and 3000 m2 day or greater in the northern part of the plain al barwani and helmi 2006 the high transmissivity in the northern part is due to the higher proportion of coarse materials caused by the narrowness of the coastal plain or greater aquifer thickness the clayey gravels underline the upper gravels this part is characterized by the appearance of brown and red marly gravels and clayey sands associated with decreasing well yields and average transmissivity of about 223 m2 day the cemented gravels are located at the bottom of the clayey gravel sequence this part is characterized by the smallest specific capacities and biggest drawdowns which make them markedly poor aquifer the groundwater quality in this area varies between mountainous and plain areas the water quality near recharge sources in mountainous areas is good with the total dissolved solid tds of less than 1500 mg l chitrakar and sana 2016 mcdonnell 2016 kwarteng et al 2009 al barwani and helmi 2006 while water quality in the plain and lowland areas decreases as groundwater dissolves many salts calcium carbonate during its way to the sea with higher tds values in the range of 1500 6500 mg l associated with larger settlements chitrakar and sana 2016 the alluvium forms a complex system of water bearing formations in al batinah region the recharge to the alluvial system overall varies annually depending on precipitation patterns however it is estimated to average 396 mcm year mcdonnell 2016 chitrakar and sana 2016 a single deep groundwater basin is formed from these deposits along the al batinah plain containing relatively fresh groundwater inland where saline intrusion exists near the coast the freshwater aquifer in the coastal zone is underlain by a saltwater wedge that now extends to several kilometers inland the other relevant hydrological characteristics of the northern batinah alluvial aquifer include the hydraulic conductivity which ranges from 0 3 m day to 449 m day where the highest values are associated with uncemented sands and gravels and the lowest hydraulic conductivity is associated with cemented clayey sands the storage coefficient values of the northern al batinah alluvial aquifer range from 1 10 5 to 1 10 2 while the transmissivity ranges from 0 9 m2 day to 16 900 m2 day mcdonnell 2016 3 methodology table 1 summarizes the data sources that have been used to conduct this research the road network data from the oman national center statistical and information ncsi were used to rectify all data sources into one coordinate system which is wgs 1984 utm zone 40 this study relied on several research approaches either in data collection analysis or interpretation as illustrated in fig 3 the methodology can be divided into two main steps 3 1 step 1 collecting and analyzing salinity data in early 1993 oman stopped issuing permits for drilling water wells and immediately started having a comprehensive inventory of wells including the location of the well type of well water quality ownership height depth of water and other important information the total number of wells in the study area were 58 850 including 24 207 operational and 34 643 nonoperational wells only 2669 wells of the ministry of regional municipalities and water resources mrmwr were used to conduct the salinity mapping in the study area for the periods 1990 2000 2010 and 2018 the degree of water salinity was analyzed based on the degree of ec the unit that was used to define water salinity was micro siemens per centimeter μs cm the ministry measured the salinity several times a year for monitoring for research the average readings of salinity were used to map salinity in the study area each water well was defined by easting and northing coordinate system wgs 1984 zone 40 the level of salinity was attached to the well as an attribute 3 1 1 the inverse distance weighting idw methods the idw is a widely used spatial deterministic interpolator which gives more weight to closer points over space the advantage of this approach is to estimate the cell values using the average values of the closest to the center of the cell whose value is to be estimated myers 1994 mitas and mitasova 1999 it is a widely accepted interpolation algorithm in the regions of plain topography such as al batinah plain where the possible effect of topography on the accuracy of the interpolated surfaces is minimized according to the idw the value of interpolated variable at any sampling point is computed in view of the weight of neighboring points to compute the value at any un sampled point n over space a weight is assigned to each of the neighboring points with data the weight wn assigned to point n is simply computed as 1 w n 1 d n i where d is the euclidean distance between points i and n then the value at any un sampled point xi is computed using the weights of all points with data as 2 x i w 1 x 1 w 2 x 2 w 3 x 3 w 4 x 4 w 5 x 5 w 6 x 6 w n x n w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 w 5 w 6 w n where x is the value at the un sampled point i and xn is the value of the variable at point n wn is the euclidean distance between the point i and the point n a comprehensive description of this interpolation algorithm is detailed in hodam et al 2017 and madhloom et al 2018 3 1 2 validation outputs there are several statistical metrics that could be used to assess the accuracy of idw outputs including the bias mean absolute error mae root mean squares error rmse rmse and correlation coefficients kazemi et al 2017 bronowicka mielniczuk et al 2019 in this study some of these metrics were deployed to assess the output of a cross tabulation procedure specifically we excluded 10 from the whole dataset wells and carried out the interpolation algorithm to the remaining data points 90 based on the interpolated surface using 90 of points we extracted the values corresponding to the randomly selected sample 10 we compared the observed data of this random sample with the predicted values by using idw bias coefficient of determination r2 and scatterplot diagrams fig 4 here it is noteworthy to indicate that the sample 10 of all points was selected by randomly using hawth s tools imbedded in arcgis software table 2 summarizes the accuracy metrics computed following the cross validation procedure 3 2 step 2 collecting and analyzing urban and vegetation data the remote sensing with the gis is a popular technique for identifying built up and green areas joseph et al 2020 abulibdeh 2020 hereher and al awadhi 2020 abulibdeh et al 2019a fadda et al 2019 al awadhi et al 2017 rajendran et al 2016 rawat and kumar 2015 as syakur et al 2012 vermeiren et al 2012 al awadhi 2008 xu 2007 four landsat images were used to identify built up and green areas for 1990 2000 2010 and 2018 with other ancillary sources such as population settlements and census data the pre processing such as image geometric correction and enhancement has been done in arcgis arcmap ver 10 5 environment several methods are used to extract the information from satellite images it depends on the type of images coverage areas concertation of the object value in the image and others for this study the built up areas were extracted with the help of the enhanced built up and bareness index ebbi by using equation 3 however the information for 1990 was extracted by using the other supported data such as printed aerial photos and topographical maps 3 ebbi band 5 band 4 band 5 band 6 10 the remote sensing techniques have been used broadly to identify and extract the green area especially when covering the large area with healthy concertation many methods and approaches were used to identify the green area such as supervised classification unsupervised classification ndvi artificial neural network ann for this study ndvi was used the main concept of ndvi is to calculate the difference between near infrared nir and red red and then divide by their sum as shown in formula 4 the value index of ndvi ranges in 1 1 the index near 1 means high concertation of green area while near 1 means less concertation 4 n d v i n i r r n i r r 4 results and discussion to add more insight to the analysis of groundwater salinity this study examines the groundwater salinity based on the spatial distribution of the abstraction water wells and their operational status for the whole study area as shown in fig 5 a the map shows that the majority of the wells are located along the cost in a thin strip of land this increases the probability of seawater intrusion the total number of wells in the study area is 58 850 of which 24 236 were in use in 1990 the number of the wells in use almost remained the same in 2018 however the main difference is the salinity ratio the water wells were classified into three categories based on their operational status as shown in fig 5b the majority of the water wells are agricultural wells and most of them are located along the coastal area these wells are more vulnerable to salinity due to seawater intrusion and high consumption of water for agricultural purposes as a result many of these wells have been abandoned that negatively affects the agricultural sector in this area the same applies to other types of wells the groundwater salinity levels were classified into five classes ranging from low to high salinity table 3 based on ec and fipps 1996 and glover 1996 irrigation water classification the five categories included 1 fresh water or excellent irrigation water which corresponds to ec of the soil in the root zone less than 2000 micro siemens per centimeter or μs cm 2 low salinity water which corresponds to ec of the soil in the root zone less between 2100 and 4000 μs cm 3 moderate salinity water which corresponds to ec of the soil in the root zone between 4100 and 8000 μs cm 4 high salinity water which corresponds to ec of the soil in the root zone between 8100 and 12 000 μs cm and 5 very high salinity water which corresponds to ec of the soil in the root zone more than 12 000 μs cm the results of the statistical analysis of groundwater salinity in al batinah area are shown in table 4 the results show the increase in the salinization value over time in the study area the maximum value of ec doubled over the study period this indicates that salinity is spreading fast in the study area table 5 shows the total coverage area for each ec class in al batinah over the study period the table shows that water salinity is increasing and extending to more areas over time the freshwater area decreased by 30 while very high salinity increased around nine folds the spatial and temporal analysis reveals that groundwater salinity is rising over time in all the catchments in al batinah area particularly in the areas near the coastline as shown in fig 6 table 6 shows the total number of wells in each salinity category table 6 clearly shows that there is an inverse relationship between the salinity category and the number of wells over time the number of the used freshwater wells for example dropped by 68 over the study period while very high salinity used wells increased by 1195 even the number of the low to moderately used wells has decreased to the expense of the high to very high salinity used wells the same applies to the not used wells as the percentage of fresh to moderate wells has decreased to the expense of high to very high not used wells it is clear that water salinity is increasing rapidly over time in all water wells with different operational purposes as shown in table 7 in general this implies a negative impact on economy particularly on the agricultural sector most of the operated wells are for agricultural purposes and hence they are the most affected by the increase in water salinity irrigating the plants with saline water results in a yield loss as plants differ significantly in the extent to tolerate salts in the soil this loss depends on many factors such as soil type and drainage stage of growth and varietal differences frequency and timing of irrigation climate and the method of irrigation the groundwater and soil salinity effects on crop yields are given in table 8 in terms of fresh water and non saline soils the yields of all crops are not affected as long as water and soil salinity are kept within the freshwater range since irrigation with fresh water could lead to accumulating water and soil salinity to a field over a season good water and soil management are significant to maintain the soil and water quality on the other hand lower levels of water and soil salinity result in reducing the yields slightly or significantly depending on the crop type and the severity of the water and soil salinity these losses could be overcome by adopting water and soil management and agronomic practices that are appropriate for local conditions some of the mitigation strategies can be followed to reduce the negative effects of salinity on crop yields including deep irrigation before sowing to migrate the salts from the soil proper leveling of soil to prevent accumulation of salts in elevated areas and mulching and applying organic matter to improve physical properties of soil other mitigation strategies could include increasing leaching salt scraping and piling selecting irrigation system with uniform application and sowing on shoulders of ridges in terms of moderate salinity the crop selection based on salt tolerance is the most significant management decision in mitigating the salinity effect of yield crops different factors also play an important role in soil and water salinity mitigation such as crop variety local climate soil type management practices and irrigation water quality in high salinity situation it is better to use the crops having much higher levels of tolerance than what is currently used the diversification of production systems with high salinity crops is an important adaptation strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of salinity and to sustain farm productivity in high saline water and soil finally in a very high salinity stage introducing biosaline agricultural system is an approach to achieve production from saline land and using saline water resources therefore growing non conventional crops is no longer economical when water and soil are characterized by very high salinity 5 driving forces of salinity in the study area the salinity problem in al batinah area is significant and has been increasing over time utilizing saline water in agricultural practices is considered a common practice in that area al rahbi et al 2019 maf and icba 2012 this practice elevates the problem of salinity over time the primary cause of water salinization in the study area is groundwater overdraft in al batinah governorates the groundwater use was about 54 higher than renewable supplies in 2010 where recharged water is 360 million cubic meters a year mcm compared to 557 mcm water abstraction ahmed and askri 2016 maf and icba 2012 therefore the underground water in storage has been used to meet the water demand and hence it has resulted in reducing groundwater levels the reduction in the groundwater level allows fresh water in the landward side of the irrigation coastal strip to be accelerated from the hills because of the increase in the groundwater gradient however the pumping process flattens or reverses the groundwater gradient to the sea and hence allows for seawater intrusion as pumping process reduces the outflow of groundwater that prevents the flowing of seawater into the aquifer al rahbi et al 2019 kacimov et al 2005 in addition the reduction in the thickness of fresh water reduces the pressure on the deeper seawater wedge and allows it to rise up into the aquifer a primary way to stop the inflow of seawater is to reduce the withdrawal of groundwater which in turn reduces further salinization of the farms using groundwater sana et al 2013 the groundwater salinity has also increased in this area due to climate characteristics and the area s proximity to the sea ahmed and askri 2016 kacimov et al 2005 the climatic conditions in this area are conducive to accumulation of salts in groundwater and on the surface and subsurface of the soil as salt cannot leach down completely therefore the net water movement in the soil remains upward and is associated with the dissolved salts hussain et al 2010 the groundwater evaporates and leaves these salts on the surface area or nearer the underneath these conditions increase the probability of the development of groundwater and soil salinity this process is always active particularly in dry seasons and hence gradually but slowly builds up the saline groundwater and soils another factor that elevates the groundwater salinity in al batinah is its nearness to the sea the area is subject to saline seawater intrusion that increases the salinity of the groundwater furthermore soil salinity increases due to soil formation from minerals high in salty water sprays soluble salt content and saline water floods the salt content is naturally high in a significant part of al batinah soils as these soils were built up from the deposited coastal materials salinity also accumulates when soil is left uncultivated for long periods since the net water movement becomes upward the irrigation for crops diverts the water cycle and salt movement downward and hence it is useful to keep the soils under crop cover munns and gilliham 2015 however in al batinah area water resources are very limited and hence the crop intensity cannot increase this forces the farmers to keep their lands fallow for some part of the year particularly during summers therefore the accumulated salts in subsurface remain recycling and cannot leach very deep or be drained off humans activities induce the secondary type of salinity these activities include cultural practices sewage from residential areas polluted effluents from industries into waterways and soils and irrigation operations and crop sequences in agricultural fields this type of salinity is pronounced in al batinah area al rahbi et al 2019 maf and icba 2012 al mulla 2010 the urbanization is another driving force of groundwater salinity al batinah area has witnessed rapid urban transformation between 1990 and 2018 driven by population growth and economic development the urbanization in this area has spread horizontally as shown in fig 7 the urban area expanded by 138 4 between 1990 and 2000 to cover a total area of 87 33 km2 as shown in table 9 however the rate of expansion retreated between 2000 and 2010 to reach 24 3 whereas the urban area expanded to cover 108 6 km2 by 2010 between 2010 and 2018 al batinah area witnessed a rapid increase in urbanization the area of urbanization increased by 117 3 to cover 235 9 km2 by 2018 most urban expansion took place along the coastal strip where the land is fertile and groundwater wells are extensive the urbanization has increased the probability of discharging treated water from wastewater treatment plants into the groundwater and the soil therefore the urban development in this area has resulted in gradual but consistent increase in salt concentration of groundwater the expansion in urbanization in al batinah area was on the expanse of the vegetation area as shown in table 9 and fig 8 although between 1990 and 2010 the percentage of vegetation area increased in al batinah area the main increase was in the landscape vegetation as the percentage of the farms witnessed reduction due to urbanization and water salinization after 2010 the green areas witnessed a rapid decline until 2018 as shown in table one reason for this phenomenon is that many farmers converted their farms to other types of use mainly residential and commercial areas the agricultural production in the country increased steadily until 1990 and accelerated in 1997 the agricultural production increased from 0 68 million tons in 1985 to 0 7 and 1 23 million tons in 1990 and 1997 respectively maf and icba 2012 however this production decreased by 4 7 nationally in the subsequent years to an average of 1 17 million tons over the period 2006 2010 al batinah governorates accounted for 80 of this reduction maf and icba 2012 water and soil salinization are significant contributors for the loss of cultivated land and productivity in addition the loss of the cultivated area was greater than that provided by new lands brought into production the rising groundwater salinity in al batinah area is a serious threat to the sustainable use of natural resources and economy of the area particularly the agricultural sector the expansion of the agricultural sector in al batinah area accelerated the use of groundwater resources through over pumping this process resulted in disturbing the water balance and seawater intrusion the farms in the upstream areas were irrigated by the wells equipped with pumps and motors or by drilling of deep wells and heavy pumping the aquifer became deficit since the withdrawals were higher than the recharge therefore the salinization process became very active and persistent with no salt control at that time in addition the area witnessed the increasing number of sebkha which are poorly drained depression areas near the coastal areas where salt and water accumulate gradually the salt content in these areas increased as the excessive water either evaporated or drained into the sea as a result the salt affected the agricultural areas and abandoning the farms became a permanent feature and ever increasing phenomenon of the landscape in al batinah plain therefore agricultural practices development and sustainability in this area would not be possible as water and salinity emerged as an extreme problem 6 management strategies some measures were taken by the authorities to control and reduce the level of water salinity such as the control of digging new wells and the rehabilitation of the older ones furthermore the authorities constructed new recharge dams and developed incentives for modern irrigation system however a number of farms have been abandoned due to high salinity levels that were unendurable even to the most salt tolerant crops furthermore the groundwater salinity in al batinah is irreversible due to the existence of depressions in aquifers therefore it has become of paramount importance to develop and implement sufficient and effective groundwater reclamation policies and strategies to prevent any further salinization to sustain agricultural lands and natural ecosystems and manage and monitor groundwater salinity the current situation requires the management techniques that ensure the sustainable use of saline water help in conserving land and water resources and minimize the loss to crops and soil health in agricultural and water sectors the water shortage can result in social and economic difficulties and hence technical and policy changes are needed to avoid these hardships abulibdeh and zaidan 2020 improving water management options is needed as a transition from focusing on augmenting supply this necessity provides the direct service to concentrate on water management and regulation of services allocating water based on the principles of economic efficiency has an advantage of providing objective guidance and developing methods that have built in flexibility to manage differences in water supply and demand these changes require the development of plans that promote demand management integrate water quantity and quality enforce environmental regulations in better and stronger ways decentralize responsibility for delivering water services reform tariffs for water supply irrigation and sanitation and strengthen government agencies seawater intrusion and salinization of groundwater phenomena are inseparable and negatively affect agricultural lands in al batinah area this impact is difficult to be solved without introducing the measures to reduce and eliminate groundwater overdraft managing and mitigating salinity effects require addressing policies and regulations that align with water and environmental conservation furthermore these policies and regulations should halt seawater intrusion by balancing water supply and demand improve management of soil resources and water inputs and adapt agronomy in the salinity affected areas to produce higher yields many of the crops in al batinah area are among low value crops in response to concerns for food security in the country therefore the agricultural sector consumes around 93 of all water use in the country it is important to measure the needed water in terms of its spatiotemporal use and in what quantities it should be done routinely and accurately most of the input data can be defined by regular monitoring and evaluating the groundwater levels this data can define the physical characteristics of the groundwater reservoir the focus should be on those areas where the groundwater system is affected by the seawater intrusion furthermore the soil profile should be determined in these areas to measure how much water and nutrients can be stored for plants use and the portion of water that will likely drain from it to recharge the water table increasing the supply is an expensive approach in addition to its environmental challenges the main source of water in the country is the desalinated water abulibdeh et al 2019b constructing desalination plants to address agricultural water deficits is costly and economically not efficient furthermore constructing dams takes many years and dams are environmentally challenging therefore the better management of the water demand in the agricultural sector is considered the biggest payoff in view of the overwhelming share of agriculture in the excess water demand of this sector the management objective is to mitigate and control seawater intrusion and not to prevent the process itself another challenge is to manage groundwater extraction since most of the groundwater production is private prevent exhausting the resource and manage agricultural trade to reduce agricultural water demand one of the options is to shut down wells in areas that are negatively affected by salinization of soils and seawater intrusion the farmers in the areas affected by seawater intrusion believe they have the access to groundwater by tradition right and very long term usage this ambiguous water right needs a solution that is socially equitable efficient and effective however wells and groundwater are owned by the country the recently constructed wells on new lands are licensed and controlled by the government in addition the government should subsidize most of the pumping equipment and initial capital investment in agricultural wells to encourage the changes in behavior that leads to water conservation and reduction price based approaches can be used to conserve water and use tariffs to transmit information about water scarcity the groundwater users must bear the production cost however groundwater is freely accessible by public however most of the agricultural users receive the subsidized electricity at flat rate tariffs consequently groundwater is severely over exploited and hence groundwater levels fall resulting in the marginalization of many small farmers and those who can afford the larger pumps remain in the business the volume of groundwater pumped can be constrained if measures such as price of the electricity is equivalent to the electricity production cost and thereafter by increasing the block tariff the improvement in agricultural extension services for delivering high quality technical support and advice that farmers need will eventually return a high value to economy by overcoming the threats of dwindling farm productivity due to mismanagement of water and soil resources the farmers should be able to produce competitively and remain in the business vis à vis the cheap imported food and agricultural products biosaline production system is an economically efficient approach in a short to medium term to moderate high salinity areas of al batinah particularly in good quality groundwater areas to rejuvenate soils that have become salinized through poor management the reduction in groundwater utilization will enable the agriculture to be sustained in this area and add important value to economy these strategies carry considerable operational difficulties and should be finetuned considering the costs opportunities benefits and socio political risks the investment in upgrading the on farm irrigation efficiency reuse of treated wastewater and new recharge dams will not be sufficient to slow down the rate of seawater intrusion therefore the overall utilization of groundwater has to be reduced the elements such as the extreme freshwater deficit prevailing in the area and the extensive aridity of centuries do not allow to get rid of salinity one approach to mitigate and manage salinity in this area in an efficient and effective way is using appropriate hydrological agronomic cultural and biological techniques these techniques are evolving particularly for the al batinah area and are adopted by farmers furthermore the support of the adaptation of reliable management techniques requires initiating strong and wise policy decisions some techniques suggested to optimize the salt management and control with a minimum loss to deep percolation include leaching salt periodically reliable estimation of leaching fraction monitoring the salinity of the root zone and water distribution uniformity hussain et al 2010 7 policy implications managing water services may include policies to shift the role of the government to regulator rather than water service provider and make water service deliveries business oriented the authorities must develop a comprehensive water resources management policy to enable assessment planning and regulation of all water using sectors different approaches to better manage and regulate water demand and supply are needed these approaches may include shifting their policies of directly providing water supply services to private sector as services to be provided by private or independently owned utilities managing both the water services delivery and water resources need to be recognized in new legislative changes water resources management could include adopting water friendly agricultural policy that aims to divert resources away from crops that produce low economic returns compared to the high value of water furthermore this approach can adopt a virtual water policy developing and implementing policies and strategies to manage water demand for the agricultural sector should be considered carefully in consideration of the reactions of farmers one of the main issues that has been debated a lot is weather farmers should pay the price of water they consume the farmers in areas that are negatively affected by seawater intrusion have free access to water the seawater intrusion causes a loss of income and sometimes results in farms abandonment therefore there is a strong social economic and environmental debate in favor of water use regulation and pricing implementing the regulation of licensing the new wells in the study area to prevent the construction of new illegal wells in the saline areas of al batinah is significant in reducing water salinity the suggestions have been made to stop agricultural practices and production in highly saline areas and to shift them to new areas of suitable soil and good quality groundwater this can lead to significant increase in farm productivity and incomes a water right can be allocated to each new farm where the use of this water would be monitored furthermore each new farm should be equipped with water supply monitor automated water demand soil sensors and subsidized irrigation equipment the conditional leases should also be proposed as an alternative to ownership so that new farms can maintain a commercial approach in addition rezoning of the farms for housing commercial or tourist facility development is an effective payoff for farmers in saline water coastal areas the subsidies is a means that can aid farmers in the transition process over the short term food security is a major concern in the country and has driven the substantial government investment in irrigation systems furthermore the food security concern has led to subsidies of inputs electricity irrigation technology and pumps and of outputs through price support mechanisms this aims to increase food self sufficiency on the national level in view of the geopolitical tension in the region therefore agricultural policy reform has a potential to reduce the agricultural water demand progressive agricultural policies allow the country to increase the imports of lower value staples and grow those crops more that have a comparative advantage to export furthermore it is also useful to benefit from different approaches that have been taken by other neighboring countries or countries with similar climate soil and agricultural conditions 8 conclusion the salinity in al batinah is a serious problem and it has a negative impact on food security and the economy because of its impact on the agricultural sector therefore it has become of paramount importance to develop and implement sufficient and effective groundwater reclamation policies and strategies to prevent any further salinization to sustain agricultural lands and natural ecosystems and manage and monitor groundwater salinity the current situation requires management techniques that can ensure the sustainable use of saline water help in conserving land and water resources and minimize the losses to crops and soil health different mitigation strategies and management techniques are more appropriate for this arid area these techniques could include the application of organic matter that increases water holding capacity of the soil and decrease evaporation practice of mulching the increased number of seedlings or higher seed rates of crops precision in land leveling to avoid over and under irrigation breaking capillaries by plowing the fields during fallow periods to reduce evaporation and accumulation of salts adjusting irrigation scheduling irrigation depth irrigation frequencies to provide more irrigation water than mere crop requirements appropriate leaching fractions planting on the shoulders of ridges and seed

12002,the aim of this study is to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater salinity in al batinah governorate a sultanate of oman and the strategies to manage and control this problem in an effective way around 58 000 water wells were investigated based on their operational status and type between 1990 and 2018 the groundwater salinity levels in the area were classified into five categories based on the electrical conductivity ec these categories include fresh water or excellent irrigation water low salinity water moderate salinity water high salinity water and very high salinity water a salinity map was created to track the changes in groundwater salinity over time in the study area the results show that water salinity increases over time due to the increase in urbanization and over pumping of water from these wells the increase in water salinity has a negative impact on the sustainability of the society and the economy particularly on the agricultural sector and hence effective government measurements are required to reduce these negative effects graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater salinity sustainable development electrical conductivity government policy al batinah area 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of water for billions of people around the world and it influences sustainable socioeconomic development of every community sahour et al 2020 gašparović and singh 2020 ferchichi et al 2018 gleeson et al 2012 over the past few decades the sustainability of this natural resource has been threatened in many parts of the world due to its increasing demand and overexploitation motevalli et al 2019 rawat et al 2018a wada et al 2010 specifically the groundwater quality and water flow patterns in the coastal aquifers have witnessed erratic changes due to excessive withdrawal and overexploitation leading to the encroachment by seawater intrusion to coastal aquifers and the increase in groundwater salinity shi et al 2020 argamasilla et al 2017 werner et al 2013a bouchaou et al 2009 groundwater salinization is more significant in arid and semi arid areas that have limited freshwater resources furthermore the groundwater salinity in these areas is considered a major environmental issue that needs a special attention mosaffa et al 2021 choudri et al 2015a this phenomenon which is a dynamic process and is either induced by humans or occurs naturally has adverse economic consequences affects the quality of drinking water and ecological health and makes different negative impacts on crop growth and productivity and hence it can lead to land degradation sahour et al 2020 abu alnaeem et al 2018 gholami et al 2017 in arid and semi arid areas the availability of good quality water is extremely low in comparison to its utilization consequently the demand for groundwater exceeds the supply quantities which results in the utilization of saline groundwater in huge quantities with consequences of salinization and desertification mosaffa et al 2021 ferchichi et al 2018 furthermore water salinity is a significant factor in soil salinity which is considered one of the important reasons for desertification in arid and semi arid areas al yahyai and khan 2015 choudri et al 2015a al belushi 2003 hence timely detection of groundwater salinity and the assessment and monitoring of its severity level and extent have become essential to mitigate the negative effects of this phenomenon mitigating the negative impact of groundwater salinity will help in conserving non renewable land and water resources as well as in minimizing the losses to crops and environment estevez et al 2019 allbed and kumar 2013 salt water since it is heavier usually occurs as a wedge beneath fresh water abu alnaeem et al 2018 song et al 2018 salt and fresh water mix in the diffusion zone or transition zone and hence water becomes more saline downwards and toward the sea the presence of a transition zone illustrates the existence of a significant circulation of seawater into and out of the aquifer majeed and muhammad 2019 song et al 2018 the saline water is prevented from moving further inland because of the formation of a natural barrier due to a continuous movement of fresh water through the zone the flow of fresh groundwater to the sea is maintained by limited pumping of water from wells achieved by recharge in the upper parts of the aquifers the tradition zone holds a fairly constant position canedo arguelles et al 2019 jia et al 2017 on the other hand the groundwater level falls when excessive pumping alters this equilibrium mainly near the coast where the flow of fresh water is reduced the transition zone in this case will move inland and upwards therefore the water pumped from wells near the coast progressively becomes more saline abu alnaeem et al 2018 jia et al 2017 the groundwater salinization is a common significant environmental and socioeconomic problem particularly in highly populated coastal areas abu alnaeem et al 2018 maguette et al 2017 the salinization problem can be attributed to natural factors and anthropic activities the natural factors include but not limited to climate hydrodynamic conditions seawater intrusion infiltration from surface saline water and wastewater topographic relief interaction of water with rocks low annual precipitation geology upward intrusion of brines from deeper aquifers impact of adjacent aquifers and saline water up coning caused by groundwater overexploitation the anthropic activities include but not limited to intensive farming activities large scale irrigation urban expansion improper sewage disposal and septic tank leachate overexploitation of groundwater and unplanned industrialization abd elhamid et al 2020 mirzavand et al 2020 rawat et al 2018b argamasilla et al 2017 mahlknecht et al 2017 tringali et al 2017 bodrud dozaa et al 2016 ledesma ruiz et al 2015 kaliraj et al 2014 werner et al 2013b huang et al 2013 elgettafi et al 2012 carol et al 2009 several studies have been conducted globally to investigate water salinity and seawater intrusion in different aquifer systems by utilizing different modeling approaches mosaffa et al 2021 abu alnaeem et al 2020 maliqi et al 2020 ferchichi et al 2018 mahlknecht et al 2017 bodrud dozaa et al 2016 chitrakar and sana 2016 chenini et al 2015 molla et al 2015 zghibi et al 2014 sherif et al 2012 park et al 2012 datta et al 2009 furthermore the spatiotemporal development of salinity has been detected by using the geographic information system gis mosaffa et al 2021 gašparović and singh 2020 maliqi et al 2020 ferchichi et al 2018 abu alnaeem et al 2018 arslan 2012 mosaffa et al 2021 investigated the source of salinity in groundwater by using stable isotope tracers and the gis in the azarshahr and shabestar sufyan aquifers located in the urmia basin northwest iran the use of isotope tracers was effective to observe the effect of basin geology and groundwater salinity the study found that evaporation and dissolution of evaporation rocks in the study area were greatly effective in isotopic concentrations sahour et al 2020 mapped the spatial distribution of groundwater salinity in the southern coastal aquifer of the caspian sea they used the statistical and machine learning techniques by utilizing the available hydrogeology and hydrometeorology data they considered different variables affecting the groundwater salinity e g the distance from the sea mean annual evaporation the depth of the water table mean annual precipitation aquifer transmissivity and elevation they found that aquifer transmissivity was the most significant factor to affect the groundwater salinity in the study area park et al 2012 investigated the seawater intrusion into a coastal aquifer system in korea by using the groundwater modeling system and a multidimensional hydrodynamic dispersion model they found that seawater intrusion could be reduced if saltwater extraction was carried out in a range of 30 50 of the groundwater pumping rate different studies have been conducted to assess the groundwater and soil salinity in oman in general and in al batinah in particular most of these studies have focused on assessing the soil salinity rather than groundwater salinity al rahbi et al 2019 investigated the salinity intrusion in al batinah area by using the color aerial imaging with an unmanned aerial vehicle they found an adverse relationship between the soil ec and the distance from the seashore in addition they found that intensive pumping from a fresh groundwater zone and evaporation from a saline phreatic surface lead to a trough in the water table no fresh groundwater recharge into the sea caused by the resistivity traverses perpendicular to the shoreline kacimov et al 2005 considered different elements to study the seawater intrusion such as the catchment sizes water densities incident freshwater level in mountains intensities of fresh groundwater pumping sea level hydraulic conductivity and evaporation rates they found that pumping salt water from an intruded part of the aquifer could mitigate the seawater intrusion to fresh groundwater in al batinah area the higher solute concentration and density of seawater compared to fresh groundwater have been found to be the main reasons of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers this intrusion process is exacerbated due to the high extraction of fresh groundwater in over pumped catchments furthermore the seawater intrusion occurs due to the penetration of saline tongue landward from an interface between the coastal aquifer and seawater kacimov et al 2005 the fresh groundwater seeping to the sea from a higher elevation zone in the upper part of a coastal catchment stymies the tongue propagation al belushi 2003 analyzed the factors of desertification in al batinah where the study was based to classify the soil types in the area and investigate the characteristics of these soils to determine if some soil types speed up the process of desertification in the area the study also took into consideration the mapping of the groundwater salinity for different catchment locations in the study area the study found that groundwater in al batinah governorate particularly the areas near the coastal zone was severely affected by the seawater intrusion the study also concluded that the relationship between the soil salinity and water salinity in the study area was the result of irrigation practices bajjali 2003 analyzed the quality of groundwater for 20 000 wells in oman by using gis he found that the most affected area was al batinah governorate particularly the coastal area where the groundwater salinity ranged between 4000 and 35 000 mg l ppm al barwani and helmi 2006 mapped the groundwater salinity levels by using the gis and autocad in the coastal area of al batinah plain the map was based on groundwater ec surveys conducted by the ministry of regional municipalities and water resources between 1984 and 2005 the study concluded that the cultivated land was reduced by 7 between 2000 and 2005 the study also found that the salinity water moved 12 km toward inland in different parts of al batinah governorate particularly in barka the ministry of agriculture and fisheries developed the oman salinity strategy in 2012 to consider groundwater and soil salinization socioeconomic impacts and feasible managerial and institutional responses the report discussed different strategies policies and management approaches to overcome salinity problems in al batinah area the groundwater salinity problem has increased due to limited supplies of fresh water and a tremendous increase in the use of saline groundwater in agriculture maf and icba 2012 the agricultural sector is significant for food security objective in oman the area under cultivation in the area has decreased by about 1800 feddans units of area a year since 1997 maf and icba 2012 which is of great concern for policymakers the agricultural sector contributes to the economic growth through job creation improvement in rural income diversification of the national income the sector is considered a strong barrier against rural migration naifer et al 2011 the agricultural sector in the study area depends mainly on irrigation and hence the availability of water rather than the availability of suitable soils is the main constraint in the expansion of the agricultural area under cultivation hussain et al 2010 groundwater is a primary natural water resource in this area therefore its management is crucial for the agricultural sector economic development and the benefit of the future generation however the systematic over abstraction of groundwater resources has many negative consequences such as the groundwater salinization collapse of traditional irrigation and aquifer depletion in coastal areas currently the country is increasingly dependent on non conventional water sources such as desalination and treated wastewater to bridge the gap between the supply and demand abulibdeh and zaidan 2020 al rahbi et al 2019 sana et al 2013 hussain et al 2010 the aim of this study is to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater salinity in al batinah governorate the sultanate of oman and the ways to manage and control this problem in an effective way around 58 000 water wells were investigated based on their operational status and type between 1990 and 2018 the groundwater salinity levels will be examined based on the ec of the water in addition the study aims to study the appropriate measures that the authorities could encounter to mitigate this phenomenon to reduce the negative social and economic impact on the residents of the study area 2 study area 2 1 geographical setting al batinah plain extends in nearly 300 km northwest of the capital city muscat and along the west shore of the gulf of oman it is located at the foot of the western hajar mountains in the northeastern part of the sultanate as shown in fig 1 it extends from the northwest to southeast trends in a crescent shape al hatrushi 2014 this plain is the second most dense area in the country after the capital muscat it has witnessed a rapid increase in population growth and socioeconomic activities such as intensive urbanization coastal tourism projects active ports infrastructure development agricultural development and industrial activities al rahbi et al 2019 choudri et al 2015b this growth has resulted in elevating the pressure on natural resources and the subsequent increase in the demand for freshwater use further leading to an extensive pumping of fresh groundwater furthermore these activities have resulted in environmental challenges such as seawater intrusion water and soil salinization and desertification lawley et al 2016 choudri et al 2016 consequently the subsequent lowering of the water table has led to the creation of an unbalanced situation between saline water and fresh water this in turn causes seawater intrusion al batinah plain is the most fertile area in the sultanate of oman and the largest agricultural area covering around 24 of the total cultivated area this is the most concentrated farming area of oman with about 52 of land under cultivation which accounts for 65 of the omani agricultural production of crops such as vegetables dates and forage choudri et al 2013 2015a al batinah is one of the richest areas of fresh groundwater in the country the plain is the main source of fresh water in this area and a favorable region for groundwater occurrence which is crucial for agricultural economy of the country al batinah governorate accounts for 52 of the national agricultural water demand but provides 38 of the nation s renewable water resources maf and icba 2012 consequently the local agricultural demand exceeds the supply by 58 leading to critical water shortage in the area al rahbi et al 2019 furthermore the groundwater level in this area has witnessed a severe decline due to the industrial endeavors urbanization and the increase in irrigation resulting in the significant seawater intrusion al rahbi et al 2019 maf and icba 2012 in the recent decades the agricultural activities have increased manifold due to the availability of modern pumping facilities and resulting in the depletion of the fresh groundwater consequently the increased groundwater salinity has adversely affected the agricultural sector in the area and the country maf and icba 2012 furthermore the prolonged droughts have negatively affected the fresh groundwater level by increasing the extracted water from aquifers the seawater intrusion and well depletion are other challenges for al batinah s water resources as these processes increase the water salinity chitrakar and sana 2016 al ismaily and probert 1998 the salinity problems in the study area are of the two following categories i soil salinity in areas supplied by fresh water caused by improper irrigation management this type of salinity can be reversed unless the soil is significantly damaged through improved drainage and better soil water management by using fresh water ii groundwater salinity caused by the imbalance between abstracted fresh groundwater and what is naturally available this imbalance allows the inflow of seawater into coastal aquifers this results in salinizing the irrigated water sources this type of salinization is difficult to reverse as the chemistry of the groundwater aquifer is frequently irreversibly changed however bringing the groundwater system back into balance can slow down the rate of seawater intrusion in addition this requires a reduction in fresh groundwater use in the affected areas 2 2 climate settings according to koppen geiger climate classification the sultanate of oman is classified as tropical and subtropical desert climate bwh the country is characterized by two seasons summer and winter the summer that extends between april and october is scorching while winter is characterized by warmth and low humidity the air temperature varies depending on the location and altitude with a mean annual temperature ranging between 32 c and 38 c and around 17 8 c in the mountains the precipitation is limited and erratic with an average annual rainfall of about 100 mm al rahbi et al 2019 al hatrushi 2014 kwarteng et al 2009 although the rainfall is scanty it is the only source of natural water replenishment and is considered the main source for recharging the groundwater aquifers in the study area the relative humidity is very high in the coastal areas throughout the year and reaches a maximum of 99 in summers furthermore the evapotranspiration rate is around 1 29 m year al rahbi et al 2019 al hatrushi et al 2014 2 3 geological and hydrogeological settings the sultanate of oman is located near the northeastern edge of the arabian plate hawassina bed formed the bed of ocean in the late cretaceous period in general the country is divided into three geological provinces namely the oman mountains in the north the low lying al huqf in the central part and the dhofar mountains in the southwest kwarteng et al 2016 al hatrushi et al 2014 hanna 1995 the geology of al batinah coastal plain is coupled with the geology of the north oman mountains see fig 2 these mountains are composed of tectonically emplaced paleozoic and mesozoic continental margin and tethys deep sea sediments along with a slab of cretaceous oceanic crust and mantle popularly known as samail ophiolites kwarteng et al 2016 robertson 1990 lithologically the northern oman mountains are composed of three consecutive main rock units in addition to quaternary sediments kwarteng et al 2016 hanna 1995 the base rock units consist of the autochthonous sequence which are the oldest rocks exposed in the mountains and are composed of the precambrian crystalline basement of the arabian platform in addition these base rocks are composed of the precambrian crystalline basement of the arabian platform and the pre permian shelf carbonates known as the hajar super group sequence overlying the autochthonous sequence is the allochthonous sequence which consists of samail ophiolites hawasnah complex and metamorphic rocks sandwiched between them overlying the allochthonous sequence is the late tertiary and quaternary deposits that include gravel terraces and fans in the alluvial plains slopes and aeolian deposits the surface deposits along the coastline consist of a mixture of terrestrial and marine deposits including he raised beaches alluvial gravel coral terraces and aeolian sands kwarteng et al 2016 based on the geological setting and rock type the al batinah area can be divided into two major parts kwarteng et al 2009 2016 al hatrushi et al 2014 1 the mountains which are composed of hard rocks mainly igneous overlain by ophiolite sediments with some sandstones and conglomerates underlain by several thrust sheets of pelagic sediments and tertiary limestone and 2 the al batinah plain which has been formed over millions of years by the effect of natural processes such as weathering and rainfall the rainfall on mountains is an important element that contributes to building up the plain by spreading sediments furthermore the complex patterns of clay and gravel have been formed in valley channels the plain is composed of coarse gravels and boulders with occasional cemented beds al batinah plain can be divided into two main zones 1 the piedmont zone which consists of several alluvial terraces of fluvial origin of limited extent and 2 the surface of the plain which is composed of coarse sand and gravel along with alluvial terraces that elevate around 600 m above the sea level numerous valleys descending from mountains and meandering to drain in the gulf of oman have dissected the surface the modern valley gravel acts as a major conduit to the upper catchment s reaches in al batinah plain furthermore these modern valley gravels which reach 50 m in thickness are the location of the major water bearing formation second the valley fans prevail at lower reaches forming the coastal plain the coastal zone is less than 20 m above the sea level and the surface mainly consists of terrestrial and marine coarse to fine sands furthermore the sand dunes and sabkhas exist near the coast the coastal alluvium extends up to the depth of 600 m of poorly sorted silts sands and gravels the alluvial deposits become finer toward the interfluve area between the systems of braided channels as well as toward the coastal area in the northern batinah coastal plain the groundwater occurs in both the alluvium and the underlying upper fars formation from where less than 1 of the current abstraction originates al hatrushi 2016 al hatrushi et al 2014 on the other hand groundwater occurs in alluvium aquifer in the southern al batinah coastal plain hydrogeologically they are divided into three parts namely upper gravels clayey gravels and cemented gravels al barwani and helmi 2006 the upper gravel is comprised of low lands or piedmont zone which constitutes the main productive zone where thickness increases toward the sea hydraulically this unit is affected by the cementation with calcium carbonate grain size and the degree of sorting however its storage and transmissivity are generally good the transmissivity value ranges between 550 m2 day in the southern part and 3000 m2 day or greater in the northern part of the plain al barwani and helmi 2006 the high transmissivity in the northern part is due to the higher proportion of coarse materials caused by the narrowness of the coastal plain or greater aquifer thickness the clayey gravels underline the upper gravels this part is characterized by the appearance of brown and red marly gravels and clayey sands associated with decreasing well yields and average transmissivity of about 223 m2 day the cemented gravels are located at the bottom of the clayey gravel sequence this part is characterized by the smallest specific capacities and biggest drawdowns which make them markedly poor aquifer the groundwater quality in this area varies between mountainous and plain areas the water quality near recharge sources in mountainous areas is good with the total dissolved solid tds of less than 1500 mg l chitrakar and sana 2016 mcdonnell 2016 kwarteng et al 2009 al barwani and helmi 2006 while water quality in the plain and lowland areas decreases as groundwater dissolves many salts calcium carbonate during its way to the sea with higher tds values in the range of 1500 6500 mg l associated with larger settlements chitrakar and sana 2016 the alluvium forms a complex system of water bearing formations in al batinah region the recharge to the alluvial system overall varies annually depending on precipitation patterns however it is estimated to average 396 mcm year mcdonnell 2016 chitrakar and sana 2016 a single deep groundwater basin is formed from these deposits along the al batinah plain containing relatively fresh groundwater inland where saline intrusion exists near the coast the freshwater aquifer in the coastal zone is underlain by a saltwater wedge that now extends to several kilometers inland the other relevant hydrological characteristics of the northern batinah alluvial aquifer include the hydraulic conductivity which ranges from 0 3 m day to 449 m day where the highest values are associated with uncemented sands and gravels and the lowest hydraulic conductivity is associated with cemented clayey sands the storage coefficient values of the northern al batinah alluvial aquifer range from 1 10 5 to 1 10 2 while the transmissivity ranges from 0 9 m2 day to 16 900 m2 day mcdonnell 2016 3 methodology table 1 summarizes the data sources that have been used to conduct this research the road network data from the oman national center statistical and information ncsi were used to rectify all data sources into one coordinate system which is wgs 1984 utm zone 40 this study relied on several research approaches either in data collection analysis or interpretation as illustrated in fig 3 the methodology can be divided into two main steps 3 1 step 1 collecting and analyzing salinity data in early 1993 oman stopped issuing permits for drilling water wells and immediately started having a comprehensive inventory of wells including the location of the well type of well water quality ownership height depth of water and other important information the total number of wells in the study area were 58 850 including 24 207 operational and 34 643 nonoperational wells only 2669 wells of the ministry of regional municipalities and water resources mrmwr were used to conduct the salinity mapping in the study area for the periods 1990 2000 2010 and 2018 the degree of water salinity was analyzed based on the degree of ec the unit that was used to define water salinity was micro siemens per centimeter μs cm the ministry measured the salinity several times a year for monitoring for research the average readings of salinity were used to map salinity in the study area each water well was defined by easting and northing coordinate system wgs 1984 zone 40 the level of salinity was attached to the well as an attribute 3 1 1 the inverse distance weighting idw methods the idw is a widely used spatial deterministic interpolator which gives more weight to closer points over space the advantage of this approach is to estimate the cell values using the average values of the closest to the center of the cell whose value is to be estimated myers 1994 mitas and mitasova 1999 it is a widely accepted interpolation algorithm in the regions of plain topography such as al batinah plain where the possible effect of topography on the accuracy of the interpolated surfaces is minimized according to the idw the value of interpolated variable at any sampling point is computed in view of the weight of neighboring points to compute the value at any un sampled point n over space a weight is assigned to each of the neighboring points with data the weight wn assigned to point n is simply computed as 1 w n 1 d n i where d is the euclidean distance between points i and n then the value at any un sampled point xi is computed using the weights of all points with data as 2 x i w 1 x 1 w 2 x 2 w 3 x 3 w 4 x 4 w 5 x 5 w 6 x 6 w n x n w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 w 5 w 6 w n where x is the value at the un sampled point i and xn is the value of the variable at point n wn is the euclidean distance between the point i and the point n a comprehensive description of this interpolation algorithm is detailed in hodam et al 2017 and madhloom et al 2018 3 1 2 validation outputs there are several statistical metrics that could be used to assess the accuracy of idw outputs including the bias mean absolute error mae root mean squares error rmse rmse and correlation coefficients kazemi et al 2017 bronowicka mielniczuk et al 2019 in this study some of these metrics were deployed to assess the output of a cross tabulation procedure specifically we excluded 10 from the whole dataset wells and carried out the interpolation algorithm to the remaining data points 90 based on the interpolated surface using 90 of points we extracted the values corresponding to the randomly selected sample 10 we compared the observed data of this random sample with the predicted values by using idw bias coefficient of determination r2 and scatterplot diagrams fig 4 here it is noteworthy to indicate that the sample 10 of all points was selected by randomly using hawth s tools imbedded in arcgis software table 2 summarizes the accuracy metrics computed following the cross validation procedure 3 2 step 2 collecting and analyzing urban and vegetation data the remote sensing with the gis is a popular technique for identifying built up and green areas joseph et al 2020 abulibdeh 2020 hereher and al awadhi 2020 abulibdeh et al 2019a fadda et al 2019 al awadhi et al 2017 rajendran et al 2016 rawat and kumar 2015 as syakur et al 2012 vermeiren et al 2012 al awadhi 2008 xu 2007 four landsat images were used to identify built up and green areas for 1990 2000 2010 and 2018 with other ancillary sources such as population settlements and census data the pre processing such as image geometric correction and enhancement has been done in arcgis arcmap ver 10 5 environment several methods are used to extract the information from satellite images it depends on the type of images coverage areas concertation of the object value in the image and others for this study the built up areas were extracted with the help of the enhanced built up and bareness index ebbi by using equation 3 however the information for 1990 was extracted by using the other supported data such as printed aerial photos and topographical maps 3 ebbi band 5 band 4 band 5 band 6 10 the remote sensing techniques have been used broadly to identify and extract the green area especially when covering the large area with healthy concertation many methods and approaches were used to identify the green area such as supervised classification unsupervised classification ndvi artificial neural network ann for this study ndvi was used the main concept of ndvi is to calculate the difference between near infrared nir and red red and then divide by their sum as shown in formula 4 the value index of ndvi ranges in 1 1 the index near 1 means high concertation of green area while near 1 means less concertation 4 n d v i n i r r n i r r 4 results and discussion to add more insight to the analysis of groundwater salinity this study examines the groundwater salinity based on the spatial distribution of the abstraction water wells and their operational status for the whole study area as shown in fig 5 a the map shows that the majority of the wells are located along the cost in a thin strip of land this increases the probability of seawater intrusion the total number of wells in the study area is 58 850 of which 24 236 were in use in 1990 the number of the wells in use almost remained the same in 2018 however the main difference is the salinity ratio the water wells were classified into three categories based on their operational status as shown in fig 5b the majority of the water wells are agricultural wells and most of them are located along the coastal area these wells are more vulnerable to salinity due to seawater intrusion and high consumption of water for agricultural purposes as a result many of these wells have been abandoned that negatively affects the agricultural sector in this area the same applies to other types of wells the groundwater salinity levels were classified into five classes ranging from low to high salinity table 3 based on ec and fipps 1996 and glover 1996 irrigation water classification the five categories included 1 fresh water or excellent irrigation water which corresponds to ec of the soil in the root zone less than 2000 micro siemens per centimeter or μs cm 2 low salinity water which corresponds to ec of the soil in the root zone less between 2100 and 4000 μs cm 3 moderate salinity water which corresponds to ec of the soil in the root zone between 4100 and 8000 μs cm 4 high salinity water which corresponds to ec of the soil in the root zone between 8100 and 12 000 μs cm and 5 very high salinity water which corresponds to ec of the soil in the root zone more than 12 000 μs cm the results of the statistical analysis of groundwater salinity in al batinah area are shown in table 4 the results show the increase in the salinization value over time in the study area the maximum value of ec doubled over the study period this indicates that salinity is spreading fast in the study area table 5 shows the total coverage area for each ec class in al batinah over the study period the table shows that water salinity is increasing and extending to more areas over time the freshwater area decreased by 30 while very high salinity increased around nine folds the spatial and temporal analysis reveals that groundwater salinity is rising over time in all the catchments in al batinah area particularly in the areas near the coastline as shown in fig 6 table 6 shows the total number of wells in each salinity category table 6 clearly shows that there is an inverse relationship between the salinity category and the number of wells over time the number of the used freshwater wells for example dropped by 68 over the study period while very high salinity used wells increased by 1195 even the number of the low to moderately used wells has decreased to the expense of the high to very high salinity used wells the same applies to the not used wells as the percentage of fresh to moderate wells has decreased to the expense of high to very high not used wells it is clear that water salinity is increasing rapidly over time in all water wells with different operational purposes as shown in table 7 in general this implies a negative impact on economy particularly on the agricultural sector most of the operated wells are for agricultural purposes and hence they are the most affected by the increase in water salinity irrigating the plants with saline water results in a yield loss as plants differ significantly in the extent to tolerate salts in the soil this loss depends on many factors such as soil type and drainage stage of growth and varietal differences frequency and timing of irrigation climate and the method of irrigation the groundwater and soil salinity effects on crop yields are given in table 8 in terms of fresh water and non saline soils the yields of all crops are not affected as long as water and soil salinity are kept within the freshwater range since irrigation with fresh water could lead to accumulating water and soil salinity to a field over a season good water and soil management are significant to maintain the soil and water quality on the other hand lower levels of water and soil salinity result in reducing the yields slightly or significantly depending on the crop type and the severity of the water and soil salinity these losses could be overcome by adopting water and soil management and agronomic practices that are appropriate for local conditions some of the mitigation strategies can be followed to reduce the negative effects of salinity on crop yields including deep irrigation before sowing to migrate the salts from the soil proper leveling of soil to prevent accumulation of salts in elevated areas and mulching and applying organic matter to improve physical properties of soil other mitigation strategies could include increasing leaching salt scraping and piling selecting irrigation system with uniform application and sowing on shoulders of ridges in terms of moderate salinity the crop selection based on salt tolerance is the most significant management decision in mitigating the salinity effect of yield crops different factors also play an important role in soil and water salinity mitigation such as crop variety local climate soil type management practices and irrigation water quality in high salinity situation it is better to use the crops having much higher levels of tolerance than what is currently used the diversification of production systems with high salinity crops is an important adaptation strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of salinity and to sustain farm productivity in high saline water and soil finally in a very high salinity stage introducing biosaline agricultural system is an approach to achieve production from saline land and using saline water resources therefore growing non conventional crops is no longer economical when water and soil are characterized by very high salinity 5 driving forces of salinity in the study area the salinity problem in al batinah area is significant and has been increasing over time utilizing saline water in agricultural practices is considered a common practice in that area al rahbi et al 2019 maf and icba 2012 this practice elevates the problem of salinity over time the primary cause of water salinization in the study area is groundwater overdraft in al batinah governorates the groundwater use was about 54 higher than renewable supplies in 2010 where recharged water is 360 million cubic meters a year mcm compared to 557 mcm water abstraction ahmed and askri 2016 maf and icba 2012 therefore the underground water in storage has been used to meet the water demand and hence it has resulted in reducing groundwater levels the reduction in the groundwater level allows fresh water in the landward side of the irrigation coastal strip to be accelerated from the hills because of the increase in the groundwater gradient however the pumping process flattens or reverses the groundwater gradient to the sea and hence allows for seawater intrusion as pumping process reduces the outflow of groundwater that prevents the flowing of seawater into the aquifer al rahbi et al 2019 kacimov et al 2005 in addition the reduction in the thickness of fresh water reduces the pressure on the deeper seawater wedge and allows it to rise up into the aquifer a primary way to stop the inflow of seawater is to reduce the withdrawal of groundwater which in turn reduces further salinization of the farms using groundwater sana et al 2013 the groundwater salinity has also increased in this area due to climate characteristics and the area s proximity to the sea ahmed and askri 2016 kacimov et al 2005 the climatic conditions in this area are conducive to accumulation of salts in groundwater and on the surface and subsurface of the soil as salt cannot leach down completely therefore the net water movement in the soil remains upward and is associated with the dissolved salts hussain et al 2010 the groundwater evaporates and leaves these salts on the surface area or nearer the underneath these conditions increase the probability of the development of groundwater and soil salinity this process is always active particularly in dry seasons and hence gradually but slowly builds up the saline groundwater and soils another factor that elevates the groundwater salinity in al batinah is its nearness to the sea the area is subject to saline seawater intrusion that increases the salinity of the groundwater furthermore soil salinity increases due to soil formation from minerals high in salty water sprays soluble salt content and saline water floods the salt content is naturally high in a significant part of al batinah soils as these soils were built up from the deposited coastal materials salinity also accumulates when soil is left uncultivated for long periods since the net water movement becomes upward the irrigation for crops diverts the water cycle and salt movement downward and hence it is useful to keep the soils under crop cover munns and gilliham 2015 however in al batinah area water resources are very limited and hence the crop intensity cannot increase this forces the farmers to keep their lands fallow for some part of the year particularly during summers therefore the accumulated salts in subsurface remain recycling and cannot leach very deep or be drained off humans activities induce the secondary type of salinity these activities include cultural practices sewage from residential areas polluted effluents from industries into waterways and soils and irrigation operations and crop sequences in agricultural fields this type of salinity is pronounced in al batinah area al rahbi et al 2019 maf and icba 2012 al mulla 2010 the urbanization is another driving force of groundwater salinity al batinah area has witnessed rapid urban transformation between 1990 and 2018 driven by population growth and economic development the urbanization in this area has spread horizontally as shown in fig 7 the urban area expanded by 138 4 between 1990 and 2000 to cover a total area of 87 33 km2 as shown in table 9 however the rate of expansion retreated between 2000 and 2010 to reach 24 3 whereas the urban area expanded to cover 108 6 km2 by 2010 between 2010 and 2018 al batinah area witnessed a rapid increase in urbanization the area of urbanization increased by 117 3 to cover 235 9 km2 by 2018 most urban expansion took place along the coastal strip where the land is fertile and groundwater wells are extensive the urbanization has increased the probability of discharging treated water from wastewater treatment plants into the groundwater and the soil therefore the urban development in this area has resulted in gradual but consistent increase in salt concentration of groundwater the expansion in urbanization in al batinah area was on the expanse of the vegetation area as shown in table 9 and fig 8 although between 1990 and 2010 the percentage of vegetation area increased in al batinah area the main increase was in the landscape vegetation as the percentage of the farms witnessed reduction due to urbanization and water salinization after 2010 the green areas witnessed a rapid decline until 2018 as shown in table one reason for this phenomenon is that many farmers converted their farms to other types of use mainly residential and commercial areas the agricultural production in the country increased steadily until 1990 and accelerated in 1997 the agricultural production increased from 0 68 million tons in 1985 to 0 7 and 1 23 million tons in 1990 and 1997 respectively maf and icba 2012 however this production decreased by 4 7 nationally in the subsequent years to an average of 1 17 million tons over the period 2006 2010 al batinah governorates accounted for 80 of this reduction maf and icba 2012 water and soil salinization are significant contributors for the loss of cultivated land and productivity in addition the loss of the cultivated area was greater than that provided by new lands brought into production the rising groundwater salinity in al batinah area is a serious threat to the sustainable use of natural resources and economy of the area particularly the agricultural sector the expansion of the agricultural sector in al batinah area accelerated the use of groundwater resources through over pumping this process resulted in disturbing the water balance and seawater intrusion the farms in the upstream areas were irrigated by the wells equipped with pumps and motors or by drilling of deep wells and heavy pumping the aquifer became deficit since the withdrawals were higher than the recharge therefore the salinization process became very active and persistent with no salt control at that time in addition the area witnessed the increasing number of sebkha which are poorly drained depression areas near the coastal areas where salt and water accumulate gradually the salt content in these areas increased as the excessive water either evaporated or drained into the sea as a result the salt affected the agricultural areas and abandoning the farms became a permanent feature and ever increasing phenomenon of the landscape in al batinah plain therefore agricultural practices development and sustainability in this area would not be possible as water and salinity emerged as an extreme problem 6 management strategies some measures were taken by the authorities to control and reduce the level of water salinity such as the control of digging new wells and the rehabilitation of the older ones furthermore the authorities constructed new recharge dams and developed incentives for modern irrigation system however a number of farms have been abandoned due to high salinity levels that were unendurable even to the most salt tolerant crops furthermore the groundwater salinity in al batinah is irreversible due to the existence of depressions in aquifers therefore it has become of paramount importance to develop and implement sufficient and effective groundwater reclamation policies and strategies to prevent any further salinization to sustain agricultural lands and natural ecosystems and manage and monitor groundwater salinity the current situation requires the management techniques that ensure the sustainable use of saline water help in conserving land and water resources and minimize the loss to crops and soil health in agricultural and water sectors the water shortage can result in social and economic difficulties and hence technical and policy changes are needed to avoid these hardships abulibdeh and zaidan 2020 improving water management options is needed as a transition from focusing on augmenting supply this necessity provides the direct service to concentrate on water management and regulation of services allocating water based on the principles of economic efficiency has an advantage of providing objective guidance and developing methods that have built in flexibility to manage differences in water supply and demand these changes require the development of plans that promote demand management integrate water quantity and quality enforce environmental regulations in better and stronger ways decentralize responsibility for delivering water services reform tariffs for water supply irrigation and sanitation and strengthen government agencies seawater intrusion and salinization of groundwater phenomena are inseparable and negatively affect agricultural lands in al batinah area this impact is difficult to be solved without introducing the measures to reduce and eliminate groundwater overdraft managing and mitigating salinity effects require addressing policies and regulations that align with water and environmental conservation furthermore these policies and regulations should halt seawater intrusion by balancing water supply and demand improve management of soil resources and water inputs and adapt agronomy in the salinity affected areas to produce higher yields many of the crops in al batinah area are among low value crops in response to concerns for food security in the country therefore the agricultural sector consumes around 93 of all water use in the country it is important to measure the needed water in terms of its spatiotemporal use and in what quantities it should be done routinely and accurately most of the input data can be defined by regular monitoring and evaluating the groundwater levels this data can define the physical characteristics of the groundwater reservoir the focus should be on those areas where the groundwater system is affected by the seawater intrusion furthermore the soil profile should be determined in these areas to measure how much water and nutrients can be stored for plants use and the portion of water that will likely drain from it to recharge the water table increasing the supply is an expensive approach in addition to its environmental challenges the main source of water in the country is the desalinated water abulibdeh et al 2019b constructing desalination plants to address agricultural water deficits is costly and economically not efficient furthermore constructing dams takes many years and dams are environmentally challenging therefore the better management of the water demand in the agricultural sector is considered the biggest payoff in view of the overwhelming share of agriculture in the excess water demand of this sector the management objective is to mitigate and control seawater intrusion and not to prevent the process itself another challenge is to manage groundwater extraction since most of the groundwater production is private prevent exhausting the resource and manage agricultural trade to reduce agricultural water demand one of the options is to shut down wells in areas that are negatively affected by salinization of soils and seawater intrusion the farmers in the areas affected by seawater intrusion believe they have the access to groundwater by tradition right and very long term usage this ambiguous water right needs a solution that is socially equitable efficient and effective however wells and groundwater are owned by the country the recently constructed wells on new lands are licensed and controlled by the government in addition the government should subsidize most of the pumping equipment and initial capital investment in agricultural wells to encourage the changes in behavior that leads to water conservation and reduction price based approaches can be used to conserve water and use tariffs to transmit information about water scarcity the groundwater users must bear the production cost however groundwater is freely accessible by public however most of the agricultural users receive the subsidized electricity at flat rate tariffs consequently groundwater is severely over exploited and hence groundwater levels fall resulting in the marginalization of many small farmers and those who can afford the larger pumps remain in the business the volume of groundwater pumped can be constrained if measures such as price of the electricity is equivalent to the electricity production cost and thereafter by increasing the block tariff the improvement in agricultural extension services for delivering high quality technical support and advice that farmers need will eventually return a high value to economy by overcoming the threats of dwindling farm productivity due to mismanagement of water and soil resources the farmers should be able to produce competitively and remain in the business vis à vis the cheap imported food and agricultural products biosaline production system is an economically efficient approach in a short to medium term to moderate high salinity areas of al batinah particularly in good quality groundwater areas to rejuvenate soils that have become salinized through poor management the reduction in groundwater utilization will enable the agriculture to be sustained in this area and add important value to economy these strategies carry considerable operational difficulties and should be finetuned considering the costs opportunities benefits and socio political risks the investment in upgrading the on farm irrigation efficiency reuse of treated wastewater and new recharge dams will not be sufficient to slow down the rate of seawater intrusion therefore the overall utilization of groundwater has to be reduced the elements such as the extreme freshwater deficit prevailing in the area and the extensive aridity of centuries do not allow to get rid of salinity one approach to mitigate and manage salinity in this area in an efficient and effective way is using appropriate hydrological agronomic cultural and biological techniques these techniques are evolving particularly for the al batinah area and are adopted by farmers furthermore the support of the adaptation of reliable management techniques requires initiating strong and wise policy decisions some techniques suggested to optimize the salt management and control with a minimum loss to deep percolation include leaching salt periodically reliable estimation of leaching fraction monitoring the salinity of the root zone and water distribution uniformity hussain et al 2010 7 policy implications managing water services may include policies to shift the role of the government to regulator rather than water service provider and make water service deliveries business oriented the authorities must develop a comprehensive water resources management policy to enable assessment planning and regulation of all water using sectors different approaches to better manage and regulate water demand and supply are needed these approaches may include shifting their policies of directly providing water supply services to private sector as services to be provided by private or independently owned utilities managing both the water services delivery and water resources need to be recognized in new legislative changes water resources management could include adopting water friendly agricultural policy that aims to divert resources away from crops that produce low economic returns compared to the high value of water furthermore this approach can adopt a virtual water policy developing and implementing policies and strategies to manage water demand for the agricultural sector should be considered carefully in consideration of the reactions of farmers one of the main issues that has been debated a lot is weather farmers should pay the price of water they consume the farmers in areas that are negatively affected by seawater intrusion have free access to water the seawater intrusion causes a loss of income and sometimes results in farms abandonment therefore there is a strong social economic and environmental debate in favor of water use regulation and pricing implementing the regulation of licensing the new wells in the study area to prevent the construction of new illegal wells in the saline areas of al batinah is significant in reducing water salinity the suggestions have been made to stop agricultural practices and production in highly saline areas and to shift them to new areas of suitable soil and good quality groundwater this can lead to significant increase in farm productivity and incomes a water right can be allocated to each new farm where the use of this water would be monitored furthermore each new farm should be equipped with water supply monitor automated water demand soil sensors and subsidized irrigation equipment the conditional leases should also be proposed as an alternative to ownership so that new farms can maintain a commercial approach in addition rezoning of the farms for housing commercial or tourist facility development is an effective payoff for farmers in saline water coastal areas the subsidies is a means that can aid farmers in the transition process over the short term food security is a major concern in the country and has driven the substantial government investment in irrigation systems furthermore the food security concern has led to subsidies of inputs electricity irrigation technology and pumps and of outputs through price support mechanisms this aims to increase food self sufficiency on the national level in view of the geopolitical tension in the region therefore agricultural policy reform has a potential to reduce the agricultural water demand progressive agricultural policies allow the country to increase the imports of lower value staples and grow those crops more that have a comparative advantage to export furthermore it is also useful to benefit from different approaches that have been taken by other neighboring countries or countries with similar climate soil and agricultural conditions 8 conclusion the salinity in al batinah is a serious problem and it has a negative impact on food security and the economy because of its impact on the agricultural sector therefore it has become of paramount importance to develop and implement sufficient and effective groundwater reclamation policies and strategies to prevent any further salinization to sustain agricultural lands and natural ecosystems and manage and monitor groundwater salinity the current situation requires management techniques that can ensure the sustainable use of saline water help in conserving land and water resources and minimize the losses to crops and soil health different mitigation strategies and management techniques are more appropriate for this arid area these techniques could include the application of organic matter that increases water holding capacity of the soil and decrease evaporation practice of mulching the increased number of seedlings or higher seed rates of crops precision in land leveling to avoid over and under irrigation breaking capillaries by plowing the fields during fallow periods to reduce evaporation and accumulation of salts adjusting irrigation scheduling irrigation depth irrigation frequencies to provide more irrigation water than mere crop requirements appropriate leaching fractions planting on the shoulders of ridges and seed

12003,rapid increase in urban areas due to rise in population and industrialization has increased the demand for water resources further the changing land use pattern due to urban development is affecting the groundwater recharge so forecasting groundwater has become the basic condition for efficient groundwater resource development the technique of artificial neural networks ann which has ability to model the complex water resources problems is used ann is a mathematical model which mimics the working of nerve cells it is capable of recognizing the relationship between the input and output without understanding the physical connection between them in this study an ann model was used to predict the pre and post monsoon groundwater fluctuation at the tikri kalan observation well situated in the west delhi india the model comprises of three layers feed forward network trained with levenberg marquardt lm algorithm and activated with log sigmoid function four different architectural networks are formulated and the optimum one is identified on the performance of statistical indices the architecture of 3 15 1 is found to be generating the best results and can be employed in urban areas for forecasting groundwater fluctuation and managing water resources effectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater level urban prediction land use artificial neural network groundwater hydrology 1 introduction the developing countries have registered a rapid increment in population in the last twenty years for instance the population of india in 1991 was only 846 4 million which increased to 1 21 billion in 2011 census of india coi 2011 in this period the population of delhi reached to 16 7 million from 9 42 million s a d 2012 the increased population in national capital territory of delhi has resulted into the increase in the groundwater exploitation in order to compensate the water supply deficit of 112 million gallons per day mgd shekhar et al 2009 keshari 2014a b the increase in the groundwater draft has led to the decline of groundwater in most parts of delhi over exploitation of groundwater may lead to serious water scarcity environmental and hydrological draught further the urban cities are experiencing significant change in the land use and the increase in the paved surfaces which in turn affect the groundwater recharge the groundwater level monitoring data reveals strong interaction between city growths and groundwater impacts therefore improved understanding of linkages between the city growth and aquifer response is required to enable accurate prediction of groundwater level in urban areas one of the main problem with groundwater prediction is the non availability of the sufficient data especially the detailed multifaceted data for simulating the effects of urban development in such areas an accurate prediction becomes more important rather than conceiving the actual physical relation daliakopoulos et al 2005 smith and eli 1995 tokar and johnson 1999 the literature reveals that in cases when a well defined hydrological relationship cannot be defined artificial neural network ann provides a significant advantage in modeling for systematically converting inputs to outputs nayak et al 2004 morid et al 2007 yadav et al 1995 recently some attempts have been made to predict the groundwater levels using ann coulibaly et al 2001 calibrated three types of functionally different artificial neural network models with a relatively short length of groundwater level records and related it with hydro meteorological data to simulate groundwater table fluctuations in the gondo aquifer burkina daliakopoulos et al 2005 examined the performance of different neural networks in a groundwater level forecasting and identified an optimal ann architecture that can simulate the decreasing trend of the groundwater level in messara valley in crete greece and provided acceptable predictions up to 18 months ahead further nayak et al 2006 used ann to forecast groundwater level in a shallow aquifer similarly zarghami et al 2007 used ann to forecast groundwater level in zahedan city of iran shamsuddin et al 2017 used forward neural network architecture coupled with levenberg marquardt lm algorithm to predicted daily groundwater levels of jenderam hilir selangor malaysia the prediction incorporated river recharge and river bank infiltration on daily groundwater fluctuations kaya et al 2018 predicted monthly groundwater level fluctuations in reyhanli turkey using feed forward back propagation ann adiat et al 2020 predicted the groundwater levels in weathered and fractured aquifer systems of ijebu jesa city of southwestern nigeria the predicted results were verified using geo electrical parameters proving that groundwater level predictions are in agreement with observed data for basement complex terrain iqbal et al 2020 related the groundwater level fluctuations in area between river ravi and river sutlej with the metrological parameters using levenberg marquardt back propagation ann models it is observed that these modelling studies were mostly carried out with the input data of precipitation and temperature thus they do not reflect the urban scenarios as the land use pattern changes in the urban areas changes very rapidly which has a direct impact on the groundwater recharge the present study aims to develop an efficient artificial neural network model for forecasting groundwater levels in urban areas the developed model can be used for simulating the future groundwater levels which will help in water management and resource allocation incorporating the changes in land use and land cover 2 methodology an ann model usually has several layers the first and the last layers are the input and output layers respectively the rest of layers are the hidden layers each layer consists of a different number of nodes artificial neurons the behavior of an ann model depends so on both weight and transfer function among the many functionally different ann models feed forward back propagation neural network trained with levenberg marquardt ffnn lmb algorithm was found to be effective in predicting the monthly groundwater levels sujatha and kumar 2010 daliakopoulos et al 2005 chitsazan et al 2013 the increase in the urban development reduces the amount of water infiltrating into the groundwater chatterjee et al 2009 estimated that the concretization of bare ground and green areas are reducing the infiltration capacity of an area by three to four times so rain infiltration factor considering the effect of the changing bare ground green area with paved area as described in equation 1 is used in estimating the recharge through rainfall 1 1

table rif rain infiltration factor 2 1 ann architecture and activation function the neurons in one layer are connected to neurons in other layers through the weighted interconnections an activation function is applied to the neurons to convert the input signal into an activated value to generate the final output a model which yields the minimum error based on performance indicator while retaining the simple and compact structure is termed as the optimal architecture tawfik et al 1997 the number of hidden layers as well as number of neurons in the hidden layer form the crucial part of successful ann architecture however no unified theory exists for determining such an optimal structure hecht nielsen 1987 and kumar and ray 1997 reported that the neurons of single hidden layer activated with sigmoidal activation function are sufficient to model any hydrological process though many empirical relationships to determine the number of hidden neurons have been suggested by maier and dandy 2000 the best strategy for selecting the appropriate number of neurons in the hidden layer is by a trial and error procedure therefore the selection of architecture has been decided by the exhaustive evaluations of various ann architectures the number of neurons were changed one by one and finalized on the basis of the performance evaluations of results generated by them a feed forward network trained with the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm is used in the present study in a feed forward network the nodes are arranged in layers starting from a first input layer and ending at the final output layer as shown in fig 1 each layer of feed forward has connections to the next layer but they are devoid of any back connections it means they allow the signals to travel in only one direction i e from input to output the levenberg marquardt method also known as damped least square dls method is a standard technique used to solve nonlinear least squares problems the levenberg marquardt method is actually a combination of two minimization methods the gradient descent method and the gauss newton method it acts more like a gradient descent method when the parameters are far from their optimal value and act more like the gauss newton method when the parameters are close to their optimal value galvin 2013 the activation function is usually a nonlinear bounded and piece wise differentiable function gallant 1993 in the present study a sigmoid function as defined in equation 2 is taken as the activation function it is the most commonly used transfer function which exhibits monotonically increasing and continuously differentiable properties 2 ϕ v 1 1 e a v where ϕ is the sigmoid function a is the slope parameter of the sigmoid function υ is output due to linear combination of inputs and bias by varying the parameter a sigmoid functions of different slopes can be obtained 2 2 network training and model performance the most important part of the ann is its ability to learn learning is the process by which a neural network brings changes in the free parameters according to its surrounding environment haykin 1999 karayiannis and venetsanopoulos 1993 a neural network learns about its environment through an iterative process of adjustments applied to interconnected weights and bias in this study error correction learning is utilised to train the network this scheme optimises the connection weights by minimising the error between the output signal and the target response of a neuron in a step by step manner the training begins with random weights and networks then process the input and compare its resulting output against the desired output errors are then propagated back through the system causing the system to adjust the weights which control the network this process occurs over and over as the weights are continually tweaked to get the output with the desired accuracy the computed water level fluctuation during the training process are compared with the observed values of groundwater fluctuation the efficiency of the selected network is measured using the statistical indices mainly root mean square error rmse and coefficient of correlation r2 while the r2 statistic gives the overall performance of the network the value of rmse provides the global goodness of fit the rmse and r2 are defined as 3 rmse t 1 n y c t y obs t 2 n 4 r 2 1 y c t y obs t 2 y obs 2 y c 2 n where yc t indicates the estimated value of groundwater fluctuation at time t yobs t denotes the observed value of groundwater fluctuation at time t and n is the number of observations 3 description of the study area the study area is located in the tikri kalan village in the west delhi as shown in fig 2 it is situated at the border of haryana and delhi and is characterized by the infrastructural development taking place at the fast rate the study area lies between 28 40 45 and 28 41 10 north latitudes and 76 58 23 and 76 58 61 east longitudes covering an area of 98 75 acres the climate of the area is characterized by dryness except during the brief span of monsoon season it has a hot summer and a cold winter the rainy season spans over the period of mid june to september and this is the time period during which the groundwater recharge takes place the delhi region receives normal annual rainfall of 611 8 mm mostly occurring in monsoon season the annual normal rainfall of about 390 mm happens in the west delhi region this region is occupied by unconsolidated quaternary alluvium which comprises of sand clay silt gravels pebbles and kankars as per the experiments the impermeable clay and kankar layer is found to be located upto a depth of 28 m followed by layer of kankar and silt existing upto 52 m below the ground level cgwb 2011 the nct delhi has seen a rapid increase in the urban area in the recent years to accommodate the increasing population the land under the urban area has increased from 685 sq km to 1114 sq km in 1991 2011 groundwater year book nct delhi 2011 fig 3 shows that similar trend is also observed in the tikri kalan town occupying a geographical area of 2 55 sq km infrastructural development has jumped to 70 of total area in the time period of ten years between 2001 and 2011 the study area was predominately an agricultural land before the year 2010 the construction work for the infrastructural growth has started since the year 2010 with the time the large piece of the agricultural land has been replaced by the built up land the water utilization pattern reflects that the whole population of the region is meeting their water needs through groundwater resources there are 13 hydrograph monitoring stations in the west delhi and the hydrograph of observation well located at tikri kalan is considered to be the representation dataset to reflect the effect of infrastructural development on the groundwater level as shown in fig 4 the depth to water level in the tikri kalan observation well from 2003 to 2011 was considered for the analysis the variation of groundwater levels in pre monsoon and post monsoon below the ground water level at tikri kalan observation well is shown in fig 5 4 results and discussions in the present study the data used is the net recharge through rainfall population of the area and change in the paved surface within the study area as shown in table 1 the recharge through rainfall is calculated using the rain infiltration factor method the population is estimated using population density data as reported by government of india s a d 2012 and per head per day consumption is taken from the bis 1172 1993 for computing paved area the land use classification was carried out using arcgis 9 3 1 from the city maps the area corresponding to each land use class is computed to understand the pattern of urban development and increase in the paved area here the groundwater level data for the period 2003 2011 were used in the study the data were processed and outliers were identified the groundwater levels measured for 2003 and 2010 were not taken into consideration for model simulation as they belong to fit to the category of outliers as shown in fig 6 the processed data after removing the outliers were divided into training and testing subsets for the modeling ann the groundwater levels for the period 2004 2007 were used for calibration and the groundwater levels for the period 2008 2011 were used for the validation the lr training algorithm uses the mean square error mse to adjust the synaptic weights in order to minimize the performance function the value of 0 1 was chosen as the goal of the mean square error function thereafter the network is subjected to 100 iterations showing the best training performance of 0 224 as shown in fig 7 four different architecture models were used for forecasting groundwater fluctuations at the tikri kalan observation well the basis of difference was the selection of number of neurons in the hidden layer these neurons were decided on the basis of several tests the output for all the models was taken as water fluctuation it has been found that the 15 neurons in the hidden layer result in the best performance the values of r 2 and rmse for this model architecture are much better than other architectures as shown in table 2 based on these results 3 15 1 architecture of ann is adopted for the present case of prediction of water fluctuation levels in the tikri kalan area west delhi figss 8 and 9 shows the comparison of computed and observed water level fluctuation the coefficient of determination r 2 of the best fit line reflects that the model is able to explain the 82 of the total variation 5 conclusions a feed forward network ann model trained with lm algorithm is formulated for forecasting the water fluctuation at tikri kalan observation well located in the west delhi india recharge change in population and paved area were taken as inputs and the groundwater fluctuation between pre and post monsoon period at observation well of tikri kalan were the output four architectures of ann are formed by varying the number of neurons in the hidden layers the results obtained reveal that the model architecture of 3 15 1 activated with log sigmoid transfer function is the optimum architecture model for predicting the water fluctuation in the urban areas this architecture scores best in the terms of statistical measures therefore the formulated ann structure provides an efficient tool for predicting groundwater fluctuation in the growing urban areas which indirectly help in groundwater policy making declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

in national capital territory of delhi has resulted into the increase in the groundwater exploitation in order to compensate the water supply deficit of 112 million gallons per day mgd shekhar et al 2009 keshari 2014a b the increase in the groundwater draft has led to the decline of groundwater in most parts of delhi over exploitation of groundwater may lead to serious water scarcity environmental and hydrological draught further the urban cities are experiencing significant change in the land use and the increase in the paved surfaces which in turn affect the groundwater recharge the groundwater level monitoring data reveals strong interaction between city growths and groundwater impacts therefore improved understanding of linkages between the city growth and aquifer response is required to enable accurate prediction of groundwater level in urban areas one of the main problem with groundwater prediction is the non availability of the sufficient data especially the detailed multifaceted data for simulating the effects of urban development in such areas an accurate prediction becomes more important rather than conceiving the actual physical relation daliakopoulos et al 2005 smith and eli 1995 tokar and johnson 1999 the literature reveals that in cases when a well defined hydrological relationship cannot be defined artificial neural network ann provides a significant advantage in modeling for systematically converting inputs to outputs nayak et al 2004 morid et al 2007 yadav et al 1995 recently some attempts have been made to predict the groundwater levels using ann coulibaly et al 2001 calibrated three types of functionally different artificial neural network models with a relatively short length of groundwater level records and related it with hydro meteorological data to simulate groundwater table fluctuations in the gondo aquifer burkina daliakopoulos et al 2005 examined the performance of different neural networks in a groundwater level forecasting and identified an optimal ann architecture that can simulate the decreasing trend of the groundwater level in messara valley in crete greece and provided acceptable predictions up to 18 months ahead further nayak et al 2006 used ann to forecast groundwater level in a shallow aquifer similarly zarghami et al 2007 used ann to forecast groundwater level in zahedan city of iran shamsuddin et al 2017 used forward neural network architecture coupled with levenberg marquardt lm algorithm to predicted daily groundwater levels of jenderam hilir selangor malaysia the prediction incorporated river recharge and river bank infiltration on daily groundwater fluctuations kaya et al 2018 predicted monthly groundwater level fluctuations in reyhanli turkey using feed forward back propagation ann adiat et al 2020 predicted the groundwater levels in weathered and fractured aquifer systems of ijebu jesa city of southwestern nigeria the predicted results were verified using geo electrical parameters proving that groundwater level predictions are in agreement with observed data for basement complex terrain iqbal et al 2020 related the groundwater level fluctuations in area between river ravi and river sutlej with the metrological parameters using levenberg marquardt back propagation ann models it is observed that these modelling studies were mostly carried out with the input data of precipitation and temperature thus they do not reflect the urban scenarios as the land use pattern changes in the urban areas changes very rapidly which has a direct impact on the groundwater recharge the present study aims to develop an efficient artificial neural network model for forecasting groundwater levels in urban areas the developed model can be used for simulating the future groundwater levels which will help in water management and resource allocation incorporating the changes in land use and land cover 2 methodology an ann model usually has several layers the first and the last layers are the input and output layers respectively the rest of layers are the hidden layers each layer consists of a different number of nodes artificial neurons the behavior of an ann model depends so on both weight and transfer function among the many functionally different ann models feed forward back propagation neural network trained with levenberg marquardt ffnn lmb algorithm was found to be effective in predicting the monthly groundwater levels sujatha and kumar 2010 daliakopoulos et al 2005 chitsazan et al 2013 the increase in the urban development reduces the amount of water infiltrating into the groundwater chatterjee et al 2009 estimated that the concretization of bare ground and green areas are reducing the infiltration capacity of an area by three to four times so rain infiltration factor considering the effect of the changing bare ground green area with paved area as described in equation 1 is used in estimating the recharge through rainfall 1 1

table rif rain infiltration factor 2 1 ann architecture and activation function the neurons in one layer are connected to neurons in other layers through the weighted interconnections an activation function is applied to the neurons to convert the input signal into an activated value to generate the final output a model which yields the minimum error based on performance indicator while retaining the simple and compact structure is termed as the optimal architecture tawfik et al 1997 the number of hidden layers as well as number of neurons in the hidden layer form the crucial part of successful ann architecture however no unified theory exists for determining such an optimal structure hecht nielsen 1987 and kumar and ray 1997 reported that the neurons of single hidden layer activated with sigmoidal activation function are sufficient to model any hydrological process though many empirical relationships to determine the number of hidden neurons have been suggested by maier and dandy 2000 the best strategy for selecting the appropriate number of neurons in the hidden layer is by a trial and error procedure therefore the selection of architecture has been decided by the exhaustive evaluations of various ann architectures the number of neurons were changed one by one and finalized on the basis of the performance evaluations of results generated by them a feed forward network trained with the levenberg marquardt lm algorithm is used in the present study in a feed forward network the nodes are arranged in layers starting from a first input layer and ending at the final output layer as shown in fig 1 each layer of feed forward has connections to the next layer but they are devoid of any back connections it means they allow the signals to travel in only one direction i e from input to output the levenberg marquardt method also known as damped least square dls method is a standard technique used to solve nonlinear least squares problems the levenberg marquardt method is actually a combination of two minimization methods the gradient descent method and the gauss newton method it acts more like a gradient descent method when the parameters are far from their optimal value and act more like the gauss newton method when the parameters are close to their optimal value galvin 2013 the activation function is usually a nonlinear bounded and piece wise differentiable function gallant 1993 in the present study a sigmoid function as defined in equation 2 is taken as the activation function it is the most commonly used transfer function which exhibits monotonically increasing and continuously differentiable properties 2 ϕ v 1 1 e a v where ϕ is the sigmoid function a is the slope parameter of the sigmoid function υ is output due to linear combination of inputs and bias by varying the parameter a sigmoid functions of different slopes can be obtained 2 2 network training and model performance the most important part of the ann is its ability to learn learning is the process by which a neural network brings changes in the free parameters according to its surrounding environment haykin 1999 karayiannis and venetsanopoulos 1993 a neural network learns about its environment through an iterative process of adjustments applied to interconnected weights and bias in this study error correction learning is utilised to train the network this scheme optimises the connection weights by minimising the error between the output signal and the target response of a neuron in a step by step manner the training begins with random weights and networks then process the input and compare its resulting output against the desired output errors are then propagated back through the system causing the system to adjust the weights which control the network this process occurs over and over as the weights are continually tweaked to get the output with the desired accuracy the computed water level fluctuation during the training process are compared with the observed values of groundwater fluctuation the efficiency of the selected network is measured using the statistical indices mainly root mean square error rmse and coefficient of correlation r2 while the r2 statistic gives the overall performance of the network the value of rmse provides the global goodness of fit the rmse and r2 are defined as 3 rmse t 1 n y c t y obs t 2 n 4 r 2 1 y c t y obs t 2 y obs 2 y c 2 n where yc t indicates the estimated value of groundwater fluctuation at time t yobs t denotes the observed value of groundwater fluctuation at time t and n is the number of observations 3 description of the study area the study area is located in the tikri kalan village in the west delhi as shown in fig 2 it is situated at the border of haryana and delhi and is characterized by the infrastructural development taking place at the fast rate the study area lies between 28 40 45 and 28 41 10 north latitudes and 76 58 23 and 76 58 61 east longitudes covering an area of 98 75 acres the climate of the area is characterized by dryness except during the brief span of monsoon season it has a hot summer and a cold winter the rainy season spans over the period of mid june to september and this is the time period during which the groundwater recharge takes place the delhi region receives normal annual rainfall of 611 8 mm mostly occurring in monsoon season the annual normal rainfall of about 390 mm happens in the west delhi region this region is occupied by unconsolidated quaternary alluvium which comprises of sand clay silt gravels pebbles and kankars as per the experiments the impermeable clay and kankar layer is found to be located upto a depth of 28 m followed by layer of kankar and silt existing upto 52 m below the ground level cgwb 2011 the nct delhi has seen a rapid increase in the urban area in the recent years to accommodate the increasing population the land under the urban area has increased from 685 sq km to 1114 sq km in 1991 2011 groundwater year book nct delhi 2011 fig 3 shows that similar trend is also observed in the tikri kalan town occupying a geographical area of 2 55 sq km infrastructural development has jumped to 70 of total area in the time period of ten years between 2001 and 2011 the study area was predominately an agricultural land before the year 2010 the construction work for the infrastructural growth has started since the year 2010 with the time the large piece of the agricultural land has been replaced by the built up land the water utilization pattern reflects that the whole population of the region is meeting their water needs through groundwater resources there are 13 hydrograph monitoring stations in the west delhi and the hydrograph of observation well located at tikri kalan is considered to be the representation dataset to reflect the effect of infrastructural development on the groundwater level as shown in fig 4 the depth to water level in the tikri kalan observation well from 2003 to 2011 was considered for the analysis the variation of groundwater levels in pre monsoon and post monsoon below the ground water level at tikri kalan observation well is shown in fig 5 4 results and discussions in the present study the data used is the net recharge through rainfall population of the area and change in the paved surface within the study area as shown in table 1 the recharge through rainfall is calculated using the rain infiltration factor method the population is estimated using population density data as reported by government of india s a d 2012 and per head per day consumption is taken from the bis 1172 1993 for computing paved area the land use classification was carried out using arcgis 9 3 1 from the city maps the area corresponding to each land use class is computed to understand the pattern of urban development and increase in the paved area here the groundwater level data for the period 2003 2011 were used in the study the data were processed and outliers were identified the groundwater levels measured for 2003 and 2010 were not taken into consideration for model simulation as they belong to fit to the category of outliers as shown in fig 6 the processed data after removing the outliers were divided into training and testing subsets for the modeling ann the groundwater levels for the period 2004 2007 were used for calibration and the groundwater levels for the period 2008 2011 were used for the validation the lr training algorithm uses the mean square error mse to adjust the synaptic weights in order to minimize the performance function the value of 0 1 was chosen as the goal of the mean square error function thereafter the network is subjected to 100 iterations showing the best training performance of 0 224 as shown in fig 7 four different architecture models were used for forecasting groundwater fluctuations at the tikri kalan observation well the basis of difference was the selection of number of neurons in the hidden layer these neurons were decided on the basis of several tests the output for all the models was taken as water fluctuation it has been found that the 15 neurons in the hidden layer result in the best performance the values of r 2 and rmse for this model architecture are much better than other architectures as shown in table 2 based on these results 3 15 1 architecture of ann is adopted for the present case of prediction of water fluctuation levels in the tikri kalan area west delhi figss 8 and 9 shows the comparison of computed and observed water level fluctuation the coefficient of determination r 2 of the best fit line reflects that the model is able to explain the 82 of the total variation 5 conclusions a feed forward network ann model trained with lm algorithm is formulated for forecasting the water fluctuation at tikri kalan observation well located in the west delhi india recharge change in population and paved area were taken as inputs and the groundwater fluctuation between pre and post monsoon period at observation well of tikri kalan were the output four architectures of ann are formed by varying the number of neurons in the hidden layers the results obtained reveal that the model architecture of 3 15 1 activated with log sigmoid transfer function is the optimum architecture model for predicting the water fluctuation in the urban areas this architecture scores best in the terms of statistical measures therefore the formulated ann structure provides an efficient tool for predicting groundwater fluctuation in the growing urban areas which indirectly help in groundwater policy making declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
12004,in the past two decades addis ababa city has been under continuous demand of additional water supply improvement due to critical shortage of supply became particularly a serious problem at the outskirts of topographically high places in order to overcome the existing problem groundwater development optioned as emergency water supply project however the development continued without giving attention to its sustainability and now takes about 63 of the share over the last decade many well fields have been drilled akaki legedadi legetafo ayat south ayat north fanta and addis ababa pocket areas in the same watershed that have an area about 1490 km2 the main objective of this study was to assess the groundwater hydrodynamics and sustainable utilization of the sources for the study 166 deep borehole completion and pumping test well fields within and around addis ababa were used from the analysis it was found that hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity in the watershed vary from 0 02 to 256 m day and 5 4 101 to 2 16 104 m2 day respectively the major aquifers are fractured scoriaceous basalt scoria fractured ignimbrite or a combination of these rocks analysis of water level contour map for akaki well field indicated that 84 50 of the current pumping water levels were below the dynamic water level in particular old akaki well field has been severely depleted out of 24 drilled wells 13 of them are abandoned as water level and discharge have significantly declined despite huge importance of groundwater it has been understood poorly and undervalued it is a finite resource and the aquifers can become depleted as this extraction rates which exceed recharge rates therefore groundwater management should be practiced through reliable aquifer characterization

specific capacity conductivity and transmissivity storativity 1 introduction addis ababa is a big city that demands large volume of water supply for domestic commercial industrial and institutional use in the past two decades the city has been under continuous demand of additional water supply source improvement due to critical shortage of supply became particularly a serious problem at the outskirts at topographically high places in order to overcome the existing problem groundwater development optioned as emergency water supply project the addis ababa water sewerage authority aawsa in 1999 planned stage iii water of supply program to have more water sources in the coming 20 years to produce a total of about 813 500 cubic meters of water per day out of this the groundwater in akaki well field is expected to produce 125 000 cubic meters of water per day while the surface water from sibilu and gerbi dams could have a supply of 115 500 and 77 000 cubic meter of water per day respectively aawsa 2000 at this time the groundwater development planned were a south west and west of akaki well field areas b legedadi legetafo ayat and surrounding areas c south ayat north fanta well field and surrounding areas d sebeta tefki and surrounding areas wwdse 2008 shortage of water supply in the city is due to high population growth and increased demand for water uses most areas specially found at the outskirts of the city and those at topographically high places are under serious problem of water supply in general only rare places are getting water supply continuously for 24 h in the city it is common to see people waiting for water at water points in the city in order to overcome the existing problem groundwater development is highly implemented without giving attention to its sustainability groundwater sustainability is commonly defined as groundwater development in a manner that can be maintained throughout entire hydrologic system for an indefinite time without causing unacceptable environmental economic or social consequences it is clear that both groundwater quantity and quality must be considered based on this definition of sustainability the sustainability of a groundwater pumping activity in terms of quantity alone i e the hydraulic sustainability is ultimately possible only if the balance or equilibrium can be established in the groundwater system under the pumping regime a groundwater utilization system is sustainable only when pumping as an additional discharge term imposed on a natural system which was originally in a state of equilibrium is balanced by the sum of increases in recharge and decreases in natural discharge in practical terms increases in recharge or decreases in natural discharge can rarely be identified confirmed or quantified without a detailed analysis of the original flow regime as it exists under pumping and the process of transition between them again in practical terms such an analysis and assessment of impact of different groundwater development scenarios can only be done through simulation zhou 2009 accurate water balance and information on groundwater dynamics are important bases for assessment of sustainability of groundwater resources at a basin scale alley et al 1999 2004 most of these studies were designed to evaluate the groundwater system and to develop an understanding of its evolution in response to pumpage against the overall background of serious water shortages and deterioration of ecological systems groundwater sustainability has become the central concept guiding the development and management of aquifer system therefore the main objective of this research was to study the groundwater hydrodynamics and sustainability of the addis ababa city aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the akaki catchment is located in central ethiopia along the western margin of the main ethiopian rift valley enclosed within the geographical co ordinate of 8 44 53 8 to 9 13 18 n latitude and 38 34 15 08 to 39 04 01 9 e longitude it is bounded to the north by the entoto ridge system to the west by menagesha mountain and the wechecha volcanic range to the south by mt bilbilo and mt guji to the southeast by the gara bushu hills to the southwest by mt furi and to the east by the mt yerer volcanic center see fig 1 2 1 1 temperature the maximum temperature of addis ababa ranges between 210c in the wet season to 250c in the dry season while the minimum falls between 6 70c 110c in the year as shown in fig 2 2 1 2 rainfall the annual rainfall average of the watershed was estimated to 1149 10 mm by simple athematic mean method the minimum and maximum rainfalls in the watershed are 6 80 and 288 31 mm which occurred during the months of january and august respectively as shown in fig 3 2 1 3 hydrogeomorphology the topography is rugged and steep mostly between entoto and filwuha but it is gentle and flat lying in south and southwest parts of the catchment the surface water reservoir legadadi and dire found in this catchment and they are the major water supply to addis ababa city the presences of massive fractured and porous units at different depths produce a multi layer aquifer system in the big and small akaki river catchments as shown in fig 4 2 2 groundwater well fields within addis ababa city aquifer all the well fields developed by addis ababa city water supply and sewerage authority are located in this catchment average depth of the wells is about 479 m the upper casing diameter designed is 14in and the lower casing diameter is 8in the average screen length of the wells is 144 m akaki well field which includes different phases of groundwater developments old akaki akaki phase i akaki phase ii akaki phase iiia and akaki phase iiib there are also pocket well fields located in south and south west of addis ababa in oromia regional state wwdse 2011 2 2 1 geology and geological structure of the study area owing to its location along the western margin of the main ethiopian rift the geological history of the akaki catchment is an integral part of the evolution and development of the ethiopian plateau and the rift system the catchment is covered by volcanic rocks overlain by fluvial and residual soils in which black cotton soils are predominant varying in thickness from a few centimeters to about 20 m aawsa 2000 the geology at regional level was described here from akaki beseka geological map sheet of a nc 37 14 prepared at a scale of 1 250 000 by geological survey of ethiopia which covers an area of 18 000 km2 the major lithological formations within the catchment as taken from this map sheet are shown in fig 5 the area is highly tectonized and is complex in structure because its nearness to the main ethiopian rift or its margin different geomorphic features align mostly to the ne sw direction which is parallel to the structure of the rift or rift margin most of these lineaments are observed in all units as interpreted from the digital elevation model and maximum length estimated is about 5 km most of the faults are trending in ne se direction and cut the entire unit joints and fracture are openings in a rock along which there is no observable movement the lengths of the structures vary between few centimeters to several meters in some places they are oriented normal to the flow banking and are parallel to each other 2 3 aquifer hydraulic properties aquifer hydraulic properties were determined from 166 deep borehole completion and pumping test data for each well located in the study area the aquifer pumping test is a frequently employed in situ method which is used to determine the hydraulic properties of water bearing formations the test involves putting an artificial stress on the aquifer by continuously pumping water from the borehole and measuring water level changes in the pumped well the change in hydraulic head can then be used to estimate the hydraulic properties of the aquifer transmissivity hydraulic conductivity and specific capacity hydraulic properties of the wells were analyzed from the collected pumping test data in order to understand the characteristic and variation within different aquifers in the watershed 2 3 1 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity k defines the rate of flow of water through a porous medium such as a soil or aquifer it is the constant of proportionality in darcy s law and as such is defined as the flow volume per unit cross sectional area of porous medium under the influence of a unit hydraulic gradient it is the volume of water flowing through a cross sectional area of an aquifer the hydraulic conductivity data value was classified to understand the variation within different aquifers in the watershed based on domenico and schwartz 1990 the hydraulic conductivity variation result within the study watershed was mapped using arcgis fig 7 table 1 shows representative values of hydraulic conductivity for various unconsolidated sedimentary materials sedimentary rocks and fractured crystalline rocks domenico and schwartz 1990 2 3 2 transmissivity transmissivity t of an aquifer measures how much water can be transmitted horizontally it is the product of the hydraulic conductivity times the thickness of the aquifer driscoll 1986 transmissivity t is a hydraulic parameter of an aquifer that is employed in most groundwater flow equations to understand the flow dynamics and is generally estimated from pumping tests freeze and cherry 1979 transmissivity t is actually equal to hydraulic conductivity k times aquifer thickness b or otherwise denoted as 1 t k b for characterization of rocks as a water conductivity media transmissivity is a major property fatoba et al 2014 it can be deduced that groundwater flow potential increases as transmissivity and permeability hydraulic conductivity increases in order to categorize the potential of groundwater for different use the transmissivity value of aquifer was employed by krasny 1993 to classify the aquifer based on transmissivity occurring in different aquifers the whole range of possible transmissivity values were separated into six classes representing the orders of transmissivity magnitude introduced by krasny 1993 as shown in table 2 2 3 3 specific capacity specific capacity of a well is the yield of a well per unit of drawdown usually expressed as cubic meters per day per m m3 day m after a given time has elapsed dividing the yield of a well by the drawdown when each is measured at the same time gives the specific capacity specific capacity generally varies with duration of pumping as pumping time increases specific capacity decreases driscoll 1986 the higher the transmissivity of the aquifer the greater is its capability to move water and the lower the drawdown in the well domenico and schwartz 1990 considered the specific capacity as the accepted standard when comparing the strength of one well versus another 2 4 analysis of groundwater hydrodynamics groundwater evaluation was made to estimate the response to potential inflow and outflow of water from underlying aquifer this was mainly to evaluate the change in water level and yield decline with time in the well field the determination of spatial effects of pumping on the aquifer was the main task analysis of periodic and continuous monitoring of water level was made to obtain information about changes of ground water flow over space and time in the well field of the watershed so the groundwater data and the rainfall recharge data important for their long term pattern and interpreted graphically to understand the dynamics of the groundwater level and recharge from rainfall thus hydrographs of groundwater responding to well pumping or groundwater abstraction and natural groundwater recharge in the basin indicate the water table fluctuation wtf in order to analyze the groundwater dynamics of the watershed basically the response of natural recharge versus the groundwater withdrawal of the watershed have to be determined domenico and schwartz 1990 2 i o δ s where i inflow o outflow s storage 2 4 1 spatial and temporal variations of water level in akaki watershed borehole data of 166 were collected from different wells out of these wells akaki well field akaki well field i ii and iii were monitored for temporal variation of water level and discharge the wells were being monitored by ethiopian construction design supervision works corporation since june 2012 the number of monitored wells and the frequency of monitoring increased markedly up to 2018 in 2012 the monitoring of water level by data logger connected to supervisory control and data acquisition scada system was started on 17 boreholes of akaki well field i or akaki phase ii water supply project additional monitoring was started on 16 and 24 wells of akaki well field ii akaki phase iiia water supply project and akaki well field iii akaki phase iiib water supply project respectively water level response to pumping pwl and water level rise upon pump not working were all identified from the scada and analyzed with respect to static water level swl and dynamic water level dwl hydraulic head measurements were essential pieces of information that are required for characterizing groundwater flow systems i e direction and hydraulic gradient of flow determining hydraulic properties of aquifers i e conductivity k transmissivity t and storativity s and evaluating the influence of pumping on water levels in a region piezometers were used to measure the hydraulic head at distinct points in saturated regions of the subsurface and it is the level to which water rises in the piezometer with reference to a datum such as sea level a pumping test is a field experiment in which a well is pumped at a controlled rate and water level response drawdown is measured in one or more surrounding observation wells piezometers and optionally in the pumped well control well itself response data from pumping tests are used to estimate the hydraulic properties of aquifers evaluate well performance and identify aquifer boundaries therefore pumping test was conducted to determine the sustainable yield of a borehole that basically based on the behavior of drawdowns observed during a hydraulic performance also known as a pumping test of the borehole through an appropriate conceptual model dynamic water level is the level when well becoming stabilized or there is no more drawdown to be created with the specific pumping rate the reference data for conducting analysis of the groundwater hydrodynamics is the pumping test data the data was analyzed for each well to determine the well hydraulic properties that determine the sustainable pumping or withdrawal rate without creating groundwater deterioration depletion the static water level shows the hydraulic head at that point with reference to the highest point of the watershed the well drawdown determined during pumping test is an indicator and reference for water level trend analysis the data showed that the water levels of some wells are dropped below the dynamic water level and the others are very close to the dynamic water level due to prolonged pumping or over exploitation of groundwater the water level could drop below the determined dynamic water level the main goal of this study was to analyze changes in groundwater well levels after development of large number of wells for addis water supply 2012 2019 thus from the data of 166 wells the water table contour map was generated from the static dynamic and recorded current water level of each of the well water level contour and raster maps are a graphic representation to analyze trend of the change of the water level during the use of wells through pumping water the hydraulic gradients which can be directly derived from these maps are the basis for calculating the rate of groundwater flow through cross sections de ridder 1980 2 4 2 spatial and temporal variations of yield the recorded yield data determined using pumping test were used to analyze the trend the analysis was made for akaki well field since both water level and discharge were monitored the daily record of yield converted to monthly data by arithmetic average of the value and trend shown graphically 2 5 analysis of sustainability of groundwater utilization the amount of groundwater abstraction from the well field was determined with respect to the annual recharge potential within the catchment area the average water level fluctuation data indicated the trend of water table from this result the net abstraction and recharge to groundwater storage was used to evaluate the sustainability of aquifer utilization safe yield and groundwater mining are terms often used in water resources analysis safe yield is the idea that groundwater development can be sustained as long as the amount of groundwater withdrawn by pumping does not exceed the amount recharged to the aquifer by precipitation the natural recharge rate is an important factor in determining the amount of natural discharge of a system and the relative amount of water available in the water budget but the idea of safe yield can lead to erroneously conclude that there is a specific pumping rate for which the impacts of development will be non depleting groundwater mining is also referring to the careful and planned withdrawal of quality water for the users without damaging the aquifer the aquifer has to sustain its quality for future development with proper groundwater mining the net extraction outflows induced by humans pumping wells minus recharge to the same aquifer is used as an indicator of human stress on the aquifer and used to determine whether the utilization is sustainable or not the analysis uses the conceptual understating of the effect of different inputs of groundwater components on the storage therefore the amount groundwater levels dropped in the past seven years were analyzed to evaluate the utilization 3 results and discussion 3 1 aquifer hydraulic properties the major groundwater hydraulic properties transmissivity hydraulic conductivity and specific capacity variations within the watershed were analyzed with respect to lithological type and location as interpolated and mapped with the help of arcgis the values of aquifer hydraulic properties showed significant variation fig 6 hydraulic conductivity in the watershed varies from 0 02 to 256 m day primary and secondary porosity and permeability of the main water bearing geologic units volcanic rocks plays most important role for these hydraulic conductivities variation these variations are particularly the result of fractures and its interconnection within basalt ignimbrite and other volcanic rocks as the lithological log of the wells exhibited the hydraulic conductivity result indicated most of the central part of the watershed and the gentle to flat areas are characterized by relatively less hydraulic conductivity value on the other hand the areas close to the watershed boundary which relatively steep topography have relatively higher hydraulic conductivity these latter areas are close to recharge zones of the watershed the hydraulic conductivities data values of the study area were classified based on the domenico and schwartz 1990 aquifer classification this classification was used to understand the lithological characteristic of the water bearing formations accordingly the aquifer materials can be categorized under permeable basalt and fractured igneous rock the major aquifers of the watershed are fractured basalt scoriaceous basalt scoria fractured ignimbrite or a combination of these materials which could comply with the above classification in the watershed the transmissivities of the wells were also mapped with the help of interpolation made with idw using gis it is the other hydraulic properties of aquifer which measure the capability of the aquifer to transmit groundwater through a 1 m wide band over its full depth fig 7 the transmissivity result of the aquifers varies between 5 4 101m2 day and 2 16 104m2 day the result indicates that lower value of transmissivity value on the relatively gentle slope area than steep areas near the boundary of the watershed in addition the results indicate a relatively higher transmissivity value of the fractured basalt and scoriaceous basalt than that of fractured ignimbrite according to krasny 1993 the aquifer of the well fields can be categorized as intermediate to very high transmissivity based on this analysis the groundwater could be planned for regional importance as far as recharge and withdrawal balance to each other the higher transmissivity of the aquifer the greater in its capability to move water and the lower the drawdown in the well specific capacity sc is another hydraulic property of aquifer that determined from the physical properties and described as the ratio of discharge q to steady drawdown s it characterizes the capacity of an aquifer to release groundwater from storage in response to a decline in hydraulic head if the discharge during the pumping test is constant then the specific capacity should vary with time as far as there is drawdown the specific capacity of the well decreases with time as pumping time increases norman 1971 domenico and schwartz 1990 considered the specific capacity as the accepted standard when comparing the strength of one well versus another the map generated for the watershed indicates that akaki well fields and lla have relatively higher specific capacity than others in the well fields fig 8 during pumping test as pumping time increases specific capacity decreases which implies with constant rate of pumping the drawdown continuously increases under the water level stabilizes as per the data analysis a general decrease in specific capacity observed from the pumping wells of akaki well fields the drawdown is with subsequent decrease of discharge the analyzed dynamic water levels and estimated safe yields were not sustained for the well fields most of the akaki wells show a decreasing trend of yield with comparable decline of water level the specific capacities are continuously changing not only as the result of drawdown but also due to discharge deterioration for most wells in the well field this is the result of well interference that means the lateral extent of the aquifer is limited to produce the first determined discharge generally the hydraulic conductivity strongly correlates to the transmissivity value in akaki well field than the rest of the well fields in the watershed areas of higher hydraulic conductivity are closely fit with high transmissivity area and vice versa these indicate that the lithological unit aquifer is strongly heterogeneous within the entire catchment than akaki well field in addition the higher the transmissivity of the aquifer the greater is its capability to move water and the lower the drawdown in the well thus it observed from the map that more or less similar area having higher values of transmissivity have higher value specific capacity 3 2 water level analysis a water table contour map was produced to show the elevation and configuration of the water table on a certain period to construct the water level data from the form of subsurface was converted to the form of water table elevation equal to water level height above a datum plane these data were then changed to raster map that indicates the elevation of the water table in the watershed fig 9 this study employed gis based interpolation techniques for geospatial analysis of ground water trend analysis akaki well field water level decreased because of stress as the result of current groundwater withdrawal water level maps that show spatial variations of static and dynamic water level were generated for the entire akaki watershed based on the data obtained from the pumping test the water level fluctuations were analyzed along three cross sections of the generated map these cross sections were selected along relatively substantial borehole density from upstream to downstream part of akaki well field as specified in method and analysis the major work was to evaluate the water level of akaki well field that equipped with water level measurement the first profile lies between two points a 501231 3 e 1011100 1n and b 466984 7e 970500 1n that has estimated distance about 53 1 km fig 10 the minimum maximum and average static water level along this cross section was 13 79 and 40 8 m below ground surface similarly the minimum maximum and average dynamic water levels were 16 3 90 5 52 8 m respectively table 3 in general the evaluation of the pumping water level indicates that minimum maximum and average water level drop of 3 74 43 86 23 46 m were created against the proposed sustainable dynamic water level due to groundwater over exploitation table 4 the second profile lies between two points d 501977 4e 1010595 2n and g 470437 1e 970101 2n that has estimated distance about 33 8 km fig 11 the minimum maximum and average static water level along this second cross section was 13 79 and 40 8 m below ground surface similarly the minimum maximum and average dynamic water levels were 13 23 18 22 66 84 m respectively table 3 likewise the evaluation of the pumping water level along this cross section indicates that minimum maximum and average water level drop of 26 58 70 22 23 70 m were created against the proposed sustainable dynamic water level due groundwater over exploitation table 4 to make the analysis more consistent third profile was selected which lies between two points p 476628 7e 1005612 1n to q 471294e 969983 4n that has estimated distance about 36 km fig 12 the minimum maximum and average static water levels along this cross section were 5 78 156 3 and 54 32 m below ground surface the minimum maximum and average dynamic water levels were 3 7 105 8 54 6 m respectively table 3 in addition the current pumping water level was evaluated along the same profile in this akaki well field and the estimated values of the minimum maximum and average pumping water level in the well field are 2 03 177 31 38 69 m with respect to the proposed dynamic water level table 4 see figs 13 15 the current water levels map of akaki well field were mapped to show the detailed contour of the water levels the detailed data of water levels were at akaki well field site the arithmetic mean of akaki well field water level from individual wells water level measurement indicated that 81 4 of current pumping water level are below the dynamic water level out of the analyzed water level only 18 6 are in good condition that the pumping water levels are above the dynamic water level table 5 the evaluation from the water level mapping showed that 84 50 of the pumping water levels were below the dynamic water level and only 15 5 are in good condition that the pumping water levels are above the dynamic water level the main task here was to analyze the water level fluctuation on the deep groundwater generally the fluctuation of groundwater level is different in magnitude depending on the extraction and recharge in different locations however the cause of fluctuations in case of akaki well field couldn t recharge dominant fluctuation by recharge is most applicable in areas with shallow water table that display sharp raises and declines following rainfall events the method should work best for wells that show a relatively rapid water level rise in relation to the rate that water moves away from the water table one of the important reasons to propose and analyze the drawdown dynamic water and other hydraulic parameter of a well is to understand the well performance and propose its sustainable use the decline of the water level is an indicator of the water pumping from storage 3 3 groundwater sustainable utilization the amount of groundwater abstraction from the well field determined with respect to the annual recharge potential within the catchment area utilization of an aquifer implies the removal of sizable volumes of groundwater and this changes the aquifer s natural recharge and discharge patterns net recharges in akaki basin were estimated between 51 5 and 81 mm which help the analysis of trend of the current of groundwater use from the above two figures the average recharge is 66 25 mm the total volume of recharge to akaki watershed therefore calculated to be about 99 mm3 year the estimated total volume of recharge on abay plateau that considered for groundwater inflow is 77 mm3 year the annual design and planned groundwater withdrawal from the different well fields of the akaki watershed that yet connected to the supply system is about 414 000m3 day the maximum actual production from these water supply projects were 348 200m3 day the production now significantly decreases to 281 970m3 day table 6 currently there are two big projects under construction south ayat north fanta and legedadi legetafo ayata ii lla ii their sources were developed and tested to supply together about 154 000m3 day with this design discharge as the base and using the trend of production of the connected sources above the expected maximum and optimum production are forecasted to be 115 500 and 77 000m3 day respectively table 7 in addition to the above aawsa water supply projects the productions of 387 wells those owned by oromia cities and rural villages including private wells were analyzed the average design discharges were estimated from the individual well discharges the production tend of these wells were forecasted to the current scenario of aawsa wells as given the table table 8 the design production and current groundwater withdrawal from the watershed are estimated to be 688 181 76 and 419 060 88 m3 day respectively however when the two projects under construction by aawsa are completed the groundwater design production and average withdrawal are increased to be 842 181 76 and 496 060 88 m3 day see table 9 at this stage the sustainability issue should have to get attention because groundwater pumping or taking from storage without equivalent recharge lead to the depletion of the source under such conditions groundwater pumping upsets the dynamic equilibrium of a natural system the water budget changes over time as the system responds to the stress with time the mining phase gives way to a transitional phase in which the effects of pumping spread throughout the hydrologic system and leads to depletion of the resources ground water extraction modifies the groundwater flows to satisfy pumping rates groundwater storage decreases as water is released from storage the groundwater system converges toward a new equilibrium constrained by the capture of available water sources where capture refers to decreased discharge of the wells these have great effect on the working condition of the submersible pumps and the supply system network most transmission mains are working under efficiency in addition because of the decrease in discharge and water level decline addis ababa water supply and sewerage authority was forced to lower the pump position of 11 wells rehabilitation of 7 wells and abandoning of 26 wells moreover other 22 wells are not operational and require pump pullout to identify the problems in general the existing situation is worst in the case old akaki well fields where 13 wells are totally abandoned in this well field other replacement wells known as koyefeche water supply wells were drilled but indicated significant water level decline in six months operation due to over abstraction 4 conclusion and recommendation 4 1 conclusion the hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity in the watershed vary from 0 02 m day to 256 m day and 5 4 101m2 day to 2 16 104m2 day respectively these variations are particularly the result of fractures and its interconnection within basalt ignimbrite and other volcanic rocks as the lithological log of the wells exhibited central part of the watershed and the gentle to flat areas are characterized by relatively less hydraulic conductivity transmissivity but the values are higher close to the watershed boundary on relatively steep topography in addition the results indicate a relatively higher hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values for fractured and scoriaceous weathered basalt than that of fractured ignimbrite generally the hydraulic conductivity strongly correlates to the transmissivity value in akaki well field than the rest of the well fields in the watershed major aquifers of the watershed are fractured basalt scoriaceous basalt scoria fractured ignimbrite or a combination of these water bearing formations the map generated for the watershed indicates that akaki well fields and lla have relatively higher specific capacity than others in the well fields however the akaki well fields are with significant water level drawdown and discharge deterioration because intense water pumping and also wells are relatively close to each other over pumping which lead to water level and discharge decline of akaki well field is similar in value for most of the wells in the well field in other words most the wells show a decreasing trend of yield with comparable similar decline of water level the specific capacities are continuously changing not only as the result of drawdown but also due to heavy discharge for most wells in the well field this is the result of well interference in which lateral extent of the aquifer is limited to produce the estimated safe yield the water level fluctuations were analyzed along three cross sections of the water level contour map generated accordingly level mapping showed that 84 50 of the pumping water levels were below the dynamic water level and only 15 5 are in good condition that the pumping water levels are above the dynamic water level

12004,in the past two decades addis ababa city has been under continuous demand of additional water supply improvement due to critical shortage of supply became particularly a serious problem at the outskirts of topographically high places in order to overcome the existing problem groundwater development optioned as emergency water supply project however the development continued without giving attention to its sustainability and now takes about 63 of the share over the last decade many well fields have been drilled akaki legedadi legetafo ayat south ayat north fanta and addis ababa pocket areas in the same watershed that have an area about 1490 km2 the main objective of this study was to assess the groundwater hydrodynamics and sustainable utilization of the sources for the study 166 deep borehole completion and pumping test well fields within and around addis ababa were used from the analysis it was found that hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity in the watershed vary from 0 02 to 256 m day and 5 4 101 to 2 16 104 m2 day respectively the major aquifers are fractured scoriaceous basalt scoria fractured ignimbrite or a combination of these rocks analysis of water level contour map for akaki well field indicated that 84 50 of the current pumping water levels were below the dynamic water level in particular old akaki well field has been severely depleted out of 24 drilled wells 13 of them are abandoned as water level and discharge have significantly declined despite huge importance of groundwater it has been understood poorly and undervalued it is a finite resource and the aquifers can become depleted as this extraction rates which exceed recharge rates therefore groundwater management should be practiced through reliable aquifer characterization

specific capacity conductivity and transmissivity storativity 1 introduction addis ababa is a big city that demands large volume of water supply for domestic commercial industrial and institutional use in the past two decades the city has been under continuous demand of additional water supply source improvement due to critical shortage of supply became particularly a serious problem at the outskirts at topographically high places in order to overcome the existing problem groundwater development optioned as emergency water supply project the addis ababa water sewerage authority aawsa in 1999 planned stage iii water of supply program to have more water sources in the coming 20 years to produce a total of about 813 500 cubic meters of water per day out of this the groundwater in akaki well field is expected to produce 125 000 cubic meters of water per day while the surface water from sibilu and gerbi dams could have a supply of 115 500 and 77 000 cubic meter of water per day respectively aawsa 2000 at this time the groundwater development planned were a south west and west of akaki well field areas b legedadi legetafo ayat and surrounding areas c south ayat north fanta well field and surrounding areas d sebeta tefki and surrounding areas wwdse 2008 shortage of water supply in the city is due to high population growth and increased demand for water uses most areas specially found at the outskirts of the city and those at topographically high places are under serious problem of water supply in general only rare places are getting water supply continuously for 24 h in the city it is common to see people waiting for water at water points in the city in order to overcome the existing problem groundwater development is highly implemented without giving attention to its sustainability groundwater sustainability is commonly defined as groundwater development in a manner that can be maintained throughout entire hydrologic system for an indefinite time without causing unacceptable environmental economic or social consequences it is clear that both groundwater quantity and quality must be considered based on this definition of sustainability the sustainability of a groundwater pumping activity in terms of quantity alone i e the hydraulic sustainability is ultimately possible only if the balance or equilibrium can be established in the groundwater system under the pumping regime a groundwater utilization system is sustainable only when pumping as an additional discharge term imposed on a natural system which was originally in a state of equilibrium is balanced by the sum of increases in recharge and decreases in natural discharge in practical terms increases in recharge or decreases in natural discharge can rarely be identified confirmed or quantified without a detailed analysis of the original flow regime as it exists under pumping and the process of transition between them again in practical terms such an analysis and assessment of impact of different groundwater development scenarios can only be done through simulation zhou 2009 accurate water balance and information on groundwater dynamics are important bases for assessment of sustainability of groundwater resources at a basin scale alley et al 1999 2004 most of these studies were designed to evaluate the groundwater system and to develop an understanding of its evolution in response to pumpage against the overall background of serious water shortages and deterioration of ecological systems groundwater sustainability has become the central concept guiding the development and management of aquifer system therefore the main objective of this research was to study the groundwater hydrodynamics and sustainability of the addis ababa city aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the akaki catchment is located in central ethiopia along the western margin of the main ethiopian rift valley enclosed within the geographical co ordinate of 8 44 53 8 to 9 13 18 n latitude and 38 34 15 08 to 39 04 01 9 e longitude it is bounded to the north by the entoto ridge system to the west by menagesha mountain and the wechecha volcanic range to the south by mt bilbilo and mt guji to the southeast by the gara bushu hills to the southwest by mt furi and to the east by the mt yerer volcanic center see fig 1 2 1 1 temperature the maximum temperature of addis ababa ranges between 210c in the wet season to 250c in the dry season while the minimum falls between 6 70c 110c in the year as shown in fig 2 2 1 2 rainfall the annual rainfall average of the watershed was estimated to 1149 10 mm by simple athematic mean method the minimum and maximum rainfalls in the watershed are 6 80 and 288 31 mm which occurred during the months of january and august respectively as shown in fig 3 2 1 3 hydrogeomorphology the topography is rugged and steep mostly between entoto and filwuha but it is gentle and flat lying in south and southwest parts of the catchment the surface water reservoir legadadi and dire found in this catchment and they are the major water supply to addis ababa city the presences of massive fractured and porous units at different depths produce a multi layer aquifer system in the big and small akaki river catchments as shown in fig 4 2 2 groundwater well fields within addis ababa city aquifer all the well fields developed by addis ababa city water supply and sewerage authority are located in this catchment average depth of the wells is about 479 m the upper casing diameter designed is 14in and the lower casing diameter is 8in the average screen length of the wells is 144 m akaki well field which includes different phases of groundwater developments old akaki akaki phase i akaki phase ii akaki phase iiia and akaki phase iiib there are also pocket well fields located in south and south west of addis ababa in oromia regional state wwdse 2011 2 2 1 geology and geological structure of the study area owing to its location along the western margin of the main ethiopian rift the geological history of the akaki catchment is an integral part of the evolution and development of the ethiopian plateau and the rift system the catchment is covered by volcanic rocks overlain by fluvial and residual soils in which black cotton soils are predominant varying in thickness from a few centimeters to about 20 m aawsa 2000 the geology at regional level was described here from akaki beseka geological map sheet of a nc 37 14 prepared at a scale of 1 250 000 by geological survey of ethiopia which covers an area of 18 000 km2 the major lithological formations within the catchment as taken from this map sheet are shown in fig 5 the area is highly tectonized and is complex in structure because its nearness to the main ethiopian rift or its margin different geomorphic features align mostly to the ne sw direction which is parallel to the structure of the rift or rift margin most of these lineaments are observed in all units as interpreted from the digital elevation model and maximum length estimated is about 5 km most of the faults are trending in ne se direction and cut the entire unit joints and fracture are openings in a rock along which there is no observable movement the lengths of the structures vary between few centimeters to several meters in some places they are oriented normal to the flow banking and are parallel to each other 2 3 aquifer hydraulic properties aquifer hydraulic properties were determined from 166 deep borehole completion and pumping test data for each well located in the study area the aquifer pumping test is a frequently employed in situ method which is used to determine the hydraulic properties of water bearing formations the test involves putting an artificial stress on the aquifer by continuously pumping water from the borehole and measuring water level changes in the pumped well the change in hydraulic head can then be used to estimate the hydraulic properties of the aquifer transmissivity hydraulic conductivity and specific capacity hydraulic properties of the wells were analyzed from the collected pumping test data in order to understand the characteristic and variation within different aquifers in the watershed 2 3 1 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity k defines the rate of flow of water through a porous medium such as a soil or aquifer it is the constant of proportionality in darcy s law and as such is defined as the flow volume per unit cross sectional area of porous medium under the influence of a unit hydraulic gradient it is the volume of water flowing through a cross sectional area of an aquifer the hydraulic conductivity data value was classified to understand the variation within different aquifers in the watershed based on domenico and schwartz 1990 the hydraulic conductivity variation result within the study watershed was mapped using arcgis fig 7 table 1 shows representative values of hydraulic conductivity for various unconsolidated sedimentary materials sedimentary rocks and fractured crystalline rocks domenico and schwartz 1990 2 3 2 transmissivity transmissivity t of an aquifer measures how much water can be transmitted horizontally it is the product of the hydraulic conductivity times the thickness of the aquifer driscoll 1986 transmissivity t is a hydraulic parameter of an aquifer that is employed in most groundwater flow equations to understand the flow dynamics and is generally estimated from pumping tests freeze and cherry 1979 transmissivity t is actually equal to hydraulic conductivity k times aquifer thickness b or otherwise denoted as 1 t k b for characterization of rocks as a water conductivity media transmissivity is a major property fatoba et al 2014 it can be deduced that groundwater flow potential increases as transmissivity and permeability hydraulic conductivity increases in order to categorize the potential of groundwater for different use the transmissivity value of aquifer was employed by krasny 1993 to classify the aquifer based on transmissivity occurring in different aquifers the whole range of possible transmissivity values were separated into six classes representing the orders of transmissivity magnitude introduced by krasny 1993 as shown in table 2 2 3 3 specific capacity specific capacity of a well is the yield of a well per unit of drawdown usually expressed as cubic meters per day per m m3 day m after a given time has elapsed dividing the yield of a well by the drawdown when each is measured at the same time gives the specific capacity specific capacity generally varies with duration of pumping as pumping time increases specific capacity decreases driscoll 1986 the higher the transmissivity of the aquifer the greater is its capability to move water and the lower the drawdown in the well domenico and schwartz 1990 considered the specific capacity as the accepted standard when comparing the strength of one well versus another 2 4 analysis of groundwater hydrodynamics groundwater evaluation was made to estimate the response to potential inflow and outflow of water from underlying aquifer this was mainly to evaluate the change in water level and yield decline with time in the well field the determination of spatial effects of pumping on the aquifer was the main task analysis of periodic and continuous monitoring of water level was made to obtain information about changes of ground water flow over space and time in the well field of the watershed so the groundwater data and the rainfall recharge data important for their long term pattern and interpreted graphically to understand the dynamics of the groundwater level and recharge from rainfall thus hydrographs of groundwater responding to well pumping or groundwater abstraction and natural groundwater recharge in the basin indicate the water table fluctuation wtf in order to analyze the groundwater dynamics of the watershed basically the response of natural recharge versus the groundwater withdrawal of the watershed have to be determined domenico and schwartz 1990 2 i o δ s where i inflow o outflow s storage 2 4 1 spatial and temporal variations of water level in akaki watershed borehole data of 166 were collected from different wells out of these wells akaki well field akaki well field i ii and iii were monitored for temporal variation of water level and discharge the wells were being monitored by ethiopian construction design supervision works corporation since june 2012 the number of monitored wells and the frequency of monitoring increased markedly up to 2018 in 2012 the monitoring of water level by data logger connected to supervisory control and data acquisition scada system was started on 17 boreholes of akaki well field i or akaki phase ii water supply project additional monitoring was started on 16 and 24 wells of akaki well field ii akaki phase iiia water supply project and akaki well field iii akaki phase iiib water supply project respectively water level response to pumping pwl and water level rise upon pump not working were all identified from the scada and analyzed with respect to static water level swl and dynamic water level dwl hydraulic head measurements were essential pieces of information that are required for characterizing groundwater flow systems i e direction and hydraulic gradient of flow determining hydraulic properties of aquifers i e conductivity k transmissivity t and storativity s and evaluating the influence of pumping on water levels in a region piezometers were used to measure the hydraulic head at distinct points in saturated regions of the subsurface and it is the level to which water rises in the piezometer with reference to a datum such as sea level a pumping test is a field experiment in which a well is pumped at a controlled rate and water level response drawdown is measured in one or more surrounding observation wells piezometers and optionally in the pumped well control well itself response data from pumping tests are used to estimate the hydraulic properties of aquifers evaluate well performance and identify aquifer boundaries therefore pumping test was conducted to determine the sustainable yield of a borehole that basically based on the behavior of drawdowns observed during a hydraulic performance also known as a pumping test of the borehole through an appropriate conceptual model dynamic water level is the level when well becoming stabilized or there is no more drawdown to be created with the specific pumping rate the reference data for conducting analysis of the groundwater hydrodynamics is the pumping test data the data was analyzed for each well to determine the well hydraulic properties that determine the sustainable pumping or withdrawal rate without creating groundwater deterioration depletion the static water level shows the hydraulic head at that point with reference to the highest point of the watershed the well drawdown determined during pumping test is an indicator and reference for water level trend analysis the data showed that the water levels of some wells are dropped below the dynamic water level and the others are very close to the dynamic water level due to prolonged pumping or over exploitation of groundwater the water level could drop below the determined dynamic water level the main goal of this study was to analyze changes in groundwater well levels after development of large number of wells for addis water supply 2012 2019 thus from the data of 166 wells the water table contour map was generated from the static dynamic and recorded current water level of each of the well water level contour and raster maps are a graphic representation to analyze trend of the change of the water level during the use of wells through pumping water the hydraulic gradients which can be directly derived from these maps are the basis for calculating the rate of groundwater flow through cross sections de ridder 1980 2 4 2 spatial and temporal variations of yield the recorded yield data determined using pumping test were used to analyze the trend the analysis was made for akaki well field since both water level and discharge were monitored the daily record of yield converted to monthly data by arithmetic average of the value and trend shown graphically 2 5 analysis of sustainability of groundwater utilization the amount of groundwater abstraction from the well field was determined with respect to the annual recharge potential within the catchment area the average water level fluctuation data indicated the trend of water table from this result the net abstraction and recharge to groundwater storage was used to evaluate the sustainability of aquifer utilization safe yield and groundwater mining are terms often used in water resources analysis safe yield is the idea that groundwater development can be sustained as long as the amount of groundwater withdrawn by pumping does not exceed the amount recharged to the aquifer by precipitation the natural recharge rate is an important factor in determining the amount of natural discharge of a system and the relative amount of water available in the water budget but the idea of safe yield can lead to erroneously conclude that there is a specific pumping rate for which the impacts of development will be non depleting groundwater mining is also referring to the careful and planned withdrawal of quality water for the users without damaging the aquifer the aquifer has to sustain its quality for future development with proper groundwater mining the net extraction outflows induced by humans pumping wells minus recharge to the same aquifer is used as an indicator of human stress on the aquifer and used to determine whether the utilization is sustainable or not the analysis uses the conceptual understating of the effect of different inputs of groundwater components on the storage therefore the amount groundwater levels dropped in the past seven years were analyzed to evaluate the utilization 3 results and discussion 3 1 aquifer hydraulic properties the major groundwater hydraulic properties transmissivity hydraulic conductivity and specific capacity variations within the watershed were analyzed with respect to lithological type and location as interpolated and mapped with the help of arcgis the values of aquifer hydraulic properties showed significant variation fig 6 hydraulic conductivity in the watershed varies from 0 02 to 256 m day primary and secondary porosity and permeability of the main water bearing geologic units volcanic rocks plays most important role for these hydraulic conductivities variation these variations are particularly the result of fractures and its interconnection within basalt ignimbrite and other volcanic rocks as the lithological log of the wells exhibited the hydraulic conductivity result indicated most of the central part of the watershed and the gentle to flat areas are characterized by relatively less hydraulic conductivity value on the other hand the areas close to the watershed boundary which relatively steep topography have relatively higher hydraulic conductivity these latter areas are close to recharge zones of the watershed the hydraulic conductivities data values of the study area were classified based on the domenico and schwartz 1990 aquifer classification this classification was used to understand the lithological characteristic of the water bearing formations accordingly the aquifer materials can be categorized under permeable basalt and fractured igneous rock the major aquifers of the watershed are fractured basalt scoriaceous basalt scoria fractured ignimbrite or a combination of these materials which could comply with the above classification in the watershed the transmissivities of the wells were also mapped with the help of interpolation made with idw using gis it is the other hydraulic properties of aquifer which measure the capability of the aquifer to transmit groundwater through a 1 m wide band over its full depth fig 7 the transmissivity result of the aquifers varies between 5 4 101m2 day and 2 16 104m2 day the result indicates that lower value of transmissivity value on the relatively gentle slope area than steep areas near the boundary of the watershed in addition the results indicate a relatively higher transmissivity value of the fractured basalt and scoriaceous basalt than that of fractured ignimbrite according to krasny 1993 the aquifer of the well fields can be categorized as intermediate to very high transmissivity based on this analysis the groundwater could be planned for regional importance as far as recharge and withdrawal balance to each other the higher transmissivity of the aquifer the greater in its capability to move water and the lower the drawdown in the well specific capacity sc is another hydraulic property of aquifer that determined from the physical properties and described as the ratio of discharge q to steady drawdown s it characterizes the capacity of an aquifer to release groundwater from storage in response to a decline in hydraulic head if the discharge during the pumping test is constant then the specific capacity should vary with time as far as there is drawdown the specific capacity of the well decreases with time as pumping time increases norman 1971 domenico and schwartz 1990 considered the specific capacity as the accepted standard when comparing the strength of one well versus another the map generated for the watershed indicates that akaki well fields and lla have relatively higher specific capacity than others in the well fields fig 8 during pumping test as pumping time increases specific capacity decreases which implies with constant rate of pumping the drawdown continuously increases under the water level stabilizes as per the data analysis a general decrease in specific capacity observed from the pumping wells of akaki well fields the drawdown is with subsequent decrease of discharge the analyzed dynamic water levels and estimated safe yields were not sustained for the well fields most of the akaki wells show a decreasing trend of yield with comparable decline of water level the specific capacities are continuously changing not only as the result of drawdown but also due to discharge deterioration for most wells in the well field this is the result of well interference that means the lateral extent of the aquifer is limited to produce the first determined discharge generally the hydraulic conductivity strongly correlates to the transmissivity value in akaki well field than the rest of the well fields in the watershed areas of higher hydraulic conductivity are closely fit with high transmissivity area and vice versa these indicate that the lithological unit aquifer is strongly heterogeneous within the entire catchment than akaki well field in addition the higher the transmissivity of the aquifer the greater is its capability to move water and the lower the drawdown in the well thus it observed from the map that more or less similar area having higher values of transmissivity have higher value specific capacity 3 2 water level analysis a water table contour map was produced to show the elevation and configuration of the water table on a certain period to construct the water level data from the form of subsurface was converted to the form of water table elevation equal to water level height above a datum plane these data were then changed to raster map that indicates the elevation of the water table in the watershed fig 9 this study employed gis based interpolation techniques for geospatial analysis of ground water trend analysis akaki well field water level decreased because of stress as the result of current groundwater withdrawal water level maps that show spatial variations of static and dynamic water level were generated for the entire akaki watershed based on the data obtained from the pumping test the water level fluctuations were analyzed along three cross sections of the generated map these cross sections were selected along relatively substantial borehole density from upstream to downstream part of akaki well field as specified in method and analysis the major work was to evaluate the water level of akaki well field that equipped with water level measurement the first profile lies between two points a 501231 3 e 1011100 1n and b 466984 7e 970500 1n that has estimated distance about 53 1 km fig 10 the minimum maximum and average static water level along this cross section was 13 79 and 40 8 m below ground surface similarly the minimum maximum and average dynamic water levels were 16 3 90 5 52 8 m respectively table 3 in general the evaluation of the pumping water level indicates that minimum maximum and average water level drop of 3 74 43 86 23 46 m were created against the proposed sustainable dynamic water level due to groundwater over exploitation table 4 the second profile lies between two points d 501977 4e 1010595 2n and g 470437 1e 970101 2n that has estimated distance about 33 8 km fig 11 the minimum maximum and average static water level along this second cross section was 13 79 and 40 8 m below ground surface similarly the minimum maximum and average dynamic water levels were 13 23 18 22 66 84 m respectively table 3 likewise the evaluation of the pumping water level along this cross section indicates that minimum maximum and average water level drop of 26 58 70 22 23 70 m were created against the proposed sustainable dynamic water level due groundwater over exploitation table 4 to make the analysis more consistent third profile was selected which lies between two points p 476628 7e 1005612 1n to q 471294e 969983 4n that has estimated distance about 36 km fig 12 the minimum maximum and average static water levels along this cross section were 5 78 156 3 and 54 32 m below ground surface the minimum maximum and average dynamic water levels were 3 7 105 8 54 6 m respectively table 3 in addition the current pumping water level was evaluated along the same profile in this akaki well field and the estimated values of the minimum maximum and average pumping water level in the well field are 2 03 177 31 38 69 m with respect to the proposed dynamic water level table 4 see figs 13 15 the current water levels map of akaki well field were mapped to show the detailed contour of the water levels the detailed data of water levels were at akaki well field site the arithmetic mean of akaki well field water level from individual wells water level measurement indicated that 81 4 of current pumping water level are below the dynamic water level out of the analyzed water level only 18 6 are in good condition that the pumping water levels are above the dynamic water level table 5 the evaluation from the water level mapping showed that 84 50 of the pumping water levels were below the dynamic water level and only 15 5 are in good condition that the pumping water levels are above the dynamic water level the main task here was to analyze the water level fluctuation on the deep groundwater generally the fluctuation of groundwater level is different in magnitude depending on the extraction and recharge in different locations however the cause of fluctuations in case of akaki well field couldn t recharge dominant fluctuation by recharge is most applicable in areas with shallow water table that display sharp raises and declines following rainfall events the method should work best for wells that show a relatively rapid water level rise in relation to the rate that water moves away from the water table one of the important reasons to propose and analyze the drawdown dynamic water and other hydraulic parameter of a well is to understand the well performance and propose its sustainable use the decline of the water level is an indicator of the water pumping from storage 3 3 groundwater sustainable utilization the amount of groundwater abstraction from the well field determined with respect to the annual recharge potential within the catchment area utilization of an aquifer implies the removal of sizable volumes of groundwater and this changes the aquifer s natural recharge and discharge patterns net recharges in akaki basin were estimated between 51 5 and 81 mm which help the analysis of trend of the current of groundwater use from the above two figures the average recharge is 66 25 mm the total volume of recharge to akaki watershed therefore calculated to be about 99 mm3 year the estimated total volume of recharge on abay plateau that considered for groundwater inflow is 77 mm3 year the annual design and planned groundwater withdrawal from the different well fields of the akaki watershed that yet connected to the supply system is about 414 000m3 day the maximum actual production from these water supply projects were 348 200m3 day the production now significantly decreases to 281 970m3 day table 6 currently there are two big projects under construction south ayat north fanta and legedadi legetafo ayata ii lla ii their sources were developed and tested to supply together about 154 000m3 day with this design discharge as the base and using the trend of production of the connected sources above the expected maximum and optimum production are forecasted to be 115 500 and 77 000m3 day respectively table 7 in addition to the above aawsa water supply projects the productions of 387 wells those owned by oromia cities and rural villages including private wells were analyzed the average design discharges were estimated from the individual well discharges the production tend of these wells were forecasted to the current scenario of aawsa wells as given the table table 8 the design production and current groundwater withdrawal from the watershed are estimated to be 688 181 76 and 419 060 88 m3 day respectively however when the two projects under construction by aawsa are completed the groundwater design production and average withdrawal are increased to be 842 181 76 and 496 060 88 m3 day see table 9 at this stage the sustainability issue should have to get attention because groundwater pumping or taking from storage without equivalent recharge lead to the depletion of the source under such conditions groundwater pumping upsets the dynamic equilibrium of a natural system the water budget changes over time as the system responds to the stress with time the mining phase gives way to a transitional phase in which the effects of pumping spread throughout the hydrologic system and leads to depletion of the resources ground water extraction modifies the groundwater flows to satisfy pumping rates groundwater storage decreases as water is released from storage the groundwater system converges toward a new equilibrium constrained by the capture of available water sources where capture refers to decreased discharge of the wells these have great effect on the working condition of the submersible pumps and the supply system network most transmission mains are working under efficiency in addition because of the decrease in discharge and water level decline addis ababa water supply and sewerage authority was forced to lower the pump position of 11 wells rehabilitation of 7 wells and abandoning of 26 wells moreover other 22 wells are not operational and require pump pullout to identify the problems in general the existing situation is worst in the case old akaki well fields where 13 wells are totally abandoned in this well field other replacement wells known as koyefeche water supply wells were drilled but indicated significant water level decline in six months operation due to over abstraction 4 conclusion and recommendation 4 1 conclusion the hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity in the watershed vary from 0 02 m day to 256 m day and 5 4 101m2 day to 2 16 104m2 day respectively these variations are particularly the result of fractures and its interconnection within basalt ignimbrite and other volcanic rocks as the lithological log of the wells exhibited central part of the watershed and the gentle to flat areas are characterized by relatively less hydraulic conductivity transmissivity but the values are higher close to the watershed boundary on relatively steep topography in addition the results indicate a relatively higher hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values for fractured and scoriaceous weathered basalt than that of fractured ignimbrite generally the hydraulic conductivity strongly correlates to the transmissivity value in akaki well field than the rest of the well fields in the watershed major aquifers of the watershed are fractured basalt scoriaceous basalt scoria fractured ignimbrite or a combination of these water bearing formations the map generated for the watershed indicates that akaki well fields and lla have relatively higher specific capacity than others in the well fields however the akaki well fields are with significant water level drawdown and discharge deterioration because intense water pumping and also wells are relatively close to each other over pumping which lead to water level and discharge decline of akaki well field is similar in value for most of the wells in the well field in other words most the wells show a decreasing trend of yield with comparable similar decline of water level the specific capacities are continuously changing not only as the result of drawdown but also due to heavy discharge for most wells in the well field this is the result of well interference in which lateral extent of the aquifer is limited to produce the estimated safe yield the water level fluctuations were analyzed along three cross sections of the water level contour map generated accordingly level mapping showed that 84 50 of the pumping water levels were below the dynamic water level and only 15 5 are in good condition that the pumping water levels are above the dynamic water level
