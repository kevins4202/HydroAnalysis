23010,an analytical method is proposed in this paper to present the effect of the degradation development of concrete friction piles subjected to vertical loads on the pile bearing capacity this paper proposes an analytical solution of the sulfate diffusion reaction equation based on fick s law and danckwerts method in polar coordinates a chemo mechanics model is established to compute expansion based on the consideration of the pore filling furthermore the effect of concrete expansion on pile lateral soil effective stress is analyzed a model is based on a hyperbolic nonlinear relationship to simulate the behavior between the skin friction and the pile degradation along the pile soil interface additionally the sulfate distribution over time the changes of crack point along a pile radius and the skin friction are analyzed finally a parametric study with different external sulfate concentration the microcracks and different soil properties is performed the results show that the crack point moves into a pile due to external sulfate attack accelerating the invasion of sulfate the effective radius and the elastic modulus of a pile tend to decrease the degradation of concrete friction piles lead to loss of friction resulting in the bearing capacity of the pile decline the effect of different soil properties the on pile bearing capacity is different keywords concrete pile pile bearing capacity external sulfate attack degradation cavity expansion 1 introduction for many years engineering structures under vertical loads have been designed to resist external sulfate attack which occurs when sulfate in ground water saline soils or marine environments rajasekaran 2005 reacts with calcium aluminate hydrates cah in the concrete especially the durability and vertical load carrying properties of the foundations in civil engineering fields such as bridges and buildings exposed to sulfate rich environments are under threat after severe material degradation at present the existing studies focus on the degradation mechanism of the concrete material and the corresponding durability design to resist sulfate attack shannag and shaia 2003 santhanam et al 2006 müllauer et al 2013 siad et al 2015 bassuoni and rahman 2016 li et al 2016 in the application of foundation engineering design the design of concrete structure subjected to vertical loads in a sulfate rich environment has begun to be considered the effect of degradation of the concrete pile and some protective measures have been taken gb 50046 2008 gbt 50942 2014 however when the pile foundation is exposed to a sulfate rich environment the study of structure effects after material degradation has few reports brueckner et al 2012 the main structure effects can make concrete cross sectional area loss make the cover concrete to the reinforcing bars damage lead to pile foundation settlement make pile skin friction lose and so on the structural stability and durability suffer from the impact of the structure effects above the deterioration of the concrete pile surface may change the friction at the affect areas and reduces the vertical load bearing capacity of a pile however signs of deterioration of a substructure will be invisible and the public safety will be rarely endangered due to the gradual process of external sulfate attack on the other hand this is partly due to the large safety factor used in the design of piles the previous studies may provide useful tools and guidance for investigating the pile bearing capacity of concrete friction piles with consideration of external sulfate attack however it needs to point out that most of the available calculation methods of the pile bearing capacity applied in the sulfate free environment without consideration of external sulfate attack in addition there is little study on the effect of external sulfate attack on the bearing capacity of concrete friction piles especially the analytical frameworks for exploring the bearing capacity of concrete piles with sulfate attack it is evident that a new methodology for the analysis of effects of the degradation of concrete piles caused by sulfate attack on skin friction at pile soil interface is still needed the primary objective of this study is to develop an analytical method for the relationship between the skin friction and the pile displacement considering the degradation development of concrete piles under vertical loads the analytical solution of the proposed diffusion reaction equation is derived based on the degradation mechanism and the geometrical characteristics of piles a chemo mechanics model is established to compute expansions considering the effects of expansion of the pile degradation on the stress of pile lateral soil the elastic solutions for the stress and the radial displacement is derived based on cylindrical cavity expansion to analyze the relative compaction effect according to the displacement coordination of pile soil the formula of the shear strength of the pile soil interface is modified with the expansion degradation of piles and then the hyperbolic load transfer method is used to analyze the relationship between the pile skin friction and the pile soil relative displacement in fig 1 a schematic diagram of the different processes considered in this model is depicted 2 time varying model of pile skin friction 2 1 hyperbolic nonlinear model fig 2 shows a simple hyperbolic relationship between the pile skin friction and the displacement at the pile soil interface in a period time t with vertical load of a pile head increasing the pile skin friction increases nonlinearly without external sulfate attack the shear stress of the pile shaft nearly reaches the limiting value τsu when the pile displacement is increasing large based on this hyperbolic relationship zhang and zhang 2012 the pile skin friction can be expressed by the following equation when piles serve in a rich sulfate environment during their life span 1 τ s t w t a t b t w t where τ s t is the shaft shear stress in a period time t w t is the pile displacement in a period time t a t and b t empirical coefficients are greatly influenced by the properties of pile soil interface in this paper a t and b t are also influenced by sulfate attack the pile displacement w t is induced by the shaft shear stress and by the gradual nature of external sulfate attack w t randolph and wroth 1979 can be modified as follows 2 w t τ 0 t r 0 t g ln r m r 0 t where τ 0 t is the time dependent shear stress at pile soil interface r 0 t is the time dependent radius of the pile g is the shear modulus of the elastic soil outside of the disturbed zone r m is the radial distance from the pile centre to a point at which the shear stress induced by the pile can be considered to be negligible according to the expression suggested by lee 1993 the value of r m can be taken as r m 2 5 l ρ m 1 υ where l is the length of the pile ρ m is modified inhomogeneity factor and υ is the poisson s ratio of the elastic soil the modified inhomogeneity factor can be expressed randolph and wroth 1979 3 ρ m g l 2 g l where g l 2 and g l are the values of the shear modulus at pile mid depth and pile base respectively ρ m of homogeneous soil is 1 the time dependent coefficient a t can be taken as the initial stiffness of the shaft shear stress pile displacement relationship of the pile soil interface as shown in fig 2 the value of a randolph and wroth 1978 can be modified using the following equation considering the time effect 4 a t r 0 t g ln r m r the asymptote of the shaft shear stress pile displacement curve can be considered as the time dependent coefficient b t when the pile displacement reaches at a large value as shown in fig 2 this asymptote skin friction τsu is approximately equal to the maximum possible value of the pile soil interface τf t by means of a failure ratio rsf it can use τf t to express τsu the value of b t can be expressed 5 b t τ s u τ f t r sf according to the shaft shear stress displacement curve the values of rsf are supposed to be in the range 0 80 0 95 clough and duncan 1971 this paper takes 0 88 the following equation can be used to calculate τ f t azzouz et al 1990 yang et al 2006 6 τ f t k 0 k h k 0 σ v t tan φ δ φ where k h is lateral earth pressure coefficient σ v t is effective overburden pressure at a certain depth with consideration of expansion as shown in the next section δ is friction angle of pile soil interface k 0 is the in situ earth pressure coefficient the value of which was approximately estimated by k 0 1 sin φ φ is the angle of shearing resistance of the surrounding soil kulhawy 1984 suggested that the value δ φ is 0 9 and chose a value of 0 8 for k h k 0 2 2 the relative compaction effect in a period time t the expansion development of concrete piles underground has a relative compaction effect on soil around piles which can change the effective overburden pressure σ v t the relative compaction effect is defined as the very small displacements and strains of soil caused by the expansion of piles in service exposed to external sulfate attack which is different from the compaction effect the compaction effect occurs in the construction of jacked piles while the relative compaction effect occurs in the process of piles whole life when pile service in sulfate rich environments compaction effect is obvious for big pile volume while relative compaction effect is closely relate to expansion caused by material degradation the expansion is generally small and the compaction effect is mild the expansion development of concrete piles in erosion soil is regard as cavity expansion in infinite homogeneous saturated soil fig 3 shows a planar view of a cylindrical cavity with an initial cavity radius of r 0 which expands to another cavity radius r p as the internal cavity pressure increases from the initial in situ stress to σ p regardless of the pile end expansion effects on soil layer deterioration expansion of concrete pile shaft results in soil lateral extrusion which can be considered as cylindrical expansion therefore the equilibrium equation in the cylindrical polar coordinate system can be expressed as 7 σ r r σ r σ θ r 0 where σ r and σ θ are normal stresses acting in the radial and tangential directions respectively the elastic solution for radial displacement can be obtained as follows yu 2000 8 u σ p σ 0 2 g r p 2 r that the pile expansive deformation is equal to the radial displacement of soil gives 9 u t r p r 0 ε c t r 0 where ε c t is linear expansion strain of pile concrete in a period time t as shown in section 3 hence the stress of pile soil interface in a period time t is obtained 10 σ p t σ 0 2 g ε c t 1 ε c t 3 chemo mechanics model to obtain the linear expansion strain ε c t a chemo mechanics model is needed to build for the quantitative analysis of the concrete erosion expansion 3 1 diffusion reaction model the previous studies primarily focused on the sulfate diffusion reaction in a semi infinite reinforced concrete structure with a plane surface however the sulfate diffusion reaction equation in a semi infinite reinforced concrete structure is different from that in a concrete pile to describe the external sulfate attack in concrete piles a diffusion reaction model for external sulfate is established the cross section of a concrete pile casted in situ is mostly circle the radial distance is r mm to simplify this problem the hoop and axial diffusion of the sulfate is assumed to be negligible additionally when sulfate is immobilized by an irreversible reaction the rate of sulfate consumption in a pile is kc where constant k represents the rate of take up of sulfates and maybe considered as the solubility rate tixier and mobasher 2003a then the equation for the diffusion reaction of sulfate along the radius of the concrete pile is expressed as 11 c t d 2 c r 2 r 1 c r k c where c is the sulfate concentration d represents diffusion coefficient c s is the environment sulfate concentration c 0 is the internal sulfate concentration then the initial and boundary conditions of eq 11 can be expressed as 12 c r 0 c 0 0 r r 0 c r 0 t c s t 0 the solution cannot be derived by the method of separation of variables due to the limited boundary condition the danckwerts method is found to solve this problem crank 1975 let u 1 be the solution of the equation for diffusion in radius in absence of reaction i e of 13 c t d 2 c r 2 r 1 c r for the same boundary conditions the boundary condition is homogenized as follows 14 u 1 r t c r t c s then 15 c t d 2 c r 2 r 1 c r 16 c r 0 u 0 u s 0 r r 0 c r 0 t 0 t 0 using the method of separation of variables the solution is obtained as follows 17 c r t n 1 c n 2 c 0 c s n 1 j 0 μ n r r 0 β n b j 1 β n r 0 e d β n 2 t where μ n n 1 2 is the positive root of j 0 x 0 and j 0 x and j 1 x are bessel functions of order zero one and zero two respectively of the first kind β n μ n r 0 by substituting eq 17 into eq 14 eq 14 can be rewritten as 18 u 1 c r t c s c s 2 c 0 c s n 1 j 0 μ n r r 0 β n b j 1 β n r 0 e d β n 2 t the solution of eq 18 is determined by integral transformation of danckwerts method 19 c c s 2 c 0 c s n 1 j 0 μ n r r 0 β n r 0 j 1 β n r 0 k d β n 2 k d β n 2 d β n 2 k e d β n 2 k t eq 19 is the solution for external sulfate diffusion reaction in a concrete pile 3 2 concrete volumetric expansion in this model it is assumed that considering the chemical reactions of sulfate ions with the unreacted hydration compounds of the cement paste the potential volume expansion causes the concrete deterioration the most relevant chemical reactions that are generally accepted to potentially take place during the exposure to sulfate solution are now summarized tixier and mobasher 2003b sarkar et al 2010 idiart et al 2011 ikumi et al 2014 yin et al 2017 in the first step the ingressing sulfates react with portlandite ch and or calcium silicate hydrates csh then gypsum csh2 precipitates from the reaction 20 ch so 4 2 c s h 2 2 oh 21 c s h so 4 2 h 2 o c s h 2 the consumption of cementitious materials make the concrete degrade into a non cohesive granular mass shazali et al 2006 which leads to mechanical performance degradation and reduce tensile strength in the second step the gypsum conducts a set of reactions with unreacted tricalcium aluminate c3a grains eq 22 tetracalcium aluminate hydrate c4ah13 eq 23 monosulfoaluminate c 4 a s h

consumption of cementitious materials and the expansion of product accelerate the deterioration of concrete in this study ettringite is assumed to the only reaction product to govern the concrete expansion the role of gypsum in the process of the concrete expansion has not been quantified neville 2004 so the possible expansion due to gypsum formation is neglected according to the three aluminate phases considered in the present model the volume can be calculated as indicated in eq 25 25 δ v i v v c 6 a s 3 h 32 v i a i v c s h 2 v i a i v c s h 2 v c 6 a s 3 h 32 v i a i v c s h 2 1 where v i is the molar volume of each reactant a i is the stoichiometric coefficient the δ v i v values obtained for c 3 a c 4 ah 13 c 4 a s h 12 are reported 1 31 0 48 0 55 respectively clifton and ponnersheim 1994 the expansion reduction will depend on the capacity of the pore structure to accommodate ettringite and the capacity of the matrix to resist expansive stress assuming isotropy in the volumetric expansion the total volumetric strain is defined as 26 ε v i 1 n δ v i v f φ 0 where f is the fraction of capillary porosity being filled which is usually in a range between 5 and 40 tixier and mobasher 2003a the linear strain of concrete is as follows tixier and mobasher 2003a 27 ε c ε v 3 the capillary porosity φ 0 is estimated according to a powers model 28 φ 0 m a x υ c w c 0 36 α w c 0 32 0 where α is the degree of hydration of the cement υ c is the volumetric fraction of cement in the concrete w c is the water cement ratio 3 3 mechanical characteristics of pile concrete degradation considering piles exposed to the external sulfate attack the concrete elastic modulus changes over time to simplify the analysis the elastic modulus of concrete pile plane is divided into the modulus e c of cracked area and uncracked area as the initial elastic modulus e 0 without consideration the effect of capillary porosity being filled on the elastic modulus as shown in fig 4 when the stress of concrete increases to exceed tensile strength σ e ε f t concrete damages with cracks growing the damage parameter related to a crack density parameter referred to as cd number of cracks per unit volume has the relation budiansky and o connell 1976 29 ω 16 9 c d the crack density has been empirically correlated to the strain tixier and mobasher 2003a 30 c d 0 16 1 ε e ε 2 3 where ε is the strain ε e represents the threshold strain at which the micro cracks start forming the value of which is not given tixier and mobasher 2003a sarkar et al 2010 generally the stress strain relationship is linear when the stress is 40 60 of peak tensile stress in this paper the threshold strain is taken as 50 of peak tensile stress the modulus e c of cracking area is expressed as follows tixier and mobasher 2003a 31 e c e 0 1 ω where e 0 is the initial elastic modulus the weighted average of the modulus of two areas is the modulus of a pile after erosion 32 e r 0 2 e 0 r 0 2 r 0 2 e c r 0 2 where r 0 is the effective radius of a deteriorated pile by substituting eq 29 31 into eq 32 eq 32 can be rewritten as 33 e e 0 1 0 284 1 r 0 2 r 0 2 1 ε e ε 2 3 4 analysis of the proposed method at the first step the sulfate distributions have been calculated with the analytical solution of diffusion reaction equation then the degradation of a concrete pile has been analyzed the expansion and crack development in a pile has also presented the expansion can lead to the stress increasing and the displacement increasing of the soil around the pile finally considering the external sulfate attack the relationship between the pile skin friction and the displacement is obtained markedly different experimental conditions and methods as well as a limited number of reported values make it difficult to choose a reasonable value for the diffusivity d the diffusivity d is a constant value that is suggested to be between 0 75 10 12 m2 s 1 and 9 10 12 m2 s 1 tixier and mobasher 2003b the kinetic rate k is suggested to be between 10 6 and 10 9 s 1 tixier 2000 it is assumed that the diffusion coefficient and reaction rate are d 6 10 12 m2 s 1 and k 10 9 s 1 respectively in addition in section 4 4 2 influence of microcracks on the sulfate diffusion coefficient was considered main parameters such as pile geometry soil physical parameters especially boston blue clay in section 4 2 and section 4 3 environmental condition chemical reaction parameters physical and mechanical parameters of concrete considered for the proposed method in this case are listed in table 1 4 1 analysis of the proposed method to verify the present method an experimental test of concrete piles under external sulfate attack was performed the calculated results of the analytical method and experimental data are compared the concrete specimen geometrical size is φ100 mm 200 mm the water cement ratio is 0 55 as shown in table 2 all specimens were demolded after 24 h of casting and were cured in a condition of 20 3 c and 95 relative humidity the specimens were immersed in 5 sodium sulfate after specimens curing 28 days the initial content of sulfate in the specimen is measured the sodium sulfate solutions were replenished every week to maintain a uniform concentration when the sulfate attack occurs at the end of 30 d 90 d 180 d and 270 d the specimens were removed from the sodium sulfate solution and air dried powder samples were then taken at different cover depths centre of gravity position 1 87 mm 5 5 mm 9 5 mm 13 5 mm and 17 5 mm from the exposed surfaces 1 g of powder was obtained at each depth and placed in a desiccator to dry for 2 h the dried powder was then submerged in 50 ml of distilled water in a covered plastic cup for 48 h finally the sulfate concentration of different depths in the specimen was measured by spectrophotometer the calculated results of crank 1975 the present solution and experimental data are compared as shown in fig 5 the results show that the sulfate distribution profiles from crank 1975 and the present solution along pile radius at different times have a good agreement furthermore the sulfate distribution profiles from experimental test and the present solution also have a good fit therefore the validity of the proposed method is verified the experimental data shows that the concentration and depth of sulfate in the concrete increase over time fig 6 shows the effective radius and the modulus of a pile decreasing with time sulfate can react with the hydration products of cement to form ettringite degrading the concrete into disruptive expansion which lead to the loss of the cross sectional area of a concrete pile namely the effective radius and the modulus of a pile decreases with external sulfate attack during the service the reduction tendency of the effective radius and the elastic modulus of a pile is basically identical but the decrement is different the effective radius of a pile reduced nearly by 25 while the concrete modulus decreased by 2 5 4 2 crack development of piles and stress development of soil the steps for the solution of sulfate critical concentration of concrete crack the strain of concrete crack is obtained according to the stress strain relation of concrete then the consumption of sulfate is calculated according to the content of the reactant in concrete with eq 20 24 according to the law of mass conservation the local consumption by sulfate reaction of sulfate ions is equal to the difference between the divergence of the ion flow due to diffusion and change rate of concentration therefore the time of diffusion to the position is obtained the sulfate concentration at the boundary of the crack area and the uncrack area is obtained as the critical concentration of concrete crack fig 7 shows the crack expands to the inside of a pile over time it takes short time to degrade the concrete into crack near the pile surface because the high sulfate concentration near the pile surface leads to full action with concrete hydration products the farther from the pile surface the lower the sulfate concentration is crack extends from pile surface to inside at a slower speed as a result concrete crack position moving speed is closely related to sulfate diffusion reaction in a pile the expansion develops over time corresponding to the crack extending according to the displacement compatibility of the pile soil the expansion gives the stress development of soil boston blue clay fig 8 shows the expansion and pile lateral soil stress changing with time the expansion of a pile and the soil stress increase rapidly in early stage then they increased slowly this is because the sulfate diffusion depth increases but its concentration is low and increases slowly additionally as shown in fig 8 the increment of the displacement and the stress around a pile is very little this attributes to the displacement and the stress of soil around a pile subjected to the expansion of pile concrete the concrete is brittle material the tensile strength is low and the concrete expansion strain is very small with the conditions of displacement coordination and stress balance the displacement and the stress of soil around a pile caused by the concrete expansion is relatively small 4 3 skin friction of piles exposed to external sulfate attack the degradation of a pile caused by external sulfate attack the loss of effective radius and the modulus of a pile lead to loss of the skin friction while the increase of soil stress caused by pile expansion may be has a positive effect on the skin friction this study investigated the effects of two factors on unit skin friction respectively fig 9 shows the relationship between the unit skin friction and the pile displacement considering the loss of effective radius compared with the measured values he 2002 and the relationship between the unit skin friction and the pile displacement in a normal environment it is found that the unit skin friction of a pile in a sulfate rich environment decreases over time with sulfate attack the percentage loss of unit skin friction of a pile is approximately 5 9 and 8 8 respectively at 5 years and 30 years for a particular displacement w 10 mm fig 10 shows the relationship between the unit skin friction and the pile displacement considering the effect of expansion compared with the measured values he 2002 and the relationship between the unit skin friction and the pile displacement in a normal environment it is found that the increase of the unit skin friction is not obvious when the soil stress increases in the other word the increase of soil stress caused by pile expansion has no positive effect on the skin friction because the soil stress is too small to increase the skin friction according to the effect of degradation of a pile on unit skin friction from figs 9 and 10 it is concluded that the unit skin friction decreases due to the degradation of a pile with external sulfate attack which leads pile larger settlement in a sulfate rich environment one of pile degradation types is local degradation due to the decline or rise of the ground salt water the concrete pile suffers from the wet and dry cycle of the ground salt water which makes the local serious corrosion of pile shaft as shown in fig 11 therefore the effect of vertical expansion of concrete piles and deterioration of concrete pile shaft on pile soil friction coefficient can be ignored only the radial expansion of concrete piles should be considered for a friction pile the single pile bearing capacity is mainly provided by pile side friction fig 12 shows the relationship between the vertical load and the displacement the measured values are fitted as a hyperbolic model of the transfer function the regression coefficient is a 0 0716 and b 0 022 yang et al 2016 the results show that hyperbolic model of transfer function fitted by measured values and the modified model at 30 years in this paper are of good match which verifies the validity of the modified model furthermore it is found that pile degradation has an obvious negative effect on skin friction according to the relationship between skin friction q and displacement w when the pile diameter is less than 800 mm the ultimate load is defined as the load corresponding to a displacement 40 mm gb50007 2011 when the pile diameter is not less than 800 mm the ultimate load is defined as the load corresponding to a displacement equal to 5 of the pile diameter jgj106 2014 the former is national standard and the latter is the industry standard in china the two values of total settlement complement each other it is noted that differences are great between countries in the stipulation of ultimate bearing capacity according to the total settlement of pile top which is related to the safety factor of each country especially the requirement of superstructure on settlement of pile foundation to quantify the effect of pile degradation on skin friction fig 13 shows the skin friction decreases over time when the pile displacement is 40 mm during the 30 years the skin friction reduces by 24 3 which means a 24 3 reduction in the vertical bearing capacity of the single pile as to friction pile it is can be concluded that the external sulfate attack result in a larger settlement of a pile due to the pile degradation 4 4 parametric analysis 4 4 1 influence of sulfate concentration c s fig 14 shows the load settlement curve for concrete piles exposed to 0 5 1 2 sulfate solution respectively it is concluded that the concentration of sulfate has a significant influence on the load settlement curve of a concrete pile on the same load condition a higher sulfate concentration yields larger settlement this is because a higher external sulfate concentration leads to faster corrosion speed of the pile concrete the deterioration of the pile concrete accelerates therefore the loss of the cross sectional area increases additionally the contact surface between the pile shaft and the soil is lose due to the degradation and spalling of concrete resulting in the decrease of lateral friction resistance and the load capacity of the pile 4 4 2 influence of microcracks fig 15 shows the pile load settlement curve for the conditions of microcracks w c 50 μm of the pile concrete and the uncracked pile concrete as shown in fig 15 the existence of concrete microcracks has a weakening effect on the pile bearing capacity the loss of pile bearing capacity increases with the settlement increasing when the settlement is 20 mm the loss of pile bearing capacity is about 5 additionally it is not as influential as the external sulfate concentration this is because sulfate reaction with the cementitious materials generates dilatability products such as ettringite pore filling and the formation of tiny cracks after pore filling have different effects on sulfate diffusion coefficient the filling of concrete pores reduces the sulfate diffusion coefficient while the formation of microcracks makes the diffusion coefficient of sulfate increase therefore the increasing of diffusion coefficient during the microcrack formation period speeds up the diffusion of sulfate which accelerates the deterioration of pile concrete the bearing capacity of pile loses gradually 4 4 3 influence of soil property in the sulfate environment the soil property as an important factor affects the pile bearing capacity as shown in table 1 the physical parameters of the three types of soil are given combined with the soil parameters and external sulfate attack the load settlement curves in the noncorrosive environment and the corrosive environment are obtained as shown in fig 16 it can be concluded that under the sulfate attack the deterioration of concrete pile has little impact on the load settlement relationship when the settlement is small especially the boston blue clay the effect of soil parameters on sulfate attack is obvious when the settlement is large when the settlement value is 20 mm the load of a concrete pile in boston blue clay sand and clay lose by 12 14 and 26 respectively 5 conclusions this study based on the hyperbolic nonlinear model presents the effect of pile degradation development on the pile bearing capacity compared with the skin friction of a pile in the normal environment the conclusions are as follows 1 with external sulfate attack the concrete pile degraded with time such as the loss of effective radius and the modulus of a concrete pile during 20 years the decrease of effective radius and the modulus is obvious after 20 years the decrease rate of the effective radius and the modulus is small the same tendency is the crack development along the pile radius 2 the expansion increases with time the relative compaction effect occurs which leads to the increase of effective stress of the soil around a pile 3 the decreasing of the effective radius and the modulus of a pile leads to decrease the skin friction the increase of skin friction is not obvious when the soil stress increases the skin friction decreases due to external sulfate attack which leads pile a larger settlement in a sulfate rich environment 4 external sulfate concentration has a significantly influence on the bearing capacity of concrete pile the microcracks formation in the pile concrete accelerates the loss of the pile bearing performance the soil properties can affect the bearing capacity of concrete piles therefore the design and construction of pile foundation in a sulfate rich environment need to consider the degradation of a pile to decrease the bearing capacity of a pile measures should be taken to ensure the normal service life of a pile acknowledgements this study was supported financially by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc via grant no 41772290 the authors would like to

23010,an analytical method is proposed in this paper to present the effect of the degradation development of concrete friction piles subjected to vertical loads on the pile bearing capacity this paper proposes an analytical solution of the sulfate diffusion reaction equation based on fick s law and danckwerts method in polar coordinates a chemo mechanics model is established to compute expansion based on the consideration of the pore filling furthermore the effect of concrete expansion on pile lateral soil effective stress is analyzed a model is based on a hyperbolic nonlinear relationship to simulate the behavior between the skin friction and the pile degradation along the pile soil interface additionally the sulfate distribution over time the changes of crack point along a pile radius and the skin friction are analyzed finally a parametric study with different external sulfate concentration the microcracks and different soil properties is performed the results show that the crack point moves into a pile due to external sulfate attack accelerating the invasion of sulfate the effective radius and the elastic modulus of a pile tend to decrease the degradation of concrete friction piles lead to loss of friction resulting in the bearing capacity of the pile decline the effect of different soil properties the on pile bearing capacity is different keywords concrete pile pile bearing capacity external sulfate attack degradation cavity expansion 1 introduction for many years engineering structures under vertical loads have been designed to resist external sulfate attack which occurs when sulfate in ground water saline soils or marine environments rajasekaran 2005 reacts with calcium aluminate hydrates cah in the concrete especially the durability and vertical load carrying properties of the foundations in civil engineering fields such as bridges and buildings exposed to sulfate rich environments are under threat after severe material degradation at present the existing studies focus on the degradation mechanism of the concrete material and the corresponding durability design to resist sulfate attack shannag and shaia 2003 santhanam et al 2006 müllauer et al 2013 siad et al 2015 bassuoni and rahman 2016 li et al 2016 in the application of foundation engineering design the design of concrete structure subjected to vertical loads in a sulfate rich environment has begun to be considered the effect of degradation of the concrete pile and some protective measures have been taken gb 50046 2008 gbt 50942 2014 however when the pile foundation is exposed to a sulfate rich environment the study of structure effects after material degradation has few reports brueckner et al 2012 the main structure effects can make concrete cross sectional area loss make the cover concrete to the reinforcing bars damage lead to pile foundation settlement make pile skin friction lose and so on the structural stability and durability suffer from the impact of the structure effects above the deterioration of the concrete pile surface may change the friction at the affect areas and reduces the vertical load bearing capacity of a pile however signs of deterioration of a substructure will be invisible and the public safety will be rarely endangered due to the gradual process of external sulfate attack on the other hand this is partly due to the large safety factor used in the design of piles the previous studies may provide useful tools and guidance for investigating the pile bearing capacity of concrete friction piles with consideration of external sulfate attack however it needs to point out that most of the available calculation methods of the pile bearing capacity applied in the sulfate free environment without consideration of external sulfate attack in addition there is little study on the effect of external sulfate attack on the bearing capacity of concrete friction piles especially the analytical frameworks for exploring the bearing capacity of concrete piles with sulfate attack it is evident that a new methodology for the analysis of effects of the degradation of concrete piles caused by sulfate attack on skin friction at pile soil interface is still needed the primary objective of this study is to develop an analytical method for the relationship between the skin friction and the pile displacement considering the degradation development of concrete piles under vertical loads the analytical solution of the proposed diffusion reaction equation is derived based on the degradation mechanism and the geometrical characteristics of piles a chemo mechanics model is established to compute expansions considering the effects of expansion of the pile degradation on the stress of pile lateral soil the elastic solutions for the stress and the radial displacement is derived based on cylindrical cavity expansion to analyze the relative compaction effect according to the displacement coordination of pile soil the formula of the shear strength of the pile soil interface is modified with the expansion degradation of piles and then the hyperbolic load transfer method is used to analyze the relationship between the pile skin friction and the pile soil relative displacement in fig 1 a schematic diagram of the different processes considered in this model is depicted 2 time varying model of pile skin friction 2 1 hyperbolic nonlinear model fig 2 shows a simple hyperbolic relationship between the pile skin friction and the displacement at the pile soil interface in a period time t with vertical load of a pile head increasing the pile skin friction increases nonlinearly without external sulfate attack the shear stress of the pile shaft nearly reaches the limiting value τsu when the pile displacement is increasing large based on this hyperbolic relationship zhang and zhang 2012 the pile skin friction can be expressed by the following equation when piles serve in a rich sulfate environment during their life span 1 τ s t w t a t b t w t where τ s t is the shaft shear stress in a period time t w t is the pile displacement in a period time t a t and b t empirical coefficients are greatly influenced by the properties of pile soil interface in this paper a t and b t are also influenced by sulfate attack the pile displacement w t is induced by the shaft shear stress and by the gradual nature of external sulfate attack w t randolph and wroth 1979 can be modified as follows 2 w t τ 0 t r 0 t g ln r m r 0 t where τ 0 t is the time dependent shear stress at pile soil interface r 0 t is the time dependent radius of the pile g is the shear modulus of the elastic soil outside of the disturbed zone r m is the radial distance from the pile centre to a point at which the shear stress induced by the pile can be considered to be negligible according to the expression suggested by lee 1993 the value of r m can be taken as r m 2 5 l ρ m 1 υ where l is the length of the pile ρ m is modified inhomogeneity factor and υ is the poisson s ratio of the elastic soil the modified inhomogeneity factor can be expressed randolph and wroth 1979 3 ρ m g l 2 g l where g l 2 and g l are the values of the shear modulus at pile mid depth and pile base respectively ρ m of homogeneous soil is 1 the time dependent coefficient a t can be taken as the initial stiffness of the shaft shear stress pile displacement relationship of the pile soil interface as shown in fig 2 the value of a randolph and wroth 1978 can be modified using the following equation considering the time effect 4 a t r 0 t g ln r m r the asymptote of the shaft shear stress pile displacement curve can be considered as the time dependent coefficient b t when the pile displacement reaches at a large value as shown in fig 2 this asymptote skin friction τsu is approximately equal to the maximum possible value of the pile soil interface τf t by means of a failure ratio rsf it can use τf t to express τsu the value of b t can be expressed 5 b t τ s u τ f t r sf according to the shaft shear stress displacement curve the values of rsf are supposed to be in the range 0 80 0 95 clough and duncan 1971 this paper takes 0 88 the following equation can be used to calculate τ f t azzouz et al 1990 yang et al 2006 6 τ f t k 0 k h k 0 σ v t tan φ δ φ where k h is lateral earth pressure coefficient σ v t is effective overburden pressure at a certain depth with consideration of expansion as shown in the next section δ is friction angle of pile soil interface k 0 is the in situ earth pressure coefficient the value of which was approximately estimated by k 0 1 sin φ φ is the angle of shearing resistance of the surrounding soil kulhawy 1984 suggested that the value δ φ is 0 9 and chose a value of 0 8 for k h k 0 2 2 the relative compaction effect in a period time t the expansion development of concrete piles underground has a relative compaction effect on soil around piles which can change the effective overburden pressure σ v t the relative compaction effect is defined as the very small displacements and strains of soil caused by the expansion of piles in service exposed to external sulfate attack which is different from the compaction effect the compaction effect occurs in the construction of jacked piles while the relative compaction effect occurs in the process of piles whole life when pile service in sulfate rich environments compaction effect is obvious for big pile volume while relative compaction effect is closely relate to expansion caused by material degradation the expansion is generally small and the compaction effect is mild the expansion development of concrete piles in erosion soil is regard as cavity expansion in infinite homogeneous saturated soil fig 3 shows a planar view of a cylindrical cavity with an initial cavity radius of r 0 which expands to another cavity radius r p as the internal cavity pressure increases from the initial in situ stress to σ p regardless of the pile end expansion effects on soil layer deterioration expansion of concrete pile shaft results in soil lateral extrusion which can be considered as cylindrical expansion therefore the equilibrium equation in the cylindrical polar coordinate system can be expressed as 7 σ r r σ r σ θ r 0 where σ r and σ θ are normal stresses acting in the radial and tangential directions respectively the elastic solution for radial displacement can be obtained as follows yu 2000 8 u σ p σ 0 2 g r p 2 r that the pile expansive deformation is equal to the radial displacement of soil gives 9 u t r p r 0 ε c t r 0 where ε c t is linear expansion strain of pile concrete in a period time t as shown in section 3 hence the stress of pile soil interface in a period time t is obtained 10 σ p t σ 0 2 g ε c t 1 ε c t 3 chemo mechanics model to obtain the linear expansion strain ε c t a chemo mechanics model is needed to build for the quantitative analysis of the concrete erosion expansion 3 1 diffusion reaction model the previous studies primarily focused on the sulfate diffusion reaction in a semi infinite reinforced concrete structure with a plane surface however the sulfate diffusion reaction equation in a semi infinite reinforced concrete structure is different from that in a concrete pile to describe the external sulfate attack in concrete piles a diffusion reaction model for external sulfate is established the cross section of a concrete pile casted in situ is mostly circle the radial distance is r mm to simplify this problem the hoop and axial diffusion of the sulfate is assumed to be negligible additionally when sulfate is immobilized by an irreversible reaction the rate of sulfate consumption in a pile is kc where constant k represents the rate of take up of sulfates and maybe considered as the solubility rate tixier and mobasher 2003a then the equation for the diffusion reaction of sulfate along the radius of the concrete pile is expressed as 11 c t d 2 c r 2 r 1 c r k c where c is the sulfate concentration d represents diffusion coefficient c s is the environment sulfate concentration c 0 is the internal sulfate concentration then the initial and boundary conditions of eq 11 can be expressed as 12 c r 0 c 0 0 r r 0 c r 0 t c s t 0 the solution cannot be derived by the method of separation of variables due to the limited boundary condition the danckwerts method is found to solve this problem crank 1975 let u 1 be the solution of the equation for diffusion in radius in absence of reaction i e of 13 c t d 2 c r 2 r 1 c r for the same boundary conditions the boundary condition is homogenized as follows 14 u 1 r t c r t c s then 15 c t d 2 c r 2 r 1 c r 16 c r 0 u 0 u s 0 r r 0 c r 0 t 0 t 0 using the method of separation of variables the solution is obtained as follows 17 c r t n 1 c n 2 c 0 c s n 1 j 0 μ n r r 0 β n b j 1 β n r 0 e d β n 2 t where μ n n 1 2 is the positive root of j 0 x 0 and j 0 x and j 1 x are bessel functions of order zero one and zero two respectively of the first kind β n μ n r 0 by substituting eq 17 into eq 14 eq 14 can be rewritten as 18 u 1 c r t c s c s 2 c 0 c s

chemical reactions of sulfate ions with the unreacted hydration compounds of the cement paste the potential volume expansion causes the concrete deterioration the most relevant chemical reactions that are generally accepted to potentially take place during the exposure to sulfate solution are now summarized tixier and mobasher 2003b sarkar et al 2010 idiart et al 2011 ikumi et al 2014 yin et al

tensile strength in the second step the gypsum conducts a set of reactions with unreacted tricalcium aluminate c3a grains eq 22 tetracalcium aluminate hydrate c4ah13 eq 23 monosulfoaluminate c 4 a s h

consumption of cementitious materials and the expansion of product accelerate the deterioration of concrete in this study ettringite is assumed to the only reaction product to govern the concrete expansion the role of gypsum in the process of the concrete expansion has not been quantified neville 2004 so the possible expansion due to gypsum formation is neglected according to the three aluminate phases considered in the present model the volume can be calculated as indicated in eq 25 25 δ v i v v c 6 a s 3 h 32 v i a i v c s h 2 v i a i v c s h 2 v c 6 a s 3 h 32 v i a i v c s h 2 1 where v i is the molar volume of each reactant a i is the stoichiometric coefficient the δ v i v values obtained for c 3 a c 4 ah 13 c 4 a s h 12 are reported 1 31 0 48 0 55 respectively clifton and ponnersheim 1994 the expansion reduction will depend on the capacity of the pore structure to accommodate ettringite and the capacity of the matrix to resist expansive stress assuming isotropy in the volumetric expansion the total volumetric strain is defined as 26 ε v i 1 n δ v i v f φ 0 where f is the fraction of capillary porosity being filled which is usually in a range between 5 and 40 tixier and mobasher 2003a the linear strain of concrete is as follows tixier and mobasher 2003a 27 ε c ε v 3 the capillary porosity φ 0 is estimated according to a powers model 28 φ 0 m a x υ c w c 0 36 α w c 0 32 0 where α is the degree of hydration of the cement υ c is the volumetric fraction of cement in the concrete w c is the water cement ratio 3 3 mechanical characteristics of pile concrete degradation considering piles exposed to the external sulfate attack the concrete elastic modulus changes over time to simplify the analysis the elastic modulus of concrete pile plane is divided into the modulus e c of cracked area and uncracked area as the initial elastic modulus e 0 without consideration the effect of capillary porosity being filled on the elastic modulus as shown in fig 4 when the stress of concrete increases to exceed tensile strength σ e ε f t concrete damages with cracks growing the damage parameter related to a crack density parameter referred to as cd number of cracks per unit volume has the relation budiansky and o connell 1976 29 ω 16 9 c d the crack density has been empirically correlated to the strain tixier and mobasher 2003a 30 c d 0 16 1 ε e ε 2 3 where ε is the strain ε e represents the threshold strain at which the micro cracks start forming the value of which is not given tixier and mobasher 2003a sarkar et al 2010 generally the stress strain relationship is linear when the stress is 40 60 of peak tensile stress in this paper the threshold strain is taken as 50 of peak tensile stress the modulus e c of cracking area is expressed as follows tixier and mobasher 2003a 31 e c e 0 1 ω where e 0 is the initial elastic modulus the weighted average of the modulus of two areas is the modulus of a pile after erosion 32 e r 0 2 e 0 r 0 2 r 0 2 e c r 0 2 where r 0 is the effective radius of a deteriorated pile by substituting eq 29 31 into eq 32 eq 32 can be rewritten as 33 e e 0 1 0 284 1 r 0 2 r 0 2 1 ε e ε 2 3 4 analysis of the proposed method at the first step the sulfate distributions have been calculated with the analytical solution of diffusion reaction equation then the degradation of a concrete pile has been analyzed the expansion and crack development in a pile has also presented the expansion can lead to the stress increasing and the displacement increasing of the soil around the pile finally considering the external sulfate attack the relationship between the pile skin friction and the displacement is obtained markedly different experimental conditions and methods as well as a limited number of reported values make it difficult to choose a reasonable value for the diffusivity d the diffusivity d is a constant value that is suggested to be between 0 75 10 12 m2 s 1 and 9 10 12 m2 s 1 tixier and mobasher 2003b the kinetic rate k is suggested to be between 10 6 and 10 9 s 1 tixier 2000 it is assumed that the diffusion coefficient and reaction rate are d 6 10 12 m2 s 1 and k 10 9 s 1 respectively in addition in section 4 4 2 influence of microcracks on the sulfate diffusion coefficient was considered main parameters such as pile geometry soil physical parameters especially boston blue clay in section 4 2 and section 4 3 environmental condition chemical reaction parameters physical and mechanical parameters of concrete considered for the proposed method in this case are listed in table 1 4 1 analysis of the proposed method to verify the present method an experimental test of concrete piles under external sulfate attack was performed the calculated results of the analytical method and experimental data are compared the concrete specimen geometrical size is φ100 mm 200 mm the water cement ratio is 0 55 as shown in table 2 all specimens were demolded after 24 h of casting and were cured in a condition of 20 3 c and 95 relative humidity the specimens were immersed in 5 sodium sulfate after specimens curing 28 days the initial content of sulfate in the specimen is measured the sodium sulfate solutions were replenished every week to maintain a uniform concentration when the sulfate attack occurs at the end of 30 d 90 d 180 d and 270 d the specimens were removed from the sodium sulfate solution and air dried powder samples were then taken at different cover depths centre of gravity position 1 87 mm 5 5 mm 9 5 mm 13 5 mm and 17 5 mm from the exposed surfaces 1 g of powder was obtained at each depth and placed in a desiccator to dry for 2 h the dried powder was then submerged in 50 ml of distilled water in a covered plastic cup for 48 h finally the sulfate concentration of different depths in the specimen was measured by spectrophotometer the calculated results of crank 1975 the present solution and experimental data are compared as shown in fig 5 the results show that the sulfate distribution profiles from crank 1975 and the present solution along pile radius at different times have a good agreement furthermore the sulfate distribution profiles from experimental test and the present solution also have a good fit therefore the validity of the proposed method is verified the experimental data shows that the concentration and depth of sulfate in the concrete increase over time fig 6 shows the effective radius and the modulus of a pile decreasing with time sulfate can react with the hydration products of cement to form ettringite degrading the concrete into disruptive expansion which lead to the loss of the cross sectional area of a concrete pile namely the effective radius and the modulus of a pile decreases with external sulfate attack during the service the reduction tendency of the effective radius and the elastic modulus of a pile is basically identical but the decrement is different the effective radius of a pile reduced nearly by 25 while the concrete modulus decreased by 2 5 4 2 crack development of piles and stress development of soil the steps for the solution of sulfate critical concentration of concrete crack the strain of concrete crack is obtained according to the stress strain relation of concrete then the consumption of sulfate is calculated according to the content of the reactant in concrete with eq 20 24 according to the law of mass conservation the local consumption by sulfate reaction of sulfate ions is equal to the difference between the divergence of the ion flow due to diffusion and change rate of concentration therefore the time of diffusion to the position is obtained the sulfate concentration at the boundary of the crack area and the uncrack area is obtained as the critical concentration of concrete crack fig 7 shows the crack expands to the inside of a pile over time it takes short time to degrade the concrete into crack near the pile surface because the high sulfate concentration near the pile surface leads to full action with concrete hydration products the farther from the pile surface the lower the sulfate concentration is crack extends from pile surface to inside at a slower speed as a result concrete crack position moving speed is closely related to sulfate diffusion reaction in a pile the expansion develops over time corresponding to the crack extending according to the displacement compatibility of the pile soil the expansion gives the stress development of soil boston blue clay fig 8 shows the expansion and pile lateral soil stress changing with time the expansion of a pile and the soil stress increase rapidly in early stage then they increased slowly this is because the sulfate diffusion depth increases but its concentration is low and increases slowly additionally as shown in fig 8 the increment of the displacement and the stress around a pile is very little this attributes to the displacement and the stress of soil around a pile subjected to the expansion of pile concrete the concrete is brittle material the tensile strength is low and the concrete expansion strain is very small with the conditions of displacement coordination and stress balance the displacement and the stress of soil around a pile caused by the concrete expansion is relatively small 4 3 skin friction of piles exposed to external sulfate attack the degradation of a pile caused by external sulfate attack the loss of effective radius and the modulus of a pile lead to loss of the skin friction while the increase of soil stress caused by pile expansion may be has a positive effect on the skin friction this study investigated the effects of two factors on unit skin friction respectively fig 9 shows the relationship between the unit skin friction and the pile displacement considering the loss of effective radius compared with the measured values he 2002 and the relationship between the unit skin friction and the pile displacement in a normal environment it is found that the unit skin friction of a pile in a sulfate rich environment decreases over time with sulfate attack the percentage loss of unit skin friction of a pile is approximately 5 9 and 8 8 respectively at 5 years and 30 years for a particular displacement w 10 mm fig 10 shows the relationship between the unit skin friction and the pile displacement considering the effect of expansion compared with the measured values he 2002 and the relationship between the unit skin friction and the pile displacement in a normal environment it is found that the increase of the unit skin friction is not obvious when the soil stress increases in the other word the increase of soil stress caused by pile expansion has no positive effect on the skin friction because the soil stress is too small to increase the skin friction according to the effect of degradation of a pile on unit skin friction from figs 9 and 10 it is concluded that the unit skin friction decreases due to the degradation of a pile with external sulfate attack which leads pile larger settlement in a sulfate rich environment one of pile degradation types is local degradation due to the decline or rise of the ground salt water the concrete pile suffers from the wet and dry cycle of the ground salt water which makes the local serious corrosion of pile shaft as shown in fig 11 therefore the effect of vertical expansion of concrete piles and deterioration of concrete pile shaft on pile soil friction coefficient can be ignored only the radial expansion of concrete piles should be considered for a friction pile the single pile bearing capacity is mainly provided by pile side friction fig 12 shows the relationship between the vertical load and the displacement the measured values are fitted as a hyperbolic model of the transfer function the regression coefficient is a 0 0716 and b 0 022 yang et al 2016 the results show that hyperbolic model of transfer function fitted by measured values and the modified model at 30 years in this paper are of good match which verifies the validity of the modified model furthermore it is found that pile degradation has an obvious negative effect on skin friction according to the relationship between skin friction q and displacement w when the pile diameter is less than 800 mm the ultimate load is defined as the load corresponding to a displacement 40 mm gb50007 2011 when the pile diameter is not less than 800 mm the ultimate load is defined as the load corresponding to a displacement equal to 5 of the pile diameter jgj106 2014 the former is national standard and the latter is the industry standard in china the two values of total settlement complement each other it is noted that differences are great between countries in the stipulation of ultimate bearing capacity according to the total settlement of pile top which is related to the safety factor of each country especially the requirement of superstructure on settlement of pile foundation to quantify the effect of pile degradation on skin friction fig 13 shows the skin friction decreases over time when the pile displacement is 40 mm during the 30 years the skin friction reduces by 24 3 which means a 24 3 reduction in the vertical bearing capacity of the single pile as to friction pile it is can be concluded that the external sulfate attack result in a larger settlement of a pile due to the pile degradation 4 4 parametric analysis 4 4 1 influence of sulfate concentration c s fig 14 shows the load settlement curve for concrete piles exposed to 0 5 1 2 sulfate solution respectively it is concluded that the concentration of sulfate has a significant influence on the load settlement curve of a concrete pile on the same load condition a higher sulfate concentration yields larger settlement this is because a higher external sulfate concentration leads to faster corrosion speed of the pile concrete the deterioration of the pile concrete accelerates therefore the loss of the cross sectional area increases additionally the contact surface between the pile shaft and the soil is lose due to the degradation and spalling of concrete resulting in the decrease of lateral friction resistance and the load capacity of the pile 4 4 2 influence of microcracks fig 15 shows the pile load settlement curve for the conditions of microcracks w c 50 μm of the pile concrete and the uncracked pile concrete as shown in fig 15 the existence of concrete microcracks has a weakening effect on the pile bearing capacity the loss of pile bearing capacity increases with the settlement increasing when the settlement is 20 mm the loss of pile bearing capacity is about 5 additionally it is not as influential as the external sulfate concentration this is because sulfate reaction with the cementitious materials generates dilatability products such as ettringite pore filling and the formation of tiny cracks after pore filling have different effects on sulfate diffusion coefficient the filling of concrete pores reduces the sulfate diffusion coefficient while the formation of microcracks makes the diffusion coefficient of sulfate increase therefore the increasing of diffusion coefficient during the microcrack formation period speeds up the diffusion of sulfate which accelerates the deterioration of pile concrete the bearing capacity of pile loses gradually 4 4 3 influence of soil property in the sulfate environment the soil property as an important factor affects the pile bearing capacity as shown in table 1 the physical parameters of the three types of soil are given combined with the soil parameters and external sulfate attack the load settlement curves in the noncorrosive environment and the corrosive environment are obtained as shown in fig 16 it can be concluded that under the sulfate attack the deterioration of concrete pile has little impact on the load settlement relationship when the settlement is small especially the boston blue clay the effect of soil parameters on sulfate attack is obvious when the settlement is large when the settlement value is 20 mm the load of a concrete pile in boston blue clay sand and clay lose by 12 14 and 26 respectively 5 conclusions this study based on the hyperbolic nonlinear model presents the effect of pile degradation development on the pile bearing capacity compared with the skin friction of a pile in the normal environment the conclusions are as follows 1 with external sulfate attack the concrete pile degraded with time such as the loss of effective radius and the modulus of a concrete pile during 20 years the decrease of effective radius and the modulus is obvious after 20 years the decrease rate of the effective radius and the modulus is small the same tendency is the crack development along the pile radius 2 the expansion increases with time the relative compaction effect occurs which leads to the increase of effective stress of the soil around a pile 3 the decreasing of the effective radius and the modulus of a pile leads to decrease the skin friction the increase of skin friction is not obvious when the soil stress increases the skin friction decreases due to external sulfate attack which leads pile a larger settlement in a sulfate rich environment 4 external sulfate concentration has a significantly influence on the bearing capacity of concrete pile the microcracks formation in the pile concrete accelerates the loss of the pile bearing performance the soil properties can affect the bearing capacity of concrete piles therefore the design and construction of pile foundation in a sulfate rich environment need to consider the degradation of a pile to decrease the bearing capacity of a pile measures should be taken to ensure the normal service life of a pile acknowledgements this study was supported financially by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc via grant no 41772290 the authors would like to

23011,reinforcement bar corrosion induced by chloride ions ingress is one of the dominating causes for the deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in salty environment thus it is particularly important to accurately predict chloride concentration in concretes and evaluate the structural service life this paper presents the results of an indoor experimental investigation on chloride diffusion in plain and reinforced mortar specimens exposed to tidal zone which is simulated by a self design marine environment automatic simulation device concrete covering layer was divided into major influence area mia and secondary influence area sia to accurately describe the chloride ion concentration distribution characteristics mia is the region affected by direct and indirect blocking effect of reinforcement bar while sia is the area only influenced by the indirect one also the relative influence coefficient c re was defined to measure the impact of reinforcement bar on the chloride ion ingress the results indicate that indirect blocking effect of rebar resulting from changes of material properties is the major cause for the chloride ion concentration distribution in sia and it is only relative to the diffusion depth whereas direct blocking effect of bar caused by physical obstruction to accumulate chloride ions contributes most to the chloride increase in mia and it is correlated to the diffusion depth exposure time and diameter of bar finally an empirical prediction model of chloride concentration in concrete covering layer considering the effect of reinforcement presence is proposed keywords chloride concentration prediction reinforcement bar effect covering layer 1 introduction reinforcement bar corrosion induced by chloride ions is generally regarded as one of the dominating causes for the deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in salty environment angst et al 2009 du et al 2015a 2015b tuutti 1982 divided the degradation process of reinforcement bar into two periods initiation and propagation stages in the first one chloride ions can reduce the ph of concrete pore solution break the passive film of steel bar embedded in concrete morris and vazquez 2002 saremi and mahallati 2002 and initiate the corrosion of rebar critical chloride content which means the chloride threshold value required for rebar corrosion may show a great scatter bastidas arteaga and schoefs 2015 and thus it is necessary to consider the discreteness of critical chloride content in engineering design and application also it has been identified to be one of the most significant parameters to evaluate the remaining service life of existing structures gulikers 2006 as for the propagation stage migration of chloride ions into and out of the corrosion pit is required to sustain anodic dissolution and sufficient chloride concentration at the surface of bar is necessary to maintain the aggressive pitting corrosion angst et al 2011 therefore it appears to be particularly important to accurately estimate the chloride concentration cl at the surface of bar close to the exposed side over the past few decades a considerable number of researches have been done to describe the chloride diffusion process and predict chloride concentration in concrete or mortar considering various factors for instance thomas and phil 1999 conducted long term field and laboratory tests and proposed predictive model to describe time dependent chloride diffusion in cementitious materials with supplementary such as fly ash or slag martin perez et al 2000 established mathematical models to demonstrate that chloride binding capacity could reduce the chloride diffusivity in cementitious system and shorten the chloride penetration depth song et al 2004 analyzed the effect of environmental factors construction quality cover thickness material property and structure type on the reinforcement bar corrosion in concrete based on a real project and field survey bastidas arteaga et al 2011 presented a comprehensive model of chloride penetration considering the uncertainties of input parameters materials properties and environmental actions bastidas arteaga and schoefs 2012 then proposed a new method integrating the uncertainties of material properties environmental actions and the effect of imperfect inspections to improve the performance of maintenance strategies for corroding rc structures in chloride contaminated atmosphere zhang et al 2017 discussed the impact of admixture on chloride time varying diffusivity by a man made simulating drying wetting test they claimed that the addition of fly ash basalt fiber and silica fume could increase the anti permeability of concrete especially the first one wang et al 2018a suggested a time and depth dependent model of chloride diffusion coefficient determined by boltzmann matano method for concrete members considering the effect of coarse aggregate the results showed that chloride diffusion coefficient decreased as coarse aggregate volume fraction or maximum sizes of aggregate increased othmen et al 2018 presented a statistical investigation of surface chloride content and diffusion coefficient to analyze the chloride profiles in a beam of real structure exposed in splash zone for 28 years other influence factors of chloride diffusivity in concrete have also been investigated in a large amount of literature not all listed here all these studies made great contribution to the discussion of chloride ingression in concrete and the determination of chloride concentration in deep penetration depth however less adequate is their concern about the effect of reinforcement bar presence on chloride distribution comparing to the irregular shape and random distribution of coarse aggregates steel bar can be deemed to be a kind of special cylindrical aggregate with relatively fixed position in mortar because of the bar s high hardness and density the transportation of chloride ions can be postulated to bypass the steel bar instead of piercing through it consequently chloride concentration distribution may be influenced by reinforcement bar somehow in fact the accumulation phenomenon of chloride iron at the surface of bar close to the exposed side was reported by hansen and saouma 1999 as early as 1999 they numerically simulated reinforced concrete deterioration in bridge deck and illustrated that higher chloride concentration cl could be detected at the front surface of reinforcing steel in comparison with other position at the same depth subsequently kranc et al 2002 also found the increase of cl at the front surface of bar by numerical analysis and defined attenuation coefficient to investigate the earlier initiation time of steel corrosion oh and jang 2003 applied finite element analysis to evaluate the chloride cluster and argued that larger diameter of rebar caused greater accumulation of cl as a result the initiation time of steel corrosion would be shortened about 30 40 due to the consideration of bar existence these literature presented a compelling argument for the chloride accumulation in front of the bar and a serious worry about overestimating structural service life whereas few physical tests about this issue were carried out to solve the problem of lack of experiments outdoor exposure tests were conducted at dania beach florida and all reinforced concrete slabs were cyclically ponded with a sodium chloride solution yu and hartt 2007 yu et al 2007 the results stated that the presence of reinforcement bar not only had obstruction effect to block the chloride ions but also interfered with the spatial arrangement of coarse aggregates immediate to the bar influencing the chloride concentration distribution yu and hartt 2011 pronounced that bars with larger size better corrosion resistance less cover thickness or a more flat leading edge could reduce the time to corrosion they also mentioned a phenomenon that the chloride content at the front surface of bar was approximately 1 4 times to the chloride content at the same depth as the bar after 10 year chloride exposure duration which was reported in an overview and sensitivity study of various mechanisms during chloride transportation by boddy et al 1999 despite of all these laudable achievements there are still some aspects should be improved as follows 1 apart from numerical simulation it is necessary to conduct more physical experiments 2 the investigation of rebar presence effect on cl distribution should not be only limited in the exact area in front of the bar but in a more expansive region in covering layer 3 a quantitative method to estimate this influence and predict cl considering the existence of bars should be further developed wang et al 2016 have investigated the chloride diffusion in plain and reinforced concrete members via an indoor drying wetting cycles experiment to simulate the exposure in tidal zone a single cycle consisted of 12 h wet and 12 h dry which is inconsistent with the actual tidal fluctuation in marine environment direct and indirect blocking effects of the reinforcement bar were defined to describe the physical obstruction and chloride diffusion coefficient variation respectively in this preliminary work only chloride ion concentration at the front surface of rebar was analyzed and a quantitative time depth dependent chloride diffusion model considering rebar presence was then given to predict the cl at the front surface of rebar the results showed that larger diameter of bars led to greater effect which was consistent with the findings of other literature oh and jang 2003 yu and hartt 2011 to compare with the preliminary achievements further research has been done in this work to explore the chloride distribution considering reinforcement bar presence therefore this paper seeks to 1 conduct further physical experiments in mortar specimens exposed in real time tidal zone simulated by artificial marine environment automatic simulation device rather than the drying wetting tests to focus on the essential impact of bar on chloride concentration distribution 2 extend the influence area of rebar to the whole concrete covering layer rather than the only apex of rebar closed to the exposure side 3 suggest an empirical model to predict chloride distribution in concrete covering layer considering the impact of bar existence 2 experimental procedures 2 1 test specimens to concentrate on the essential impact of reinforcement bar on chloride concentration distribution mortar specimens were used in this test ordinary portland cement p o 42 5 with density of 3100 kg m3 was used for all test specimens river sand with fineness modulus of 2 7 and apparent density of 2610 kg m3 was used as fine aggregate distilled water was used as batch water and the water to cement ratio w c was 0 54 according to the recommended value for structures of tidal zone in chinese standard jgj55 2011 2011 the mix proportion for all specimens is listed in table 1 in this test 100 day was set to be the first exposure time so as to detect the chloride concentration at the bar s apex total 15 mortar prisms 100 mm 100 mm 400 mm were casted with one embedded hot rolled plain bar hpb 300 close to the lateral surface with 20 mm covering layer thickness of cover c 20 mm and separated into 5 groups with different diameters of rebar no bars 8 mm 12 mm 16 mm 20 mm 5 specimens per group for three fixed exposure times during the first day after casting the specimens were covered with sheet and cured in standard curing chamber at 20 3 c over 90 relative humidity rh gb t 50081 2002 2002 next they were demoulded and cured in saturated solution of calcium hydroxide for 28 days to avoid leaching every side of specimens except diffusion surface was then coated with epoxy to ensure one dimensional chloride ingress each prism had its own identifier as shown in table 2 the first number represents diameter of rebar abbreviated to d in the prism and the number after the hyphen is exposure duration 100 140 180 days 2 2 test setup for chloride exposure and chloride concentration determination affected by lunar gravity and terrain the frequency of high low tide can be controlled by diurnal tide semi diurnal tide or mixed semi diurnal tide there exists diurnal tide along most coastlines in south china sea especially the beibu gulf which is one of the most typical diurnal tidal areas in the world to simulate the marine environment in diurnal tidal zone artificial marine environment automatic simulation device in fig 1 was developed independently it was composed by storage tank test tank temperature and humidity control system air blast system flow rate control system and manipulation platform comparing to the totally wet and totally dry conditions in traditional wetting drying cycles wang et al 2014 this device can effectively and realistically achieve real time rising and ebb tide cycling simulation which is more approximated to the true circumstance it can not only control the water level to go up and down gradually just like the flow in tidal zone but also adjust temperature humidity illumination wind and other ocean environment factors 3 5 sodium chloride solution was configured in storage tank instead of seawater and all mortar specimens were vertically placed on a table 200 mm high in test tank for chloride exposure upper and lower water levels were set to be 600 mm and 200 mm respectively flow between two tanks was controlled by solenoid valve water pump and flowmeter precisely for the sake of simplification diurnal tidal cycle in this test was set to be 24 h including 12 h for rising tide and other 12 h for ebb tide after required chloride exposure for 100 140 and 180 days corresponding specimens were taken out of test tank and successively drilled an in site exposure test xu et al 2011 was referred during the sample drilling procedure the testing structure top elevation 6 00 m and bottom elevation 1 00 m was in typical tidal zone according to annual tide observations concrete powder was probed at height of 1 8 m 2 3 m 2 8 m 3 3 m 3 8 m 4 8 m 5 25 m and 5 8 m respectively the maximum of chloride ion concentration along elevation met the height of 2 3 m 2 8 m and 3 3 m which means the midway down of the observed structure similarly mortar powder was extracted in the same region to be explicit fig 2 illustrates the whole sampling process in present experiment specimens were averagely divided into four parts numbered i to iv from the bottom to top and part ii was applied to drill testing samples during the drilling process part ii was averagely divided into two parts as parallel specimens to get concrete powder samples respectively on account of the symmetry of prism central axis normal to the diffusion surface was set to be x axis and y axis was supposed along the diffusion surface sixteen holes were drilled perpendicularly at four different diffusion depths x 3 5 mm 8 mm 14 mm 18 5 mm and four varying distances from the central axis y 0 mm 1 5 d 2 mm 26 5 mm 46 5 mm all of the above location details of drilling holes represented their center lines and the diameter of each hole was 3 mm note that all specimens were drilled at the same location no matter it is plain or reinforced mortar after being sized through a sieve with 0 63 mm apertures all powder samples were dried for 2 h 105 5 c and cooled down to room temperature chloride ion selective electrode was then applied to the quick determination of water soluble chloride concentration i e free chloride concentration jgjt 322 2013 2013 3 results 3 1 absolute influence of reinforcement bar on chloride concentration for the sake of analyzing the effect of steel bar existence on chloride distribution in covering layer chloride concentration profiles in plain and reinforced mortar specimens were compared absolute influence of reinforcement bar presence on chloride distribution was defined as eq 1 1 c a b c r c m where c ab is absolute influence coefficient of rebar c r is chloride concentration cl in reinforced mortar specimens c m is cl in plain mortar specimens note that c r and c m are in the same position and c m is the average value of cl at a given depth fig 3 shows c ab in each prism at different diffusion depth and time according to the uncertainty analysis elshami et al 2016 dash lines connect scatters to make tendency of c ab clearer fig 3 indicates that c ab changes obviously along the diffusion depth x and it is always less than zero when x is in range of 5 mm 10 mm in other words the cl in plain mortar specimens is always greater than that in reinforced specimens at the same location within this range of penetration depth moreover fig 3 also demonstrates that c ab is always more than zero at deeper penetration depth after 15 mm which is called accumulation phenomenon of cl and this result coincides with measurements in other literature wang et al 2016 yu and hartt 2007 however the value of c ab disperses causing difficulties to describe it by a unified expression to be explicit c ab at y 46 5 mm in each specimen is compared in fig 4 on the one hand as shown in fig 4 the difference between c ab in each group is larger than the measurement error according to the error bars in other word the change of c ab in different group is not the measurement error on the other hand as shown in fig 4 a with a given diameter of bar the trend of c ab along diffusion time differs from each specimen also it can be seen in fig 4 b at a given diffusion time the trend of c ab with bar diameter differs too both figures indicate that the variation of c ab over diffusion time and with bar diameter is irregular thus the effects of diffusion time and bar diameter on c ab are hard to tell therefore it should be doubtful whether c ab is appropriate to evaluate the effect of bar on cl in covering layer or not furthermore chloride concentration gradient in mortar or concrete is always high due to the low permeability of materials and therefore greater c ab may not be equal to greater impact for example cl at diffusion surface increases from 0 4 to 0 45 while cl at the apex of bar may grow from 0 05 to 0 1 because of the equal absolute increments of 0 05 the same impact of bar on cl at these two places can be concluded according to the absolute influence coefficient c ab but it is necessary to consider whether the conclusion is right or not although the absolute increments are identical the relative increments are 12 5 and 50 respectively it is reasonable to believe that the effect of rebar presence on chloride concentration is greater at the apex of bars in spite of the same absolute concentration difference consequently relative influence of rebar presence should be analyzed and might be more rational to measure the impact other than the absolute one 3 2 relative influence of reinforcement bar on chloride concentration in view of the analysis and doubt above relative influence of reinforcement bar on chloride distribution was then defined by eq 2 2 c r e c r c m where c re is relative influence coefficient of reinforcement bar c r and c m are same as those in eq 1 c re in each group at different diffusion depth and time is shown in fig 5 scatters are also connected by dash lines to be describable apparently data divergence is reduced and trends are almost consistent thus it is preliminarily thought that c re can reflect the impact of rebar on chloride concentration cl also c re below 1 still can be found within the range of penetration depth x between 5 mm and 10 mm which is accordant with c ab in fig 3 therefore it can be acclaimed that the cl within this diffusion depth may decline due to the bar existence which will be explained in the section of discussion what s more except for the only point right at the leading edge of bar x 18 5 mm y 0 mm c re in nearly every test hole at the same depth in any specimen are approximated to focus on the long term prediction of chloride concentration c re in all test holes except for the one x 18 5 mm y 0 mm at 140 and 180 days have been depicted in fig 6 it can be seen that nearly all measurements are within 15 error range of average c re in every test holes in other words it seems that c re is only related to the diffusion depth and has nothing to do with diffusion time and the diameter of bar as for the special point exactly in front of the bar the greater c re implies that more chloride concentration cl has been accumulated at the position and greater impact of reinforcement bar has occurred this accumulation phenomenon of cl has been reported in some literature boddy et al 1999 hansen and saouma 1999 kranc et al 2002 oh and jang 2003 wang et al 2016 yu and hartt 2007 2011 yu et al 2007 as blocking effect of rebar broadly speaking this blocking effect includes both direct blocking effect caused by physical obstruction to collect chloride ions and indirect blocking effect resulting from changes of material properties such as diffusion coefficient wang et al 2016 yu and hartt 2007 yu et al 2007 in order to accurately describe the chloride ion distribution characteristics within covering layer considering reinforcement bar presence the cross section of cover has been divided into two parts major influence area mia and secondary influence area sia as depicted in fig 7 according to fig 5 at specific x 3 5 mm 8 mm or 14 mm the corresponding holes at the same depth x share almost same c re in addition when x 18 5 mm holes at y 1 5 d 2 mm 26 5 mm and 46 5 mm have almost same c re too whereas at the point of x 18 5 mm y 0 mm c re is always higher than the value in other holes at the same depth as shown in fig 5 in other words little physical obstruction can be observed away from the bar yu and hartt 2007 believed that rebar might change the chloride diffusion within region of 3 mm in front of the bar lv 2017 acclaimed the impact region of bar can be evaluated to be 4 5 mm around the bar because of the spatial distribution of coarse aggregates in consequence as shown in fig 7 mia is the area right in front of the bar x c 3 5 c and y 0 d 2 c is the thickness of cover affected by both direct and indirect blocking effect while sia is the rest area in covering layer only influenced by indirect blocking effect the impact of bar existence on chloride distribution in these two areas will be discussed in following two sections respectively 3 3 secondary influence area of reinforcement bar sia secondary influence area of steel bar sia is the area away from the bar only affected by the indirect blocking effect firstly at the depth of 3 5 mm c re are always around 1 which implies that nearly no impact of bar can be found close to the diffusion surface also c re is always below 1 within the range of penetration depth x between 5 mm and 10 mm involving the variation of diffusion coefficient which will be explained later furthermore when x 3 5 mm 8 mm and 14 mm c re in each borehole with the same depth x are close to each other regardless of exposure duration and diameter of bars while at the depth of 18 5 mm c re in different group changes slightly as diffusion time goes by and the longer the exposure the smaller the changes are since long term chloride concentration prediction in mortar is mainly investigated the variety of c re in sia over time can be ignored moreover it is easy to understand that accumulation of cl would decrease gradually away from the position of rebar even a downward trend of c re can be found at deeper depth x 18 5 mm and longer diffusion time t 140 d and 180 d as shown in fig 5 the reason of this tendency may be owing to the absence of direct blocking of bars in sia y 0 d 2 the chloride ion can penetrate deeper without rebar in the way and the relative change of cl will consequently decline reflected as a lower c re note that there is no difference between c re and indirect blocking effect in sia to sum up c re in sia is only related to the diffusion depth x and have nothing to do with diffusion time t and diameter of bar d so influence coefficient of diffusion depth x on indirect blocking effect is defined as f x to estimate the trend of c re versus x and c re is equal to f x in sia to predict cl in reinforced mortar after long term chloride exposure accurately and conveniently f x i e c re in sia can be expressed as eq 3 3 c r e sia f x α x β x γ 2 φ where α 0 1437 β 691 7 γ 20 517 and φ 181 23 are fitting parameters it can be seen in fig 8 that the fitting value of f x is in the middle of the minimum and maximum among measured value with the max relative errors of 17 which is acceptable thus it is believed that eq 3 is appropriate to determine the relative influence of rebar presence in secondary influence area 3 4 major influence area of reinforcement bar major influence area of steel bar mia is the area just in front of the rebar concerning both direct and indirect blocking effect in addition to the impact of diffusion depth x i e indirect blocking effect the relative influence of reinforcement bar presence c re in mia may also affected by diffusion time t and bar diameter d which can be preliminarily estimated in fig 5 to be explicit c re in major influence area mia is shown in fig 9 the scatter is much greater than the measurement error therefore the direct blocking effect considered to be influenced by diffusion time t and bar diameter d therefore the impact of t and d can be expressed as following respectively 1 it can be seen in figs 5 and 9 that c re at the exact point in front of bar x 18 5 mm y 0 mm decreases slightly as time goes by thus influence coefficient of diffusion time t is defined as f t to measure direct blocking effect versus t and calculated by eq 4 4 f t c r e mia f x where c re mia is the value of relative influence coefficient in mia and f x is the c re at the same depth in sia calculated f t in each group is summarized in fig 10 it indicates that c re mia levels off as time goes by and tends to be 1 gradually in other words the effect of exposure duration would be weakened over diffusion time leaving out the impact of bar diameter temporarily m8 was selected to be the base group to study the trend of direct blocking effect versus t consequently the impact of diffusion time on direct blocking effect can be fitted as eq 5 5 f t 1 a e b t where a 1 9 and b 0 245 are fitting parameters the coefficient of regression of the best lines r2 is 0 955 2 as shown in fig 9 differences of c re in mia among specimens with different diameters are not in the same order of magnitude both figs 9 and 10 indicate that the diameter of bar do alter the direct blocking effect in mia greatly in an effort to quantify the effect influence coefficient of bar diameter f d is defined as eq 6 6 f d c r e mia c r e 8 where c re 8 is the value of relative influence in group m8 due to the subtle difference f d were averaged when the diameters of rebar were identical though at different exposure time then f d can be fitted as eq 7 7 f d 0 22 d 8 0 778 where 8 represents the diameter of bar in m8 as the base group and thus the impact of d is eliminated by non dimensionalization fig 11 provides that there is a linear relation between f d and relative rebar diameter or d the larger the diameter of bar the greater the direct blocking effect will be 3 5 empirical model predicting chloride concentration in reinforced mortar after above mentioned analysis c re is relative to diffusion depth exposure time and bar diameter in mia but only diffusion depth in sia combining eqs 3 5 and 7 c re in covering layer can be expressed as eq 8 8 c r e f x x y sia f x f t f d x y mia where c re f x f t and f d have all been given above c re being calculated accurately the chloride concentration in covering layer of reinforced mortar can be predicted then according to the chloride distribution in plain mortar by eq 2 the empirical model suggested above has been validated by comparing to the experimental results in each group as shown in fig 12 it illustrates that the empirical model can predict the chloride concentration in reinforced mortar appropriately to be clearer relative errors of the model in mia and sia are analyzed in fig 13 it displays that the relative error of almost all empirical prediction are within 10 which can be acceptable in engineering application therefore the empirical model proposed in present work is considered to be reasonable and credible 4 discussion in general chloride concentration cl in reinforced mortar is always expected to be higher than that in plain mortar because of the blocking effect of bars the experimental results mentioned above reveal that the chloride concentration in major influence area mia does increase however the declination of cl within the range of penetration depth x between 5 mm and 10 mm which is in secondary influence area sia can be detected in every specimen this may not be a coincidence it is well known that the mechanism of chloride ion ingression into unsaturated concrete is the coupling of diffusion and convection therefore the essential mechanism of the experimental phenomenon can be explained by these two aspects 4 1 convection due to the seepage of pore solution toward the concrete surface convection mainly happens in shallow concrete according to the test results in prior researches nemati chari et al 2018 petcherdchoo 2018 zhang et al 2018 the range of convection zone is within 5 mm from the surface of concrete pore pressure gradient is the primitive power to drive the pore solution flow owing to the presence of reinforcement bar the pore pressure gradient might change and then the effect of convection might be different in reinforced concrete from the plain one therefore the difference of convection might result in the unexpected declination of cl in shallow concrete besides diffusion is the control mechanism of chloride ingression into deep concrete discarding the first few millimetres below the surface is a commonly used technique to eliminate lixiviation effect othmen et al 2018 according to the analysis in previous section the trend of c re versus diffusion depth x in sia is related to the indirect blocking effect which may disturb the chloride distribution via changing material properties such as diffusion coefficient d consequently diffusion coefficient of chloride ion is also regarded as a major cause of the special concentration decrease 4 2 overall diffusion coefficient it is not hard to imagine that if the reinforcement bar in mortar is considered to be a kind of special cylindrical aggregate with high hardness density and no penetrability the diffusion capacity of the specimen would reduce which results in a lower overall diffusion coefficient of chloride ion just like higher coarse aggregate volume fraction involves a lower chloride diffusion coefficient wang et al 2018a yang 2005 based on previous researches fick s second law is widely applied to predict long term chloride concentration in a majority of literature and diffusion coefficient d is often assumed to be time varying but invariable along diffusion depth wang et al 2018b with the boundary and initial condition introduced by collepardi 1970 1972 overall diffusion coefficient d t can be calculated by eq 9 9 c x t c 0 c s c 0 1 erf x 2 d t t where c 0 is chloride concentration at the initial time c s is surface chloride concentration c x t is chloride concentration at diffusion depth of x after a certain exposure time t note that d t in eq 9 is an overall diffusion coefficient only related to diffusion time d t of reinforced mortar in group m8 m12 m16 and m20 have been summarized and compared to d t of plain mortar as shown in fig 14 it provides that d t in plain mortar are greater than those in reinforced ones thus it is reasonable to believe that the overall diffusion coefficient of chloride ion in reinforced mortar may reduce because of the rebar presence furthermore lower diffusion coefficient may lead to lower chloride concentration which means it is possible to detect lower cl in reinforced mortar 4 3 time and depth dependent diffusion coefficient although it seems probable to observe cl decrease in reinforced mortar it is still confused why the declination happens within the range of diffusion depth between 5 mm and 10 mm d t mentioned above represents the overall diffusion property which is only related to the diffusion time however chloride diffusion coefficient is also related to the penetration depth actually due to the concrete inhomogeneity and ionic interaction diffusion coefficient is distinct at different penetration depth yao et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 with regard to the fact that diffusion coefficient varies with x fick s second law is given as eq 10 10 c t c x d x t c x note that there is no closed form solution to eq 10 and d x t cannot be calculated by eq 9 any more fortunately d x t for non steady state can be determined by boltzmann matano methodology b m method tumidajski et al 1995 wang et al 2018a as can be seen in fig 15 most d x t in plain mortar are greater than those in reinforced ones too which is consistent with the comparison of overall diffusion coefficient d t in fig 14 therefore it is very likely that diffusion coefficient will decrease because of the rebar presence besides both figs 14 and 15 illustrate that diffusion coefficient reduces over time whether it is d t or d x t greater declinations of both d t and d x t always occur in plain mortar at a fixed exposure time and the reduction differences get smaller as time goes by in other words the time dependent characteristic of diffusion coefficient is more obvious in plain mortar than the reinforced one for the sake of exploring the reason for chloride concentration reduction within the range of diffusion depth between 5 mm and 10 mm the effect of exposure duration should be eliminated thus d 0 x was determined as eq 11 to focus on the variation of diffusion coefficient versus depth thomas and phil 1999 11 d x t d 0 x t 0 t m where d x t is diffusion coefficient at diffusion depth x and exposure time t d 0 x is fitted diffusion coefficient at diffusion depth x on the t 0 day m is fitting parameter tang and joost 2007 fig 16 reveals that d 0 x is always lower in reinforced mortar than that in the plain one also the deeper the depth the greater the reduction of d 0 x is that is to say d 0 x hardly changes on the exposed surface but alters significantly in front of the bar because of the rebar presence which is credible moreover each group with different diameter shares almost identical d 0 x at each depth which explains the result that indirect blocking effect is irrelevant to the diameter of bar d in fig 5 for further explanation f d 0 x was defined to evaluate the relative variation of d 0 x in reinforced mortar comparing to the plain one as given in eq 12 12 f d 0 x d 0 r x d 0 m x where d 0 r x is the average value of d 0 x in each group of reinforced mortar and d 0 m x is d 0 x in plain mortar as revealed by fig 17 the rate of f d 0 x declination is higher in the vicinity of the depth x 8 mm on the one hand the reduction rate of f d 0 x relative variation of diffusion coefficients in this corresponding depth is greater than other region along the diffusion depth on the other hand this domain is in sia relatively far away from the mia which means there is hardly any chloride accumulation for the lack of direct blocking effect thus the declination of cl in this area may not be a coincidence and it is reasonable to doubt that the reinforcement bar can not only increase cl at its apex but also decrease cl within a certain range of diffusion depth in covering layer when the thickness of cover is 20 mm the reduction happens at the depth of 5 mm 10 mm while the exact influence region under other condition need to be further confirmed 5 conclusion the effect of reinforcement bar presence on chloride distribution in covering layer of mortar was investigated via an indoor automatic artificial simulating chloride diffusion experiment involving 15 specimens with or without bars plain and reinforced mortar prims were all exposed to chloride environment for 100 140 180 days to detect chloride concentration cl in front of bars major and secondary influence areas of steel bar mia and sia were defined to describe the chloride distribution in covering layer relative influence coefficient c re was applied to evaluate direct and indirect blocking effect of reinforcement bar presence on chloride concentration considering the influence of diffusion depth exposure time and the diameter of bar thus an empirical model predicting cl in reinforced mortars according to cl in the plain ones was proposed from the results in this work following conclusions can be drawn 1 reinforcement bar can make a great difference to the chloride distribution in covering layer of mortar comparing to the plain mortar chloride concentration cl increases apparently in mia of reinforced mortar because of the blocking effect especially the direct one while cl in sia may increase or decrease in different region along the diffusion depth due to the indirect blocking effect c re was used to evaluate direct and indirect blocking effect in both areas c re in sia is only correlated to the diffusion depth while c re in mia is related to diffusion depth exposure time and bar diameter the lager the diameter the greater c re is 2 comparing to the plain mortar an unexpected declination of cl within the range of penetration depth x between 5 mm and 10 mm in reinforced mortar was detected in every group of this experiment on the one hand owing to the presence of reinforcement bar the pore pressure gradient might change and then the effect of convection might be different in reinforced concrete from the plain one on the other hand the reduction rate of relative variation of diffusion coefficients in the corresponding depth was greater than other region along the diffusion depth also it is hard for chloride ion to accumulate in the aforementioned region because of the long distance from rebar and the lack of direct blocking effect thus the declination of cl may not be a coincidence and it is reasonable to doubt that the reinforcement bar can not only increase cl at its front surface but also decrease cl within a certain range of diffusion depth in concrete covering layer 3 an empirical prediction model of chloride concentration in concrete covering layer considering the effect of diffusion depth exposure time and diameter of bars is given it provides a convenient way to evaluate the chloride distribution in reinforced specimens according to the measurement in plain ones instead of extra experiments acknowledgments we are grateful for the

23011,reinforcement bar corrosion induced by chloride ions ingress is one of the dominating causes for the deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in salty environment thus it is particularly important to accurately predict chloride concentration in concretes and evaluate the structural service life this paper presents the results of an indoor experimental investigation on chloride diffusion in plain and reinforced mortar specimens exposed to tidal zone which is simulated by a self design marine environment automatic simulation device concrete covering layer was divided into major influence area mia and secondary influence area sia to accurately describe the chloride ion concentration distribution characteristics mia is the region affected by direct and indirect blocking effect of reinforcement bar while sia is the area only influenced by the indirect one also the relative influence coefficient c re was defined to measure the impact of reinforcement bar on the chloride ion ingress the results indicate that indirect blocking effect of rebar resulting from changes of material properties is the major cause for the chloride ion concentration distribution in sia and it is only relative to the diffusion depth whereas direct blocking effect of bar caused by physical obstruction to accumulate chloride ions contributes most to the chloride increase in mia and it is correlated to the diffusion depth exposure time and diameter of bar finally an empirical prediction model of chloride concentration in concrete covering layer considering the effect of reinforcement presence is proposed keywords chloride concentration prediction reinforcement bar effect covering layer 1 introduction reinforcement bar corrosion induced by chloride ions is generally regarded as one of the dominating causes for the deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in salty environment angst et al 2009 du et al 2015a 2015b tuutti 1982 divided the degradation process of reinforcement bar into two periods initiation and propagation stages in the first one chloride ions can reduce the ph of concrete pore solution break the passive film of steel bar embedded in concrete morris and vazquez 2002 saremi and mahallati 2002 and initiate the corrosion of rebar critical chloride content which means the chloride threshold value required for rebar corrosion may show a great scatter bastidas arteaga and schoefs 2015 and thus it is necessary to consider the discreteness of critical chloride content in engineering design and application also it has been identified to be one of the most significant parameters to evaluate the remaining service life of existing structures gulikers 2006 as for the propagation stage migration of chloride ions into and out of the corrosion pit is required to sustain anodic dissolution and sufficient chloride concentration at the surface of bar is necessary to maintain the aggressive pitting corrosion angst et al 2011 therefore it appears to be particularly important to accurately estimate the chloride concentration cl at the surface of bar close to the exposed side over the past few decades a considerable number of researches have been done to describe the chloride diffusion process and predict chloride concentration in concrete or mortar considering various factors for instance thomas and phil 1999 conducted long term field and laboratory tests and proposed predictive model to describe time dependent chloride diffusion in cementitious materials with supplementary such as fly ash or slag martin perez et al 2000 established mathematical models to demonstrate that chloride binding capacity could reduce the chloride diffusivity in cementitious system and shorten the chloride penetration depth song et al 2004 analyzed the effect of environmental factors construction quality cover thickness material property and structure type on the reinforcement bar corrosion in concrete based on a real project and field survey bastidas arteaga et al 2011 presented a comprehensive model of chloride penetration considering the uncertainties of input parameters materials properties and environmental actions bastidas arteaga and schoefs 2012 then proposed a new method integrating the uncertainties of material properties environmental actions and the effect of imperfect inspections to improve the performance of maintenance strategies for corroding rc structures in chloride contaminated atmosphere zhang et al 2017 discussed the impact of admixture on chloride time varying diffusivity by a man made simulating drying wetting test they claimed that the addition of fly ash basalt fiber and silica fume could increase the anti permeability of concrete especially the first one wang et al 2018a suggested a time and depth dependent model of chloride diffusion coefficient determined by boltzmann matano method for concrete members considering the effect of coarse aggregate the results showed that chloride diffusion coefficient decreased as coarse aggregate volume fraction or maximum sizes of aggregate increased othmen et al 2018 presented a statistical investigation of surface chloride content and diffusion coefficient to analyze the chloride profiles in a beam of real structure exposed in splash zone for 28 years other influence factors of chloride diffusivity in concrete have also been investigated in a large amount of literature not all listed here all these studies made great contribution to the discussion of chloride ingression in concrete and the determination of chloride concentration in deep penetration depth however less adequate is their concern about the effect of reinforcement bar presence on chloride distribution comparing to the irregular shape and random distribution of coarse aggregates steel bar can be deemed to be a kind of special cylindrical aggregate with relatively fixed position in mortar because of the bar s high hardness and density the transportation of chloride ions can be postulated to bypass the steel bar instead of piercing through it consequently chloride concentration distribution may be influenced by reinforcement bar somehow in fact the accumulation phenomenon of chloride iron at the surface of bar close to the exposed side was reported by hansen and saouma 1999 as early as 1999 they numerically simulated reinforced concrete deterioration in bridge deck and illustrated that higher chloride concentration cl could be detected at the front surface of reinforcing steel in comparison with other position at the same depth subsequently kranc et al 2002 also found the increase of cl at the front surface of bar by numerical analysis and defined attenuation coefficient to investigate the earlier initiation time of steel corrosion oh and jang 2003 applied finite element analysis to evaluate the chloride cluster and argued that larger diameter of rebar caused greater accumulation of cl as a result the initiation time of steel corrosion would be shortened about 30 40 due to the consideration of bar existence these literature presented a compelling argument for the chloride accumulation in front of the bar and a serious worry about overestimating structural service life whereas few physical tests about this issue were carried out to solve the problem of lack of experiments outdoor exposure tests were conducted at dania beach florida and all reinforced concrete slabs were cyclically ponded with a sodium chloride solution yu and hartt 2007 yu et al 2007 the results stated that the presence of reinforcement bar not only had obstruction effect to block the chloride ions but also interfered with the spatial arrangement of coarse aggregates immediate to the bar influencing the chloride concentration distribution yu and hartt 2011 pronounced that bars with larger size better corrosion resistance less cover thickness or a more flat leading edge could reduce the time to corrosion they also mentioned a phenomenon that the chloride content at the front surface of bar was approximately 1 4 times to the chloride content at the same depth as the bar after 10 year chloride exposure duration which was reported in an overview and sensitivity study of various mechanisms during chloride transportation by boddy et al 1999 despite of all these laudable achievements there are still some aspects should be improved as follows 1 apart from numerical simulation it is necessary to conduct more physical experiments 2 the investigation of rebar presence effect on cl distribution should not be only limited in the exact area in front of the bar but in a more expansive region in covering layer 3 a quantitative method to estimate this influence and predict cl considering the existence of bars should be further developed wang et al 2016 have investigated the chloride diffusion in plain and reinforced concrete members via an indoor drying wetting cycles experiment to simulate the exposure in tidal zone a single cycle consisted of 12 h wet and 12 h dry which is inconsistent with the actual tidal fluctuation in marine environment direct and indirect blocking effects of the reinforcement bar were defined to describe the physical obstruction and chloride diffusion coefficient variation respectively in this preliminary work only chloride ion concentration at the front surface of rebar was analyzed and a quantitative time depth dependent chloride diffusion model considering rebar presence was then given to predict the cl at the front surface of rebar the results showed that larger diameter of bars led to greater effect which was consistent with the findings of other literature oh and jang 2003 yu and hartt 2011 to compare with the preliminary achievements further research has been done in this work to explore the chloride distribution considering reinforcement bar presence therefore this paper seeks to 1 conduct further physical experiments in mortar specimens exposed in real time tidal zone simulated by artificial marine environment automatic simulation device rather than the drying wetting tests to focus on the essential impact of bar on chloride concentration distribution 2 extend the influence area of rebar to the whole concrete covering layer rather than the only apex of rebar closed to the exposure side 3 suggest an empirical model to predict chloride distribution in concrete covering layer considering the impact of bar existence 2 experimental procedures 2 1 test specimens to concentrate on the essential impact of reinforcement bar on chloride concentration distribution mortar specimens were used in this test ordinary portland cement p o 42 5 with density of 3100 kg m3 was used for all test specimens river sand with fineness modulus of 2 7 and apparent density of 2610 kg m3 was used as fine aggregate distilled water was used as batch water and the water to cement ratio w c was 0 54 according to the recommended value for structures of tidal zone in chinese standard jgj55 2011 2011 the mix proportion for all specimens is listed in table 1 in this test 100 day was set to be the first exposure time so as to detect the chloride concentration at the bar s apex total 15 mortar prisms 100 mm 100 mm 400 mm were casted with one embedded hot rolled plain bar hpb 300 close to the lateral surface with 20 mm covering layer thickness of cover c 20 mm and separated into 5 groups with different diameters of rebar no bars 8 mm 12 mm 16 mm 20 mm 5 specimens per group for three fixed exposure times during the first day after casting the specimens were covered with sheet and cured in standard curing chamber at 20 3 c over 90 relative humidity rh gb t 50081 2002 2002 next they were demoulded and cured in saturated solution of calcium hydroxide for 28 days to avoid leaching every side of specimens except diffusion surface was then coated with epoxy to ensure one dimensional chloride ingress each prism had its own identifier as shown in table 2 the first number represents diameter of rebar abbreviated to d in the prism and the number after the hyphen is exposure duration 100 140 180 days 2 2 test setup for chloride exposure and chloride concentration determination affected by lunar gravity and terrain the frequency of high low tide can be controlled by diurnal tide semi diurnal tide or mixed semi diurnal tide there exists diurnal tide along most coastlines in south china sea especially the beibu gulf which is one of the most typical diurnal tidal areas in the world to simulate the marine environment in diurnal tidal zone artificial marine environment automatic simulation device in fig 1 was developed independently it was composed by storage tank test tank temperature and humidity control system air blast system flow rate control system and manipulation platform comparing to the totally wet and totally dry conditions in traditional wetting drying cycles wang et al 2014 this device can effectively and realistically achieve real time rising and ebb tide cycling simulation which is more approximated to the true circumstance it can not only control the water level to go up and down gradually just like the flow in tidal zone but also adjust temperature humidity illumination wind and other ocean environment factors 3 5 sodium chloride solution was configured in storage tank instead of seawater and all mortar specimens were vertically placed on a table 200 mm high in test tank for chloride exposure upper and lower water levels were set to be 600 mm and 200 mm respectively flow between two tanks was controlled by solenoid valve water pump and flowmeter precisely for the sake of simplification diurnal tidal cycle in this test was set to be 24 h including 12 h for rising tide and other 12 h for ebb tide after required chloride exposure for 100 140 and 180 days corresponding specimens were taken out of test tank and successively drilled an in site exposure test xu et al 2011 was referred during the sample drilling procedure the testing structure top elevation 6 00 m and bottom elevation 1 00 m was in typical tidal zone according to annual tide observations concrete powder was probed at height of 1 8 m 2 3 m 2 8 m 3 3 m 3 8 m 4 8 m 5 25 m and 5 8 m respectively the maximum of chloride ion concentration along elevation met the height of 2 3 m 2 8 m and 3 3 m which means the midway down of the observed structure similarly mortar powder was extracted in the same region to be explicit fig 2 illustrates the whole sampling process in present experiment specimens were averagely divided into four parts numbered i to iv from the bottom to top and part ii was applied to drill testing samples during the drilling process part ii was averagely divided into two parts as parallel specimens to get concrete powder samples respectively on account of the symmetry of prism central axis normal to the diffusion surface was set to be x axis and y axis was supposed along the diffusion surface sixteen holes were drilled perpendicularly at four different diffusion depths x 3 5 mm 8 mm 14 mm 18 5 mm and four varying distances from the central axis y 0 mm 1 5 d 2 mm 26 5 mm 46 5 mm all of the above location details of drilling holes represented their center lines and the diameter of each hole was 3 mm note that all specimens were drilled at the same location no matter it is plain or reinforced mortar after being sized through a sieve with 0 63 mm apertures all powder samples were dried for 2 h 105 5 c and cooled down to room temperature chloride ion selective electrode was then applied to the quick determination of water soluble chloride concentration i e free chloride concentration jgjt 322 2013 2013 3 results 3 1 absolute influence of reinforcement bar on chloride concentration for the sake of analyzing the effect of steel bar existence on chloride distribution in covering layer chloride concentration profiles in plain and reinforced mortar specimens were compared absolute influence of reinforcement bar presence on chloride distribution was defined as eq 1 1 c a b c r c m where c ab is absolute influence coefficient of rebar c r is chloride concentration cl in reinforced mortar specimens c m is cl in plain mortar specimens note that c r and c m are in the same position and c m is the average value of cl at a given depth fig 3 shows c ab in each prism at different diffusion depth and time according to the uncertainty analysis elshami et al 2016 dash lines connect scatters to make tendency of c ab clearer fig 3 indicates that c ab changes obviously along the diffusion depth x and it is always less than zero when x is in range of 5 mm 10 mm in other words the cl in plain mortar specimens is always greater than that in reinforced specimens at the same location within this range of penetration depth moreover fig 3 also demonstrates that c ab is always more than zero at deeper penetration depth after 15 mm which is called accumulation phenomenon of cl and this result coincides with measurements in other literature wang et al 2016 yu and hartt 2007 however the value of c ab disperses causing difficulties to describe it by a unified expression to be explicit c ab at y 46 5 mm in each specimen is compared in fig 4 on the one hand as shown in fig 4 the difference between c ab in each group is larger than the measurement error according to the error bars in other word the change of c ab in different group is not the measurement error on the other hand as shown in fig 4 a with a given diameter of bar the trend of c ab along diffusion time differs from each specimen also it can be seen in fig 4 b at a given diffusion time the trend of c ab with bar diameter differs too both figures indicate that the variation of c ab over diffusion time and with bar diameter is irregular thus the effects of diffusion time and bar diameter on c ab are hard to tell therefore it should be doubtful whether c ab is appropriate to evaluate the effect of bar on cl in covering layer or not furthermore chloride concentration gradient in mortar or concrete is always high due to the low permeability of materials and therefore greater c ab may not be equal to greater impact for example cl at diffusion surface increases from 0 4 to 0 45 while cl at the apex of bar may grow from 0 05 to 0 1 because of the equal absolute increments of 0 05 the same impact of bar on cl at these two places can be concluded according to the absolute influence coefficient c ab but it is necessary to consider whether the conclusion is right or not although the absolute increments are identical the relative increments are 12 5 and 50 respectively it is reasonable to believe that the effect of rebar presence on chloride concentration is greater at the apex of bars in spite of the same absolute concentration difference consequently relative influence of rebar presence should be analyzed and might be more rational to measure the impact other than the absolute one 3 2 relative influence of reinforcement bar on chloride concentration in view of the analysis and doubt above relative influence of reinforcement bar on chloride distribution was then defined by eq 2 2 c r e c r c m where c re is relative influence coefficient of reinforcement bar c r and c m are same as those in eq 1 c re in each group at different diffusion depth and time is shown in fig 5 scatters are also connected by dash lines to be describable apparently data divergence is reduced and trends are almost consistent thus it is preliminarily thought that c re can reflect the impact of rebar on chloride concentration cl also c re below 1 still can be found within the range of penetration depth x between 5 mm and 10 mm which is accordant with c ab in fig 3 therefore it can be acclaimed that the cl within this diffusion depth may decline due to the bar existence which will be explained in the section of discussion what s more except for the only point right at the leading edge of bar x 18 5 mm y 0 mm c re in nearly every test hole at the same depth in any specimen are approximated to focus on the long term prediction of chloride concentration c re in all test holes except for the one x 18 5 mm y 0 mm at 140 and 180 days have been depicted in fig 6 it can be seen that nearly all measurements are within 15 error range of average c re in every test holes in other words it seems that c re is only related to the diffusion depth and has nothing to do with diffusion time and the diameter of bar as for the special point exactly in front of the bar the greater c re implies that more chloride concentration cl has been accumulated at the position and greater impact of reinforcement bar has occurred this accumulation phenomenon of cl has been reported in some literature boddy et al 1999 hansen and saouma 1999 kranc et al 2002 oh and jang 2003 wang et al 2016 yu and hartt 2007 2011 yu et al 2007 as blocking effect of rebar broadly speaking this blocking effect includes both direct blocking effect caused by physical obstruction to collect chloride ions and indirect blocking effect resulting from changes of material properties such as diffusion coefficient wang et al 2016 yu and hartt 2007 yu et al 2007 in order to accurately describe the chloride ion distribution characteristics within covering layer considering reinforcement bar presence the cross section of cover has been divided into two parts major influence area mia and secondary influence area sia as depicted in fig 7 according to fig 5 at specific x 3 5 mm 8 mm or 14 mm the corresponding holes at the same depth x share almost same c re in addition when x 18 5 mm holes at y 1 5 d 2 mm 26 5 mm and 46 5 mm have almost same c re too whereas at the point of x 18 5 mm y 0 mm c re is always higher than the value in other holes at the same depth as shown in fig 5 in other words little physical obstruction can be observed away from the bar yu and hartt 2007 believed that rebar might change the chloride diffusion within region of 3 mm in front of the bar lv 2017 acclaimed the impact region of bar can be evaluated to be 4 5 mm around the bar because of the spatial distribution of coarse aggregates in consequence as shown in fig 7 mia is the area right in front of the bar x c 3 5 c and y 0 d 2 c is the thickness of cover affected by both direct and indirect blocking effect while sia is the rest area in covering layer only influenced by indirect blocking effect the impact of bar existence on chloride distribution in these two areas will be discussed in following two sections respectively 3 3 secondary influence area of reinforcement bar sia secondary influence area of steel bar sia is the area away from the bar only affected by the indirect blocking effect firstly at the depth of 3 5 mm c re are always around 1 which implies that nearly no impact of bar can be found close to the diffusion surface also c re is always below 1 within the range of penetration depth x between 5 mm and 10 mm involving the variation of diffusion coefficient which will be explained later furthermore when x 3 5 mm 8 mm and 14 mm c re in each borehole with the same depth x are close to each other regardless of exposure duration and diameter of bars while at the depth of 18 5 mm c re in different group changes slightly as diffusion time goes by and the longer the exposure the smaller the changes are since long term chloride concentration prediction in mortar is mainly investigated the variety of c re in sia over time can be ignored moreover it is easy to understand that accumulation of cl would decrease gradually away from the position of rebar even a downward trend of c re can be found at deeper depth x 18 5 mm and longer diffusion time t 140 d and 180 d as shown in fig 5 the reason of this tendency may be owing to the absence of direct blocking of bars in sia y 0 d 2 the chloride ion can penetrate deeper without rebar in the way and the relative change of cl will consequently decline reflected as a lower c re note that there is no difference between c re and indirect blocking effect in sia to sum up c re in sia is only related to the diffusion depth x and have nothing to do with diffusion time t and diameter of bar d so influence coefficient of diffusion depth x on indirect blocking effect is defined as f x to estimate the trend of c re versus x and c re is equal to f x in sia to predict cl in reinforced mortar after long term chloride exposure accurately and conveniently f x i e c re in sia can be expressed as eq 3 3 c r e sia f x α x β x γ 2 φ where α 0 1437 β 691 7 γ 20 517 and φ 181 23 are fitting parameters it can be seen in fig 8 that the fitting value of f x is in the middle of the minimum and maximum among measured value with the max relative errors of 17 which is acceptable thus it is believed that eq 3 is appropriate to determine the relative influence of rebar presence in secondary influence area 3 4 major influence area of reinforcement bar major influence area of steel bar mia is the area just in front of the rebar concerning both direct and indirect blocking effect in addition to the impact of diffusion depth x i e indirect blocking effect the relative influence of reinforcement bar presence c re in mia may also affected by diffusion time t and bar diameter d which can be preliminarily estimated in fig 5 to be explicit c re in major influence area mia is shown in fig 9 the scatter is much greater than the measurement error therefore the direct blocking effect considered to be influenced by diffusion time t and bar diameter d therefore the impact of t and d can be expressed as following respectively 1 it can be seen in figs 5 and 9 that c re at the exact point in front of bar x 18 5 mm y 0 mm decreases slightly as time goes by thus influence coefficient of diffusion time t is defined as f t to measure direct blocking effect versus t and calculated by eq 4 4 f t c r e mia f x where c re mia is the value of relative influence coefficient in mia and f x is the c re at the same depth in sia calculated f t in each group is summarized in fig 10 it indicates that c re mia levels off as time goes by and tends to be 1 gradually in other words the effect of exposure duration would be weakened over diffusion time leaving out the impact of bar diameter temporarily m8 was selected to be the base group to study the trend of direct blocking effect versus t consequently the impact of diffusion time on direct blocking effect can be fitted as eq 5 5 f t 1 a e b t where a 1 9 and b 0 245 are fitting parameters the coefficient of regression of the best lines r2 is 0 955 2 as shown in fig 9 differences of c re in mia among specimens with different diameters are not in the same order of magnitude both figs 9 and 10 indicate that the diameter of bar do alter the direct blocking effect in mia greatly in an effort to quantify the effect influence coefficient of bar diameter f d is defined as eq 6 6 f d c r e mia c r e 8 where c re 8 is the value of relative influence in group m8 due to the subtle difference f d were averaged when the diameters of rebar were identical though at different exposure time then f d can be fitted as eq 7 7 f d 0 22 d 8 0 778 where 8 represents the diameter of bar in m8 as the base group and thus the impact of d is eliminated by non dimensionalization fig 11 provides that there is a linear relation between f d and relative rebar diameter or d the larger the diameter of bar the greater the direct blocking effect will be 3 5 empirical model predicting chloride concentration in reinforced mortar after above mentioned analysis c re is relative to diffusion depth exposure time and bar diameter in mia but only diffusion depth in sia combining eqs 3 5 and 7 c re in covering layer can be expressed as eq 8 8 c r e f x x y sia f x f t f d x y mia where c re f x f t and f d have all been given above c re being calculated accurately the chloride concentration in covering layer of reinforced mortar can be predicted then according to the chloride distribution in plain mortar by eq 2 the empirical model suggested above has been validated by comparing to the experimental results in each group as shown in fig 12 it illustrates that the empirical model can predict the chloride concentration in reinforced mortar appropriately to be clearer relative errors of the model in mia and sia are analyzed in fig 13 it displays that the relative error of almost all empirical prediction are within 10 which can be acceptable in engineering application therefore the empirical model proposed in present work is considered to be reasonable and credible 4 discussion in general chloride concentration cl in reinforced mortar is always expected to be higher than that in plain mortar because of the blocking effect of bars the experimental results mentioned above reveal that the chloride concentration in major influence area mia does increase however the declination of cl within the range of penetration depth x between 5 mm and 10 mm which is in secondary influence area sia can be detected in every specimen this may not be a coincidence it is well known that the mechanism of chloride ion ingression into unsaturated concrete is the coupling of diffusion and convection therefore the essential mechanism of the experimental phenomenon can be explained by these two aspects 4 1 convection due to the seepage of pore solution toward the concrete surface convection mainly happens in shallow concrete according to the test results in prior researches nemati chari et al 2018 petcherdchoo 2018 zhang et al 2018 the range of convection zone is within 5 mm from the surface of concrete pore pressure gradient is the primitive power to drive the pore solution flow owing to the presence of reinforcement bar the pore pressure gradient might change and then the effect of convection might be different in reinforced concrete from the plain one therefore the difference of convection might result in the unexpected declination of cl in shallow concrete besides diffusion is the control mechanism of chloride ingression into deep concrete discarding the first few millimetres below the surface is a commonly used technique to eliminate lixiviation effect othmen et al 2018 according to the analysis in previous section the trend of c re versus diffusion depth x in sia is related to the indirect blocking effect which may disturb the chloride distribution via changing material properties such as diffusion coefficient d consequently diffusion coefficient of chloride ion is also regarded as a major cause of the special concentration decrease 4 2 overall diffusion coefficient it is not hard to imagine that if the reinforcement bar in mortar is considered to be a kind of special cylindrical aggregate with high hardness density and no penetrability the diffusion capacity of the specimen would reduce which results in a lower overall diffusion coefficient of chloride ion just like higher coarse aggregate volume fraction involves a lower chloride diffusion coefficient wang et al 2018a yang 2005 based on previous researches fick s second law is widely applied to predict long term chloride concentration in a majority of literature and diffusion coefficient d is often assumed to be time varying but invariable along diffusion depth wang et al 2018b with the boundary and initial condition introduced by collepardi 1970 1972 overall diffusion coefficient d t can be calculated by eq 9 9 c x t c 0 c s c 0 1 erf x 2 d t t where c 0 is chloride concentration at the initial time c s is surface chloride concentration c x t is chloride concentration at diffusion depth of x after a certain exposure time t note that d t in eq 9 is an overall diffusion coefficient only related to diffusion time d t of reinforced mortar in group m8 m12 m16 and m20 have been summarized and compared to d t of plain mortar as shown in fig 14 it provides that d t in plain mortar are greater than those in reinforced ones thus it is reasonable to believe that the overall diffusion coefficient of chloride ion in reinforced mortar may reduce because of the rebar presence furthermore lower diffusion coefficient may lead to lower chloride concentration which means it is possible to detect lower cl in reinforced mortar 4 3 time and depth dependent diffusion coefficient although it seems probable to observe cl decrease in reinforced mortar it is still confused why the declination happens within the range of diffusion depth between 5 mm and 10 mm d t mentioned above represents the overall diffusion property which is only related to the diffusion time however chloride diffusion coefficient is also related to the penetration depth actually due to the concrete inhomogeneity and ionic interaction diffusion coefficient is distinct at different penetration depth yao et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 with regard to the fact that diffusion coefficient varies with x fick s second law is given as eq 10 10 c t c x d x t c x note that there is no closed form solution to eq 10 and d x t cannot be calculated by eq 9 any more fortunately d x t for non steady state can be determined by boltzmann matano methodology b m method tumidajski et al 1995 wang et al 2018a as can be seen in fig 15 most d x t in plain mortar are greater than those in reinforced ones too which is consistent with the comparison of overall diffusion coefficient d t in fig 14 therefore it is very likely that diffusion coefficient will decrease because of the rebar presence besides both figs 14 and 15 illustrate that diffusion coefficient reduces over time whether it is d t or d x t greater declinations of both d t and d x t always occur in plain mortar at a fixed exposure time and the reduction differences get smaller as time goes by in other words the time dependent characteristic of diffusion coefficient is more obvious in plain mortar than the reinforced one for the sake of exploring the reason for chloride concentration reduction within the range of diffusion depth between 5 mm and 10 mm the effect of exposure duration should be eliminated thus d 0 x was determined as eq 11 to focus on the variation of diffusion coefficient versus depth thomas and phil 1999 11 d x t d 0 x t 0 t m where d x t is diffusion coefficient at diffusion depth x and exposure time t d 0 x is fitted diffusion coefficient at diffusion depth x on the t 0 day m is fitting parameter tang and joost 2007 fig 16 reveals that d 0 x is always lower in reinforced mortar than that in the plain one also the deeper the depth the greater the reduction of d 0 x is that is to say d 0 x hardly changes on the exposed surface but alters significantly in front of the bar because of the rebar presence which is credible moreover each group with different diameter shares almost identical d 0 x at each depth which explains the result that indirect blocking effect is irrelevant to the diameter of bar d in fig 5 for further explanation f d 0 x was defined to evaluate the relative variation of d 0 x in reinforced mortar comparing to the plain one as given in eq 12 12 f d 0 x d 0 r x d 0 m x where d 0 r x is the average value of d 0 x in each group of reinforced mortar and d 0 m x is d 0 x in plain mortar as revealed by fig 17 the rate of f d 0 x declination is higher in the vicinity of the depth x 8 mm on the one hand the reduction rate of f d 0 x relative variation of diffusion coefficients in this corresponding depth is greater than other region along the diffusion depth on the other hand this domain is in sia relatively far away from the mia which means there is hardly any chloride accumulation for the lack of direct blocking effect thus the declination of cl in this area may not be a coincidence and it is reasonable to doubt that the reinforcement bar can not only increase cl at its apex but also decrease cl within a certain range of diffusion depth in covering layer when the thickness of cover is 20 mm the reduction happens at the depth of 5 mm 10 mm while the exact influence region under other condition need to be further confirmed 5 conclusion the effect of reinforcement bar presence on chloride distribution in covering layer of mortar was investigated via an indoor automatic artificial simulating chloride diffusion experiment involving 15 specimens with or without bars plain and reinforced mortar prims were all exposed to chloride environment for 100 140 180 days to detect chloride concentration cl in front of bars major and secondary influence areas of steel bar mia and sia were defined to describe the chloride distribution in covering layer relative influence coefficient c re was applied to evaluate direct and indirect blocking effect of reinforcement bar presence on chloride concentration considering the influence of diffusion depth exposure time and the diameter of bar thus an empirical model predicting cl in reinforced mortars according to cl in the plain ones was proposed from the results in this work following conclusions can be drawn 1 reinforcement bar can make a great difference to the chloride distribution in covering layer of mortar comparing to the plain mortar chloride concentration cl increases apparently in mia of reinforced mortar because of the blocking effect especially the direct one while cl in sia may increase or decrease in different region along the diffusion depth due to the indirect blocking effect c re was used to evaluate direct and indirect blocking effect in both areas c re in sia is only correlated to the diffusion depth while c re in mia is related to diffusion depth exposure time and bar diameter the lager the diameter the greater c re is 2 comparing to the plain mortar an unexpected declination of cl within the range of penetration depth x between 5 mm and 10 mm in reinforced mortar was detected in every group of this experiment on the one hand owing to the presence of reinforcement bar the pore pressure gradient might change and then the effect of convection might be different in reinforced concrete from the plain one on the other hand the reduction rate of relative variation of diffusion coefficients in the corresponding depth was greater than other region along the diffusion depth also it is hard for chloride ion to accumulate in the aforementioned region because of the long distance from rebar and the lack of direct blocking effect thus the declination of cl may not be a coincidence and it is reasonable to doubt that the reinforcement bar can not only increase cl at its front surface but also decrease cl within a certain range of diffusion depth in concrete covering layer 3 an empirical prediction model of chloride concentration in concrete covering layer considering the effect of diffusion depth exposure time and diameter of bars is given it provides a convenient way to evaluate the chloride distribution in reinforced specimens according to the measurement in plain ones instead of extra experiments acknowledgments we are grateful for the

23012,the proposed time domain response estimation method aims to improve computational efficiency of the traditional step by step techniques by considering convolution item with a state space model for floating structures different from the present three techniques of estimating state space model matrices which are the impulse response curve fitting the realization theory and the regression in the frequency domain a more accurate and efficient algorithm has been developed by constructing these matrices with poles and residues of retardation functions one theoretical development is that the poles and residues are estimated by using the state space model not directly by solving ordinary differential equations which implies that the traditional ill conditioned issue can be reduced significantly meanwhile this algorithm is a direct estimation procedure and also does not require initial values during the process of computing state state model matrices which means that a better computational efficiency can be expected to investigate the performance of the proposed method three examples are employed the first example is a numerical retardation function that is based on a purely analytical relationship and this function satisfies all the properties of the convolution terms in math by comparing the approach with the three techniques of estimating state space model matrices one can draw the conclusion that the approach provides accuracy similar to that of the regression method but outperforms the curve fitting and the realization methods obviously because of the improperly used initial values the second example is a single degree of freedom system excited by different forms of external load numerical results show that a dynamic response analysis using replacement of convolution with the proposed method is in accordance with the traditional frequency and time domain method however the proposed method is insensitive to the step size of the calculation which means that the proposed method is more stable to extend the proposed method to a system with multiple degrees of freedom and investigate the capacity for computational efficiency a semi submersible platform was used conclusions from the numerical and experimental studies can be drawn 1 the estimated response of the platform by using the proposed method to replace convolution items with a state space model matches well with the traditional newmark β method 2 the calculation time is reduced significantly using the proposed method when the number of calculation steps is large and 3 the heave response of semi submersible physical model calculated by the proposed method is in good agreement with the experimental data keywords cummins equation retardation function state space model poles and residues dynamic response analysis newmark β method 1 introduction with the exploitation and production activities of offshore oil and gas resources moving to deep sea traditional fixed jacket platforms have not satisfied the requirements for drilling and production therefore many new types of floating structures such as fpso the spar platform and the semi submersible platform have been developed analysis of the dynamic response in waves is an important aspect of a floating marine structure in the design stage and is vital to the secure operation of the types of offshore platforms mentioned above the motion responses of floating offshore structures in the waves can be described with a hybrid frequency time domain model considering frequency dependent coefficients using the cummins equation cummins 1962 which contains convolution terms that reflect fluid memory effects the introduction of memory effects improves the accuracy of the dynamic response analysis but the convolution terms in the cummins equation are not convenient for analysis and design of motion control systems perez 2002 fossen 2002 in addition time domain simulations of linear transient or nonlinear problems with convolution terms consume a significant amount of computing resources and their implementation in standard simulation packages is inconvenient kashiwagi 2004 considering the simulation efficiency of the cummins equation in a time domain one approach to estimate dynamic response of marine structures is commonly analyzed by solving the frequency responses via converting the cummins equation to the frequency domain to simplify calculation the frequency domain method is based on linear theory and employs a first order potential theory approach to obtain a frequency response with the assumption that the wave is a gaussian process newman 1977 the simplified conditions of above frequency domain method demand that the wave steepness be small and that the response caused by wave excitation be proportional to the wave amplitude faltinsen 2005 the frequency response functions of floating structures can be estimated using the commercial software sesam 2008 which is implemented through three steps the first step is finding the wave spectrum of the location of the floating structure the second is calculating the response amplitude operators raos corresponding to the frequency specified wave component of the spectrum and the third step is superimposing the raos of the wave spectrum theoretically the frequency domain method is based on the assumption of considering that each component at a specified frequency is strictly a harmonic type and ignoring the condition of wave damping in addition the frequency responses of the marine structure are a multiplication of frequency response functions frfs and the results from the discrete fourier transform dft of wave forces using the frequency domain method the problem resulting from frequency leakage caused by using the fourier transform should be carefully considered for the problem above liu et al 2017 proposed a new frequency domain response estimation method that dealt with the problem in the laplace domain the retardation functions are decomposed and replaced by a series of poles and corresponding residues in the laplace domain which avoids frequency leakage using dft and removes the restriction that demands the wave force consisting of harmonic components when the influence of viscous forces and inertia forces acting on the floating platform is considered the nonlinear effects must be considered because the assumption of linearity is no longer valid to solve the nonlinear problem of dynamic response analysis of a floating structure a higher order frequency domain method has been applied which uses a bilinear or trilinear frequency response function to express a motion model considering nonlinear effects based on volterra functional representations bendat 1998 gutierrez romero et al 2016 proposed a time domain model to solve the dynamics of moored floating structures which used a second order wave radiation diffraction solver to predict floating structure performances under non linear environmental loads recently an integrated floating structure model with the mooring cables has been developed to analyze the nonlinear vibration by wang et al 2018 as the solution of the nonlinear equations didn t adopt iterative process in the study it reduced computation load greatly a different approach to describe the motion of a floating structure using an autoregressive model is applied to solve the dynamic response problem tick 1959 used an ordinary differential equation ode to express the oscillation of a floating structure which has the same formulation as the autoregressive model the high order ode can be solved efficiently by converting it to a state space model many research studies have been implemented to improve the analysis efficiency of response estimation of floating structures in the time domain the calculation efficiency can also be improved by approximating and replacing the convolution term in the cummins equation mainly including the following three methods 1 replacing the frequency dependent added mass and damping by constant coefficients 2 replacing the convolution item by a state space model and 3 replacing the force to motion response by a state space formulation the first approach is a low order approximation by replacing frequency dependent added mass and damping values with constant matrices which avoids calculation of convolution and brings high efficiency in computation however the sensitivity of the frequency to added mass and damping significantly influences the accuracy of the analysis results taghipour et al 2008 the approximate method has been used for transient response of a ship by govolato 1959 and the results indicated that the errors were large because of the possible significant error of the first method the approach is rarely used the second approach has been widely discussed by numerous researchers because of the high efficiency and accuracy schmiechen 1973 originally proposed the method to the best of the author s knowledge and used the method to study transient ship manoeuvring subsequently the state space method was applied to various ocean structures jefferys 1984 used the method to simulate the fluid dynamics model of wave power devices fossen 2002 used the approach to study ship manoeuvring and control taghipour et al 2007 used the method to conduct hydroelastic analysis of flexible marine structures the third approach replaces the force to motion response with the state space model which was proposed by cummins 1962 for the first time then perez and lande 2006 identified the vessel response of force to motion in the frequency domain the second replacement of the convolution item method above will be discussed in detail in this paper the key point for calculating dynamic response of floating structures using the second method is to obtain state space models of the retardation functions the common identification methods of a state space model include the following 1 impulse response curve fitting 2 realization theory and 3 transfer function estimation using regression in the frequency domain taghipour et al 2008 the impulse response curve fitting method is an optimization problem that can be solved by applying gauss newton type of algorithms nocedal and wright 1999 the optimization method requires an initial condition that determines consumption of time and may affect optimal results realization theory estimates a state space model by obtaining a minimal realization from markov parameters with the feedthrough matrix of identification equalling zero or not affecting the accuracy of the result taghipour et al 2008 the last method contains nonlinear least square fitting levi 1959 and quasi linear regression dennis and schnabel 1983 perez and fossen 2011 used frequency domain estimation algorithms to identify approximate linear state space model of retardation function which are convenient to implement and could consider constraints on model structure to avoid numerical ill conditioning problems rogne et al 2014 proposed a state space representation method to replace the wave radiation forces of floating multibody armesto et al 2015 studied the state space model representation and prony s coefficients method to calculate convolution integral in cummins equation also compared the results with the ones obtained from the direct computation the last method has good fitting results but the fit may be poor when the pole of the denominator is close to the imaginary axis sanathanan and koerner 1963 this paper proposes a new method depending on the complex exponential decomposition of retardation functions and building a state space matrix with poles and corresponding residues then a fourth order runge kutta method is applied to calculate the dynamic response of floating structures instead of high order differential equations first order equations are used to compute poles and corresponding residues of retardation functions when estimating the state space model which avoids an ill conditioned problem in determining the roots of a high order polynomial hu et al 2013 liu et al 2018 used the method to calculate poles and residues of excitation loadings and analyzed the dynamic response of offshore structures further which obtained good results to investigate the performance of the proposed method three examples are applied the first example is a simple retardation function which is based on pure analytical relationships and satisfies all the properties of the convolution terms the comparison of the proposed method and the three traditional methods to estimate a state space model is discussed in this example the second example is a single degree of freedom sdof mathematical model excited by a synthesized exciting wave force the response estimation using the proposed state space model representation method and the traditional time and frequency domain fd simulation method are exhibited in this part a semi submersible semi platform model has been used in the third example where the dynamic responses excited by random waves obeying the jonswap spectrum are obtained using a traditional method and the proposed method which shows the potential application to the dynamic response analysis of floating structures 2 preliminaries considering a stable

δ t is the impulse excitation and h t is the impulse response function irf a b c and d are the so called system matrix input matrix output matrix and feedthrough matrix respectively integrating the first formula of eq 1 based on the assumption of zero initial conditions and then substituting into the second equation the irf of the system can be obtained as follows 2 h t c e a t b d δ t 2 1 impulse response curve fitting method the impulse response curve fitting method applies least squares ls to estimate state space model matrices which can be expressed as 3 θ arg min θ l w l h t l c ˆ θ e a ˆ θ t l b ˆ θ d ˆ θ δ t l 2 where argmin means the minimizing argument w l is the weighting coefficient h t l is the discrete impulse response the superscript ˆ represents the estimated state

optimization problem one can find details in reference nocedal and wright 1999 2 2 realization theory realization theory obtains a minimal realization from markov parameters which consists of discrete impulse response ho and kalman 1966 to solve the realization problem the truncated singular value decomposition are implemented to decompose the hankel matrix 4 h u 1 u 2 s 1 0 0 0 v 1 t v 2 t u 1 s 1 v 1 t where h is the hankel matrix consisting of irf s 1 is a diagonal matrix made of non zero singular values and u 1 and v 1 are block orthogonal matrices the estimation of discrete state space model matrices using a realization algorithm has been discussed by kung 1978 and the state space matrices can be determined by following formula 5 a ˆ d s 1 1 2 u 11 u 12 t u 12 u 13 s 1 1 2 b ˆ d s 1 1 2 v 11 t c ˆ d u 11 s 1 1 2 d ˆ d h 0 where u 1 u 11 u 12 u 13 t and v 1 v 11 v 12 v 13 t the discrete state space model matrices are calculated from discrete impulse response that are irrelevant to response time to obtain a continuous state space model of the system the bilinear transformations are applied al saggaf and franklin 1987 which guarantees continuous time realization of the state space model matrices 2 3 transfer function estimation using regression in the frequency domain the transfer function estimation method is based on a non parametric model of the frequency response function frf of a system with a rational fraction expressing frf the estimation of frf using the frequency domain regression is characterized as follows 6 h ˆ s θ p s θ q s θ where p s θ is the laplace transform of output and q s θ is the laplace transform of input the coefficients of polynomials p s and q s which are also the elements in the state space model matrices of the linear system are included in parameter vector θ to calculate the vector the iterative method of quasi linear regression sanathanan and koerner 1963 is applied which is expressed as follows 7 θ η arg min θ l w l η q j ω l θ h j ω l p j ω l θ 2 where w l η 1 q 2 j ω l θ η 1 is weighting coefficients after a couple of iterations the vector θ tends to be stable then the state space model matrices of the system can be obtained taghipour et al 2008 3 time domain response estimation based on rapid solution of the state space model the methods to estimate state space model matrices have been discussed by researchers and are introduced in the preliminaries in this section a new estimation method based on complex exponential decomposition will be proposed 3 1 conversion of the cummins equation by using the state space model under the assumption of linear theory ideal fluid small wave excitation and body motion cummins 1962 considered the behavior of floating structures in a time domain ogilvie 1964 has illustrated the relationship of the retardation function k t and hydrodynamic coefficients including frequency dependent added mass a ω and frequency dependent damping b ω in the frequency and time domain by implementing fourier transform which can be expressed as follows 8 a ω a 1 ω 0 k t sin ω t d t 9 b ω 0 k t cos ω t d t and 10 k t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω where ω is the frequency in radians and a is infinite frequency added mass then the cummins equation can be written as 11 m a x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ c x t f e x c t where m is the mass matrix c is the restoring matrix x t is the response vector of the floating structure with six dofs and f e x c t is the excitation force in eq 11 the convolution term consumes large computer resources for a comparatively long simulated time which is not convenient for analysis and design of floating offshore structures fossen 2002 perez 2002 to solve the problem the convolution items are usually replaced with the state space model because the convolution operation is a linear procedure which is an approximate equivalent to the corresponding state space models of the linear system taghipour et al 2008 then eq 11 becomes 12 k 1 6 m i k a i k x k t k 1 6 f i k r t k 1 6 c i k x k t f i e x c t in which 13 f i k r t 0 t k i k t τ x k τ d τ where f i k t is radiation force without contribution from the infinite added mass i and k 1 2 6 are subscripts the item f i k r t in eq 13 can be regarded as the output of a system and x k t is the corresponding input respectively the relationship between input and output of the system is described with the state space model and eq 13 can be expressed as schmiechen 1973 14 z i k t a i k z i k t b i k x k t f i k r t c i k z i k t d i k x k t where a i k b i k c i k d i k are the state space model matrices corresponding to k i k t 3 2 estimation of state space model based on poles and residues relationship between input and output of a stable linear system can be characterized in different ways one of those ways is by using a high order ordinary differential equation ode for simplicity let u t x k t as input and y t f i k r t as output of the system be described by eq 13 the equivalent formula of eq 13 using a high order ode can be expressed as 15 d n y t d t n q n 1 d n 1 y t d t n 1 q 1 d y t d t q 0 y t p m d m u t d t m p m 1 d m 1 u t d t m 1 p 1 d u t d t p 0 u t where q n 1 q n 1 q 0 and p m p m 1 p 0 are the coefficients of ode implementing the laplace transform in eq 15 and converting the equation the transfer function of system can then be obtained 16 t s y s u s p m s m p m 1 s m 1 p 1 s p 0 s n q n 1 s n 1 q 1 s q 0 where y s is the laplace transform of y t and u s is laplace transform of u t for the rational function t s the roots of the equation s n q n 1 s n 1 q 1 s q 0 0 are poles of the system denoting λ l l 1 2 n as the roots of the denominator the relationship s λ 1 s λ 2 s λ n 0 is obtained then the corresponding residues can be calculated by the following equation 17 γ l lim s λ l s λ l t s l 1 2 n once the poles and residues of the linear system are obtained the transfer function can be expressed as a sum of the poles and the corresponding residues 18 t s y s u s l 1 n γ l s λ l from eq 18 the laplace transform of output y s can be characterized with poles and residues as 19 y s l 1 n γ l u s s λ l l 1 n γ l z l s in which 20 z l s u s s λ l likewise the laplace transform of input u s can be obtained as 21 u s s z l s λ l z l s by implementing the inverse laplace transform to eq 19 and eq 21 one obtains their expressions in the time domain as 22 y t l 1 n γ l z l t and 23 z l t λ l z l t u t in which z l t is the element of the state variable vector i e the inverse laplace transform of z l s converting eq 22 and eq 23 into matrix form the input and output of the system can be concatenated by a state variable which is the matrix form of the state space model as well 24 y t γ 1 γ 2 γ n z 1 t z 2 t z n t and 25 z 1 t z 2 t z n t λ 1 λ 2 λ n z 1 t z 2 t z n t 1 1 1 u t then the state space model of retardation function can be expressed in terms of eq 24 and eq 25 as 26 z t a z t b u t y t c z t d u t in which 27 a λ 1 λ 2 λ n b 1 1 1 c γ 1 γ 2 γ n d 0 3 3 determination of poles and residues to calculate the poles λ l and resides γ l in eq 27 the first effort is to obtain the time series of retardation functions at present one method implements inverse fourier transform to obtain the retardation function however this method is limited by the nyquist frequency limit and may lead to a poor description of the function for low values of t where the retardation function k i k t changes significantly duarte et al 2013 an alternative method is using a cosine transformation to frequency dependent damping b i k ω as eq 10 to obtain the retardation function this transformation is implemented using a trapezoidal integration method as follows erlend and olav 2003 28 k i k t δ ω π k 1 k max 1 2 b i k k δ ω cos k δ ω t δ ω π b i k 0 b i k k max cos k max δ ω t where k max is the number of entries of the frequency vector and δ ω is the frequency sampling interval for the digital signal analysis the discrete retardation function can be obtained using equally spaced sampling with the sample interval of δ t the discrete retardation function is expressed as k i k l k i k l δ t l 0 1 2 n 1 implementing prony decomposition the retardation function is described with poles and residues hu et al 2013 29 k i k l m 1 p γ i k m z i k m l where z i k m e λ i k m δ t m 1 2 p p is the order of the prony decomposition to obtain good estimations of poles and residues a first order matrix difference equation model is utilized because of the advantages of good conditioning and stability hu et al 2013 this algorithm starts with constructing the hankel matrix liu et al 2017 30 h l k i k l k i k l 1 k i k l η 1 k i k l 1 k i k l 2 k i k l η k i k l ξ k i k l ξ 1 k i k l ξ η 2 where ξ and η are the row and column of h l substituting l 0 and l 1 into eq 30 and applying truncated singular value decomposition to h 0 using eq 4 then a realization of a can be obtained form h 0 and h 1 hu et al 2013 31 a s 1 1 2 u 1 t h 1 v 1 s 1 1 2 implementing eigenvalue analysis to obtain eigenvalues of a represented by z i k n n 1 2 p the poles of the retardation function can be obtained through relational expression λ i k n l n z i k n δ t and substituting z i k n into eq 29 the corresponding residue γ i k n can be computed 3 4 response estimation for floating structures one the estimated sate space matrices of each retardation function are obtained they should be assembled in an mdof model to estimate the response of floating structures substituting the assembled mdof state space model into eq 11 the motion equation of floating structure becomes the following expression 32 m a x t ℂ ℤ t c x t f e x c t and 33 ℤ t a ℤ t b x t where a b ℂ and ℤ are assemblies of a ˆ i k b ˆ i k c ˆ i k and z i k introducing an auxiliary variable v t and letting v t x t a differential equation set can be established using eqs 32 and 33 solving the differential equation set the response of displacement and velocity of floating structures are estimated 34 x t v t v t m a 1 f e x c t c x t ℂ ℤ t ℤ t a z t b v t 3 5 scheme of the proposed method to apply the proposed method to calculate response of floating structures the following steps are employed 1 after calculating a i k and b i k ω through the software sesam and performing integration of b i k ω using eq 28 the retardation functions k i k t are then obtained which are used to calculate the differential equation expressed by eq 12 2 by converting convolution items in eq 12 into the outputs of corresponding state space models and using eq 14 to calculate f i k r instead of computing convolution directly the problem of calculating the convolution items becomes obtaining the output of state space models corresponding to the retardation functions 3 by regarding the retardation functions as impulse responses and translating them into state space models using the method described in section 3 2 the state space matrices can then be expressed by poles and corresponding residues of retardation functions which are shown as eq 27 4 after discretizing the retardation function k i k t with sampling interval δ t and using eq 30 to construct the hankel matrix the realization of system matrix a can then be obtained using eq 31 depending on eigenvalue analysis of a and eq 29 the poles and corresponding residues are obtained 5 by constructing a i k b i k and c i k based on those poles and residues in step 4 and assembling them in an mdof model and by introducing the mdof state space model into the cummins equation as eq 34 the fourth order runge kutta method is chosen to solve the differential equations through the above processes the response of the floating structures is obtained 4 test case state space model parameter estimation from the retardation function 4 1 numerical model of the retardation function in this part a simple retardation function as an example is considered to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed method to represent the retardation function using a state space model this example has all the properties of the convolution term in the time and frequency domains taghipour et al 2008 only for the discussion of the relationship between the state space model and retardation function it does not stand for any physical models the frequency dependent added mass and damping can be assumed as follows 35 a s ω δ μ 2 ν 2 ω 2 ν 1 μ 2 ν 2 ω 2 2 4 μ 2 ω 2 36 b s ω 2 μ ν 1 ω 2 μ 2 ν 2 ω 2 2 4 μ 2 ω 2 δ applying the cosine transform to b s ω using eq 10 the time domain retardation function can be obtained 37 k s t 1 ν e μ t cos ν t μ ν sin ν t substituting μ 0 2 ν 2 and δ 0 5 into eq 35 and eq 36 the added mass a s ω and damping b s ω plots versus the frequency are shown in fig 1 with the resolution δ ω 0 1 rad s the retardation function of eq 37 can be expressed as 38 k s t 3 e 0 2 t cos 2 t 0 1 sin 2 t 3 1 01 e 0 2 t cos 2 t φ where cos φ 1 1 01 sin φ 0 1 1 01 to obtain an analytical solution of state space matrices the retardation function is expressed using state space matrices of the proposed method which is as follows 39 k s t c s e a s t b s l 1 n γ l e λ l t because k s t is a real valued equation λ l and γ l must either be real numbers or complex conjugate pairs in this example the retardation function is a damping harmonic which means the order is 2 and the parameters of the two items are conjugate pairs letting γ 1 2 a e j ϕ λ 1 2 α j ω and substituting into eq 39 the imaginary parts of the two items are counteracted then eq 39 is rewritten as 40 k s t 2 a e α t cos ω t ϕ comparing eq 38 with eq 40 the relationship a 1 5 1 01 α 0 2 ω 2 cos ϕ 1 1 01 sin ϕ 0 1 1 01 can be obtained which means γ 1 2 a cos ϕ jsin ϕ 1 5 0 15 j λ 1 2 0 2 2 j then the analytical solution of the state space matrices corresponding to the retardation function of eq 38 are expressed as follows 41 a s 0 2 2 j 0 2 2 j b s 1 1 c s 1 5 0 15 j 1 5 0 15 j t d s 0 4 2 estimation of state space model matrices using the proposed method the analytical solution of state space matrices is obtained in section 4 1 and can be used to verify the correctness of the proposed method in this part the proposed method is applied to estimate state space matrices which includes three steps 1 constructing a hankel matrix h k using eq 30 with discrete retardation function data and the sampling interval δ t 0 2 s 2 applying singular value decomposition svd to the hankel matrix and computing a realization of system matrix a through eq 31 letting ξ η 512 and the model order p of the retardation function is determined by estimated singular values in this example p 2 and 3 implementing eigenvalue analysis to system matrix a whose eigenvalues are z ˆ 1 0 88495 0 37415 j and z ˆ 2 0 88495 0 37415 j and depending on the relationship λ n ln z n δ t to obtain poles that are λ ˆ 1 0 2 2 j and λ ˆ 2 0 2 2 j the corresponding residues γ ˆ 1 1 5 0 15 j and γ ˆ 2 1 5 0 15 j are computed through eq 29 then the estimated state space model matrices are obtained as follows 42 a ˆ s 0 2 2 j 0 2 2 j b ˆ s 1 1 c ˆ s 1 5 0 15 j 1 5 0 15 j t d ˆ s 0 comparison of the analytical solution and the estimated state space matrices using the proposed method as eq 41 and eq 42 shows that the proposed method can identify state space matrices accurately from the retardation function 4 3 comparison of estimated state space model between the proposed method and the traditional method once the estimated state space model matrices are obtained the function impulse of the signal processing toolbox in matlab can be used to compute the estimated impulse response easily the original retardation function as an evaluation criterion is considered to estimate the accuracy of different state space model identification methods in figs 2 4 the impulse response estimated by the proposed method and three traditional methods is compared with the original retardation function in the time and frequency domain the result shows that the impulse response of the estimated state space models using the proposed method and three traditional methods is consistent with the original data in the time domain however the calculation time of the impulse response curve fitting method is related to the initial value of parameters θ in eq 3 and the initial value may also affect the estimated results as shown in fig 2 in addition the initial values of the method for real offshore structures are difficult to determine which lead to the method hardly being applied to real floating structures taghipour et al 2008 the discrepancy of the estimated result using realization theory is obvious compared with that of the original retardation function in the frequency domain as shown in fig 3 compared with the original retardation function the regression in the fd method is equivalent to the proposed method in this example nevertheless the state space model obtained through regression in the fd method may be unstable because identified coefficients of the denominator may have poles with a positive real part which generates an exponentially increasing component taghipour et al 2008 to investigate the performance of the proposed method further the application of this method to the identification of the convolution terms in the cummins equation was considered 5 test case response estimation of an sdof mathematical model using the proposed method in this part an sdof mathematical model will be discussed to illustrate the response estimation process of the proposed method and investigate its performance because there is no analytical solution of response in the sdof system the fd method and the newmark β method are used to calculate dynamic response of the system compared with the convolution item replacement using the proposed method two different excitation scenarios of the system are analyzed scenario i excitation composed of purely or damped harmonic waves and scenario ii excitation composed of random waves 5 1 response estimation of the system with harmonic excitation substituting μ 0 2 ν 2 δ 0 5 m 1 and c 5 5 into eq 11 the sdof mathematical model can be expressed as 43 1 5 x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ 5 5 x t f e x c t in which excitation f e x c t is synthesized using the following formula 44 f k e x c n 1 3 a n e ζ n t k cos ω n t k θ n the parameters of the above formula equation are listed in table 1 ζ n 0 corresponding to purely harmonic waves and ζ n 0 corresponding to damped harmonic waves respectively with δ t 0 1 s and n 2049 the excitation force versus time of two scenarios is shown as fig 5 the comparisons of the estimated response using the traditional newmark β method and the fd method with the proposed method by replacing the convolution item with the state space equation the newmark β method applies an iterative method to compute displacement velocity and acceleration of the sdof system and the convolution item is discretized as the summation form the hydrodynamic coefficients a s ω and b s ω should be obtained when using the fd method to estimate the response of the system with sampling interval δ t 0 1 s i e the sampling frequency f s 1 δ t 10 hz and the frequency resolution δ ω 2 π f s n 0 0307 rad s submitting a s ω and b s ω into the transfer function of the sdof system and implementing fourier transform to excitation the frequency response is the product of the transfer function and the excitation in the frequency domain then the response of the sdof system in the time domain can be obtained by applying an inverse fourier transform to the frequency response one concern is that the number of points computed in the fd method should be odd only in this case the fourier transform of excitation is symmetrical which can reduce errors when subsequently implementing inverse fourier transform first the excitation composed of purely harmonic waves is considered comparing the response of the sdof system using the traditional newmark β method and the fd method with the new approach in the time and frequency domain the results are shown as fig 6 and fig 7 the fourth order runge kutta method is chosen to solve the differential equation of the sdof model as eq 34 in the new approach the initial conditions of velocity and displacement are set to zero the comparison diagram of the traditional method and the proposed method indicates that the estimated responses match well the wave excitations of actual floating structures are not always purely harmonic waves to investigate the proposed method the case of the sdof system excited by damped harmonic waves is considered comparisons of responses applying the proposed method and the traditional method are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the study of the response calculation in the sdof system shows that the response with replacement of the convolution item using the proposed state space model estimation method matches well with the traditional methods in the time and frequency domain no matter whether the excitation force is composed of purely harmonic waves or damped harmonic waves the discrepancy of the response is reflected mainly in the initial stage of simulation because the traditional fd method can only compute the steady response of the sdof model 5 2 response estimation of the structure with random excitation the discussion in section 5 1 shows that the proposed method can accurately calculate the response of the sdof model with three component excitation a more practical issue is that the exciting wave force contains components with multiple frequencies which is usually described by the wave spectrum the wave spectrum of the actual sea area is narrow band spectrum in general the frequencies of the exciting wave force range from ω f to ω u to simulate the actual wave force in this section where ω f and ω u are the lower and upper frequencies in radians let ω f 0 015 rad s and ω u 1 8 rad s which means that the periods of the waves covering a range of 3 49 s 418 88 s are considered the exciting force contains 120 components a n in eq 44 i e amplitudes of components are generated using a random number generator obeying a normal distribution with mean parameter 0 and standard deviation parameter 0 1 and random amplitudes should take absolute values because a n must be positive θ n are random phases following a normal distribution whose mean is 0 and standard deviation is 0 25 respectively the simulated wave force with multiple components is plotted in fig 10 when δ t 0 1 s the state space model matrices are the same as eq 41 when computing the response of the sdof system using the proposed method in this section with calculation step δ t 0 1 s when applying the fourth order runge kutta method of the new approach the time domain response is plotted in fig 11 the traditional newmark β method with α 0 6 and β 0 5 and the fd method are implemented at same time to compare with the proposed method the results show that the new approach matches better with the fd method than it does with the newmark β method implementing fourier transfer to response of the proposed method and the newmark β method the frequency response of the new approach and the traditional time and fd method are shown in fig 12 and the same conclusion can be obtained the discrepancy of the two time domain methods may be caused by the time step of the calculation which will be discussed in the next section 5 3 study of the computational interval impact on response estimation one difficulty of estimating the response of a floating structure is that the mathematical formulas of the retardation function and excitation are unknown even though the formulas can be obtained we could hardly integrate the vibration of the floating structure directly to solve the cummins equation approximate numerical methods which involve the selection of computational time step are introduced to obtain high computational accuracy the calculation step must be small which reduces the computational efficiency the newmark β method is one of the time domain numerical methods that is widely used to solve vibration equations the convolution item of the cummins equation is discretized into discrete convolution when estimating the response of floating structures using the newmark β method i e 0 k t τ x τ d τ i 1 n k n 1 i x i δ t the calculation step δ t will participate in every computation step when obtaining the convolution of the retardation function and velocity which means that the newmark β method is likely sensitive to the calculation step the proposed method replaces the convolution item with the state space model corresponding to the retardation function once the state space model matrices are obtained the intact information of the retardation function is preserved in the state space model which can reduce integral error in this section the discussion of the calculation step influencing the traditional newmark β method and the new approach is carried out to simplify the course of discussion we assume that the excitation in eq 43 contains only one harmonic wave let f e x c 2 cos 0 85 t π 6 in this analysis example with δ t 0 01 s δ t 0 2 s and δ t 0 5 s the newmark β method and the proposed method are used to estimate response of the sdof model then the accuracy of the two time domain methods is compared in the time domain the parameters of the sdof system are same as those in section 5 1 except for the exciting force the estimated responses of the two time domain methods under the excitation of the harmonic wave are plotted in fig 13 when δ t 0 01 s the figure shows that the two methods match well when the calculation step is small for the traditional newmark β method the estimated result of δ t 0 01 s can be regarded as the reference value for the real response and the calculation results for three of the time intervals are plotted in fig 14 the comparison diagram shows that a discrepancy has occurred when δ t 0 2 s compared with the response at δ t 0 01 s and the discrepancy is obvious when δ t 0 5 s this study indicates that if a high accuracy estimated response of floating structures is required using traditional newmark β method the calculation step must be sufficiently small the response of the sdof system computed by the proposed method shown in fig 15 when δ t 0 01 s δ t 0 2 s and δ t 0 5 s we can learn from the figure that the calculated response points applying the proposed method are all located at line of reference values whether δ t 0 2 s or δ t 0 5 s compared with the newmark β method the new approach is not sensitive to the calculation step when estimating the response of vibration which is beneficial to the dynamic response analysis state space matrices are same as in eq 41 when δ t 0 1 s δ t 0 2 s and δ t 0 5 s which means that only small errors are generated when calculating the convolution item of the cummins equation using the proposed method which is superior to the traditional newmark β method 6 test case a semi submersible platform numerical sturdies are implemented in this section for an mdof model to investigate the performance of the proposed method in the further analysis of floating structures a semi platform at zero forward speed is chosen as the research object as shown in fig 16 the basic parameters of the semi are given in table 2 and detailed parameters can be consulted in ref sesam 2008 6 1 calculation of frequency dependent damping the hydrodynamic coefficients of this example are extracted from commercial software sesam the frequencies of frequency dependent damping consist of 60 components ranging from 0 1 to 2 165 rad s before the dynamic response analysis the response amplitude operators raos are estimated by sesam which shows that there are no responses in the roll yaw and surge response when the incident wave direction angle is zero degrees therefore the response of the semi in heave and pitch will be discussed in this section and raos of heave and pitch are shown as fig 17 depending on the analysis result of sesam there are 10 nonzero quantities in the frequency dependent damping matrix and mass matrix and 3 nonzero values in the restoring matrix at same time which means only b 11 ω b 15 ω b 33 ω and b 55 ω will participate in the calculation when estimating the response in heave and pitch the frequency dependent damping versus frequency are exhibited in fig 18 the number of calculated frequencies of a ω and b ω in sesam is finite which leads to a suitable frequency range that should be selected to obtain a more accurate result the raos in the heave and pitch of semi are close to zero when the wave frequencies are above 1 4 rad s checking fig 17 however the value of frequency dependent damping is relatively large when the frequency is 1 4 rad s which means that a significant error will occur when taking the frequency scope of 0 1 1 4 rad s considering the raos and frequency dependent damping together the frequency ranging from 0 1 to 2 165 rad s is chosen to compute the dynamic response fig 18 shows that frequency dependent damping participating in calculation tends to zero when the frequency is equal to 2 165 rad s except for b 11 ω one method to address the case is fitting a polynomial curve to the tail of the frequency dependent damping and extrapolating the values based on the tail fit taghipour et al 2008 the result of the extrapolation method is indeterminate when the curve order is different which may bring extra deviation meanwhile the value of b 11 ω is small under the frequency of 2 162 rad s based on this condition the values of frequency dependent damping above 2 162 rad s will be truncated when calculating k 11 t using eq 28 6 2 estimation of state space model the frequency dependent damping is obtained from sesam to estimate the state space model of the retardation function the retardation function in the time domain should be calculated first a trapezoidal integral method is applied to compute the cosine transform of b ω the result of integrals shown in the top plots of figs 19 22 are marked in red and are regarded as input data to identify the state space model from the figures the values of the retardation functions decline with time and are close to zero after 50 s hence the duration from 0 to 50 s of the retardation functions is considered to estimate the state space model to simplify the calculation the sampling interval is set as 0 5 s in conformity with the subsequent time step of the response calculation the computed results indicate that the sampling interval of 0 5 s is suitable for state space model estimation using the proposed method the orders of the system should be obtained before identifying the state space model one method to determine the system orders is based on svd which considers that the numbers of significant singular values of retardation functions are system orders pickrel 1996 in this paper a method similar to the stabilization diagram method heylen et al 1995 is applied the method presupposes system orders and obtains the state space model using eq 29 and eq 27 comparing the original retardation functions with irfs calculated by the state space model obtained increasing presupposed orders until the irfs match well with the original data the presupposed orders are considered system orders the irfs computed by the state space model are in accordance with the original data when system orders are set as 20 shown as the top plots of figs 19 22 in this example the absolute values of residues of the proposed method represent the amplitude i e for the energy of retardation functions the smaller values are considered to correspond to noise components caused by calculation error liu et al 2016 the residues and corresponding poles are truncated when their absolute values are less than a hundredth of the maximum absolute values to reduce error the irfs of the estimated state space model using the proposed identity method are plotted in figs 19 22 the comparison of the estimated results and original data in the time domain is shown in the above figures which indicate that the two sets of data are in good agreement with each other to evaluate the correctness of the proposed state space model identification method further the data in the time domain are transformed into the frequency domain by using a fourier transform then the amplitude and phase of each of the retardation functions are obtained comparison of amplitudes and phases with the original signal in the frequency domain is plotted in the middle and at the bottom in figs 19 22 which illustrates that the identification results match well with the original data 6 3 dynamic response calculation of semi using proposed method the wave forces of the semi are calculated by the deepc module of sesam depending on the jonswap wave spectrum with wave height 3 m and period 8 s the calculated results of the wave forces in surge heave and pitch are plotted in fig 23 which contains 21600 points dividing the time history there are 1024 points in every segment and the overlap is 512 the corresponding spectrum of the wave force is shown in fig 24 under the excitation above the focus is on two methods for simulating the dynamic response of semi the four order runge kutta method based on the state space model estimated by the proposed method and the traditional newmark β method are applied to solve the cummins equation the estimated state space model of sdof has been assembled in an mdof before solving the differential equations the mass matrix infinite frequency add mass and restoring matrix are derived from sesam the initial conditions of the differential equations are set to zero and the time step of simulink is equal to 0 5 s the result comparison of the two methods is plotted in fig 25 and the corresponding amplitudes versus frequency are shown as fig 26 respectively 6 4 computation efficiency analysis the calculation of convolution in the cummins equations consumes significant time when computing dynamic responses of floating structures using the traditional newmark β method in this section the discussion of the proposed method is implemented to investigate the performance of the new approach from the computation efficiency perspective the responses of semi are calculated using the proposed method and the newmark β method the cpu time will be recorded when running a matlab program of the two methods a computer with a 3 4 ghz cpu clock frequency and a 12 gb physical memory is used for the simulation the calculation step and sampling interval of the state space model estimation are 0 5 s the step number of the simulation starts from 1000 and increases with an interval of 4000 until the step number equals 21000 the time consumed by the two methods is shown in fig 27 6 5 experimental study of semi submersible platform model a scale model of semi submersible platform shown in fig 28 is applied to study the dynamic response using the proposed method the physical model is constructed with design data from the real semi submersible c l 80 and also satisfies the constraints on dynamic and geometry similarities the physical model is fabricated using wooden boards fiberglass steel tubes and steel plates with total length of 1 426 m molded breadth of 0 930 m molded depth of 0 481 m the tonnage of the physical model is 0 09863 ton and the radiuses of gyration about the coordinate x y z axis are 0 3682 m 0 4165 m and 0 4842 m respectively the instruments include wave gauges dj800 for incident wave height measurement and a measurement system optotrak certus ndi canada for response data acquisition to perform the response analysis of the semi submersible platform the hydrodynamic parameters should be initially determined the software sesam is used to compute the mass matrix the infinite frequency added mass the restoring matrix and the frequency dependent damping of prototype the prototype of semi submersible platform is a symmetric structure and the y coordinate of center of gravity is 0 which means that the heave response doesn t couple with other responses thus the heave response analysis is converted into a sdof system dynamic response analysis according to the results obtained by sesam the parameters of m 33 a 33 and c 33 are determined with a value of 5 176 10 7 kg 7 274 10 7 kg and 1 200 10 7 n m respectively the frequency dependent damping b 33 ω is shown in fig 29 depending on eq 28 to perform integration the retardation function k 33 t can be obtained to compute discrete k 33 t the sampling interval is set as 0 01s it obtains the poles and corresponding residues which is listed in table 3 by substituting the discrete retardation function into eqs 30 and 31 and setting the order as 8 the state space model of retardation function k 33 t is constructed based on those poles and residues comparing the reconstructed retardation function with the original retardation function the results shown in fig 30 verify the accuracy of estimated state space model as a result the retardation function can be represented by the identified state space model when calculating heave response of semi submersible platform during the physical model test a regular wave with period 1 5652 s and wave height 0 1250 m is regarded as the incident wave and the angle of incidence is 90 the responses data of the semi submersible model excited by the wave loading are collected by optotrak certus with sampling rate 100 hz depending on the reduced scale the wave period and wave height of prototype are 14 s and 10 m respectively based on the wave force excited by unit amplitude wave by the calculation from the software sesam the force of regular wave will be obtained then substituting the wave force and the identified state space model into cummins equation the heave responses of prototype can be computed by the proposed method as a result it can derive the responses of the physical model by reduced scaled method the comparison of calculated heave responses and measured heave responses are shown in fig 31 which have a good coherence the physical model experiment indicates the correctness of proposed method further 7 conclusions a new method to identify state space models of retardation functions using poles and corresponding residues has been discussed in this paper the retardation functions were regarded as impulse response and the poles and residues of impulse response were calculated using the low order prony decomposition the relationship between the transfer function and the poles and residues was applied to establish the state space model of impulse response finally the fourth order runge kutta method was implemented to estimate the dynamic response of floating structures the numerical study indicates the following 1 the proposed method can calculate the dynamic response accurately under various excitation conditions 2 compared with the traditional newmark β method the proposed method is insensitive to the calculation step which means that a large time step will not cause a significant error and 3 the time consumed by the proposed method increasing with the count of the calculation steps is not obvious compared to that in the traditional method and the improvement of computational efficiency is significant when the calculation steps are relatively large the physical model experiment study shows that the calculated response using proposed method matches well with measured response which verifies the correctness of proposed method further

23012,the proposed time domain response estimation method aims to improve computational efficiency of the traditional step by step techniques by considering convolution item with a state space model for floating structures different from the present three techniques of estimating state space model matrices which are the impulse response curve fitting the realization theory and the regression in the frequency domain a more accurate and efficient algorithm has been developed by constructing these matrices with poles and residues of retardation functions one theoretical development is that the poles and residues are estimated by using the state space model not directly by solving ordinary differential equations which implies that the traditional ill conditioned issue can be reduced significantly meanwhile this algorithm is a direct estimation procedure and also does not require initial values during the process of computing state state model matrices which means that a better computational efficiency can be expected to investigate the performance of the proposed method three examples are employed the first example is a numerical retardation function that is based on a purely analytical relationship and this function satisfies all the properties of the convolution terms in math by comparing the approach with the three techniques of estimating state space model matrices one can draw the conclusion that the approach provides accuracy similar to that of the regression method but outperforms the curve fitting and the realization methods obviously because of the improperly used initial values the second example is a single degree of freedom system excited by different forms of external load numerical results show that a dynamic response analysis using replacement of convolution with the proposed method is in accordance with the traditional frequency and time domain method however the proposed method is insensitive to the step size of the calculation which means that the proposed method is more stable to extend the proposed method to a system with multiple degrees of freedom and investigate the capacity for computational efficiency a semi submersible platform was used conclusions from the numerical and experimental studies can be drawn 1 the estimated response of the platform by using the proposed method to replace convolution items with a state space model matches well with the traditional newmark β method 2 the calculation time is reduced significantly using the proposed method when the number of calculation steps is large and 3 the heave response of semi submersible physical model calculated by the proposed method is in good agreement with the experimental data keywords cummins equation retardation function state space model poles and residues dynamic response analysis newmark β method 1 introduction with the exploitation and production activities of offshore oil and gas resources moving to deep sea traditional fixed jacket platforms have not satisfied the requirements for drilling and production therefore many new types of floating structures such as fpso the spar platform and the semi submersible platform have been developed analysis of the dynamic response in waves is an important aspect of a floating marine structure in the design stage and is vital to the secure operation of the types of offshore platforms mentioned above the motion responses of floating offshore structures in the waves can be described with a hybrid frequency time domain model considering frequency dependent coefficients using the cummins equation cummins 1962 which contains convolution terms that reflect fluid memory effects the introduction of memory effects improves the accuracy of the dynamic response analysis but the convolution terms in the cummins equation are not convenient for analysis and design of motion control systems perez 2002 fossen 2002 in addition time domain simulations of linear transient or nonlinear problems with convolution terms consume a significant amount of computing resources and their implementation in standard simulation packages is inconvenient kashiwagi 2004 considering the simulation efficiency of the cummins equation in a time domain one approach to estimate dynamic response of marine structures is commonly analyzed by solving the frequency responses via converting the cummins equation to the frequency domain to simplify calculation the frequency domain method is based on linear theory and employs a first order potential theory approach to obtain a frequency response with the assumption that the wave is a gaussian process newman 1977 the simplified conditions of above frequency domain method demand that the wave steepness be small and that the response caused by wave excitation be proportional to the wave amplitude faltinsen 2005 the frequency response functions of floating structures can be estimated using the commercial software sesam 2008 which is implemented through three steps the first step is finding the wave spectrum of the location of the floating structure the second is calculating the response amplitude operators raos corresponding to the frequency specified wave component of the spectrum and the third step is superimposing the raos of the wave spectrum theoretically the frequency domain method is based on the assumption of considering that each component at a specified frequency is strictly a harmonic type and ignoring the condition of wave damping in addition the frequency responses of the marine structure are a multiplication of frequency response functions frfs and the results from the discrete fourier transform dft of wave forces using the frequency domain method the problem resulting from frequency leakage caused by using the fourier transform should be carefully considered for the problem above liu et al 2017 proposed a new frequency domain response estimation method that dealt with the problem in the laplace domain the retardation functions are decomposed and replaced by a series of poles and corresponding residues in the laplace domain which avoids frequency leakage using dft and removes the restriction that demands the wave force consisting of harmonic components when the influence of viscous forces and inertia forces acting on the floating platform is considered the nonlinear effects must be considered because the assumption of linearity is no longer valid to solve the nonlinear problem of dynamic response analysis of a floating structure a higher order frequency domain method has been applied which uses a bilinear or trilinear frequency response function to express a motion model considering nonlinear effects based on volterra functional representations bendat 1998 gutierrez romero et al 2016 proposed a time domain model to solve the dynamics of moored floating structures which used a second order wave radiation diffraction solver to predict floating structure performances under non linear environmental loads recently an integrated floating structure model with the mooring cables has been developed to analyze the nonlinear vibration by wang et al 2018 as the solution of the nonlinear equations didn t adopt iterative process in the study it reduced computation load greatly a different approach to describe the motion of a floating structure using an autoregressive model is applied to solve the dynamic response problem tick 1959 used an ordinary differential equation ode to express the oscillation of a floating structure which has the same formulation as the autoregressive model the high order ode can be solved efficiently by converting it to a state space model many research studies have been implemented to improve the analysis efficiency of response estimation of floating structures in the time domain the calculation efficiency can also be improved by approximating and replacing the convolution term in the cummins equation mainly including the following three methods 1 replacing the frequency dependent added mass and damping by constant coefficients 2 replacing the convolution item by a state space model and 3 replacing the force to motion response by a state space formulation the first approach is a low order approximation by replacing frequency dependent added mass and damping values with constant matrices which avoids calculation of convolution and brings high efficiency in computation however the sensitivity of the frequency to added mass and damping significantly influences the accuracy of the analysis results taghipour et al 2008 the approximate method has been used for transient response of a ship by govolato 1959 and the results indicated that the errors were large because of the possible significant error of the first method the approach is rarely used the second approach has been widely discussed by numerous researchers because of the high efficiency and accuracy schmiechen 1973 originally proposed the method to the best of the author s knowledge and used the method to study transient ship manoeuvring subsequently the state space method was applied to various ocean structures jefferys 1984 used the method to simulate the fluid dynamics model of wave power devices fossen 2002 used the approach to study ship manoeuvring and control taghipour et al 2007 used the method to conduct hydroelastic analysis of flexible marine structures the third approach replaces the force to motion response with the state space model which was proposed by cummins 1962 for the first time then perez and lande 2006 identified the vessel response of force to motion in the frequency domain the second replacement of the convolution item method above will be discussed in detail in this paper the key point for calculating dynamic response of floating structures using the second method is to obtain state space models of the retardation functions the common identification methods of a state space model include the following 1 impulse response curve fitting 2 realization theory and 3 transfer function estimation using regression in the frequency domain taghipour et al 2008 the impulse response curve fitting method is an optimization problem that can be solved by applying gauss newton type of algorithms nocedal and wright 1999 the optimization method requires an initial condition that determines consumption of time and may affect optimal results realization theory estimates a state space model by obtaining a minimal realization from markov parameters with the feedthrough matrix of identification equalling zero or not affecting the accuracy of the result taghipour et al 2008 the last method contains nonlinear least square fitting levi 1959 and quasi linear regression dennis and schnabel 1983 perez and fossen 2011 used frequency domain estimation algorithms to identify approximate linear state space model of retardation function which are convenient to implement and could consider constraints on model structure to avoid numerical ill conditioning problems rogne et al 2014 proposed a state space representation method to replace the wave radiation forces of floating multibody armesto et al 2015 studied the state space model representation and prony s coefficients method to calculate convolution integral in cummins equation also compared the results with the ones obtained from the direct computation the last method has good fitting results but the fit may be poor when the pole of the denominator is close to the imaginary axis sanathanan and koerner 1963 this paper proposes a new method depending on the complex exponential decomposition of retardation functions and building a state space matrix with poles and corresponding residues then a fourth order runge kutta method is applied to calculate the dynamic response of floating structures instead of high order differential equations first order equations are used to compute poles and corresponding residues of retardation functions when estimating the state space model which avoids an ill conditioned problem in determining the roots of a high order polynomial hu et al 2013 liu et al 2018 used the method to calculate poles and residues of excitation loadings and analyzed the dynamic response of offshore structures further which obtained good results to investigate the performance of the proposed method three examples are applied the first example is a simple retardation function which is based on pure analytical relationships and satisfies all the properties of the convolution terms the comparison of the proposed method and the three traditional methods to estimate a state space model is discussed in this example the second example is a single degree of freedom sdof mathematical model excited by a synthesized exciting wave force the response estimation using the proposed state space model representation method and the traditional time and frequency domain fd simulation method are exhibited in this part a semi submersible semi platform model has been used in the third example where the dynamic responses excited by random waves obeying the jonswap spectrum are obtained using a traditional method and the proposed method which shows the potential application to the dynamic response analysis of floating structures 2 preliminaries considering a stable linear system with impulse excitation the response of the system can be characterized by the state space model in the following equations 1 z t a z t b δ t h t c z t d δ t where z t is a state vector δ t is the impulse excitation and h t is the impulse response function irf a b c and d are the so called system matrix input matrix output matrix and feedthrough matrix respectively integrating the first formula of eq 1 based on the assumption of zero initial conditions and then substituting into the second equation the irf of the system can be obtained as follows 2 h t c e a t b d δ t 2 1 impulse response curve fitting method the impulse response curve fitting method applies least squares ls to estimate state space model matrices which can be expressed as 3 θ arg min θ l w l h t l c ˆ θ e a ˆ θ t l b ˆ θ d ˆ θ δ t l 2 where argmin means the minimizing argument w l is the weighting coefficient h t l is the discrete impulse response the superscript ˆ represents the estimated state space model matrices and the variable θ contains elements that can be used to constitute the estimated state space model matrices the gauss newton type of algorithm can be used to solve the optimization problem one can find details in reference nocedal and wright 1999 2 2 realization theory realization theory obtains a minimal realization from markov parameters which consists of discrete impulse response ho and kalman 1966 to solve the realization problem the truncated singular value decomposition are implemented to decompose the hankel matrix 4 h u 1 u 2 s 1 0 0 0 v 1 t v 2 t u 1 s 1 v 1 t where h is the hankel matrix consisting of irf s 1 is a diagonal matrix made of non zero singular values and u 1 and v 1 are block orthogonal matrices the estimation of discrete state space model matrices using a realization algorithm has been discussed by kung 1978 and the state space matrices can be determined by following formula 5 a ˆ d s 1 1 2 u 11 u 12 t u 12 u 13 s 1 1 2 b ˆ d s 1 1 2 v 11 t c ˆ d u 11 s 1 1 2 d ˆ d h 0 where u 1 u 11 u 12 u 13 t and v 1 v 11 v 12 v 13 t the discrete state space model matrices are calculated from discrete impulse response that are irrelevant to response time to obtain a continuous state space model of the system the bilinear transformations are applied al saggaf and franklin 1987 which guarantees continuous time realization of the state space model matrices 2 3 transfer function estimation using regression in the frequency domain the transfer function estimation method is based on a non parametric model of the frequency response function frf of a system with a rational fraction expressing frf the estimation of frf using the frequency domain regression is characterized as follows 6 h ˆ s θ p s θ q s θ where p s θ is the laplace transform of output and q s θ is the laplace transform of input the coefficients of polynomials p s and q s which are also the elements in the state space model matrices of the linear system are included in parameter vector θ to calculate the vector the iterative method of quasi linear regression sanathanan and koerner 1963 is applied which is expressed as follows 7 θ η arg min θ l w l η q j ω l θ h j ω l p j ω l θ 2 where w l η 1 q 2 j ω l θ η 1 is weighting coefficients after a couple of iterations the vector θ tends to be stable then the state space model matrices of the system can be obtained taghipour et al 2008 3 time domain response estimation based on rapid solution of the state space model the methods to estimate state space model matrices have been discussed by researchers and are introduced in the preliminaries in this section a new estimation method based on complex exponential decomposition will be proposed 3 1 conversion of the cummins equation by using the state space model under the assumption of linear theory ideal fluid small wave excitation and body motion cummins 1962 considered the behavior of floating structures in a time domain ogilvie 1964 has illustrated the relationship of the retardation function k t and hydrodynamic coefficients including frequency dependent added mass a ω and frequency dependent damping b ω in the frequency and time domain by implementing fourier transform which can be expressed as follows 8 a ω a 1 ω 0 k t sin ω t d t 9 b ω 0 k t cos ω t d t and 10 k t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω where ω is the frequency in radians and a is infinite frequency added mass then the cummins equation can be written as 11 m a x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ c x t f e x c t where m is the mass matrix c is the restoring matrix x t is the response vector of the floating structure with six dofs and f e x c t is the excitation force in eq 11 the convolution term consumes large computer resources for a comparatively long simulated time which is not convenient for analysis and design of floating offshore structures fossen 2002 perez 2002 to solve the problem the convolution items are usually replaced with the state space model because the convolution operation is a linear procedure which is an approximate equivalent to the corresponding state space models of the linear system taghipour et al 2008 then eq 11 becomes 12 k 1 6 m i k a i k x k t k 1 6 f i k r t k 1 6 c i k x k t f i e x c t in which 13 f i k r t 0 t k i k t τ x k τ d τ where f i k t is radiation force without contribution from the infinite added mass i and k 1 2 6 are subscripts the item f i k r t in eq 13 can be regarded as the output of a system and x k t is the corresponding input respectively the relationship between input and output of the system is described with the state space model and eq 13 can be expressed as schmiechen 1973 14 z i k t a i k z i k t b i k x k t f i k r t c i k z i k t d i k x k t where a i k b i k c i k d i k are the state

different ways one of those ways is by using a high order ordinary differential equation ode for simplicity let u t x k t as input and y t f i k r t as output of the system be described by eq 13 the equivalent formula of eq 13 using a high order ode can be expressed as 15 d n y t d t n q n 1 d n 1 y t d t n 1 q 1 d y t d t q 0 y t p m d m u t d t m p m 1 d m 1 u t d t m 1 p 1 d u t d t p 0 u t where q n 1 q n 1 q 0 and p m p m 1 p 0 are the coefficients of ode implementing the laplace transform in eq 15 and converting the equation the transfer function of system can then be obtained 16 t s y s u s p m s m p m 1 s m 1 p 1 s p 0 s n q n 1 s n 1 q 1 s q 0 where y s is the laplace transform of y t and u s is laplace transform of u t for the rational function t s the roots of the equation s n q n 1 s n 1 q 1 s q 0 0 are poles of the system denoting λ l l 1 2 n as the roots of the denominator the relationship s λ 1 s λ 2 s λ n 0 is obtained then the corresponding residues can be calculated by the following equation 17 γ l lim s λ l s λ l t s l 1 2 n once the poles and residues of the linear system are obtained the transfer function can be expressed as a sum of the poles and the corresponding residues 18 t s y s u s l 1 n γ l s λ l from eq 18 the laplace transform of output y s can be characterized with poles and residues as 19 y s l 1 n γ l u s s λ l l 1 n γ l z l s in which 20 z l s u s s λ l likewise the laplace transform of input u s can be obtained as 21 u s s z l s λ l z l s by implementing the inverse laplace transform to eq 19 and eq 21 one obtains their expressions in the time domain as 22 y t l 1 n γ l z l t and 23 z l t λ l z l t u t in which z l t is the element of the state variable vector i e the inverse laplace transform of z l s converting eq 22 and eq 23 into matrix form the input and output of the system can be concatenated by a state variable which is the matrix form of the state space model as well 24 y t γ 1 γ 2 γ n z 1 t z 2 t z n t and 25 z 1 t z 2 t z n t λ 1 λ 2 λ n z 1 t z 2 t z n t 1 1 1 u t then the state space model of retardation function can be expressed in terms of eq 24 and eq 25 as 26 z t a z t b u t y t c z t d u t

retardation functions at present one method implements inverse fourier transform to obtain the retardation function however this method is limited by the nyquist frequency limit and may lead to a poor description of the function for low values of t where the retardation function k i k t changes significantly duarte et al 2013 an alternative method is using a cosine transformation to frequency dependent damping b i k ω as eq 10 to obtain the retardation function this transformation is implemented using a trapezoidal integration method as follows erlend and olav 2003 28 k i k t δ ω π k 1 k

functions k i k t are then obtained which are used to calculate the differential equation expressed by eq 12 2 by converting convolution items in eq 12 into the outputs of corresponding state space models and using eq 14 to calculate f i k r instead of computing convolution directly the problem of calculating the convolution items becomes obtaining the output of state space models corresponding to the retardation functions 3 by regarding the retardation functions as impulse responses and translating them into state space models using the method described in section 3 2 the state space matrices can then be expressed by poles and corresponding residues of retardation functions which are shown as eq 27 4 after discretizing the retardation function k i k t with sampling interval δ t and using eq 30 to construct the hankel matrix the realization of system matrix a can then be obtained using eq 31 depending on eigenvalue analysis of a and eq 29 the poles and corresponding residues are obtained 5 by constructing a i k b i k and c i k based on those poles and residues in step 4 and assembling them in an mdof model and by introducing the mdof state space model into the cummins equation as eq 34 the fourth order runge kutta method is chosen to solve the differential equations through the above processes the response of the floating structures is obtained 4 test case state space model parameter estimation from the retardation function 4 1 numerical model of the retardation function in this part a simple retardation function as an example is considered to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed method to represent the retardation function using a state space model this example has all the properties of the convolution term in the time and frequency domains taghipour et al 2008 only for the discussion of the relationship between the state space model and retardation function it does not stand for any physical models the frequency dependent added mass and damping can be assumed as follows 35 a s ω δ μ 2 ν 2 ω 2 ν 1 μ 2 ν 2 ω 2 2 4 μ 2 ω 2 36 b s ω 2 μ ν 1 ω 2 μ 2 ν 2 ω 2 2 4 μ 2 ω 2 δ applying the cosine transform to b s ω using eq 10 the time domain retardation function can be obtained 37 k s t 1 ν e μ t cos ν t μ ν sin ν t substituting μ 0 2 ν 2 and δ 0 5 into eq 35 and eq 36 the added mass a s ω and damping b s ω plots versus the frequency are shown in fig 1 with the resolution δ ω 0 1 rad s the retardation function of eq 37 can be expressed as 38 k s t 3 e 0 2 t cos 2 t 0 1 sin 2 t 3 1 01 e 0 2 t cos 2 t φ where cos φ 1 1 01 sin φ 0 1 1 01 to obtain an analytical solution of state space matrices the retardation function is expressed using state space matrices of the proposed method which is as follows 39 k s t c s e a s t b s l 1 n γ l e λ l t because k s t is a real valued equation λ l and γ l must either be real numbers or complex conjugate pairs in this example the retardation function is a damping harmonic which means the order is 2 and the parameters of the two items are conjugate pairs letting γ 1 2 a e j ϕ λ 1 2 α j ω and substituting into eq 39 the imaginary parts of the two items are counteracted then eq 39 is rewritten as 40 k s t 2 a e α t cos ω t ϕ comparing eq 38 with eq 40 the relationship a 1 5 1 01 α 0 2 ω 2 cos ϕ 1 1 01 sin ϕ 0 1 1 01 can be obtained which means γ 1 2 a cos ϕ jsin ϕ 1 5 0 15 j λ 1 2 0 2 2 j then the analytical solution of the state space matrices corresponding to the retardation function of eq 38 are expressed as follows 41 a s 0 2 2 j 0 2 2 j b s 1 1 c s 1 5 0 15 j 1 5 0 15 j t d s 0 4 2 estimation of state space model matrices using the proposed method the analytical solution of state space matrices is obtained in section 4 1 and can be used to verify the correctness of the proposed method in this part the proposed method is applied to estimate state space matrices which includes three steps 1 constructing a hankel matrix h k using eq 30 with discrete retardation function data and the sampling interval δ t 0 2 s 2 applying singular value decomposition svd to the hankel matrix and computing a realization of system matrix a through eq 31 letting ξ η 512 and the model order p of the retardation function is determined by estimated singular values in this example p 2 and 3 implementing eigenvalue analysis to system matrix a whose eigenvalues are z ˆ 1 0 88495 0 37415 j and z ˆ 2 0 88495 0 37415 j and depending on the relationship λ n ln z n δ t to obtain poles that are λ ˆ 1 0 2 2 j and λ ˆ 2 0 2 2 j the corresponding residues γ ˆ 1 1 5 0 15 j and γ ˆ 2 1 5 0 15 j are computed through eq 29 then the estimated state space model matrices are obtained as follows 42 a ˆ s 0 2 2 j 0 2 2 j b ˆ s 1 1 c ˆ s 1 5 0 15 j 1 5 0 15 j t d ˆ s 0 comparison of the analytical solution and the estimated state space matrices using the proposed method as eq 41 and eq 42 shows that the proposed method can identify state space matrices accurately from the retardation function 4 3 comparison of estimated state space model between the proposed method and the traditional method once the estimated state space model matrices are obtained the function impulse of the signal processing toolbox in matlab can be used to compute the estimated impulse response easily the original retardation function as an evaluation criterion is considered to estimate the accuracy of different state space model identification methods in figs 2 4 the impulse response estimated by the proposed method and three traditional methods is compared with the original retardation function in the time and frequency domain the result shows that the impulse response of the estimated state space models using the proposed method and three traditional methods is consistent with the original data in the time domain however the calculation time of the impulse response curve fitting method is related to the initial value of parameters θ in eq 3 and the initial value may also affect the estimated results as shown in fig 2 in addition the initial values of the method for real offshore structures are difficult to determine which lead to the method hardly being applied to real floating structures taghipour et al 2008 the discrepancy of the estimated result using realization theory is obvious compared with that of the original retardation function in the frequency domain as shown in fig 3 compared with the original retardation function the regression in the fd method is equivalent to the proposed method in this example nevertheless the state space model obtained through regression in the fd method may be unstable because identified coefficients of the denominator may have poles with a positive real part which generates an exponentially increasing component taghipour et al 2008 to investigate the performance of the proposed method further the application of this method to the identification of the convolution terms in the cummins equation was considered 5 test case response estimation of an sdof mathematical model using the proposed method in this part an sdof mathematical model will be discussed to illustrate the response estimation process of the proposed method and investigate its performance because there is no analytical solution of response in the sdof system the fd method and the newmark β method are used to calculate dynamic response of the system compared with the convolution item replacement using the proposed method two different excitation scenarios of the system are analyzed scenario i excitation composed of purely or damped harmonic waves and scenario ii excitation composed of random waves 5 1 response estimation of the system with harmonic excitation substituting μ 0 2 ν 2 δ 0 5 m 1 and c 5 5 into eq 11 the sdof mathematical model can be expressed as 43 1 5 x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ 5 5 x t f e x c t in which excitation f e x c t is synthesized using the following formula 44 f k e x c n 1 3 a n e ζ n t k cos ω n t k θ n the parameters of the above formula equation are listed in table 1 ζ n 0 corresponding to purely harmonic waves and ζ n 0 corresponding to damped harmonic waves respectively with δ t 0 1 s and n 2049 the excitation force versus time of two scenarios is shown as fig 5 the comparisons of the estimated response using the traditional newmark β method and the fd method with the proposed method by replacing the convolution item with the state space equation the newmark β method applies an iterative method to compute displacement velocity and acceleration of the sdof system and the convolution item is discretized as the summation form the hydrodynamic coefficients a s ω and b s ω should be obtained when using the fd method to estimate the response of the system with sampling interval δ t 0 1 s i e the sampling frequency f s 1 δ t 10 hz and the frequency resolution δ ω 2 π f s n 0 0307 rad s submitting a s ω and b s ω into the transfer function of the sdof system and implementing fourier transform to excitation the frequency response is the product of the transfer function and the excitation in the frequency domain then the response of the sdof system in the time domain can be obtained by applying an inverse fourier transform to the frequency response one concern is that the number of points computed in the fd method should be odd only in this case the fourier transform of excitation is symmetrical which can reduce errors when subsequently implementing inverse fourier transform first the excitation composed of purely harmonic waves is considered comparing the response of the sdof system using the traditional newmark β method and the fd method with the new approach in the time and frequency domain the results are shown as fig 6 and fig 7 the fourth order runge kutta method is chosen to solve the differential equation of the sdof model as eq 34 in the new approach the initial conditions of velocity and displacement are set to zero the comparison diagram of the traditional method and the proposed method indicates that the estimated responses match well the wave excitations of actual floating structures are not always purely harmonic waves to investigate the proposed method the case of the sdof system excited by damped harmonic waves is considered comparisons of responses applying the proposed method and the traditional method are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the study of the response calculation in the sdof system shows that the response with replacement of the convolution item using the proposed state space model estimation method matches well with the traditional methods in the time and frequency domain no matter whether the excitation force is composed of purely harmonic waves or damped harmonic waves the discrepancy of the response is reflected mainly in the initial stage of simulation because the traditional fd method can only compute the steady response of the sdof model 5 2 response estimation of the structure with random excitation the discussion in section 5 1 shows that the proposed method can accurately calculate the response of the sdof model with three component excitation a more practical issue is that the exciting wave force contains components with multiple frequencies which is usually described by the wave spectrum the wave spectrum of the actual sea area is narrow band spectrum in general the frequencies of the exciting wave force range from ω f to ω u to simulate the actual wave force in this section where ω f and ω u are the lower and upper frequencies in radians let ω f 0 015 rad s and ω u 1 8 rad s which means that the periods of the waves covering a range of 3 49 s 418 88 s are considered the exciting force contains 120 components a n in eq 44 i e amplitudes of components are generated using a random number generator obeying a normal distribution with mean parameter 0 and standard deviation parameter 0 1 and random amplitudes should take absolute values because a n must be positive θ n are random phases following a normal distribution whose mean is 0 and standard deviation is 0 25 respectively the simulated wave force with multiple components is plotted in fig 10 when δ t 0 1 s the state space model matrices are the same as eq 41 when computing the response of the sdof system using the proposed method in this section with calculation step δ t 0 1 s when applying the fourth order runge kutta method of the new approach the time domain response is plotted in fig 11 the traditional newmark β method with α 0 6 and β 0 5 and the fd method are implemented at same time to compare with the proposed method the results show that the new approach matches better with the fd method than it does with the newmark β method implementing fourier transfer to response of the proposed method and the newmark β method the frequency response of the new approach and the traditional time and fd method are shown in fig 12 and the same conclusion can be obtained the discrepancy of the two time domain methods may be caused by the time step of the calculation which will be discussed in the next section 5 3 study of the computational interval impact on response estimation one difficulty of estimating the response of a floating structure is that the mathematical formulas of the retardation function and excitation are unknown even though the formulas can be obtained we could hardly integrate the vibration of the floating structure directly to solve the cummins equation approximate numerical methods which involve the selection of computational time step are introduced to obtain high computational accuracy the calculation step must be small which reduces the computational efficiency the newmark β method is one of the time domain numerical methods that is widely used to solve vibration equations the convolution item of the cummins equation is discretized into discrete convolution when estimating the response of floating structures using the newmark β method i e 0 k t τ x τ d τ i 1 n k n 1 i x i δ t the calculation step δ t will participate in every computation step when obtaining the convolution of the retardation function and velocity which means that the newmark β method is likely sensitive to the calculation step the proposed method replaces the convolution item with the state space model corresponding to the retardation function once the state space model matrices are obtained the intact information of the retardation function is preserved in the state space model which can reduce integral error in this section the discussion of the calculation step influencing the traditional newmark β method and the new approach is carried out to simplify the course of discussion we assume that the excitation in eq 43 contains only one harmonic wave let f e x c 2 cos 0 85 t π 6 in this analysis example with δ t 0 01 s δ t 0 2 s and δ t 0 5 s the newmark β method and the proposed method are used to estimate response of the sdof model then the accuracy of the two time domain methods is compared in the time domain the parameters of the sdof system are same as those in section 5 1 except for the exciting force the estimated responses of the two time domain methods under the excitation of the harmonic wave are plotted in fig 13 when δ t 0 01 s the figure shows that the two methods match well when the calculation step is small for the traditional newmark β method the estimated result of δ t 0 01 s can be regarded as the reference value for the real response and the calculation results for three of the time intervals are plotted in fig 14 the comparison diagram shows that a discrepancy has occurred when δ t 0 2 s compared with the response at δ t 0 01 s and the discrepancy is obvious when δ t 0 5 s this study indicates that if a high accuracy estimated response of floating structures is required using traditional newmark β method the calculation step must be sufficiently small the response of the sdof system computed by the proposed method shown in fig 15 when δ t 0 01 s δ t 0 2 s and δ t 0 5 s we can learn from the figure that the calculated response points applying the proposed method are all located at line of reference values whether δ t 0 2 s or δ t 0 5 s compared with the newmark β method the new approach is not sensitive to the calculation step when estimating the response of vibration which is beneficial to the dynamic response analysis state space matrices are same as in eq 41 when δ t 0 1 s δ t 0 2 s and δ t 0 5 s which means that only small errors are generated when calculating the convolution item of the cummins equation using the proposed method which is superior to the traditional newmark β method 6 test case a semi submersible platform numerical sturdies are implemented in this section for an mdof model to investigate the performance of the proposed method in the further analysis of floating structures a semi platform at zero forward speed is chosen as the research object as shown in fig 16 the basic parameters of the semi are given in table 2 and detailed parameters can be consulted in ref sesam 2008 6 1 calculation of frequency dependent damping the hydrodynamic coefficients of this example are extracted from commercial software sesam the frequencies of frequency dependent damping consist of 60 components ranging from 0 1 to 2 165 rad s before the dynamic response analysis the response amplitude operators raos are estimated by sesam which shows that there are no responses in the roll yaw and surge response when the incident wave direction angle is zero degrees therefore the response of the semi in heave and pitch will be discussed in this section and raos of heave and pitch are shown as fig 17 depending on the analysis result of sesam there are 10 nonzero quantities in the frequency dependent damping matrix and mass matrix and 3 nonzero values in the restoring matrix at same time which means only b 11 ω b 15 ω b 33 ω and b 55 ω will participate in the calculation when estimating the response in heave and pitch the frequency dependent damping versus frequency are exhibited in fig 18 the number of calculated frequencies of a ω and b ω in sesam is finite which leads to a suitable frequency range that should be selected to obtain a more accurate result the raos in the heave and pitch of semi are close to zero when the wave frequencies are above 1 4 rad s checking fig 17 however the value of frequency dependent damping is relatively large when the frequency is 1 4 rad s which means that a significant error will occur when taking the frequency scope of 0 1 1 4 rad s considering the raos and frequency dependent damping together the frequency ranging from 0 1 to 2 165 rad s is chosen to compute the dynamic response fig 18 shows that frequency dependent damping participating in calculation tends to zero when the frequency is equal to 2 165 rad s except for b 11 ω one method to address the case is fitting a polynomial curve to the tail of the frequency dependent damping and extrapolating the values based on the tail fit taghipour et al 2008 the result of the extrapolation method is indeterminate when the curve order is different which may bring extra deviation meanwhile the value of b 11 ω is small under the frequency of 2 162 rad s based on this condition the values of frequency dependent damping above 2 162 rad s will be truncated when calculating k 11 t using eq 28 6 2 estimation of state space model the frequency dependent damping is obtained from sesam to estimate the state space model of the retardation function the retardation function in the time domain should be calculated first a trapezoidal integral method is applied to compute the cosine transform of b ω the result of integrals shown in the top plots of figs 19 22 are marked in red and are regarded as input data to identify the state space model from the figures the values of the retardation functions decline with time and are close to zero after 50 s hence the duration from 0 to 50 s of the retardation functions is considered to estimate the state space model to simplify the calculation the sampling interval is set as 0 5 s in conformity with the subsequent time step of the response calculation the computed results indicate that the sampling interval of 0 5 s is suitable for state space model estimation using the proposed method the orders of the system should be obtained before identifying the state space model one method to determine the system orders is based on svd which considers that the numbers of significant singular values of retardation functions are system orders pickrel 1996 in this paper a method similar to the stabilization diagram method heylen et al 1995 is applied the method presupposes system orders and obtains the state space model using eq 29 and eq 27 comparing the original retardation functions with irfs calculated by the state space model obtained increasing presupposed orders until the irfs match well with the original data the presupposed orders are considered system orders the irfs computed by the state space model are in accordance with the original data when system orders are set as 20 shown as the top plots of figs 19 22 in this example the absolute values of residues of the proposed method represent the amplitude i e for the energy of retardation functions the smaller values are considered to correspond to noise components caused by calculation error liu et al 2016 the residues and corresponding poles are truncated when their absolute values are less than a hundredth of the maximum absolute values to reduce error the irfs of the estimated state space model using the proposed identity method are plotted in figs 19 22 the comparison of the estimated results and original data in the time domain is shown in the above figures which indicate that the two sets of data are in good agreement with each other to evaluate the correctness of the proposed state space model identification method further the data in the time domain are transformed into the frequency domain by using a fourier transform then the amplitude and phase of each of the retardation functions are obtained comparison of amplitudes and phases with the original signal in the frequency domain is plotted in the middle and at the bottom in figs 19 22 which illustrates that the identification results match well with the original data 6 3 dynamic response calculation of semi using proposed method the wave forces of the semi are calculated by the deepc module of sesam depending on the jonswap wave spectrum with wave height 3 m and period 8 s the calculated results of the wave forces in surge heave and pitch are plotted in fig 23 which contains 21600 points dividing the time history there are 1024 points in every segment and the overlap is 512 the corresponding spectrum of the wave force is shown in fig 24 under the excitation above the focus is on two methods for simulating the dynamic response of semi the four order runge kutta method based on the state space model estimated by the proposed method and the traditional newmark β method are applied to solve the cummins equation the estimated state space model of sdof has been assembled in an mdof before solving the differential equations the mass matrix infinite frequency add mass and restoring matrix are derived from sesam the initial conditions of the differential equations are set to zero and the time step of simulink is equal to 0 5 s the result comparison of the two methods is plotted in fig 25 and the corresponding amplitudes versus frequency are shown as fig 26 respectively 6 4 computation efficiency analysis the calculation of convolution in the cummins equations consumes significant time when computing dynamic responses of floating structures using the traditional newmark β method in this section the discussion of the proposed method is implemented to investigate the performance of the new approach from the computation efficiency perspective the responses of semi are calculated using the proposed method and the newmark β method the cpu time will be recorded when running a matlab program of the two methods a computer with a 3 4 ghz cpu clock frequency and a 12 gb physical memory is used for the simulation the calculation step and sampling interval of the state space model estimation are 0 5 s the step number of the simulation starts from 1000 and increases with an interval of 4000 until the step number equals 21000 the time consumed by the two methods is shown in fig 27 6 5 experimental study of semi submersible platform model a scale model of semi submersible platform shown in fig 28 is applied to study the dynamic response using the proposed method the physical model is constructed with design data from the real semi submersible c l 80 and also satisfies the constraints on dynamic and geometry similarities the physical model is fabricated using wooden boards fiberglass steel tubes and steel plates with total length of 1 426 m molded breadth of 0 930 m molded depth of 0 481 m the tonnage of the physical model is 0 09863 ton and the radiuses of gyration about the coordinate x y z axis are 0 3682 m 0 4165 m and 0 4842 m respectively the instruments include wave gauges dj800 for incident wave height measurement and a measurement system optotrak certus ndi canada for response data acquisition to perform the response analysis of the semi submersible platform the hydrodynamic parameters should be initially determined the software sesam is used to compute the mass matrix the infinite frequency added mass the restoring matrix and the frequency dependent damping of prototype the prototype of semi submersible platform is a symmetric structure and the y coordinate of center of gravity is 0 which means that the heave response doesn t couple with other responses thus the heave response analysis is converted into a sdof system dynamic response analysis according to the results obtained by sesam the parameters of m 33 a 33 and c 33 are determined with a value of 5 176 10 7 kg 7 274 10 7 kg and 1 200 10 7 n m respectively the frequency dependent damping b 33 ω is shown in fig 29 depending on eq 28 to perform integration the retardation function k 33 t can be obtained to compute discrete k 33 t the sampling interval is set as 0 01s it obtains the poles and corresponding residues which is listed in table 3 by substituting the discrete retardation function into eqs 30 and 31 and setting the order as 8 the state space model of retardation function k 33 t is constructed based on those poles and residues comparing the reconstructed retardation function with the original retardation function the results shown in fig 30 verify the accuracy of estimated state space model as a result the retardation function can be represented by the identified state space model when calculating heave response of semi submersible platform during the physical model test a regular wave with period 1 5652 s and wave height 0 1250 m is regarded as the incident wave and the angle of incidence is 90 the responses data of the semi submersible model excited by the wave loading are collected by optotrak certus with sampling rate 100 hz depending on the reduced scale the wave period and wave height of prototype are 14 s and 10 m respectively based on the wave force excited by unit amplitude wave by the calculation from the software sesam the force of regular wave will be obtained then substituting the wave force and the identified state space model into cummins equation the heave responses of prototype can be computed by the proposed method as a result it can derive the responses of the physical model by reduced scaled method the comparison of calculated heave responses and measured heave responses are shown in fig 31 which have a good coherence the physical model experiment indicates the correctness of proposed method further 7 conclusions a new method to identify state space models of retardation functions using poles and corresponding residues has been discussed in this paper the retardation functions were regarded as impulse response and the poles and residues of impulse response were calculated using the low order prony decomposition the relationship between the transfer function and the poles and residues was applied to establish the state space model of impulse response finally the fourth order runge kutta method was implemented to estimate the dynamic response of floating structures the numerical study indicates the following 1 the proposed method can calculate the dynamic response accurately under various excitation conditions 2 compared with the traditional newmark β method the proposed method is insensitive to the calculation step which means that a large time step will not cause a significant error and 3 the time consumed by the proposed method increasing with the count of the calculation steps is not obvious compared to that in the traditional method and the improvement of computational efficiency is significant when the calculation steps are relatively large the physical model experiment study shows that the calculated response using proposed method matches well with measured response which verifies the correctness of proposed method further

23013,we study the stratified bubbly wake of the research vessel athena r v during an overshoot maneuver using a polydisperse two fluid model the motions of ship rudders and propellers are handled with a dynamic overset approach the demands of the resolution of the flow and the small time step imposed by the rotating propellers make this problem very demanding and challenging we discuss the dynamic response of the ship focusing on trajectory motions forces and moments vortical structures and their effects on bubble and density transport are studied efforts are then focused on studying the bubbly flow and density distribution and how vortices and flow field affect bubble entrainment density and bubble transport and size distribution results indicate that the void fraction and maximum depth in the wake increase during the maneuver as do the disturbances to the stable stratification bubble entrainment during the maneuver increases in the transom stern but decreases around the hull resulting in more bubbles in the wake due to transport of bubbles entrained around the hull into the inboard side of the turn the resulting wake is also wider than in straight self propulsion operation keywords bubbly flow stratified flow ship hydrodynamics ship maneuvering ship wake 1 introduction interaction of a surface ship advancing in a seaway with the free surface causes bubble entrainment due to breaking waves drop impact and turbulence wall interaction castro and carrica 2013b in addition the propeller can generate or amplify bubble concentration through rectified diffusion hsiao and chahine 2005 or cavitation the bubbly flow created by the ship surface interaction is very complex in the near field of the ship up to approximately one ship length downstream and then the bubbly wake slowly decays as the smaller bubbles rise in a turbulent stratified flow in the far field the far field stratified bubbly wake is then a competing flow between density dominated buoyancy forces uplift by bubbles and decaying turbulence borowski et al 2008 while acoustic experimental techniques can be used to characterize the far field bubbly wake behind a ship trevorrow et al 1994 dumbrell 1997 the characterization of the near field bubbly flow around a ship is especially difficult given the large void fraction levels and the presence of the hull in addition since two phase phenomena do not scale to model scale properly these experiments need to be performed in full scale performing experiments at full scale is a challenging task due to the high velocities involved and difficult access to the areas of interest it is for these reasons that while acoustic studies exist in the far wake studies of the two phase hydrodynamics in the near field are scarce key research in this area include the works performed on board of the research vessel athena by terrill and fu 2008 using an array of conductivity probes by jeon et al 2008 using defocusing dpiv ddpiv and by johansen et al 2010 using optical phase detection probes given the level of complexity and cost of experimental campaigns and the additional information and insight that could be obtained from computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations are of considerable value due to the wide range of hydrodynamic conditions around a ship from a quasi potential flow away from the ship a strong shear driven turbulent flow in the boundary layer and the highly unsteady stern flow a wide variety of bubble size distributions can be found at different points in the domain this not only justifies the need for models but also for numerical methods that allow for prediction of any arbitrarily shaped bubble size distribution full large eddy simulation les or direct numerical simulation dns of the bubbly flow around a ship are beyond the capabilities of current supercomputers and thus significant modeling efforts are necessary currently the most advanced approach to solve bubbly flows around ships relies in polydisperse two fluid models where bubble populations are modeled in an averaged sense introducing quantities like the void fraction and bubble size distributions these modeled approaches are still expensive but doable solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes and equations for the number density and velocity of each bubble size resulting typically in several times more variables than in single phase computations the complexity of the problem requires tens or hundreds of millions of grid points making the computations very resource intensive polydisperse modeling of bubbly flows around ships was introduced by carrica et al 1999 and has since been expanded to incorporate bubble entrainment models castro et al 2016 and compressible bubbles li and carrica 2018 as well as numerical improvements to more efficiently handle breakup coalescence and dissolution castro and carrica 2013a and coupling between pressure velocity and void fraction li et al 2015 these models have been tested and validated for several flows of naval relevance including breaking waves tavakolinejad et al 2010 hydraulic jumps mortazavi et al 2016 and the bubbly flow around the research vessel athena johansen et al 2010 computations on athena r v have in particular been performed under a variety of conditions and models to study performance of bubble transport and entrainment models but mostly in straight ahead conditions in this paper we further extend the polydisperse bubbly flow model to consider stratified conditions stratification has strong effects on the far field wake of a ship potentially generating internal waves and other flow features of interest jackson et al 2013 and most relevant to this project affecting the behavior of the far field bubbly wake the near wake effects are mostly indirect with stratification modifying the flow field that transports the bubbles rather than the bubble transport itself and the bubbly flow affecting the transport of density in the near field of a ship the density stratification found in nature is not strong enough to significantly affect the bubbly flow field but the presence of moderately high void fractions affects the transport of density warranting a two way coupling approach to the problem to obtain the near field density distribution that is used as initial condition for the far field computations efforts to perform cfd in stratified media are very limited in the literature and focus in the near field of the ship or underwater vehicle chang et al 2006 studied internal and surface waves of the notional darpa suboff submarine advancing at different speeds in a two layer fluid and found the evolution of the wave pattern consistent with previous predictions using rans approach esmaeilpour et al 2016 and martin et al 2016 present a methodology to incorporate stratification to an overset solver including motions as part of their test problems the authors studied the effects of stratification on resistance for submarines and surface ships advancing in a two layer flow and a natural strongly stratified condition they analyze the generation of internal waves mixing in the wake and perform an energy balance to evaluate the energy needed to perturb the stable stratification concluding that cfd can predict the extra energy needed to generate the internal waves esmaeilpour et al 2017 extended the analysis to study the dead water problem where the resistance increases dramatically when the speed of the ship is close to the celerity of the internal waves maneuvering surface ships can entrain larger amounts of bubbles and produce an unsteady wake with considerable consequences on the distribution of bubbles in particular violent transient maneuvers can be used to distort the bubbly wake the only bubbly wake study during a maneuver available in the literature reports the near field of athena r v in a steady turn ma et al 2011 in this case the authors consider all appendages in fixed condition with the exception of the propellers shafts and struts associated with the propulsion system the whole overset grid system is then rotated as a rigid body void fraction and bubble entrainment were studied and compared with straight ahead conditions as opposed to a steady maneuvers in which a steady state is studied a more realistic transient maneuver like a zigzag requires moving bodies to simulate the rotating propeller and operation of the rudders as well as the six degrees of freedom 6dof motions of the ship this increases the cost of the simulations considerably as moving grid techniques need to be applied one of such techniques that has proven robust for ship and submarine maneuvering is the use of dynamic overset grids carrica et al 2007a 2010b 2012 in this paper we present a methodology to compute bubbly wakes on a maneuvering ship in stratified flow and analyze the physics of the resultng flow and near field bubbly wake we first discuss the two fluid model for stratified flows then the techniques used to handle the large number of variables arising from the model and the high resolution required by the problem in particular the splitting of the overset domain connectivity information dci in independent groups to parallelize the process finally we study the us navy ship athena r v undergoing an overshoot maneuver focusing on the stratified bubbly wake 2 mathematical modeling the two phase equations are derived by ensemble averaging the navier stokes equation in each phase drew and passman 1999 the resulting governing equations for the continuous phase liquid can be further simplified under appropriate assumptions carrica et al 1999 castro and carrica 2013b li et al 2015 to properly non dimensionlize the two phase equations in a stratified flow the density variation with respect to the background density ρ c h is introduced esmaeilpour et al 2016 1 ρ ρ c ρ c h z δ ρ c where δ ρ c is the reference density variation and subscript c represents the continuous phase notice that ρ c h the external density variation is a function of z only for stably stratified flows and is typically obtained from experimental data for a given location and condition additionally the density variation with respect to the reference density ρ c 0 is defined as 2 ρ ρ c ρ c 0 δ ρ c as a result the dimensionless density is 3 ρ c ρ c ρ c 0 1 ri fr 2 ρ where the richardson number is defined as ri δ ρ c ρ c 0 1 fr 2 given a characteristic velocity u 0 and a characteristic length l 0 the reynolds and the surface froude numbers are defined as re ρ c 0 u 0 l 0 μ c fr u 0 g l 0 respectively all variables in this paper are non dimensionalized by the characteristic parameters defined above the governing equations for mass and momentum conservation in the continuous phase can be written as 4 α c ρ c t α c ρ c u 0 5 α c ρ c u c t α c ρ c u c u c p ˆ c 2 α c re eff s u c α d fr 2 ρ c ρ d k ˆ ρ ri k ˆ α d ρ c p where p ˆ c p c ri 0 z ρ c h z δ ρ c d z 2 3 α c ρ c k and 1 re eff 1 re ν t s u is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient α c is the volume fraction of the continuous phase defined as the probability of finding liquid at a given point in space and time drew and passman 1999 the packing force p is added to account for the repulsive force due to bubble collisions at high void fraction levels as described in li et al 2015 a boltzmann transport equation is used to model the bubble size distribution carrica et al 1999 6 f m r t t u g f m r t β m r t χ m r t s m r t where f m r t represents the number of bubbles with mass in the range m m d m in a volume d r around a location r at time t β χ s are the source terms due to bubble breakup coalescence and entrainment respectively the mass is chosen as an internal variable instead of the customary bubble volume since bubble compression is considerable for the depths involved in full scale ship operation and bubble volume changes but mass does not a multigroup approach is used to discretize eq 6 where bubbles with mass in the range m g 1 2 m g 1 2 are represented by the group mass m g and velocity u g the bubble number density equation for group g can be written as 7 n g t u g n g ν t s c b d p n g β g χ g s g where d p is the packing diffusion coefficient dependent on the void fraction of the disperse phase for all bubbles denoted with subscript d as opposed to the group referring to bubbles of size g li et al 2015 and s c b is the bubble schmidt number the void fraction is derived from the bubble number density as 8 α d g 1 g v g n g g 1 g m g ρ g n g where ρ g v g m g are the density volume and mass for group g in this work we neglect bubble pressure due to surface tension see discussion in li and carrica 2018 thus the density ρ g ρ d depends solely on the pressure even though m g does not change ρ g can significantly vary as bubbles experience compression or expansion the liquid fraction is then obtained through α c 1 α d the bubble momentum equation for group g is 9 c v m u g t u g u g u c t u c u c 3 8 c d g r g u r g u r g 1 ρ c p ˆ c ρ c h ρ d ρ c k ˆ fr 2 c l u r g u c where the bubble slip velocity u r g is defined as u r g u g u c the coefficients of virtual mass drag and lift forces on the bubbles can be found in castro and carrica 2013b liquid density changes from stratification affect also the buoyancy and pressure gradient terms and thus the bubble velocity the density variation ρ is modeled by a single scalar transport equation esmaeilpour et al 2016 10 α c ρ t α c ρ u α c 1 re pr ν t pr t ρ where pr ν α and pr t are the molecular and turbulent prandtl numbers and α is the density diffusivity notice that density changes caused by salinity temperature and sediment concentration are lumped together into a density equation as transport processes are much faster than the effects separating the components molecular transport which affects each component differently is important in the far field and the proposed treatment is not valid in that context the sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 was modified for two phase flows moraga et al 2008 in order to consider the stratification effects an additional production term due to buoyancy is added esmaeilpour et al 2016 11 α c k t α c u c k α c p e k k α c p k α c d k α c ω t α c u c ω α c p e ω ω α c γ ν t p k α

can be found in menter 1994 an sst based delayed detached eddy simulation ddes approach as described in li et al 2016 is employed the free surface is modeled using a single phase levelset method the levelset function ϕ represents the signed distance to the free surface positive in water transported by the velocity of the continuous phase 13 ϕ t u c ϕ 0 the levelset function needs to be properly reinitialized in each time step in order to accurately capture the free surface more details can be found in carrica et al 2007b 3 numerical methods the model was implemented in the cfd code rex rex is a solver designed for ship hydrodynamics applications the domain is discretized using body fitted curvilinear multiblock structured grids overset technology is employed to allow for motion of dynamic bodies and local refinements suggar noack et al 2009 is used to obtain the domain connectivity information dci at runtime parallelization of the dci computation martin et al 2016 2018b is used to reduce the computational cost of the simulation feedback controllers can be used for speed heading course roll control and program complex autopilots open loop controllers are employed for simple maneuvers though not used in this work rex has additional functionalities including capabilities to model boundary layer transition martin et al 2018a a strong pressure velocity void fraction coupling approach is employed as bubbles become compressible in high void fraction flows li and carrica 2018 the overall polydisperse two fluid model in stratified flow is comprised of the following equations mass conservation equation eq 4 1 unknown p continuous phase momentum equation eq 5 3 unknowns u c level set transport equation eq 13 1 unknown ϕ density variation transport equation eq 10 1 unknown ρ

carrica 2013a li and carrica 2018 esmaeilpour et al 2016 4 applications to the bubbly wake of athena r v in stratified flow 4 1 case setup athena r v is a research vessel built from a decommissioned pg 94 asheville class patrol gunboat in 1976 twin propellers of variable pitch are used to provided propulsion with the maximum speed of 35 knots the ship has complex appendages including skeg stabilizers masker shafts and supporting struts and spade twin rudders main particulars can be found in table 1 in addition there is available but limited experimental data for the bubbly flow in the transom stern region of the ship in self propulsion the system of coordinates used follows the customary ship cfd standard where x points from bow to stern y points to starboard and z points up in this way roll is positive when rolling to port pitch is positive bow up and yaw is positive turning to port we also use heading which is the negative of yaw and is thus positive turning to starboard fig 1 and table 2 show the overset grid system which includes 73 blocks with refinements properly located around the ship as needed for the air entrainment models resulting in 153 million grid points in total these grids are grouped into three dynamic bodies ship propeller and rudder with the two latter subordinate to the main ship body subordinate bodies such as the propellers move with the ship while also rotate around the propeller shafts the grids grouped in the ship body move with six degrees of freedom while the refinement grids around ship do not heave roll or pitch to maintain proper positioning respect to the free surface and other flow features of interest in order to decrease the calculation cost of the dci the grids are separated into two dynamic overset groups as indicated in table 2 the grids in group 2 use dci information generated once at the beginning of the computation while those in group 1 perform the standard dci computation every time step martin et al 2016 multi block boundary conditions are applied at the interfaces between these two groups this approach reduces the computational cost to about 30 of the cost of the full dci calculation in addition suggar is coupled with rex in a multiple lagged mode with 5 processes to match the execution time of the cfd solver carrica et al 2010a the total number of nodes used in the simulations was 51 for a total of 1632 cores in a cray xc40 of these cores 1593 run cfd processes 30 run dci processes and 9 are idle in these simulations the convection terms in the liquid momentum and density equations employ a fourth order upwind biased scheme a second order tvd scheme with superbee limiter is used for the bubble number density equations time derivative is discretized with a backward second order scheme diffusion terms are discretized with a second order central differences scheme the bubble mass is discretized in four bubble groups with radii at atmospheric pressure evenly distributed in a logarithmic scale in the range 10 μ m 5 mm even though the simulation is performed with 1632 cores the time cost is still significant table 3 shows the computational cost for the main procedures in one typical time step of the solver the solution of the pressure poisson equation takes 39 of the total computational time being the most time consuming procedure in the process the bubbly fow model takes 27 5 as indicated by the last six procedures note that the computational cost for the bubbly flow model solver increases as more bubble groups are employed the models of prince and blanch 1990 and lehr et al 2002 are used for bubble coalescence and breakup respectively bubble dissolution is also included even though the effect is small under the conditions of the run the turbulent air entrainment model of castro et al 2016 and the kinematic air entrainment model of li et al 2016 are employed more details on the selection of the two phase flow parameters can be found in castro and carrica 2013b and li and carrica 2018 and references therein the background density as a function of depth is shown in fig 2 mimicking a realistic ocean condition as discussed in fissel et al 2010 the experimental data includes salinity and temperature corresponding to a seasonal average the density profile is approximated by piecewise polynomial functions of depth imposed as initial and boundary conditions the bulk richardson number is ri 0 036 and the prandtl number is assumed as 1 the reference length and velocity are l 0 47 m and u 0 5 4 m s 10 5 knots respectively resulting in reynolds and froude numbers of 2 53 10 8 and 0 25 due to the high reynolds number a two layer wall function is employed near the solid walls bhushan et al 2009 inlet far field and exit boundary conditions are applied at the appropriate faces of the background grids in order to reduce compuational cost the simulation is initially performed in stratified flow without bubbles a proportional integral pi controller operating on the propeller rotational speed is used to achieve the target speed of 5 4 m s as described in carrica et al 2010b then the two phase flow model is activated and the run continues in controlled self propulsion mode for two additional ship lengths once self propulsion in bubbly flow is achieved the propeller rotational speed is maintained constant throughout the maneuver at its self propulsion value of 3 1 rps this value is in good agreement with the powering experiments performed by crook 1981 which report powering for speeds starting at 12 knots but extrapolation of the curves to 10 5 knots results in 3 2 rps the rate of rotation of the propeller limits the time step to δ t 1 8 m s corresponding to 2 per step 4 2 motions and forces fig 3 shows the trajectory of the ship during the maneuver as discussed in 4 1 the ship remains in self propulsion condition for two ship lengths before it begins a 35 turn to starboard for simplicity the time and location of the start of the maneuverare shifted to t 0 s and x y 0 0 with the rudders turning at the maximum rate of 5 s thus reaching 35 in 7 s as the ship is reaching 70 heading the rudder is executed hard to port using a pi controller with zero degree heading target subject to the maximum rudder rate during the return to heading phase of the maneuver the ship reaches a maximum heading of 90 the total forward and lateral displacements through the maneuver are about 4 8 ship lengths each taking approximately 100 s to complete the four stages shown in fig 3 will be used for further analysis in the coming discussion fig 4 shows time histories of ship motions and rudder angle the yaw rate stabilizes within approximately 15 s of the point of maximum deflection in either starboard or port position while this is an indication that the ship is reaching steady turn at the end of each full rudder execution observation of other variables shows that the ship does not reach steady turn during the final stage of the maneuver as the ship returns to zero heading an overshoot of approximately 4 to port occurs compensated by the controller by turning the rudders about 10 to starboard the roll and pitch of the ship are small during the maneuver the roll responds to the rudder execution impulses with excursions of approximately 0 5 and oscillates with the natural roll frequency of the ship as the impulsive roll response decays and the yaw rate stabilizes a steady turn roll rate of approximately 0 9 is being established the ship pitches bow up during the maneuver with a maximum angle close to 0 2 achieved as a steady turn begins to develop since the maneuver is performed at constant propeller rotational speed the ship velocity decreases as the resistance increases due to rudder deflection and drift fig 5 shows on the left the ship velocity and drift angle where the drift angle reaches a magnitude of 12 5 to starboard or port and does not fully stabilize the velocity decreases 0 8 m s during the turn to starboard and is still decreasing when the rudder execution to port starts indicating that the ship did not achieve steady turn fig 5 also shows the hull including all appendages rudder and propeller forces in the direction of motion as the rudder turns from starboard to port the drift angle and the resistance decrease resulting in a partial recovery of the ship velocity as shown in fig 5 right the hull and rudder resistance forces projected in the direction of motion increase dramatically as the maneuver starts and the drift and rudder angles increase but decrease as the velocity recovers peaks in rudder forces are observed when initially actuated since rudder rates are imposed impulsively the time history of propeller force is presented in fig 6 the net thrust at self propulsion is approximately 27 kn resulting in a power to the water of approximately 150 kw as the maneuver progresses the thrust reaches a maximum of about twice the thrust at self propulsion since the thrust is related to the thrust coefficient by t k t ρ n 2 d 4 and the propeller rotational speed n and the diameter d are constant then the increase in thrust throughout the maneuver is entirely due to an increase in k t the thrust coefficient changes during the maneuver as the inflow velocity to the propeller decreases proportionally to the ship speed and as the flow direction respect to the propeller axis changes due to drift the presence of drift causes a net positive side force when the ship turns to starboard essentially opposing turn notice also in fig 6 that as the drift angle increases the fluctuation in forces increase fig 7 displays the turning yaw moments acting on the ship the rudders produce a favorable turning moment while hull and propellers oppose the turn turning moments produced by the rudders and hull are proportional to the ship velocity and thus after an initial peak they decrease as the ship velocity decreases the propeller moment caused mostly by the net propeller side force is proportional to drift angle and inversely proportional to ship speed as the advance coefficient increases with decreasing velocity and thus peaks right before the end of the turns to starboard and port 4 3 near field stratified bubbly flow the bubbly flow around athena r v through the maneuver is considerably different from that in self propulsion studied recently numerically castro and carrica 2013b li et al 2016 and experimentally terrill and fu 2008 johansen et al 2010 in the following sections we will focus on the flow in the first turn of the rudders and the quick pullout from the turn ensuring after reversing the rudders since behavior turning to starboard or port are similar we focus the discussion on the first turn to starboard though the accompanying videos show the complete maneuver 4 3 1 free surface and wake fig 8 shows void fraction contours on the free surface at the key ship positions shown in fig 3 the panels are shown in the ship coordinate system to highlight the bubbly wake position respect to the ship a video showing the evolution of the void fraction at the free surface and wake is presented in electronic annex i and is used to aid the discussion in self propulsion figs 3 and 8 a and first 2 s of electronic annex i the void fraction distribution is symmetric around the ship bubbles are entrained at the breaking spilling bow wave the hull free surface contact line the masker and mostly in the highly turbulent transom stern as observed experimentally mixing by the propellers and turbulence in the stern cause some upflow of high density fluid reaching the surface in the wake see fig 9 and electronic annex ii but this mixing is noticeable at the surface approximately half a shiplength downstream from the transom highlighting the difference in origin of the surface distribution for both fields the void fraction reaches in excess of 10 at stern indicating the strong entrainment source active in that location as the ship starts to turn to starboard at point b the bow wave pattern changes resulting in little entrainment on the port outboard side and increased entrainment on the starboard inboard side bubbles entrained by the masker on the starboard side are transported sidewise into the turn center and form a long tail that eventually merges into the bubbly wake the free surface exhibits a significant depression downstream of the starboard rudder on the stern see electronic annex ii 6 s into the video and the cross flow and upswelling causes high density to reach higher into the surface as the ship moves further into the turn and the yaw rate and drift increase to a maximum point c 16 s into the videos in electronic annexes i and ii the wake begins to diffuse and widens the bubbles generated by the masker fully separate from the hull and rejoin the wake further downstream the free surface shows a clear high density surface distribution on the side of the bubbly wake interestingly coincident with a low void fraction tail observed to starboard of the hull and main wake the differences in location of the surface signals of the two fields result from different entrainment mixing processes originating at different locations on the hull and its appendages in point d 22 s into the videos in electronic annexes i and ii the yaw rate is again close to zero as the turn to port has started and the wake is affected by the rudders hard to port causing asymmetry and a bulge in void fraction while the density field is overall similar to that at point c but upflow of high density fluid immediately behind the transom is also evidence of the effect of the rudders in the flow supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 01 001 the following are the supplementary data related to this article video 1 video 2 4 3 2 vortical structures vortical structures play a significant role in entraining bubbles castro et al 2016 and affecting the stratified bubbly flow around a ship fig 10 top shows the main vortices present for athena r v turning represented as isosurfaces of q 100 colored with absolute velocity as q favors smaller structures that spin faster some larger structures are not well displayed in the figure and will be shown later the propellers produce strong hub and blade tip vortices while the adverseadverse pressure gradient and massive separation in the transom stern produces the transom turbulence and associated vortices bhushan et al 2009 large angles of attack result in vortices generated by the tips of the roll stabilizers which are not deflected when turning and in the tip of the skeg among other weaker structures see fig 10 center that displays isosurfaces of q 1000 colored with void fraction cross flow due to drift causes generation of strong bilge and keel vortices and to a less extent separation on the propeller shaft and supporting struts necklace vortices on junctions between hull and appendages can also be seen and though weaker still have considerable effect the void fraction in the boundary layer see fig 10 center fig 10 bottom shows the effect of the propeller vortices on the transom vortices in self propulsion the void fraction in the wake of the propellers is much lower than the highly ventilated stern region so blanking can be applied to remove the propeller vortices the remaining vortical structures originate almost exclusively at the transom several dynamic effects are observed banding of the structures parallel to the transom is associated with the vortex shedding frequency at the wet transom due to the sudden expansion of the flow the resulting pulsating flow is free to oscillate in the center region of the wake resulting in alternating regions of upward flow with relatively high density and low void fraction and regions with low density and high void fraction which clearly indicates the origin of the fluid see annex v 0 6 s while these structures are generated more or less uniformly at the transom the vertical excursions of the regions immediately above the propeller wakes are limited in depth by the propeller vortices resulting in lower bubble entrainment and eventually in a depletion of these regions clearly observed in fig 10 bottom supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 01 001 the following are the supplementary data related to this article video 3 video 4 video 5 fig 11 better shows the bilge vortices created by cross flow during the high yaw rate phase of the maneuver point c in fig 3 by displaying streamwise vorticity ω x on cross sections along the hull as the ship turns to starboard at the bow the cross flow in the ship system goes from starboard to port causing a vortex of negative ω x marked in fig 11 as bilge vortex 1 notice that drift always results in crossflow from port to starboard and thus opposing yaw effects at the bow from slightly upstream of the masker to the stern the cross flow points from port to starboard as the effects of yaw and drift are in the same direction this causes bilge vortices with positive ω x marked as bilge vortices 2 and 3 since the cross sectional shape of the hull is less blunt from bow to stern these vortices are relatively weak crossflow on the skeg causes a very strong vortex with positive ω x as well as energetic tip vortices on the roll stabilizers discussed earlier these vortices are labeled skeg vortex starboard stabilizer vortex and port stabilizer vortex in fig 11 note that the skeg and port stabilizer vortices are directly ingested by the starboard propeller also note that bilge vortex 1 induces a secondary counter rotating vortex on the hull with positive ω x that strengthens the effect of cross flow as bilge vortex 1 dissipates downstream it interacts with the starboard stabilizer vortex electronic annex iii shows a video with isosurfaces of q 1000 colored with void fraction and density and complements the discussion in 4 3 4 electronic annex iii shows that by far the strongest vortical structures present are due to the propellers and the transom turbulent flow and that maneuvering alters the structure of the near field dramatically 4 3 3 bubble entrainment bubble entrainment is a critical ingredient in predicting the resulting bubbly wake as discussed in castro et al 2016 and li et al 2016 bubble entrainment modeling has shown enormous progress over the past years but is still a very complex problem that requires considerable empiricism and is thus the weakest link in the stratified bubbly wake model fig 12 shows the entrainment source around the ship for point c in fig 8 representing the point of maximum yaw rate during the turn to starboard the source is active at the stern bow breaking wave masker and hull free surface contact line corresponding to the high void fraction locations shown in fig 8 as shown in li et al 2016 the kinematic entrainment source is activated on highly fluctuating large free surface curvature locations in les regions for the ddes approach the turbulent air entrainment is stronger in regions of modeled turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation essentially in rans regions of the ddes approach notice that the entrainment source is only active very close to the free surface indicating that bubbles are transported deep into the flow only by turbulence the sauter mean diameter of the entrained bubbles taken from experimental measurements by johansen et al 2010 is d 32 0 49 mm where d 32 6 α d a i with a i the interfacial area density 4 3 4 bubbly flow and density field an underwater view of the stratified bubbly wake is shown in figs 13 and 14 and also in the video in electronic annex iv in self propulsion point a bubbles accumulate gradually in the boundary layer due to combined effect of transport and gravity also affected by the appendages bubbles entrained at the stern are transported deep by the vortical structures generated by the propeller and the highly turbulent flow in the transom see also fig 10 and discussion in 4 3 2 and 4 3 3 as the wake ages the void fraction gradually decreases due to larger bubbles rising and leaving the domain three main bubble clouds can be identified in fig 13 immediately downstream of the stern while farther downstream bubbles concentrate at the center of the wake this is partially caused by the effect of the twin propellers rotating outward on top which results in swirl that transports bubbles from the bottom to the center of the wake and up to approximately 0 1 l 0 downstream of the stern and then reverses into a flow downwards at the centerplane of the wake downstream the swirl flow caused by the rotating propeller passes the rudder and forms a strong upward flow further accelerated by the geometric expansion of the streamlines this up flow affects the vortex structures shedding from the transom see bottom panel in fig 10 more importantly it alters the distribution of bubbles at the stern by preventing them from transport to depth as the ship turns the upflow also changes in step with the rudder angle resulting in different bubble clouds close to transom as shown in fig 13 in the far field bubbles are mixed deeper by large scale turbulence and bubble clouds start to merge higher entrainment ocurring at the center of the transom stern also contributes to higher void fractions at the center of the wake a similar effect is observed in the stratified wake in fig 14 where turbulence from the transom stern and the propellers result in significant mixing and upflow of heavier fluid at the center of the wake near the ship but reversing downstream experimental observations at self propulsion for a higher froude number condition culver and trujillo 2007 show a remarkably similar wake structure with an extended near surface bubbly cloud reaching approximately the ship draft data for r v revelle at low froude number which has a much smaller transom stern shows also a concentrated bubbly cloud immediately downstream of the transom terrill and taylor 2015 the generation of large scale vortices on the inboard side during the turn see figs 10 and 11 results in transport of bubbles deeper into the wake on the inboard side of the turn starboard side panels b and c in fig 13 and video in electronic annex iv the main vortices responsible for this effect are the skeg stabilizer and bilge vortices the skeg vortex in particular results in high void fraction approximately α d 0 01 due to accumulation in the low pressure vortex core and bubble growth due to the same low pressure these bubbles are ingested by the propeller and transported directly deep into the wake on the starboard side the density field is also affected by large scale vortices during the high yaw rate stage of the turn panel c in fig 14 bringing high density fluid to the surface inboard of the turn see also electronic annexes ii iii and iv the bilge vortices have a dramatic effect on the density distribution inverting the stable density stratification into an unstable wake as the yaw rate decreases in figs 13 and 14 panel d the main vortices weaken and the wake recovers self propulsion characteristics fig 15 shows void fraction contours on the centerplane y 0 and a y 0 04 slice in self propulsion a more complete set of slices displaying void fraction and density are shown in a video in electronic annex v covering the complete maneuver large scale coherent structures are observed on the centerplane y 0 not present in the propeller plane y 0 04 slice on starboard side the shedding of these structures coincides with bubble entrainment activity and bubble transport resulting in large periodic bubble clouds in the wake fig 15 clearly shows that the void fraction is higher at y 0 than at y 0 04 farther behind the ship as previously discussed in this section the swirl induced by the counter rotating propellers results in up flow at the centerplane of the wake near the ship but down flow farther from the stern higher turbulence levels at the centerplane near the surface and lower turbulence behind the propellers observed in the bottom panel of fig 10 result in higher bubble entrainment at y 0 than at y 0 04 contributing to explain the observed higher void fraction at the centerplane bubble size distribution is critical to predict the far wake as larger bubbles with high terminal velocity will eventually leave the domain through the free surface and only smaller bubbles will form the far field bubbly wake fig 16 shows axial slices colored with the sauter mean diameter bubbles entrained at the stern and transported into the wake with d 32 1 mm are found deep in the wake due to direct transport mostly small bubbles are found under the ship with d 32 0 15 mm due to the large breakup rate ocurring in the high reynolds number boundary layer however the bubble size can increase in locations where bubbles accumulate due to gravity or low pressure at vortex cores as coalescence increases with collision rate dependent on void fraction and dissipation rate in addition large bubbles can be observed near the free surface along the kelvin waves direct result of entrainment bubbles with sauter diameter around 0 8 mm are found in the wake of the propeller hubs developing two characteristic clouds that eventually merge into the bubbly wake these bubbles are produced by the very low pressure on the hub vortex where turbulent kinetic energy dissipation is high favoring coalescence as the ship turns large bubbles with d 32 1 mm are observed near the skeg where the void fraction is relatively high these bubbles travel through the propeller region ultimately joining the core of the wake as the turn develops and the yaw rate reaches the maximum plate c in fig 16 large bubbles are transported much deeper than in self propulsion transported by the complex vortical system discussed in 4 3 2 and the increased turbulence in the transom stern region and wake smaller bubbles with d 32 0 15 mm transported from below the hull masker and free surface contact line join the wake on the inboard of the turn these small bubbles are very important since these will be the only ones to remain in the far field wake four locations where experimental data is available from johansen et al 2010 are monitored through the maneuver to observe the evolution of the void fraction these points are labeled m1 through m4 and are located 0 8 m downstream of the stern 0 99 m to port from the centerplane and at depths of 0 10 m 0 40 m 0 56 m and 0 71 m from the calm free surface respectively labels iihr into and iihr with indicate measurements by johansen et al 2010 in head or following waves the data from terrill and fu 2008 at other depths was linearly interpolated to these locations for consistency fig 17 presents time histories of void fraction at points m1 m4 for the initial turn of the maneuver with the available experimental data shown as horizontal lines note that the experimental data is for self propulsion with a low sea state condition not included in the present simulation self propulsion simulations mimicking the experimental conditions including the waves were computed and compared against experimental data in castro et al 2016 li et al 2016 and li et al 2018 point m1 can be out of the water periodically due to large variations in surface elevation in the stern as also observed experimentally johansen et al 2010 so computation of the void fraction requires conditional averaging in point m2 the void fraction increases slightly as the ship turns exhibiting more transient fluctuations the void fraction at self propulsion is in average close to the experimental data the highest void fraction through the maneuver is α d 0 3 in point m3 the overall void fraction decreases compared to m2 due to the increase in depth the void fraction from iihr with and terrill overlap with very small values with the model overpredicting the void fraction at self propulsion but for point m4 the predicted void fraction lies between the experimental data the void fraction for points m2 and m3 increases significantly as the ship maneuvers indicating that more bubbles are transported down and as with point m2 fluctuations also increase two other important parameters that affect the wake are the total volume of entrained air and the bubble entrainment rate to obtain these parameters we integrate the void fraction under the free surface in the computational domain the total entrained volume of air is defined as s α v α d d v and the entrainment rate is computed integrating the entrainment source in eq 7 s ent v s α d d v the integration volumes include the hull the complete domain minus the wake and the wake volume downstream of the ship fig 18 shows on the left the total volume of air around the hull and in the wake the amount of air accumulated in the wake is two orders of magnitude larger than the air accumulated around the hull the entrainment source in the hull however is one order of magnitude smaller that the source in the wake note that bubbles entrained in the hull area are then transported to the wake and counted there as well interestingly the entrainment source increases initially with the start of the maneuver but then decreases as the turn maneuver develops while the source in the wake mostly in the transom increases more slowly but is always stronger than at self propulsion as the rudders are turned from starboard to port the source around the hull recovers but drops in the wake as a momentary streamlined condition with zero drift similar to self propulsion but at a lower speed establishes around 40 s see fig 5 the total entrained volume responds similarly but takes longer to react as bubbles are transported through the domain from the operational point of view maneuvers increase both the entrainment of bubbles due to increased turbulence in the transom region and the total volume of air in the domain a slight decrease in air volume and entrainment source occur during the low drift period as turn direction is reversed 5 conclusions an overset methodology to compute the bubbly wake of a maneuvering ship in a stratified background ocean is presented and demonstrated for athena r v due to the high resolution and small time step necessary to resolve the maneuver the computational cost is considerable to alleviate the high computational cost of performing the overset dci grids are split into independent groups that are evaluated in parallel numerical tests show that the computation of pressure poisson equation is the most expensive portion of the procedure after a self propulsion stage a maneuver at constant propeller rps is performed in which a 35 turn to starboard is performed first followed by a controlled return to original heading to achieve an s trajectory with 90 heading change the dynamic response of the ship shows moderate roll excursions when the rudders are executed with pitch changes below 0 2 the drift angle reaches 13 at maximum yaw rate while the thrust in the propellers peaks at twice the value at self propulsion propeller side forces are considerable and oppose turn resisting yaw moments produced by the propeller hull and appendages counteract turning moments produced by the rudders the bubble entrainment and transport and the resulting bubbly and density flow fields are studied in detail large scale vortical structures caused by the bilge skeg and roll stabilizers as well as swirl caused by the propellers play an important role on transporting bubbles and the stratified flow vortical structures that produce mixing in the flow include turbulence generated at the transom stern and tip vortices from the propellers bubbles entrained at the hull free surface contact line bow breaking waves and at the transom stern are affected by the ship flow field and eventually reach the stern to form the bubbly wake while the self propulsion phase of the computation exhibits a wake with a characteristic central bubble cloud reaching approximately the ship draft and considerable mixing of the density the peak yaw rate portion of the maneuver displays higher void fraction and a wider region of upflow that brings high density fluid to the surface in the inboard side of the maneuver large bubbles can reach deeper into the wake during the maneuver while a shallower trail of small bubbles forms on the inboard side of the turn bubble sources in the transom stern increase during the turn but decrease around the hull current efforts in this project are focused on improving modeling of bubble entrainment and transport with hybrid rans les approaches acknowledgments this research was supported by the office of naval research grants n00014 14 1 0134 and n00014 17 1 2082 with dr thomas fu as program officer computations were performed on clusters at navy dod supercomputing resource center 
23013,we study the stratified bubbly wake of the research vessel athena r v during an overshoot maneuver using a polydisperse two fluid model the motions of ship rudders and propellers are handled with a dynamic overset approach the demands of the resolution of the flow and the small time step imposed by the rotating propellers make this problem very demanding and challenging we discuss the dynamic response of the ship focusing on trajectory motions forces and moments vortical structures and their effects on bubble and density transport are studied efforts are then focused on studying the bubbly flow and density distribution and how vortices and flow field affect bubble entrainment density and bubble transport and size distribution results indicate that the void fraction and maximum depth in the wake increase during the maneuver as do the disturbances to the stable stratification bubble entrainment during the maneuver increases in the transom stern but decreases around the hull resulting in more bubbles in the wake due to transport of bubbles entrained around the hull into the inboard side of the turn the resulting wake is also wider than in straight self propulsion operation keywords bubbly flow stratified flow ship hydrodynamics ship maneuvering ship wake 1 introduction interaction of a surface ship advancing in a seaway with the free surface causes bubble entrainment due to breaking waves drop impact and turbulence wall interaction castro and carrica 2013b in addition the propeller can generate or amplify bubble concentration through rectified diffusion hsiao and chahine 2005 or cavitation the bubbly flow created by the ship surface interaction is very complex in the near field of the ship up to approximately one ship length downstream and then the bubbly wake slowly decays as the smaller bubbles rise in a turbulent stratified flow in the far field the far field stratified bubbly wake is then a competing flow between density dominated buoyancy forces uplift by bubbles and decaying turbulence borowski et al 2008 while acoustic experimental techniques can be used to characterize the far field bubbly wake behind a ship trevorrow et al 1994 dumbrell 1997 the characterization of the near field bubbly flow around a ship is especially difficult given the large void fraction levels and the presence of the hull in addition since two phase phenomena do not scale to model scale properly these experiments need to be performed in full scale performing experiments at full scale is a challenging task due to the high velocities involved and difficult access to the areas of interest it is for these reasons that while acoustic studies exist in the far wake studies of the two phase hydrodynamics in the near field are scarce key research in this area include the works performed on board of the research vessel athena by terrill and fu 2008 using an array of conductivity probes by jeon et al 2008 using defocusing dpiv ddpiv and by johansen et al 2010 using optical phase detection probes given the level of complexity and cost of experimental campaigns and the additional information and insight that could be obtained from computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations are of considerable value due to the wide range of hydrodynamic conditions around a ship from a quasi potential flow away from the ship a strong shear driven turbulent flow in the boundary layer and the highly unsteady stern flow a wide variety of bubble size distributions can be found at different points in the domain this not only justifies the need for models but also for numerical methods that allow for prediction of any arbitrarily shaped bubble size distribution full large eddy simulation les or direct numerical simulation dns of the bubbly flow around a ship are beyond the capabilities of current supercomputers and thus significant modeling efforts are necessary currently the most advanced approach to solve bubbly flows around ships relies in polydisperse two fluid models where bubble populations are modeled in an averaged sense introducing quantities like the void fraction and bubble size distributions these modeled approaches are still expensive but doable solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes and equations for the number density and velocity of each bubble size resulting typically in several times more variables than in single phase computations the complexity of the problem requires tens or hundreds of millions of grid points making the computations very resource intensive polydisperse modeling of bubbly flows around ships was introduced by carrica et al 1999 and has since been expanded to incorporate bubble entrainment models castro et al 2016 and compressible bubbles li and carrica 2018 as well as numerical improvements to more efficiently handle breakup coalescence and dissolution castro and carrica 2013a and coupling between pressure velocity and void fraction li et al 2015 these models have been tested and validated for several flows of naval relevance including breaking waves tavakolinejad et al 2010 hydraulic jumps mortazavi et al 2016 and the bubbly flow around the research vessel athena johansen et al 2010 computations on athena r v have in particular been performed under a variety of conditions and models to study performance of bubble transport and entrainment models but mostly in straight ahead conditions in this paper we further extend the polydisperse bubbly flow model to consider stratified conditions stratification has strong effects on the far field wake of a ship potentially generating internal waves and other flow features of interest jackson et al 2013 and most relevant to this project affecting the behavior of the far field bubbly wake the near wake effects are mostly indirect with stratification modifying the flow field that transports the bubbles rather than the bubble transport itself and the bubbly flow affecting the transport of density in the near field of a ship the density stratification found in nature is not strong enough to significantly affect the bubbly flow field but the presence of moderately high void fractions affects the transport of density warranting a two way coupling approach to the problem to obtain the near field density distribution that is used as initial condition for the far field computations efforts to perform cfd in stratified media are very limited in the literature and focus in the near field of the ship or underwater vehicle chang et al 2006 studied internal and surface waves of the notional darpa suboff submarine advancing at different speeds in a two layer fluid and found the evolution of the wave pattern consistent with previous predictions using rans approach esmaeilpour et al 2016 and martin et al 2016 present a methodology to incorporate stratification to an overset solver including motions as part of their test problems the authors studied the effects of stratification on resistance for submarines and surface ships advancing in a two layer flow and a natural strongly stratified condition they analyze the generation of internal waves mixing in the wake and perform an energy balance to evaluate the energy needed to perturb the stable stratification concluding that cfd can predict the extra energy needed to generate the internal waves esmaeilpour et al 2017 extended the analysis to study the dead water problem where the resistance increases dramatically when the speed of the ship is close to the celerity of the internal waves maneuvering surface ships can entrain larger amounts of bubbles and produce an unsteady wake with considerable consequences on the distribution of bubbles in particular violent transient maneuvers can be used to distort the bubbly wake the only bubbly wake study during a maneuver available in the literature reports the near field of athena r v in a steady turn ma et al 2011 in this case the authors consider all appendages in fixed condition with the exception of the propellers shafts and struts associated with the propulsion system the whole overset grid system is then rotated as a rigid body void fraction and bubble entrainment were studied and compared with straight ahead conditions as opposed to a steady maneuvers in which a steady state is studied a more realistic transient maneuver like a zigzag requires moving bodies to simulate the rotating propeller and operation of the rudders as well as the six degrees of freedom 6dof motions of the ship this increases the cost of the simulations considerably as moving grid techniques need to be applied one of such techniques that has proven robust for ship and submarine maneuvering is the use of dynamic overset grids carrica et al 2007a 2010b 2012 in this paper we present a methodology to compute bubbly wakes on a maneuvering ship in stratified flow and analyze the physics of the resultng flow and near field bubbly wake we first discuss the two fluid model for stratified flows then the techniques used to handle the large number of variables arising from the model and the high resolution required by the problem in particular the splitting of the overset domain connectivity information dci in independent groups to parallelize the process finally we study the us navy ship athena r v undergoing an overshoot maneuver focusing on the stratified bubbly wake 2 mathematical modeling the two phase equations are derived by ensemble averaging the navier stokes equation in each phase drew and passman 1999 the resulting governing equations for the continuous phase liquid can be further simplified under appropriate assumptions carrica et al 1999 castro and carrica 2013b li et al 2015 to properly non dimensionlize the two phase equations in a stratified flow the density variation with respect to the background density ρ c h is introduced esmaeilpour et al 2016 1 ρ ρ c ρ c h z δ ρ c where δ ρ c is the reference density variation and subscript c represents the continuous phase notice that ρ c h the external density variation is a function of z only for stably stratified flows and is typically obtained from experimental data for a given location and condition additionally the density variation with respect to the reference density ρ c 0 is defined as 2 ρ ρ c ρ c 0 δ ρ c as a result the dimensionless density is 3 ρ c ρ c ρ c 0 1 ri fr 2 ρ where the richardson number is defined as ri δ ρ c ρ c 0 1 fr 2 given a characteristic velocity u 0 and a characteristic length l 0 the reynolds and the surface froude numbers are defined as re ρ c 0 u 0 l 0 μ c fr u 0 g l 0 respectively all variables in this paper are non dimensionalized by the characteristic parameters defined above the governing equations for mass and momentum conservation in the continuous phase can be written as 4 α c ρ c t α c ρ c u 0 5 α c ρ c u c t α c ρ c u c u c p ˆ c 2 α c re eff s u c α d fr 2 ρ c ρ d k ˆ ρ ri k ˆ α d ρ c p where p ˆ c p c ri 0 z ρ c h z δ ρ c d z 2 3 α c ρ c k and 1 re eff 1 re ν t s u is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient α c is the volume fraction of the continuous phase defined as the probability of finding liquid at a given point in space and time drew and passman 1999 the packing force p is added to account for the repulsive force due to bubble collisions at high void fraction levels as described in li et al 2015 a boltzmann transport equation is used to model the bubble size distribution carrica et al 1999 6 f m r t t u g f m r t β m r t χ m r t s m r t where f m r t represents the number of bubbles with mass in the range m m d m in a volume d r around a location r at time t β χ s are the source terms due to bubble breakup coalescence and entrainment respectively the mass is chosen as an internal variable instead of the customary bubble volume since bubble compression is considerable for the depths involved in full scale ship operation and bubble volume changes but mass does not a multigroup approach is used to discretize eq 6 where bubbles with mass in the range m g 1 2 m g 1 2 are represented by the group mass m g and velocity u g the bubble number density equation for group g can be written as 7 n g t u g n g ν t s c b d p n g β g χ g s g where d p is the packing diffusion coefficient dependent on the void fraction of the disperse phase for all bubbles denoted with subscript d as opposed to the group referring to bubbles of size g li et al 2015 and s c b is the bubble schmidt number the void fraction is derived from the bubble number density as 8 α d g 1 g v g n g g 1 g m g ρ g n g where ρ g v g m g are the density volume and mass for group g in this work we neglect bubble pressure due to surface tension see discussion in li and carrica 2018 thus the density ρ g ρ d depends solely on the pressure even though m g does not change ρ g can significantly vary as bubbles experience compression or expansion the liquid fraction is then obtained through α c 1 α d the bubble momentum equation for group g is 9 c v m u g t u g u g u c t u c u c 3 8 c d g r g u r g u r g 1 ρ c p ˆ c ρ c h ρ d ρ c k ˆ fr 2 c l u r g u c where the bubble slip velocity u r g is defined as u r g u g u c the coefficients of virtual mass drag and lift forces on the bubbles can be found in castro and carrica 2013b liquid density changes from stratification affect also the buoyancy and pressure gradient terms and thus the bubble velocity the density variation ρ is modeled by a single scalar transport equation esmaeilpour et al 2016 10 α c ρ t α c ρ u α c 1 re pr ν t pr t ρ where pr ν α and pr t are the molecular and turbulent prandtl numbers and α is the density diffusivity notice that density changes caused by salinity temperature and sediment concentration are lumped together into a density equation as transport processes are much faster than the effects separating the components molecular transport which affects each component differently is important in the far field and the proposed treatment is not valid in that context the sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 was modified for two phase flows moraga et al 2008 in order to consider the stratification effects an additional production term due to buoyancy is added esmaeilpour et al 2016 11 α c k t α c u c k α c p e k k α c p k α c d k α c ω t α c u c ω α c p e ω ω α c γ ν t p k α

can be found in menter 1994 an sst based delayed detached eddy simulation ddes approach as described in li et al 2016 is employed the free surface is modeled using a single phase levelset method the levelset function ϕ represents the signed distance to the free surface positive in water transported by the velocity of the continuous phase 13 ϕ t u c ϕ 0 the levelset function needs to be properly reinitialized in each time step in order to accurately capture the free surface more details can be found in carrica et al 2007b 3 numerical methods the model was implemented in the cfd code rex rex is a solver designed for ship hydrodynamics applications the domain is discretized using body fitted curvilinear multiblock structured grids overset technology is employed to allow for motion of dynamic bodies and local refinements suggar noack et al 2009 is used to obtain the domain connectivity information dci at runtime parallelization of the dci computation martin et al 2016 2018b is used to reduce the computational cost of the simulation feedback controllers can be used for speed heading course roll control and program complex autopilots open loop controllers are employed for simple maneuvers though not used in this work rex has additional functionalities including capabilities to model boundary layer transition martin et al 2018a a strong pressure velocity void fraction coupling approach is employed as bubbles become compressible in high void fraction flows li and carrica 2018 the overall polydisperse two fluid model in stratified flow is comprised of the following equations mass conservation equation eq 4 1 unknown p continuous phase momentum equation eq 5 3 unknowns u c level set transport equation eq 13 1 unknown ϕ density variation transport equation eq 10 1 unknown ρ turbulence model equations eq 11 2 unknowns k ω bubble momentum equations eq 9 3 unknowns per group u g bubble number density equations eqn 7 1 unknown per group n g total bubble mass equation 1 unknown ε m see li and carrica 2018 as a result there are 8 4 g 1 unknowns to be solved in total with g the number of bubble groups more details about the numerical methods can be found in castro and carrica 2013a li and carrica 2018 esmaeilpour et al 2016 4 applications to the bubbly wake of athena r v in stratified flow 4 1 case setup athena r v is a research vessel built from a decommissioned pg 94 asheville class patrol gunboat in 1976 twin propellers of variable pitch are used to provided propulsion with the maximum speed of 35 knots the ship has complex appendages including skeg stabilizers masker shafts and supporting struts and spade twin rudders main particulars can be found in table 1 in addition there is available but limited experimental data for the bubbly flow in the transom stern region of the ship in self propulsion the system of coordinates used follows the customary ship cfd standard where x points from bow to stern y points to starboard and z points up in this way roll is positive when rolling to port pitch is positive bow up and yaw is positive turning to port we also use heading which is the negative of yaw and is thus positive turning to starboard fig 1 and table 2 show the overset grid system which includes 73 blocks with refinements properly located around the ship as needed for the air entrainment models resulting in 153 million grid points in total these grids are grouped into three dynamic bodies ship propeller and rudder with the two latter subordinate to the main ship body subordinate bodies such as the propellers move with the ship while also rotate around the propeller shafts the grids grouped in the ship body move with six degrees of freedom while the refinement grids around ship do not heave roll or pitch to maintain proper positioning respect to the free surface and other flow features of interest in order to decrease the calculation cost of the dci the grids are separated into two dynamic overset groups as indicated in table 2 the grids in group 2 use dci information generated once at the beginning of the computation while those in group 1 perform the standard dci computation every time step martin et al 2016 multi block boundary conditions are applied at the interfaces between these two groups this approach reduces the computational cost to about 30 of the cost of the full dci calculation in addition suggar is coupled with rex in a multiple lagged mode with 5 processes to match the execution time of the cfd solver carrica et al 2010a the total number of nodes used in the simulations was 51 for a total of 1632 cores in a cray xc40 of these cores 1593 run cfd processes 30 run dci processes and 9 are idle in these simulations the convection terms in the liquid momentum and density equations employ a fourth order upwind biased scheme a second order tvd scheme with superbee limiter is used for the bubble number density equations time derivative is discretized with a backward second order scheme diffusion terms are discretized with a second order central differences scheme the bubble mass is discretized in four bubble groups with radii at atmospheric pressure evenly distributed in a logarithmic scale in the range 10 μ m 5 mm even though the simulation is performed with 1632 cores the time cost is still significant table 3 shows the computational cost for the main procedures in one typical time step of the solver the solution of the pressure poisson equation takes 39 of the total computational time being the most time consuming procedure in the process the bubbly fow model takes 27 5 as indicated by the last six procedures note that the computational cost for the bubbly flow model solver increases as more bubble groups are employed the models of prince and blanch 1990 and lehr et al 2002 are used for bubble coalescence and breakup respectively bubble dissolution is also included even though the effect is small under the conditions of the run the turbulent air entrainment model of castro et al 2016 and the kinematic air entrainment model of li et al 2016 are employed more details on the selection of the two phase flow parameters can be found in castro and carrica 2013b and li and carrica 2018 and references therein the background density as a function of depth is shown in fig 2 mimicking a realistic ocean condition as discussed in fissel et al 2010 the experimental data includes salinity and temperature corresponding to a seasonal average the density profile is approximated by piecewise polynomial functions of depth imposed as initial and boundary conditions the bulk richardson number is ri 0 036 and the prandtl number is assumed as 1 the reference length and velocity are l 0 47 m and u 0 5 4 m s 10 5 knots respectively resulting in reynolds and froude numbers of 2 53 10 8 and 0 25 due to the high reynolds number a two layer wall function is employed near the solid walls bhushan et al 2009 inlet far field and exit boundary conditions are applied at the appropriate faces of the background grids in order to reduce compuational cost the simulation is initially performed in stratified flow without bubbles a proportional integral pi controller operating on the propeller rotational speed is used to achieve the target speed of 5 4 m s as described in carrica et al 2010b then the two phase flow model is activated and the run continues in controlled self propulsion mode for two additional ship lengths once self propulsion in bubbly flow is achieved the propeller rotational speed is maintained constant throughout the maneuver at its self propulsion value of 3 1 rps this value is in good agreement with the powering experiments performed by crook 1981 which report powering for speeds starting at 12 knots but extrapolation of the curves to 10 5 knots results in 3 2 rps the rate of rotation of the propeller limits the time step to δ t 1 8 m s corresponding to 2 per step 4 2 motions and forces fig 3 shows the trajectory of the ship during the maneuver as discussed in 4 1 the ship remains in self propulsion condition for two ship lengths before it begins a 35 turn to starboard for simplicity the time and location of the start of the maneuverare shifted to t 0 s and x y 0 0 with the rudders turning at the maximum rate of 5 s thus reaching 35 in 7 s as the ship is reaching 70 heading the rudder is executed hard to port using a pi controller with zero degree heading target subject to the maximum rudder rate during the return to heading phase of the maneuver the ship reaches a maximum heading of 90 the total forward and lateral displacements through the maneuver are about 4 8 ship lengths each taking approximately 100 s to complete the four stages shown in fig 3 will be used for further analysis in the coming discussion fig 4 shows time histories of ship motions and rudder angle the yaw rate stabilizes within approximately 15 s of the point of maximum deflection in either starboard or port position while this is an indication that the ship is reaching steady turn at the end of each full rudder execution observation of other variables shows that the ship does not reach steady turn during the final stage of the maneuver as the ship returns to zero heading an overshoot of approximately 4 to port occurs compensated by the controller by turning the rudders about 10 to starboard the roll and pitch of the ship are small during the maneuver the roll responds to the rudder execution impulses with excursions of approximately 0 5 and oscillates with the natural roll frequency of the ship as the impulsive roll response decays and the yaw rate stabilizes a steady turn roll rate of approximately 0 9 is being established the ship pitches bow up during the maneuver with a maximum angle close to 0 2 achieved as a steady turn begins to develop since the maneuver is performed at constant propeller rotational speed the ship velocity decreases as the resistance increases due to rudder deflection and drift fig 5 shows on the left the ship velocity and drift angle where the drift angle reaches a magnitude of 12 5 to starboard or port and does not fully stabilize the velocity decreases 0 8 m s during the turn to starboard and is still decreasing when the rudder execution to port starts indicating that the ship did not achieve steady turn fig 5 also shows the hull including all appendages rudder and propeller forces in the direction of motion as the rudder turns from starboard to port the drift angle and the resistance decrease resulting in a partial recovery of the ship velocity as shown in fig 5 right the hull and rudder resistance forces projected in the direction of motion increase dramatically as the maneuver starts and the drift and rudder angles increase but decrease as the velocity recovers peaks in rudder forces are observed when initially actuated since rudder rates are imposed impulsively the time history of propeller force is presented in fig 6 the net thrust at self propulsion is approximately 27 kn resulting in a power to the water of approximately 150 kw as the maneuver progresses the thrust reaches a maximum of about twice the thrust at self propulsion since the thrust is related to the thrust coefficient by t k t ρ n 2 d 4 and the propeller rotational speed n and the diameter d are constant then the increase in thrust throughout the maneuver is entirely due to an increase in k t the thrust coefficient changes during the maneuver as the inflow velocity to the propeller decreases proportionally to the ship speed and as the flow direction respect to the propeller axis changes due to drift the presence of drift causes a net positive side force when the ship turns to starboard essentially opposing turn notice also in fig 6 that as the drift angle increases the fluctuation in forces increase fig 7 displays the turning yaw moments acting on the ship the rudders produce a favorable turning moment while hull and propellers oppose the turn turning moments produced by the rudders and hull are proportional to the ship velocity and thus after an initial peak they decrease as the ship velocity decreases the propeller moment caused mostly by the net propeller side force is proportional to drift angle and inversely proportional to ship speed as the advance coefficient increases with decreasing velocity and thus peaks right before the end of the turns to starboard and port 4 3 near field stratified bubbly flow the bubbly flow around athena r v through the maneuver is considerably different from that in self propulsion studied recently numerically castro and carrica 2013b li et al 2016 and experimentally terrill and fu 2008 johansen et al 2010 in the following sections we will focus on the flow in the first turn of the rudders and the quick pullout from the turn ensuring after reversing the rudders since behavior turning to starboard or port are similar we focus the discussion on the first turn to starboard though the accompanying videos show the complete maneuver 4 3 1 free surface and wake fig 8 shows void fraction contours on the free surface at the key ship positions shown in fig 3 the panels are shown in the ship coordinate system to highlight the bubbly wake position respect to the ship a video showing the evolution of the void fraction at the free surface and wake is presented in electronic annex i and is used to aid the discussion in self propulsion figs 3 and 8 a and first 2 s of electronic annex i the void fraction distribution is symmetric around the ship bubbles are entrained at the breaking spilling bow wave the hull free surface contact line the masker and mostly in the highly turbulent transom stern as observed experimentally mixing by the propellers and turbulence in the stern cause some upflow of high density fluid reaching the surface in the wake see fig 9 and electronic annex ii but this mixing is noticeable at the surface approximately half a shiplength downstream from the transom highlighting the difference in origin of the surface distribution for both fields the void fraction reaches in excess of 10 at stern indicating the strong entrainment source active in that location as the ship starts to turn to starboard at point b the bow wave pattern changes resulting in little entrainment on the port outboard side and increased entrainment on the starboard inboard side bubbles entrained by the masker on the starboard side are transported sidewise into the turn center and form a long tail that eventually merges into the bubbly wake the free surface exhibits a significant depression downstream of the starboard rudder on the stern see electronic annex ii 6 s into the video and the cross flow and upswelling causes high density to reach higher into the surface as the ship moves further into the turn and the yaw rate and drift increase to a maximum point c 16 s into the videos in electronic annexes i and ii the wake begins to diffuse and widens the bubbles generated by the masker fully separate from the hull and rejoin the wake further downstream the free surface shows a clear high density surface distribution on the side of the bubbly wake interestingly coincident with a low void fraction tail observed to starboard of the hull and main wake the differences in location of the surface signals of the two fields result from different entrainment mixing processes originating at different locations on the hull and its appendages in point d 22 s into the videos in electronic annexes i and ii the yaw rate is again close to zero as the turn to port has started and the wake is affected by the rudders hard to port causing asymmetry and a bulge in void fraction while the density field is overall similar to that at point c but upflow of high density fluid immediately behind the transom is also evidence of the effect of the rudders in the flow supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 01 001 the following are the supplementary data related to this article video 1 video 2 4 3 2 vortical structures vortical structures play a significant role in entraining bubbles castro et al 2016 and affecting the stratified bubbly flow around a ship fig 10 top shows the main vortices present for athena r v turning represented as isosurfaces of q 100 colored with absolute velocity as q favors smaller structures that spin faster some larger structures are not well displayed in the figure and will be shown later the propellers produce strong hub and blade tip vortices while the adverseadverse pressure gradient and massive separation in the transom stern produces the transom turbulence and associated vortices bhushan et al 2009 large angles of attack result in vortices generated by the tips of the roll stabilizers which are not deflected when turning and in the tip of the skeg among other weaker structures see fig 10 center that displays isosurfaces of q 1000 colored with void fraction cross flow due to drift causes generation of strong bilge and keel vortices and to a less extent separation on the propeller shaft and supporting struts necklace vortices on junctions between hull and appendages can also be seen and though weaker still have considerable effect the void fraction in the boundary layer see fig 10 center fig 10 bottom shows the effect of the propeller vortices on the transom vortices in self propulsion the void fraction in the wake of the propellers is much lower than the highly ventilated stern region so blanking can be applied to remove the propeller vortices the remaining vortical structures originate almost exclusively at the transom several dynamic effects are observed banding of the structures parallel to the transom is associated with the vortex shedding frequency at the wet transom due to the sudden expansion of the flow the resulting pulsating flow is free to oscillate in the center region of the wake resulting in alternating regions of upward flow with relatively high density and low void fraction and regions with low density and high void fraction which clearly indicates the origin of the fluid see annex v 0 6 s while these structures are generated more or less uniformly at the transom the vertical excursions of the regions immediately above the propeller wakes are limited in depth by the propeller vortices resulting in lower bubble entrainment and eventually in a depletion of these regions clearly observed in fig 10 bottom supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 01 001 the following are the supplementary data related to this article video 3 video 4 video 5 fig 11 better shows the bilge vortices created by cross flow during the high yaw rate phase of the maneuver point c in fig 3 by displaying streamwise vorticity ω x on cross sections along the hull as the ship turns to starboard at the bow the cross flow in the ship system goes from starboard to port causing a vortex of negative ω x marked in fig 11 as bilge vortex 1 notice that drift always results in crossflow from port to starboard and thus opposing yaw effects at the bow from slightly upstream of the masker to the stern the cross flow points from port to starboard as the effects of yaw and drift are in the same direction this causes bilge vortices with positive ω x marked as bilge vortices 2 and 3 since the cross sectional shape of the hull is less blunt from bow to stern these vortices are relatively weak crossflow on the skeg causes a very strong vortex with positive ω x as well as energetic tip vortices on the roll stabilizers discussed earlier these vortices are labeled skeg vortex starboard stabilizer vortex and port stabilizer vortex in fig 11 note that the skeg and port stabilizer vortices are directly ingested by the starboard propeller also note that bilge vortex 1 induces a secondary counter rotating vortex on the hull with positive ω x that strengthens the effect of cross flow as bilge vortex 1 dissipates downstream it interacts with the starboard stabilizer vortex electronic annex iii shows a video with isosurfaces of q 1000 colored with void fraction and density and complements the discussion in 4 3 4 electronic annex iii shows that by far the strongest vortical structures present are due to the propellers and the transom turbulent flow and that maneuvering alters the structure of the near field dramatically 4 3 3 bubble entrainment bubble entrainment is a critical ingredient in predicting the resulting bubbly wake as discussed in castro et al 2016 and li et al 2016 bubble entrainment modeling has shown enormous progress over the past years but is still a very complex problem that requires considerable empiricism and is thus the weakest link in the stratified bubbly wake model fig 12 shows the entrainment source around the ship for point c in fig 8 representing the point of maximum yaw rate during the turn to starboard the source is active at the stern bow breaking wave masker and hull free surface contact line corresponding to the high void fraction locations shown in fig 8 as shown in li et al 2016 the kinematic entrainment source is activated on highly fluctuating large free surface curvature locations in les regions for the ddes approach the turbulent air entrainment is stronger in regions of modeled turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation essentially in rans regions of the ddes approach notice that the entrainment source is only active very close to the free surface indicating that bubbles are transported deep into the flow only by turbulence the sauter mean diameter of the entrained bubbles taken from experimental measurements by johansen et al 2010 is d 32 0 49 mm where d 32 6 α d a i with a i the interfacial area density 4 3 4 bubbly flow and density field an underwater view of the stratified bubbly wake is shown in figs 13 and 14 and also in the video in electronic annex iv in self propulsion point a bubbles accumulate gradually in the boundary layer due to combined effect of transport and gravity also affected by the appendages bubbles entrained at the stern are transported deep by the vortical structures generated by the propeller and the highly turbulent flow in the transom see also fig 10 and discussion in 4 3 2 and 4 3 3 as the wake ages the void fraction gradually decreases due to larger bubbles rising and leaving the domain three main bubble clouds can be identified in fig 13 immediately downstream of the stern while farther downstream bubbles concentrate at the center of the wake this is partially caused by the effect of the twin propellers rotating outward on top which results in swirl that transports bubbles from the bottom to the center of the wake and up to approximately 0 1 l 0 downstream of the stern and then reverses into a flow downwards at the centerplane of the wake downstream the swirl flow caused by the rotating propeller passes the rudder and forms a strong upward flow further accelerated by the geometric expansion of the streamlines this up flow affects the vortex structures shedding from the transom see bottom panel in fig 10 more importantly it alters the distribution of bubbles at the stern by preventing them from transport to depth as the ship turns the upflow also changes in step with the rudder angle resulting in different bubble clouds close to transom as shown in fig 13 in the far field bubbles are mixed deeper by large scale turbulence and bubble clouds start to merge higher entrainment ocurring at the center of the transom stern also contributes to higher void fractions at the center of the wake a similar effect is observed in the stratified wake in fig 14 where turbulence from the transom stern and the propellers result in significant mixing and upflow of heavier fluid at the center of the wake near the ship but reversing downstream experimental observations at self propulsion for a higher froude number condition culver and trujillo 2007 show a remarkably similar wake structure with an extended near surface bubbly cloud reaching approximately the ship draft data for r v revelle at low froude number which has a much smaller transom stern shows also a concentrated bubbly cloud immediately downstream of the transom terrill and taylor 2015 the generation of large scale vortices on the inboard side during the turn see figs 10 and 11 results in transport of bubbles deeper into the wake on the inboard side of the turn starboard side panels b and c in fig 13 and video in electronic annex iv the main vortices responsible for this effect are the skeg stabilizer and bilge vortices the skeg vortex in particular results in high void fraction approximately α d 0 01 due to accumulation in the low pressure vortex core and bubble growth due to the same low pressure these bubbles are ingested by the propeller and transported directly deep into the wake on the starboard side the density field is also affected by large scale vortices during the high yaw rate stage of the turn panel c in fig 14 bringing high density fluid to the surface inboard of the turn see also electronic annexes ii iii and iv the bilge vortices have a dramatic effect on the density distribution inverting the stable density stratification into an unstable wake as the yaw rate decreases in figs 13 and 14 panel d the main vortices weaken and the wake recovers self propulsion characteristics fig 15 shows void fraction contours on the centerplane y 0 and a y 0 04 slice in self propulsion a more complete set of slices displaying void fraction and density are shown in a video in electronic annex v covering the complete maneuver large scale coherent structures are observed on the centerplane y 0 not present in the propeller plane y 0 04 slice on starboard side the shedding of these structures coincides with bubble entrainment activity and bubble transport resulting in large periodic bubble clouds in the wake fig 15 clearly shows that the void fraction is higher at y 0 than at y 0 04 farther behind the ship as previously discussed in this section the swirl induced by the counter rotating propellers results in up flow at the centerplane of the wake near the ship but down flow farther from the stern higher turbulence levels at the centerplane near the surface and lower turbulence behind the propellers observed in the bottom panel of fig 10 result in higher bubble entrainment at y 0 than at y 0 04 contributing to explain the observed higher void fraction at the centerplane bubble size distribution is critical to predict the far wake as larger bubbles with high terminal velocity will eventually leave the domain through the free surface and only smaller bubbles will form the far field bubbly wake fig 16 shows axial slices colored with the sauter mean diameter bubbles entrained at the stern and transported into the wake with d 32 1 mm are found deep in the wake due to direct transport mostly small bubbles are found under the ship with d 32 0 15 mm due to the large breakup rate ocurring in the high reynolds number boundary layer however the bubble size can increase in locations where bubbles accumulate due to gravity or low pressure at vortex cores as coalescence increases with collision rate dependent on void fraction and dissipation rate in addition large bubbles can be observed near the free surface along the kelvin waves direct result of entrainment bubbles with sauter diameter around 0 8 mm are found in the wake of the propeller hubs developing two characteristic clouds that eventually merge into the bubbly wake these bubbles are produced by the very low pressure on the hub vortex where turbulent kinetic energy dissipation is high favoring coalescence as the ship turns large bubbles with d 32 1 mm are observed near the skeg where the void fraction is relatively high these bubbles travel through the propeller region ultimately joining the core of the wake as the turn develops and the yaw rate reaches the maximum plate c in fig 16 large bubbles are transported much deeper than in self propulsion transported by the complex vortical system discussed in 4 3 2 and the increased turbulence in the transom stern region and wake smaller bubbles with d 32 0 15 mm transported from below the hull masker and free surface contact line join the wake on the inboard of the turn these small bubbles are very important since these will be the only ones to remain in the far field wake four locations where experimental data is available from johansen et al 2010 are monitored through the maneuver to observe the evolution of the void fraction these points are labeled m1 through m4 and are located 0 8 m downstream of the stern 0 99 m to port from the centerplane and at depths of 0 10 m 0 40 m 0 56 m and 0 71 m from the calm free surface respectively labels iihr into and iihr with indicate measurements by johansen et al 2010 in head or following waves the data from terrill and fu 2008 at other depths was linearly interpolated to these locations for consistency fig 17 presents time histories of void fraction at points m1 m4 for the initial turn of the maneuver with the available experimental data shown as horizontal lines note that the experimental data is for self propulsion with a low sea state condition not included in the present simulation self propulsion simulations mimicking the experimental conditions including the waves were computed and compared against experimental data in castro et al 2016 li et al 2016 and li et al 2018 point m1 can be out of the water periodically due to large variations in surface elevation in the stern as also observed experimentally johansen et al 2010 so computation of the void fraction requires conditional averaging in point m2 the void fraction increases slightly as the ship turns exhibiting more transient fluctuations the void fraction at self propulsion is in average close to the experimental data the highest void fraction through the maneuver is α d 0 3 in point m3 the overall void fraction decreases compared to m2 due to the increase in depth the void fraction from iihr with and terrill overlap with very small values with the model overpredicting the void fraction at self propulsion but for point m4 the predicted void fraction lies between the experimental data the void fraction for points m2 and m3 increases significantly as the ship maneuvers indicating that more bubbles are transported down and as with point m2 fluctuations also increase two other important parameters that affect the wake are the total volume of entrained air and the bubble entrainment rate to obtain these parameters we integrate the void fraction under the free surface in the computational domain the total entrained volume of air is defined as s α v α d d v and the entrainment rate is computed integrating the entrainment source in eq 7 s ent v s α d d v the integration volumes include the hull the complete domain minus the wake and the wake volume downstream of the ship fig 18 shows on the left the total volume of air around the hull and in the wake the amount of air accumulated in the wake is two orders of magnitude larger than the air accumulated around the hull the entrainment source in the hull however is one order of magnitude smaller that the source in the wake note that bubbles entrained in the hull area are then transported to the wake and counted there as well interestingly the entrainment source increases initially with the start of the maneuver but then decreases as the turn maneuver develops while the source in the wake mostly in the transom increases more slowly but is always stronger than at self propulsion as the rudders are turned from starboard to port the source around the hull recovers but drops in the wake as a momentary streamlined condition with zero drift similar to self propulsion but at a lower speed establishes around 40 s see fig 5 the total entrained volume responds similarly but takes longer to react as bubbles are transported through the domain from the operational point of view maneuvers increase both the entrainment of bubbles due to increased turbulence in the transom region and the total volume of air in the domain a slight decrease in air volume and entrainment source occur during the low drift period as turn direction is reversed 5 conclusions an overset methodology to compute the bubbly wake of a maneuvering ship in a stratified background ocean is presented and demonstrated for athena r v due to the high resolution and small time step necessary to resolve the maneuver the computational cost is considerable to alleviate the high computational cost of performing the overset dci grids are split into independent groups that are evaluated in parallel numerical tests show that the computation of pressure poisson equation is the most expensive portion of the procedure after a self propulsion stage a maneuver at constant propeller rps is performed in which a 35 turn to starboard is performed first followed by a controlled return to original heading to achieve an s trajectory with 90 heading change the dynamic response of the ship shows moderate roll excursions when the rudders are executed with pitch changes below 0 2 the drift angle reaches 13 at maximum yaw rate while the thrust in the propellers peaks at twice the value at self propulsion propeller side forces are considerable and oppose turn resisting yaw moments produced by the propeller hull and appendages counteract turning moments produced by the rudders the bubble entrainment and transport and the resulting bubbly and density flow fields are studied in detail large scale vortical structures caused by the bilge skeg and roll stabilizers as well as swirl caused by the propellers play an important role on transporting bubbles and the stratified flow vortical structures that produce mixing in the flow include turbulence generated at the transom stern and tip vortices from the propellers bubbles entrained at the hull free surface contact line bow breaking waves and at the transom stern are affected by the ship flow field and eventually reach the stern to form the bubbly wake while the self propulsion phase of the computation exhibits a wake with a characteristic central bubble cloud reaching approximately the ship draft and considerable mixing of the density the peak yaw rate portion of the maneuver displays higher void fraction and a wider region of upflow that brings high density fluid to the surface in the inboard side of the maneuver large bubbles can reach deeper into the wake during the maneuver while a shallower trail of small bubbles forms on the inboard side of the turn bubble sources in the transom stern increase during the turn but decrease around

23014,the investigation on the phenomena of objects falling into water is of great significance to protect the underwater equipment in offshore industry the dropped objects into water are found to be affected by many factors such as drop angle drop height its physical properties etc this study mainly focuses on considering the influence of water environment currents and waves on the dropped cylindrical objects after water entry by modifying the three dimensional 3d theory xiang et al 2017 and integrating the effects of currents and waves into drobs current is added as a uniform steady

waves the drag forces are revised by rewriting the relative cylinder to water particle velocities by the comparison between the simulated trajectory of the cylinder under currents and corresponding recorded trajectory in the experiments the simulations agree well with the experimental data the effects of speed and heading of the currents associated with the cylinder s initial speed are studied in drobs and found to influence the trajectory and motions of the dropped cylindrical objects also the dynamics of a dropped cylinder moving in the field of a progressive regular wave is investigated

are one of those which may incur safety issues during offshore engineering operations objects accidentally dropped into water may bring risks of damaging underwater facilities including those either floating in the water or resting on the seabed therefore for the purpose of protection the study on the trajectory of objects falling into the water and their landing points are of great interest and necessity many researchers have been studying the topic about a cylinder freely falling into calm water since long aanesland 1987 experimentally and numerically investigated falling drilling pipes into calm water two model tests were presented the first test was performed in order to investigate the entire history of events from a drop at the platform deck until the object lands on the seabed the second drop test was intended to verify a computer program which was developed to calculate the motion velocity and acceleration of falling drilling pipes and to predict the impact load a number of different trajectories were observed in the tests and are as illustrated in fig 1 aanesland 1987 his program solves a set of two dimensional 2d maneuvering equations which describe the motions of drilling pipes in which the trailing edge effect for a long slender body has been considered and further corrected for viscous effects newman 1977 kim et al 2002 focused on the study of characteristic motions of 3d bodies freely falling through calm water the time domain six degree of freedom motions of general 3d bodies dropping in water has been solved by a direct numerical scheme in addition the viscous effect on the cylindrical bodies have been considered by estimating the drag coefficients of the bodies for various body aspect ratios end shapes and orientations to incoming flow from laboratory experiments a comparison between numerical results and experimental tests showed that the simulated motion pattern depends significantly on initial drop angle body aspect ratio and mass center xiang et al 2017a 2017b proposed a new three dimensional 3d theory to consider the effect of axial rotation on dropped cylindrical objects into calm water by modifying the maneuvering equations for a slender rigid body a numerical tool called dropped objects simulator drobs has been successfully developed based on this 3d theory then drobs is used to investigate various factors that may affect the trajectories including drop angle normal drag coefficient binormal drag coefficient rolling frequency longitudinal center of gravity lcg xiang et al 2016 used drobs to study the landing point distribution of the dropped cylinder and finally obtained the risk free zone for offshore operations however dropped objects in complicated water flow environment with currents and waves instead of calm water are more common and realistic luo and davis 1992 simulated the 2d motion of falling objects by solving the differential equations of motion illustrative parametric studies are carried out in a computer program called delta it was found that the horizontal excursion at the seabed level is greatly affected by the drop angle in addition the maximum horizontal velocity of the object is dependent on both the drop height and angle as to the environmental conditions it is observed that the wave has limited overall effect on both horizontal excursion and the maximum velocity though the wave phase could affect the excursion the currents have significant effect on the horizontal excursion since its effect is uniform with depth and increases with the time the body takes to drop through the water column friedman et al 2003 present some preliminary results of a similar problem where a symmetric body of revolution is falling in regular waves the wave velocity field is treated as an unsteady non uniform current the dynamics of a 3d slender body falling in a weakly non uniform unsteady current is investigated analytic expressions for the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on a body moving in a non uniform current are presented numerical simulations of the nonlinear equations of motion of the body are performed also the kinematic parameters of motion and trajectories are also calculated lyu et al 2014 reports an experimental investigation on the motion of a circular cylinder after it horizontally enters into a water flow with a certain slamming speed a smart cylinder releasing mechanism is designed to enable repeatable release of the cylinder a high speed camera is used to record the cylinder s motion the effects of three factors are investigated including the cylinder to water density ratio current speed and slamming speed of the cylinder data for several cases with either a solid cylinder or a hollow cylinder are obtained and compared variations of both horizontal and vertical displacements against these factors are presented and analyzed this paper mainly focuses on numerically studying the influence of water flow environments currents and waves on the dropped cylindrical objects after water entry by modifying the three dimensional 3d theory xiang et al 2017b the effects of currents and waves are integrated into drobs by considering current as a uniform steady flow and the waves as non uniform unsteady flow based on the 3d airy wave theory analytic expressions for the hydrodynamic forces and moments are modified by adding inertial terms from waves viscosity terms are considered by rewriting the relative cylinder to water particle velocity by the comparison between the simulated trajectory of the cylinder under currents and corresponding observed trajectory in the experiments the simulations agree well with the experimental data also the dynamics of a dropped cylinder moving in the field of a progressive regular wave is investigated for different wave amplitudes wave frequencies and for different ratios of cylinder to water mass density multiple simulations of dropped cylinders in the flow by drobs illustrate that the dropped cylinder is greatly affected by changing the speed and heading of the currents wave amplitude and frequency associated with the cylinder s initial speed 2 a 3d theory for dropped objects into water flow in fig 1 oxyz is the global coordinate system where x y represents the still water surface and z axis points vertical upwards the other coordinate system oxyz is a local coordinate system fixed on the cylinder where x axis is the cylinder axis in tangent direction y axis is in binormal direction and z axis is in normal direction its origin is located at the geometric center both oxyz and oxyz coordinate systems coincide when the cylinder is situated on the water surface horizontally at the beginning the definition for the directions of wave and current are shown in fig 2 the dropped cylinder here is assumed to be a slender rigid body based on xiang et al 2017b a modified 3d theory for describing the motions of slender dropped cylinders considering effects of currents and waves

to the yaw motion the new direction for axis y after rotation is taken as the nutation axis and named n 2 rotation around the nutation axis n the euler angle corresponds to the pitch motion 3 rotation around the local axis x or global axis x axis x coincides with axis x the corresponding angle is for roll motion being a self rotation euler angle during these three rotations the relation between the

the experiment are acquired with a high speed camera from one side of the water tunnel images of the cylinder are taken and analyzed to study the motion details at each moment for example t 0s after water entry the velocity at t 0s is y 0 0 0167 m s z 0 0 4872 m s for vc 0 05 m s y 0 0 0346 m s z 0 0 5385 m s for vc 0 1 m s fig 3 illustrates the position of the cylinder in y z plane at t 0 20 40 60 80 ms lyu et al 2014 the property of model 2 the cylinder used in aanesland 1987 s experiments are shown in table 2 it s noted that model 1 is the same as model 2 except for mass density initially model 1 model 2 is just completely immersed below the calm water surface and fixed before getting released as per dispersion relation when wave frequencies ω are set to 2 5 3 0 and 3 5 rad s d 0 5 l w which indicates the deep water wave conditions 3 1 numerical study of dropped cylindrical objects under currents in present article direct validations for cylinder motions under waves nonuniform unsteady water flow cannot be obtained because no related model test data is available but to indirectly validate the effectiveness and accuracy of drobs we make systematic comparisons of the drobs predictions of cylinder motions under currents uniform steady water flow with laboratory drop tests of lyu et al 2014 fig 4 shows the comparisons of the drobs predicting trajectory with the laboratory experiments results table 3 compares the simulated coordinates of the cylinder with measured coordinates at time step 20 40 60 and 80 ms respectively a good agreement of the drobs predictions with experimental results indicates the capability of drobs in predicting motions of dropped cylindrical objects in water flow moreover by referring to the data from drobs predictions at t 80 ms in table 3 it s found that at the same slamming velocity higher current speed causes the dropped cylinder moving deeper in z direction and further in y direction in the same dropping durations objects entering water lead to very complicated phenomena which however are not the focus of the current study to avoid effects from water entry process in the following study the cylinder is assumed to be just completely immersed below the water surface with given initial velocities in the simulations at the beginning simulations of the cylinder lyu et al 2014 falling into water with depth at 5 m initial vertical speed z 0 0 in the direction of v s and horizontal speed y 0 0 in the direction of v c speed of current v c 0 00 0 05 and 0 10 m s and heading angle β at 90 are shown in fig 5 and with heading angle β at 0 are shown in fig 6 the effect of initial vertical speed z 0 and horizontal speed y 0 are studied in figs 7 and 8 fig 7 shows the simulated trajectories of cylinder with z 0 increasing from 0 m s to 2 m s the total duration of falling lasts 5 s at the end the displacement in y direction is found not affected by z 0 but the displacement in z direction is influenced by z 0 terminal conditions can be referred to table 4 fig 8 shows the simulated trajectories of cylinder with y 0 increasing from 0 m s to 0 1 m s the total duration of falling lasts 5 s as well at the end the displacement in z direction is found not affected by y 0 but the displacement in y direction is greatly influenced by y 0 terminal conditions can be referred to table 5 3 2 numerical study of dropped cylindrical objects under regular waves 3 2 1 effect of wave amplitude model 1 with cylinder to water mass density ratio λ 1 19 1 in aanesland 1987 and model 2 with λ 7 1 are used to study the wave effects initially model 1 model 2 is immersed still into the water with drop angle at 0 and fall till hitting the bottom at 5 m water depth fig 9 a depicts the comparisons of trajectories of model 1 under various waves with amplitude a increasing from 0 to 0 1 m fig 9b shows the variation of velocity components with time it s found that without wave effects zero wave amplitude the cylinder falls down following a straight line which is overlapped with z axis but under wave effects non zero wave amplitude the original straight line is disturbed and the trajectory turns into a curve with regular vibrations around z axis if we examine the motions carefully it can be seen that both the second order motions the slowly varying components and first order motions the quickly varying components exist but the first order motions tend to disappear with the cylinder going deep also with wave amplitude increasing the second order motions are very similar but the first order motion becomes larger and the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis increases and the horizontal excursion on the bottom also get affected as shown in table 6 fig 10 a depicts the comparisons of trajectories of model 2 under various regular waves with amplitude increasing from 0 to 0 1 m the variation of velocity components u 1 u 3 ω 2 with time are recorded in fig 10b it s found that under wave effects non zero wave amplitude the trajectory of the dropped cylinder is disturbed and turns into a curve with only second order motions the slowly varying motions with wave amplitude increasing the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis and the horizontal excursion on the bottom also increase as recorded by table 7 by comparing fig 9a with 10a it s further found that during falling model 1 and model 2 are both greatly affected because of the change of wave amplitude 3 2 2 effect of wave frequency fig 11 a depicts the comparisons of trajectories of model 1 under various regular waves with frequency ω increasing from 2 5 rad s to 3 5 rad s fig 11b displays the variation of velocity components u 1 u 3 ω 2 with time during falling it s found that with wave frequency increasing the trajectory of the dropped cylinder moves further away from the z axis resulting in increasing the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis and the excursion of landing point on the bottom as shown in table 8 fig 12 a depicts the comparisons of trajectories of model 2 under various regular waves with frequency increasing from 2 5 rad s to 3 5 rad s it s found that with wave frequency increasing the trajectory associated with the landing point maximum horizontal offset of the dropped cylinder don t get significantly affected as shown by table 9 the variation of velocity components with time are recorded in fig 12b also with the cylinder going deep the trajectories start to become overlapped by the comparison of fig 11a with 12a it s further found that during falling the cylinder with larger mass density becomes less sensitive to the change of wave frequency 4 conclusions in this paper the influence of water flow environments e g currents and waves on the dropped cylindrical objects after water entry has been studied a modified three dimensional 3d theory to describe the motions of dropped cylindrical objects underwater is proposed based on previous work xiang et al 2017a and 2017b the water flow effects have been numerically simulated and investigated in the in house tool drobs by considering currents as uniform steady flow and waves as non uniform unsteady flow firstly the simulated trajectories of the cylinder under currents are compared with observed trajectory in the experiments in order to further validate the accuracy and efficiency of drobs a good agreement can be found between numerical results and experimental data in addition multiple simulations of cylinder dropped into currents show that the trajectory and motions of the dropped cylindrical objects are sensitive to the change of current speed heading and the cylinder s initial speed finally drobs is used to study the wave effects on the dropped cylinders with different mass density it s found that for the considered wave frequency range and wave amplitude range the waves significantly affect the trajectory and motions of dropped cylindrical objects with the cylinder s mass density increasing motion parameters for the dropped cylinder including its trajectory maximum offset together with its excursion on the bottom keep sensitive to the change of wave amplitude however these motion parameters start to lose the sensitivity to the change of wave frequency under deep water conditions for model 1 with λ 1 19 1 under wave effect non zero wave amplitude its trajectory tends to turn into regular vibrations around z axis with both the second order motions the slowly varying components and first order motions the quickly varying components but with the cylinder going deep the first order motions tend to disappear also with wave amplitude increasing the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis increases and the horizontal excursion on the bottom also get affected with wave frequency increasing the trajectory of the dropped cylinder moves further away from the z axis resulting in increasing the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis and the excursion of landing point on the bottom for a larger mass density model 2 with λ 7 1 under wave effect non zero wave amplitude the trajectory turns into regular vibrations around z axis with only second order motions with wave amplitude increasing the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis and the horizontal excursion on the bottom both increase with wave frequency increasing the trajectory and the excursion of landing point on the bottom don t get significantly affected it is noted that in the future there will be further work on drop tests under waves to compare the numerical results to experiments for direct validations also other factors which may influence the dropped cylinder into water such as the initial drop angle wave heading angle etc are to be investigated acknowledgement this work was financed by the open research funding by state key lab of ocean engineering shanghai jiao tong university shanghai china grant no

23014,the investigation on the phenomena of objects falling into water is of great significance to protect the underwater equipment in offshore industry the dropped objects into water are found to be affected by many factors such as drop angle drop height its physical properties etc this study mainly focuses on considering the influence of water environment currents and waves on the dropped cylindrical objects after water entry by modifying the three dimensional 3d theory xiang et al 2017 and integrating the effects of currents and waves into drobs current is added as a uniform steady flow the waves will bring a non uniform unsteady flow field based on 3d airy wave theory thus analytic expressions for the hydrodynamic forces and moments are modified by adding inertial terms from waves the drag forces are revised by rewriting the relative cylinder to water particle velocities by the comparison between the simulated trajectory of the cylinder under currents and corresponding recorded trajectory in the experiments the simulations agree well with the experimental data the effects of speed and heading of the currents associated with the cylinder s initial speed are studied in drobs and found to influence the trajectory and motions of the dropped cylindrical objects also the dynamics of a dropped cylinder moving in the field of a progressive regular wave is investigated

are one of those which may incur safety issues during offshore engineering operations objects accidentally dropped into water may bring risks of damaging underwater facilities including those either floating in the water or resting on the seabed therefore for the purpose of protection the study on the trajectory of objects falling into the water and their landing points are of great interest and necessity many researchers have been studying the topic about a cylinder freely falling into calm water since long aanesland 1987 experimentally and numerically investigated falling drilling pipes into calm water two model tests were presented the first test was performed in order to investigate the entire history of events from a drop at the platform deck until the object lands on the seabed the second drop test was intended to verify a computer program which was developed to calculate the motion velocity and acceleration of falling drilling pipes and to predict the impact load a number of different trajectories were observed in the tests and are as illustrated in fig 1 aanesland 1987 his program solves a set of two dimensional 2d maneuvering equations which describe the motions of drilling pipes in which the trailing edge effect for a long slender body has been considered and further corrected for viscous effects newman 1977 kim et al 2002 focused on the study of characteristic motions of 3d bodies freely falling through calm water the time domain six degree of freedom motions of general 3d bodies dropping in water has been solved by a direct numerical scheme in addition the viscous effect on the cylindrical bodies have been considered by estimating the drag coefficients of the bodies for various body aspect ratios end shapes and orientations to incoming flow from laboratory experiments a comparison between numerical results and experimental tests showed that the simulated motion pattern depends significantly on initial drop angle body aspect ratio and mass center xiang et al 2017a 2017b proposed a new three dimensional 3d theory to consider the effect of axial rotation on dropped cylindrical objects into calm water by modifying the maneuvering equations for a slender rigid body a numerical tool called dropped objects simulator drobs has been successfully developed based on this 3d theory then drobs is used to investigate various factors that may affect the trajectories including drop angle normal drag coefficient binormal drag coefficient rolling frequency longitudinal center of gravity lcg xiang et al 2016 used drobs to study the landing point distribution of the dropped cylinder and finally obtained the risk free zone for offshore operations however dropped objects in complicated water flow environment with currents and waves instead of calm water are more common and realistic luo and davis 1992 simulated the 2d motion of falling objects by solving the differential equations of motion illustrative parametric studies are carried out in a computer program called delta it was found that the horizontal excursion at the seabed level is greatly affected by the drop angle in addition the maximum horizontal velocity of the object is dependent on both the drop height and angle as to the environmental conditions it is observed that the wave has limited overall effect on both horizontal excursion and the maximum velocity though the wave phase could affect the excursion the currents have significant effect on the horizontal excursion since its effect is uniform with depth and increases with the time the body takes to drop through the water column friedman et al 2003 present some preliminary results of a similar problem where a symmetric body of revolution is falling in regular waves the wave velocity field is treated as an unsteady non uniform current the dynamics of a 3d slender body falling in a weakly non uniform unsteady current is investigated analytic expressions for the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on a body moving in a non uniform current are presented numerical simulations of the nonlinear equations of motion of the body are performed also the kinematic parameters of motion and trajectories are also calculated lyu et al 2014 reports an experimental investigation on the motion of a circular cylinder after it horizontally enters into a water flow with a certain slamming speed a smart cylinder releasing mechanism is designed to enable repeatable release of the cylinder a high speed camera is used to record the cylinder s motion the effects of three factors are investigated including the cylinder to water density ratio current speed and slamming speed of the cylinder data for several cases with either a solid cylinder or a hollow cylinder are obtained and compared variations of both horizontal and vertical displacements against these factors are presented and analyzed this paper mainly focuses on numerically studying the influence of water flow environments currents and waves on the dropped cylindrical objects after water entry by modifying the three dimensional 3d theory xiang et al 2017b the effects of currents and waves are integrated into drobs by considering current as a uniform steady flow and the waves as non uniform unsteady flow based on the 3d airy wave theory analytic expressions for the hydrodynamic forces and moments are modified by adding inertial terms from waves viscosity terms are considered by rewriting the relative cylinder to water particle velocity by the comparison between the simulated trajectory of the cylinder under currents and corresponding observed trajectory in the experiments the simulations agree well with the experimental data also the dynamics of a dropped cylinder moving in the field of a progressive regular wave is investigated for different wave amplitudes wave frequencies and for different ratios of cylinder to water mass density multiple simulations of dropped cylinders in the flow by drobs illustrate that the dropped cylinder is greatly affected by changing the speed and heading of the currents wave amplitude and frequency associated with the cylinder s initial speed 2 a 3d theory for dropped objects into water flow in fig 1 oxyz is the global coordinate system where x y represents the still water surface and z axis points vertical upwards the other coordinate system oxyz is a local coordinate system fixed on the cylinder where x axis is the cylinder axis in tangent direction y axis is in binormal direction and z axis is in normal direction its origin is located at the geometric center both oxyz and oxyz coordinate systems coincide when the cylinder is situated on the water surface horizontally at the beginning the definition for the directions of wave and current are shown in fig 2 the dropped cylinder here is assumed to be a slender rigid body based on xiang et al 2017b a modified 3d theory for describing the motions of slender dropped cylinders considering effects of currents and waves

model 1 model 2 is just completely immersed below the calm water surface and fixed before getting released as per dispersion relation when wave frequencies ω are set to 2 5 3 0 and 3 5 rad s d 0 5 l w which indicates the deep water wave conditions 3 1 numerical study of dropped cylindrical objects under currents in present article direct validations for cylinder motions under waves nonuniform unsteady water flow cannot be obtained because no related model test data is available but to indirectly validate the effectiveness and accuracy of drobs we make systematic comparisons of the drobs predictions of cylinder motions under currents uniform steady water flow with laboratory drop tests of lyu et al 2014 fig 4 shows the comparisons of the drobs predicting trajectory with the laboratory experiments results table 3 compares the simulated coordinates of the cylinder with measured coordinates at time step 20 40 60 and 80 ms respectively a good agreement of the drobs predictions with experimental results indicates the capability of drobs in predicting motions of dropped cylindrical objects in water flow moreover by referring to the data from drobs predictions at t 80 ms in table 3 it s found that at the same slamming velocity higher current speed causes the dropped cylinder moving deeper in z direction and further in y direction in the same dropping durations objects entering water lead to very complicated phenomena which however are not the focus of the current study to avoid effects from water entry process in the following study the cylinder is assumed to be just completely immersed below the water surface with given initial velocities in the simulations at the beginning simulations of the cylinder lyu et al 2014 falling into water with depth at 5 m initial

wave effects initially model 1 model 2 is immersed still into the water with drop angle at 0 and fall till hitting the bottom at 5 m water depth fig 9 a depicts the comparisons of trajectories of model 1 under various waves with amplitude a increasing from 0 to 0 1 m fig 9b shows the variation of velocity components with time it s found that without wave effects zero wave amplitude the cylinder falls down following a straight line which is overlapped with z axis but under wave effects non zero wave amplitude the original straight line is disturbed and the trajectory turns into a curve with regular vibrations around z axis if we examine the motions carefully it can be seen that both the second order motions the slowly varying components and first order motions the quickly varying components exist but the first order motions tend to disappear with the cylinder going deep also with wave amplitude increasing the second order motions are very similar but the first order motion becomes larger and the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis increases and the horizontal excursion on the bottom also get affected as shown in table 6 fig 10 a depicts the comparisons of trajectories of model 2 under various regular waves with amplitude increasing from 0 to 0 1 m the variation of velocity components u 1 u 3 ω 2 with time are recorded in fig 10b it s found that under wave effects non zero wave amplitude the trajectory of the dropped cylinder is disturbed and turns into a curve with only second order motions the slowly varying motions with wave amplitude increasing the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis and the horizontal excursion on the bottom also increase as recorded by table 7 by comparing fig 9a with 10a it s further found that during falling model 1 and model 2 are both greatly affected because of the change of wave amplitude 3 2 2 effect of wave frequency fig 11 a depicts the comparisons of trajectories of model 1 under various regular waves with frequency ω increasing from 2 5 rad s to 3 5 rad s fig 11b displays the variation of velocity components u 1 u 3 ω 2 with time during falling it s found that with wave frequency increasing the trajectory of the dropped cylinder moves further away from the z axis resulting in increasing the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis and the excursion of landing point on the bottom as shown in table 8 fig 12 a depicts the comparisons of trajectories of model 2 under various regular waves with frequency increasing from 2 5 rad s to 3 5 rad s it s found that with wave frequency increasing the trajectory associated with the landing point maximum horizontal offset of the dropped cylinder don t get significantly affected as shown by table 9 the variation of velocity components with time are recorded in fig 12b also with the cylinder going deep the trajectories start to become overlapped by the comparison of fig 11a with 12a it s further found that during falling the cylinder with larger mass density becomes less sensitive to the change of wave frequency 4 conclusions in this paper the influence of water flow environments e g currents and waves on the dropped cylindrical objects after water entry has been studied a modified three dimensional 3d theory to describe the motions of dropped cylindrical objects underwater is proposed based on previous work xiang et al 2017a and 2017b the water flow effects have been numerically simulated and investigated in the in house tool drobs by considering currents as uniform steady flow and waves as non uniform unsteady flow firstly the simulated trajectories of the cylinder under currents are compared with observed trajectory in the experiments in order to further validate the accuracy and efficiency of drobs a good agreement can be found between numerical results and experimental data in addition multiple simulations of cylinder dropped into currents show that the trajectory and motions of the dropped cylindrical objects are sensitive to the change of current speed heading and the cylinder s initial speed finally drobs is used to study the wave effects on the dropped cylinders with different mass density it s found that for the considered wave frequency range and wave amplitude range the waves significantly affect the trajectory and motions of dropped cylindrical objects with the cylinder s mass density increasing motion parameters for the dropped cylinder including its trajectory maximum offset together with its excursion on the bottom keep sensitive to the change of wave amplitude however these motion parameters start to lose the sensitivity to the change of wave frequency under deep water conditions for model 1 with λ 1 19 1 under wave effect non zero wave amplitude its trajectory tends to turn into regular vibrations around z axis with both the second order motions the slowly varying components and first order motions the quickly varying components but with the cylinder going deep the first order motions tend to disappear also with wave amplitude increasing the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis increases and the horizontal excursion on the bottom also get affected with wave frequency increasing the trajectory of the dropped cylinder moves further away from the z axis resulting in increasing the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis and the excursion of landing point on the bottom for a larger mass density model 2 with λ 7 1 under wave effect non zero wave amplitude the trajectory turns into regular vibrations around z axis with only second order motions with wave amplitude increasing the maximum offset of the vibrations to the z axis and the horizontal excursion on the bottom both increase with wave frequency increasing the trajectory and the excursion of landing point on the bottom don t get significantly affected it is noted that in the future there will be further work on drop tests under waves to compare the numerical results to experiments for direct validations also other factors which may influence the dropped cylinder into water such as the initial drop angle wave heading angle etc are to be investigated acknowledgement this work was financed by the open research funding by state key lab of ocean engineering shanghai jiao tong university shanghai china grant no
