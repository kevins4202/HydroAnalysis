14680,the expansion of algal bloom in surface waters is a global problem in the freshwater ecosystem differential reactivity of organic phosphorus po compounds from organic debris suspended particulate matter spm and sediment towards hydrolysis can dictate the extent of supply often limited inorganic p pi for algal growth thereby controlling the extent of bloom here we combined solution p 31 nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr sequential extraction enzymatic hydrolysis and 16s rrna measurements to characterize speciation and biogeochemical cycling of p in lake erhai china lower ratios of diester p monoester p in spm in january mean 0 09 and july 0 14 than that in april 0 29 reflected the higher degree of diester p remineralization in cold and warm months both h2o pi and po were significantly higher in spm mean 1580 mg kg 1 and 1618 mg kg 1 than those in sediment mean 8 mg kg 1 and 387 mg kg 1 in addition results from enzymatic hydrolysis experiments demonstrated that 61 po in spm and 58 in sediment in the h2o nahco3 and naoh extracts could be hydrolyzed these results suggested that h2o pi and po from spm were the primarily bioavailable p sources for algae changes of pi contents particularly h2o pi in algae and alkaline phosphatase activity apa during the observation periods were likely to be controlled by the strategies of p uptake and utilization of algae p remobilization remineralization from spm likely resulted from algae and bacteria e g pseudomonas collectively these results provide important insights that spm p could sustain the algal blooms even if the dissolved p was depleted in the water column graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic phosphorus 31p nmr sequential extraction enzymatic hydrolysis 16s rrna data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction algal blooms triggered by nutrient loading have been one of the lingering issues in the recovery of freshwater ecosystem health on the earth li et al 2015 reduction of external nutrient loading is the most common remedial measure to mitigate algal blooms however the duration frequency and magnitude of algal blooms appear to be elevated in many freshwater lakes such as lake erhai in china lake kasumigaura in japan and lake erie in north america shinohara et al 2012 huang et al 2020 wang et al 2021b hou et al 2022 ji et al 2022 one of the potential reasons for these results is attributed to the internal loading of phosphorus p joshi et al 2015 li et al 2017a b similar to sediment p released from dead algae and suspended particulate matter spm in the water column provide a significant feedback loop to replenish p for algal blooms shinohara et al 2012 li et al 2017a b feng et al 2018 despite their importance currently little is known regarding the p speciation of algae spm and sediment existing knowledge on inorganic p pi pools of spm depends heavily on sequential extraction tang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 sequential extraction method developed by hedley et al 1982 is the most commonly used for pi pools in sediment zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2021b in reality particulate organic p pop in the water column accounted for 47 87 of their corresponding total p tp yang et al 2021a in addition pi released from pop remineralization in the water column under enzymes can provide p source for algae giles et al 2015 li et al 2017b nevertheless pop in the water column is often classified as refractory species pan et al 2013 pu et al 2021 taken above mentioned into consideration p speciation and their remineralization e g li et al 2015 feng et al 2018 pan et al 2020 ni et al 2022 and bio availability of algae spm and sediment is turnover need more attention because those of characteristics determine the mechanisms of p regeneration zhu et al 2013 li et al 2015 2017b identifying the sources and cycling of dissolved p in the water column is complex due to i a low concentration of dissolved p in the water column compared to spm and sediment p ii active and variable transformations of pi and po iii co occurring biotic and abiotic reactions of p and iv variable strategies by micro organisms for p uptake and utilization as a function of the concentrations and compositions of po and pi jaisi and blake 2014 such characteristics not only hinder the identification of sources and cycling of p but also hamper the formulation of effective nutrient management measurements in aquatic ecosystem therefore complementary methods are required to identify the composition and bio availability of p compounds and p pools of algae spm and sediment for a better understanding of the biogeochemical and dynamic cycling of p solution 31p nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 31p nmr is a state of the art nondestructive technique for identifying p compounds in environmental samples tate and newman 1982 cade menun and preston 1996 shinohara et al 2012 read et al 2014 in addition enzymatic hydrolysis provides a better method for accessing bioavailable po due to its similar reactions associated with po remineralization in lake ecosystem quiquampoix and mousain 2005 monbet et al 2007 zhu et al 2013 ni et al 2022 major groups of compounds discriminated by nmr are orthophosphate monoesters monoester p orthophosphate diesters diester p pyrophosphate pyro p and orthophosphate ortho p bioavailable po pools in the h2o nahco3 and naoh extracts identified by enzymatic hydrolysis include monoester p diester p and phytate like p these compounds can originate from algae spm and sediment but their relative concentration vary thus may provide useful information for probing into p transformation and recycling lake erhai the second largest freshwater lake on yunnan guizhou plateau is one of the most concerned lakes in china and an important drinking water source for dali city yunnan province in recent years external p inputs have been effectively controlled whereas large scale algal blooms still occur annually ji et al 2017 chen et al 2021 concentrations of tp 0 05 mg l 1 in the water column are often five times greater than those of soluble reactive p srp 0 01 mg l 1 and dissolved po dop 0 01 mg l 1 ji et al 2017 yang et al 2021b under this condition we hypothesize that p released from spm is a critical p source for algae to test this hypothesis we carried out a set of systematic research in p speciation in algae spm and sediment the objectives of our research were to 1 characterize the p speciation of algae spm and sediment 2 compare the differences of bioavailable po among them 3 explore the potential mechanisms of p released from spm solution 31p nmr sequential extraction enzymatic hydrolysis and 16s rrna were collectively employed to achieve the objectives and test the hypothesis results obtained from this study contributed to a better understanding of the reasoning behind the repeated algal blooms in dissolved p depleted lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation and analysis of physicochemical properties of water water algae and sediment were collected at the same sites fig s1 in january april and july in 2021 the detailed description of study sites is available in supplementary materials 60 l lake water from surface water below 0 5 m surface water and bottom water above 0 5 m sediment was collected at each site using a niskin sampler respectively spm were collected for analyzing p speciation filtered by 60 l lake water with precombusted 450 c 4 h and preweighted gf f glass fiber filters gf f 0 7 μm whatman uk additional samples of lake water 5 l were collected at the same sites 1 5 l was used for algal abundance analysis with the addition of 3 5 ml of formaldehyde and another 0 5 l was used for physicochemical properties analysis and the remainder of 3 l was filtered through 0 22 μm filters for 16s rrna analysis algae below 0 5 m surface water was collected using a phytoplankton collector 200 mesh diameter 0 064 mm and stored in a clean polyethylene bottle samples of sediment were collected by using a gravity core sampler from all sites all samples were stored at 4 c and immediately transported to the laboratory for analysis each sediment core was sliced from the top of the core to obtain 0 2 cm section and was stored in two clean centrifuge tubes algae mass was carefully and repeatedly washed by using ultrapure water to remove associate contents except algae feng et al 2016a 2018 after preprocessing algae spm and sediment were frozen at 80 c first before freeze drying subsequently algae and sediment were ground and sieved through a 200 mesh the lyophilized spm and sieved samples were stored at 20 c until analysis dissolved oxygen do temperature t and ph of water column were measured by a multi parameter water quality monitor ysi 6600v2 co usa concentrations of tp of water samples were quantified by using a molybdenum blue method after digesting in potassium persulfate note the concentrations of srp in water samples filtered by gf f glass fiber filters during observation periods were lower than 10 μg l 1 murphy and riley 1962 alkaline phosphatase activity apa and algal abundance from water samples were measured by p nitrophenyl phosphate colorimetric method and optical microscopy counting respectively gage and gorham 1985 boon 1989 concentrations of spm in water samples were calculated by gravimetric method to further assess the hydrolyzability of po in different p pools of algae spm and sediment additional samples including algae spm and sediment were collected in november in 2022 the methods of samples collection were same to above mentioned 2 2 sample preparation and 31p nmr analysis solution 31p nmr was employed to analyze the composition of p compounds a sufficient amount sample algae 0 2 g spm 40 l lake water collected on four glass fiber filters and sediment 2 g was extracted using 40 ml of 0 25 m naoh and 0 05 m edta solution for 16 h cade menun and preston 1996 these samples were centrifuged 14 000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min after extraction the supernatant was filtered through a filter gf f triplicate samples approximately 2 ml each were collected for the measurement of tp and pi concentrations the method for analyzing tp concentrations with naoh edta extracts was the same as that of water samples pi concentrations extracted by naoh edta were measured by a molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 subsequently the filtrate was freeze dried 80 c for several days and then the lyophilized samples were stored at 20 c until 31p nmr analysis see details in supplementary materials 2 3 analysis of p pools and bioavailable po sequential extraction proposed by hedley et al 1982 has been gradually applied to analyze the sediment p pools zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2021b pu et al 2023 although the method was originally used to characterize soil p pools here sequential extraction was employed to analyze p pools of algae spm and sediment solid solution 1 60 hedley et al 1982 briefly a sufficient amount of sample algae 0 2 g spm 10 l lake water collected on a glass fiber filter and sediment 0 2 g was sequentially extracted by using ultrapure water 0 5 m nahco3 ph 8 50 0 1 m naoh and 1 m hcl for 16 h the samples were centrifuged at 4390 g for 15 min after extraction the supernatant was filtered by using filters gf f the filtrate was collected for analyzing pi contents murphy and riley 1962 contents of tp in algae 0 2 g spm 10 l lake water collected on a glass fiber filter and sediment 0 2 g were measured by using the combustion method aspila et al 1976 po of algae spm and sediment was calculated by the difference between tp and pi tang et al 2018 yang et al 2021a to further access the contents of bioavailable po in the different p pools of algae spm and sediment extracted by sequential extraction enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were performed following zhu et al 2013 report using three main enzymes table s1 alkaline phosphatase apase phosphodiesterase pdease and phytase choice of these enzymes were intended to characterize bioavailable po pools monoester p diester p and phytate like p respectively see details in supplementary materials 2 4 illumina miseq sequencing of 16s rrna genes the microbial community in the water column and sediment were investigated from phylum to genus level all samples were performed by high throughput sequencing analysis at sangon botech co ltd shanghai china that referred to a previous study yang et al 2021c briefly total genomic dna was extracted from 0 5 g sediment and spm filtered by filters see section 2 1 using the e z n a mag bind soil dna kit m5635 02 omega 16s rrna genes were amplified using primers 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and the reverse primers 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc targeting the v3 v4 variable regions 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed on the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa at sangon biotech co ltd the sequences 97 similarity were clustered into the same operational taxonomic units classification information of species from phylum to genus level was assigned according to the ribosomal database project classifier 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition difference of p compounds in different substances contents of naoh edta tp tp and extraction efficiency calculated as naoh edta tp tp of algae spm and sediment were shown in fig s2 in descending order of contents of naoh edta tp and tp the average p contents of three substances were spm algae sediment fig s2 the extraction efficiency of these substances ranged from 26 to 114 fig s2 such dramatic changes of the extraction efficiency likely resulted from the substantial differences of these substances moreover similar ranges of the extraction efficiency have been reported for example 20 to 102 in other freshwater ecosystems shinohara et al 2012 feng et al 2016b xie et al 2019 yang et al 2020 composition of p compounds in algae spm and sediment identified by applying solution 31p nmr included ortho p monoester p diester p and pyro p figs 1 and s3 4 multiple peaks of monoester p and diester p were observed in all samples fig 1 which was similar to previous findings from other freshwater ecosystems suggesting that multiple peaks of monoester p and diester p from algae spm and sediment were also observed shinohara et al 2012 li et al 2017b feng et al 2020 yang et al 2020 monoester p in all samples included α glycerophosphate β glycerophosphate and unknow monoester p figs 1 and s3 dna rna and phospholipids were dominant diester p compounds in whole samples figs 1 and s3 however polyphosphate poly p was not observed in overall samples not shown similar results for poly p peaks from algae spm and sediment were not observed by solution 31p nmr in other freshwater ecosystems li et al 2015 feng et al 2020 yang et al 2020 likely due to the low concentrations contents of poly p in all samples and the presence of degradation of poly p during the alkaline extraction lyophilization procedure and 31p nmr analysis cade menun et al 2006 wang et al 2021a moreover contents of p compounds and their corresponding percentages were further analysis results showed that contents and percentages of biogenic p of algae average 937 mg kg 1 and 64 and spm average 1351 mg kg 1 and 50 were significantly higher than those of sediment average 138 mg kg 1 and 35 figs 1 s4 and table s2 these results suggest that biogenic p of algae and spm could be released during or after sedimentation relative remineralization efficiency for diester p and monoester p can be expressed by diester p monoester p ratios a lower diester p monoester p ratio reflects the higher degree of diester p remineralization because monoester p is more chemically stable than diester p paytan et al 2003 ahlgren et al 2006 and diester p degradation generates monoester p accordingly lower ratios of diester p monoester p from spm in january mean 0 09 and july 0 14 than those in april 0 29 were observed showing the higher degree of diester p remineralization during these periods moreover the diester p monoester p ratios in algae mean 0 15 and spm mean 0 17 were markedly lower than those of sediment mean 0 55 table s2 which might reflect the substantial degradation and or reproduction during or after sedimentation the possible explanation for the low diester p monoester p ratios in algae and spm is that the presence of α glycerophosphate and β glycerophosphate likely resulted from degradation of phospholipids due to alkaline extraction and relative long 31p nmr analysis time generally 10 h turner et al 2003 doolette et al 2009 alternatively phospholipids could also be naturally hydrolyzed as α glycerophosphate and β glycerophosphate induced by sunlight and or phosphodiesterase turner et al 2003 li et al 2019 guo et al 2020 further work is urgently needed to differentiate natural degradation from artificial hydrolysis in future the reasonable interpretation for the higher diester p monoester p ratios in sediment is primarily attributed to increased dna of sediment fig 1 the presence of dna in spm and sediment might be the result of sedimentation because dna is relatively recalcitrant to hydrolyze relative to other po molecules e g rna westmeimer 1987 alternatively dna can be constantly produced in sediments li et al 2015 similar results have been reported in other lakes for sediment dna reproduction shinohara et al 2012 jin et al 2022 3 2 variation of p pools and bio availability of po pools 3 2 1 variation of p pools in algae suspended particulate matter and sediment contents of p pools and their corresponding percentages to tp in all samples were shown in figs 2 and s5 contents of pi pools especially h2o pi in algae were gradually decreased from january to july which might be attributed to p uptake and utilization strategies of algae see 3 3 however compared with the variation of contents of p pools in algae during the observation periods the contents of p pools in spm were irregular but relatively higher beside sites a and c in january fig 2a b and c here it is worth considering that the spm p contents are dominantly controlled by two linked but not overlapping variables srp concentration and the adsorption capacity of spm river and richardson 2018 ji et al 2022 walch et al 2022 variable spm p contents reflected their complex processes and or mechanisms of these two factors during the observation periods thus more direct evidences for the characterizing p adsorption mechanisms on spm and its composition are warranted sediment might be the result of spm sedimentation thus po remineralization and pi remobilization from spm could have occurred during or after sedimentation the collective contents and percentages of h2o pi nahco3 pi naoh pi and po in algae mean 1870 mg kg 1 and 98 and spm mean 4038 mg kg 1 and 86 were significantly higher than those of sediment mean 696 mg kg 1 and 65 figs 2 and s5 h2o pi and po from algae and spm were the mainly bioavailable p sources for algal blooms pi extracted by h2o is loosely adsorbed to spm or sediment particles which represents immediately available p contents of pi in algae spm and sediment extracted by h2o ranged from 38 to 1231 mg kg 1 average 610 mg kg 1 from 397 to 3312 mg kg 1 average 1580 mg kg 1 and from 1 to 16 mg kg 1 average 8 mg kg 1 accounting for 3 52 average 29 25 46 average 35 and 0 2 average 1 respectively figs 2 and s5 similar results also demonstrated that contents of immediately available p average 633 mg kg 1 19 of the tp of spm extracted by nh4cl were fundamentally higher than those of sediment average 10 mg kg 1 1 of the tp in lake chaohu china yang et al 2020 2022 these results suggested that immediately available p of spm was a dominant p source for algal blooms contents of po in algae 468 1241 mg kg 1 average 767 mg kg 1 and 44 of tp and spm 472 2879 mg kg 1 average 1618 mg kg 1 and 37 of tp were markedly higher than those of sediment 231 534 mg kg 1 average 387 mg kg 1 and 40 of tp these observations demonstrated that the most of po from algae and spm could be released during or after sedimentation and thus provided primarily bioavailable po for algae results from 31p nmr and sequential extraction provided relative comparison differences between 31p nmr and sequential extraction were often described in lake sediments by previous studies dong et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 ni et al 2019 campos et al 2022 the range of po tp percentages from algae spm and sediment measured by 31p nmr ranged from 32 to 80 mean 58 from 20 to 50 mean 36 and from 26 to 42 mean 33 respectively fig 1 in contrast the range of po tp percentages from algae spm and sediment extracted by sequential extraction varied from 24 to 74 mean 44 from 25 to 49 mean 37 and from 33 to 47 mean 40 respectively fig s5 understanding the differences of po overestimation or underestimation is not straightforward particularly because of і fundamental difference of extracts in the two methods ii presence degradation of poly p and diester p during the pretreatment of sample and 31p nmr analysis cade menun et al 2006 wang et al 2021a iii re adsorption of extracted p onto colloidal particles and or caco3 of the residue wang et al 2013 iv the occurrence of molybdate reaction between molybdate and ortho p only rather than other pi forms e g pyro p and poly p and thus underestimating the pi concentrations of the extracts murphy and riley 1962 cade menun et al 2006 in addition it is important to highlight that these two methods are not accurately quantified bioavailable po therefore enzymatic hydrolysis was employed to further character the compositions and contents of bioavailable po in different p pools of algae spm and sediment 3 2 2 bio availability of po pools before performed by enzymatic hydrolysis we analyzed the contents e g pi and po see supplementary materials of different p pools from algae spm and sediment extracted by h2o nahco3 naoh and hcl which was shown in figs s6 and s7 after enzymatic hydrolysis results demonstrated that monoester p and diester p were the main po species in different po pools of algae spm and sediment fig 3 which was consistent with the distribution of monoester p and diester p in these substances measured by solution 31p nmr fig 1 monoester p and diester p from algae and spm were important po sources for algal blooms enzymatically hydrolyzable contents of monoester p diester p and phytate like p from algae average 695 mg kg 1 and spm average 824 mg kg 1 were substantially higher than those of sediment average 56 mg kg 1 in the h2o nahco3 and naoh extracts accounting for 126 61 and 58 of their correspondingly total po of these extracts respectively figs 3 and s8 similar results for contents of enzymatically hydrolyzable monoester p and diester p from sediment were observed in the same research area which ranged from 20 to 58 mg kg 1 pu et al 2023 no hydrolysable po in the hcl extract of algae spm and sediment was observed during the enzymatic hydrolysis experiment not shown which is similar to a previous report showing no hydrolysable po in the same p pool of sediment zhu et al 2013 furthermore based on the enzymatic hydrolysis pi released from spm po remineralization in the lake could be reached to 7 2 t which can increase the concentrations of srp by 3 μg l 1 altogether the above results indicated that the majority of po from algae and spm could be hydrolysable during or after sedimentation causing p released from algae and spm to water column and further providing p source for algae 3 3 shift in strategies for p uptake by algae previous studies have demonstrated that dissolved pi and po could be rapidly accumulated in algae and slowly utilized during the subsequent growth and reproduction jauzein et al 2010 laws et al 2011 ren et al 2017 furthermore apa was regulated by pi stress ren et al 2017 however these results were obtained in simulated system that performed in the laboratory our results from field investigations not only identify previous lab findings but also gain some new insights as was shown that i the higher degree of spm diester p remineralization in january and july than those in april was observed see 3 1 ii apa in water column in january and july was approximately 16 and 45 times than those in april respectively which reflected the higher degree of monoester p remineralization in january and july than those in april fig s9 iii contents of h2o pi and pyro p of algae in january were 22 times greater than that of algae in april and july figs 1 and 2 and fig s4 in addition algal abundance were gradually increased during the observation periods fig s10 these results reflected the shift strategies for p uptake and utilization by algae in different p quota of algal cell taken together dissolved pi from po remineralization in the water column could be directly stored in algae in the form of ortho p and pyro p in january algae heavily depended on its stored pi for growth and reproduction in april p supply for algal blooms in july can be heavily dependent on spm po remineralization however these samples were collected at long time intervals as a result which might be lost some important information associated with the strategies of p uptake and utilization of algae therefore increasing sample times are required to further clarify the strategies for p uptake and utilization by algae during the its growth and reproduction in ongoing work the hydrodynamics driven changes in spm mineralogy led to increasing p sorption as was shown by the higher contents of pi particularly h2o pi in spm than those in algae especially in july fig 2a b the underlying reason for the higher p contents of spm is that srp can bind preferentially with particulate surface beside biological uptake and assimilation yang et al 2021a therefore increasing the competition between algae and sorption sites of inorganic spm for dissolved pi in the water column during the algal blooms e g july might also lead algae to increasingly depend on pop remineralization to meet its p needs olander and vitousek 2005 helfenstein et al 2018 this was also expressed by the enhancing apa in the water column with the increasing algal abundance figs s9 and s10 to further reveal the p uptake and utilization strategies of algae future work is required to quantify the adsorption of dissolved pi on spm in the water column and its effect on algal growth and reproduction 3 4 microbially driven p release from suspended particulate matter bacteria also play an essential role in p release except for algae strong correlations among p pools and p compounds from spm to sediment and different bacterial communities at genus level in their corresponding mediums were observed suggesting that spm and sediment might enrich some specific taxa fig 4 a b we selected 10 genera in the water column and 10 genera in sediment as core genera due to their high relative abundances and significant positive or negative correlations with their corresponding p pools and p compounds fig 5 a b fortunately those of the selected core genera have members with reported capabilities in p solubilization mineralization e g pseudomonas in the water column thiobacillus in sediment which can transform po or insoluble pi into dissolved pi menkina 1950 paul and sundara rao 1971 illmer and schhinner 1992 jorquera et al 2008 in order to provide more information for p cycling we further analyzed the relative abundance of phosphorus solubilization mineralization bacteria including inorganic phosphorus solubilization bacteria ipb organic phosphorus mineralization bacteria opb at genus level in the water column and sediment these results indicate that relative abundance of both ipb mean 16 60 and opb mean 27 85 in the water column were greater than those of in sediment mean 0 84 for ipb and 2 29 for opb fig s11 which highlighted that these key bacteria genera were responsible for p released from spm during the sedimentation moreover iron cycling driven by redox transformations or microorganisms can also influence p release from p associated with iron hydr oxides fig s12 increasing studies have shown that the competition between some bacteria e g fe iii reducing bacteria ferb fe ii oxidizing bacteria feob and redox transformations for fe ii oxidation or fe iii reduction may increase crowe et al 2007 melton et al 2014 upreti et al 2019 fan et al 2021 chen et al 2022 in addition latest studies demonstrated that some bacteria e g sulfate reducing bacteria srb sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob with the capability of sulfate reduction or sulfide oxidization could affect the fe speciation by mediating the s speciation baldwin et al 2000 arning et al 2009 yu et al 2015 chen et al 2016 fan et al 2018 berg et al 2019 li et al 2022 therefore the relative abundance of ferb feob srb and sob was further analysis results demonstrated that the relative abundance of ferb mean 16 27 and srb mean 5 88 in the water column and ferb mean 2 04 and srb 1 59 in sediment were obviously higher than their corresponding relative abundance of feob mean 1 1 and sob mean 0 4 in the water column and feob 0 8 and sob 0 9 in sediment fig s13 respectively suggesting that ferb and srb contributed greatly to p remobilization from spm during sedimentation alternatively the pathway of p released from spm driven by abiotic reaction such as t ph do fig s14 might be nonnegligible pan et al 2013 further work is required to quantify the relative contribution of above listed factors for p release from spm 4 conclusions the integrated information from complementary technologies enabled us to summarize that p released from spm during or after sedimentation provided a major p source for algal blooms under dissolved p depleted water column p compounds from algae spm and sediment were identified including ortho p monoester p diester p and pyro p relative lower diester p monoester p ratios of spm in surface water in january and july than those of in april reflected the higher degree of diester p remineralization in the water column during these periods the h2o pi and po monoester p and diester p from spm were the primarily bioavailable p pools for algae the strategies of p uptake and utilization of algae were further identified in the field investigation dissolved pi in the water column could be stored in algae in the form of ortho p and pyro p in january algae heavily relied on its stored pi for growth and reproduction in april spm po remineralization provided the primary p source for algal blooms in july algae and bacteria e g pseudomonas were responsible for spm p remineralization and or remobilization overall our findings provide new insights into the understanding of algal blooms with dissolved p depleted water bodies which are valuable for understanding p

2022 ji et al 2022 one of the potential reasons for these results is attributed to the internal loading of phosphorus p joshi et al 2015 li et al 2017a b similar to sediment p released from dead algae and suspended particulate matter spm in the water column provide a significant feedback loop to replenish p for algal blooms shinohara et al 2012 li et al 2017a b feng et al 2018 despite their importance currently little is known regarding the p speciation of algae spm and sediment existing knowledge on inorganic p pi pools of spm depends heavily on sequential extraction tang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 sequential extraction method developed by hedley et al 1982 is the most commonly used for pi pools in sediment zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2021b in reality particulate organic p pop in the water column accounted for 47 87 of their corresponding total p tp yang et al 2021a in addition pi released from pop remineralization in the water column under enzymes can provide p source for algae giles et al 2015 li et al 2017b nevertheless pop in the water column is often classified as refractory species pan et al 2013 pu et al 2021 taken above mentioned into consideration p speciation and their remineralization e g li et al 2015 feng et al 2018 pan et al 2020 ni et al 2022 and bio availability of algae spm and sediment is turnover need more attention because those of characteristics determine the mechanisms of p regeneration zhu et al 2013 li et al 2015 2017b identifying the sources and cycling of dissolved p in the water column is complex due to i a low concentration of dissolved p in the water column compared to spm and sediment p ii active and variable transformations of pi and po iii co occurring biotic and abiotic reactions of p and iv variable strategies by micro organisms for p uptake and utilization as a function of the concentrations and compositions of po and pi jaisi and blake 2014 such characteristics not only hinder the identification of sources and cycling of p but also hamper the formulation of effective nutrient management measurements in aquatic ecosystem therefore complementary methods are required to identify the composition and bio availability of p compounds and p pools of algae spm and sediment for a better understanding of the biogeochemical and dynamic cycling of p solution 31p nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 31p nmr is a state of the art nondestructive technique for identifying p compounds in environmental samples tate and newman 1982 cade menun and preston 1996 shinohara et al 2012 read et al 2014 in addition enzymatic hydrolysis provides a better method for accessing bioavailable po due to its similar reactions associated with po remineralization in lake ecosystem quiquampoix and mousain 2005 monbet et al 2007 zhu et al 2013 ni et al 2022 major groups of compounds discriminated by nmr are orthophosphate monoesters monoester p orthophosphate diesters diester p pyrophosphate pyro p and orthophosphate ortho p bioavailable po pools in the h2o nahco3 and naoh extracts identified by enzymatic hydrolysis include monoester p diester p and phytate like p these compounds can originate from algae spm and sediment but their relative concentration vary thus may provide useful information for probing into p transformation and recycling lake erhai the second largest freshwater lake on yunnan guizhou plateau is one of the most concerned lakes in china and an important drinking water source for dali city yunnan province in recent years external p inputs have been effectively controlled whereas large scale algal blooms still occur annually ji et al 2017 chen et al 2021 concentrations of tp 0 05 mg l 1 in the water column are often five times greater than those of soluble reactive p srp 0 01 mg l 1 and dissolved po dop 0 01 mg l 1 ji et al 2017 yang et al 2021b under this condition we hypothesize that p released from spm is a critical p source for algae to test this hypothesis we carried out a set of systematic research in p speciation in algae spm and sediment the objectives of our research were to 1 characterize the p speciation of algae spm and sediment 2 compare the differences of bioavailable po among them 3 explore the potential mechanisms of p released from spm solution 31p nmr sequential extraction enzymatic hydrolysis and 16s rrna were collectively employed to achieve the objectives and test the hypothesis results obtained from this study contributed to a better understanding of the reasoning behind the repeated algal blooms in dissolved p depleted lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation and analysis of physicochemical properties of water water algae and sediment were collected at the same sites fig s1 in january april and july in 2021 the detailed description of study sites is available in supplementary materials 60 l lake water from surface water below 0 5 m surface water and bottom water above 0 5 m sediment was collected at each site using a niskin sampler respectively spm were collected for analyzing p speciation filtered by 60 l lake water with precombusted 450 c 4 h and preweighted gf f glass fiber filters gf f 0 7 μm whatman uk additional samples of lake water 5 l were collected at the same sites 1 5 l was used for algal abundance analysis with the addition of 3 5 ml of formaldehyde and another 0 5 l was used for physicochemical properties analysis and the remainder of 3 l was filtered through 0 22 μm filters for 16s rrna analysis algae below 0 5 m surface water was collected using a phytoplankton collector 200 mesh diameter 0 064 mm and stored in a clean polyethylene bottle samples of sediment were collected by using a gravity core sampler from all sites all samples were stored at 4 c and immediately transported to the laboratory for analysis each sediment core was sliced from the top of the core to obtain 0 2 cm section and was stored in two clean centrifuge tubes algae mass was carefully and repeatedly washed by using ultrapure water to remove associate contents except algae feng et al 2016a 2018 after preprocessing algae spm and sediment were frozen at 80 c first before freeze drying subsequently algae and sediment were ground and sieved through a 200 mesh the lyophilized spm and sieved samples were stored at 20 c until analysis dissolved oxygen do temperature t and ph of water column were measured by a multi parameter water quality monitor ysi 6600v2 co usa concentrations of tp of water samples were quantified by using a molybdenum blue method after digesting in potassium persulfate note the concentrations of srp in water samples filtered by gf f glass fiber filters during observation periods were lower than 10 μg l 1 murphy and riley 1962 alkaline phosphatase activity apa and algal abundance from water samples were measured by p nitrophenyl phosphate colorimetric method and optical microscopy counting respectively gage and gorham 1985 boon 1989 concentrations of spm in water samples were calculated by gravimetric method to further assess the hydrolyzability of po in different p pools of algae spm and sediment additional samples including algae spm and sediment were collected in november in 2022 the methods of samples collection were same to above mentioned 2 2 sample preparation and 31p nmr analysis solution 31p nmr was employed to analyze the composition of p compounds a sufficient amount sample algae 0 2 g spm 40 l lake water collected on four glass fiber filters and sediment 2 g was extracted using 40 ml of 0 25 m naoh and 0 05 m edta solution for 16 h cade menun and preston 1996 these samples were centrifuged 14 000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min after extraction the supernatant was filtered through a filter gf f triplicate samples approximately 2 ml each were collected for the measurement of tp and pi concentrations the method for analyzing tp concentrations with naoh edta extracts was the same as that of water samples pi concentrations extracted by naoh edta were measured by a molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 subsequently the filtrate was freeze dried 80 c for several days and then the lyophilized samples were stored at 20 c until 31p nmr analysis see details in supplementary materials 2 3 analysis of p pools and bioavailable po sequential extraction proposed by hedley et al 1982 has been gradually applied to analyze the sediment p pools zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2021b pu et al 2023 although the method was originally used to characterize soil p pools here sequential extraction was employed to analyze p pools of algae spm and sediment solid solution 1 60 hedley et al 1982 briefly a sufficient amount of sample algae 0 2 g spm 10 l lake water collected on a glass fiber filter and sediment 0 2 g was sequentially extracted by using ultrapure water 0 5 m nahco3 ph 8 50 0 1 m naoh and 1 m hcl for 16 h the samples were centrifuged at 4390 g for 15 min after extraction the supernatant was filtered by using filters gf f the filtrate was collected for analyzing pi contents murphy and riley 1962 contents of tp in algae 0 2 g spm 10 l lake water collected on a glass fiber filter and sediment 0 2 g were measured by using the combustion method aspila et al 1976 po of algae spm and sediment was calculated by the difference between tp and pi tang et al 2018 yang et al 2021a to further access the contents of bioavailable po in the different p pools of algae spm and sediment extracted by sequential extraction enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were performed following zhu et al 2013 report using three main enzymes table s1 alkaline phosphatase apase phosphodiesterase pdease and phytase choice of these enzymes were intended to characterize bioavailable po pools monoester p diester p and phytate like p respectively see details in supplementary materials 2 4 illumina miseq sequencing of 16s rrna genes the microbial community in the water column and sediment were investigated from phylum to genus level all samples were performed by high throughput sequencing analysis at sangon botech co ltd shanghai china that referred to a previous study yang et al 2021c briefly total genomic dna was extracted from 0 5 g sediment and spm filtered by filters see section 2 1 using the e z n a mag bind soil dna kit m5635 02 omega 16s rrna genes were amplified using primers 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and the reverse primers 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc targeting the v3 v4 variable regions 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed on the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa at sangon biotech co ltd the sequences 97 similarity were clustered into the same operational taxonomic units classification information of species from phylum to genus level was assigned according to the ribosomal database project classifier 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition difference of p compounds in different substances contents of naoh edta tp tp and extraction efficiency calculated as naoh edta tp tp of algae spm and sediment were shown in fig s2 in descending order of contents of naoh edta tp and tp the average p contents of three substances were spm algae sediment fig s2 the extraction efficiency of these substances ranged from 26 to 114 fig s2 such dramatic changes of the extraction efficiency likely resulted from the substantial differences of these substances moreover similar ranges of the extraction efficiency have been reported for example 20 to 102 in other freshwater ecosystems shinohara et al 2012 feng et al 2016b xie et al 2019 yang et al 2020 composition of p compounds in algae spm and sediment identified by applying solution 31p nmr included ortho p monoester p diester p and pyro p figs 1 and s3 4 multiple peaks of monoester p and diester p were observed in all samples fig 1 which was similar to previous findings from other freshwater ecosystems suggesting that multiple peaks of monoester p and diester p from algae spm and sediment were also observed shinohara et al 2012 li et al 2017b feng et al 2020 yang et al 2020 monoester p in all samples included α glycerophosphate β glycerophosphate and unknow monoester p figs 1 and s3 dna rna and phospholipids were dominant diester p compounds in whole samples figs 1 and s3 however polyphosphate poly p was not observed in overall samples not shown similar results for poly p peaks from algae spm and sediment were not observed by solution 31p nmr in other freshwater ecosystems li et al 2015 feng et al 2020 yang et al 2020 likely due to the low concentrations contents of poly p in all samples and the presence of degradation of poly p during the alkaline extraction lyophilization procedure and 31p nmr analysis cade menun et al 2006 wang et al 2021a moreover contents of p compounds and their corresponding percentages were further analysis results showed that contents and percentages of biogenic p of algae average 937 mg kg 1 and 64 and spm average 1351 mg kg 1 and 50 were significantly higher than those of sediment average 138 mg kg 1 and 35 figs 1 s4 and table s2 these results suggest that biogenic p of algae and spm could be released during or after sedimentation relative remineralization efficiency for diester p and monoester p can be expressed by diester p monoester p ratios a lower diester p monoester p ratio reflects the higher degree of diester p remineralization because monoester p is more chemically stable than diester p paytan et al 2003 ahlgren et al 2006 and diester p degradation generates monoester p accordingly lower ratios of diester p monoester p from spm in january mean 0 09 and july 0 14 than those in april 0 29 were observed showing the higher degree of diester p remineralization during these periods moreover the diester p monoester p ratios in algae mean 0 15 and spm mean 0 17 were markedly lower than those of sediment mean 0 55 table s2 which might reflect the substantial degradation and or reproduction during or after sedimentation the possible explanation for the low diester p monoester p ratios in algae and spm is that the presence of α glycerophosphate and β glycerophosphate likely resulted from degradation of phospholipids due to alkaline extraction and relative long 31p nmr analysis time generally 10 h turner et al 2003 doolette et al 2009 alternatively phospholipids could also be naturally hydrolyzed as α glycerophosphate and β glycerophosphate induced by sunlight and or phosphodiesterase turner et al 2003 li et al 2019 guo et al 2020 further work is urgently needed to differentiate natural degradation from artificial hydrolysis in future the reasonable interpretation for the higher diester p monoester p ratios in sediment is primarily attributed to increased dna of sediment fig 1 the presence of dna in spm and sediment might be the result of sedimentation because dna is relatively recalcitrant to hydrolyze relative to other po molecules e g rna westmeimer 1987 alternatively dna can be constantly produced in sediments li et al 2015 similar results have been reported in other lakes for sediment dna reproduction shinohara et al 2012 jin et al 2022 3 2 variation of p pools and bio availability of po pools 3 2 1 variation of p pools in algae suspended particulate matter and sediment contents of p pools and their corresponding percentages to tp in all samples were shown in figs 2 and s5 contents of pi pools especially h2o pi in algae were gradually decreased from january to july which might be attributed to p uptake and utilization strategies of algae see 3 3 however compared with the variation of contents of p pools in algae during the observation periods the contents of p pools in spm were irregular but relatively higher beside sites a and c in january fig 2a b and c here it is worth considering that the spm p contents are dominantly controlled by two linked but not overlapping variables srp concentration and the adsorption capacity of spm river and richardson 2018 ji et al 2022 walch et al 2022 variable spm p contents reflected their complex processes and or mechanisms of these two factors during the observation periods thus more direct evidences for the characterizing p adsorption mechanisms on spm and its composition are warranted sediment might be the result of spm sedimentation thus po remineralization and pi remobilization from spm could have occurred during or after sedimentation the collective contents and percentages of h2o pi nahco3 pi naoh pi and po in algae mean 1870 mg kg 1 and 98 and spm mean 4038 mg kg 1 and 86 were significantly higher than those of sediment mean 696 mg kg 1 and 65 figs 2 and s5 h2o pi and po from algae and spm were the mainly bioavailable p sources for algal blooms pi extracted by h2o is loosely adsorbed to spm or sediment particles which represents immediately available p contents of pi in algae spm and sediment extracted by h2o ranged from 38 to 1231 mg kg 1 average 610 mg kg 1 from 397 to 3312 mg kg 1 average 1580 mg kg 1 and from 1 to 16 mg kg 1 average 8 mg kg 1 accounting for 3 52 average 29 25 46 average 35 and 0 2 average 1 respectively figs 2 and s5 similar results also demonstrated that contents of immediately available p average 633 mg kg 1 19 of the tp of spm extracted by nh4cl were fundamentally higher than those of sediment average 10 mg kg 1 1 of the tp in lake chaohu china yang et al 2020 2022 these results suggested that immediately available p of spm was a dominant p source for algal blooms contents of po in algae 468 1241 mg kg 1 average 767 mg kg 1 and 44 of tp and spm 472 2879 mg kg 1 average 1618 mg kg 1 and 37 of tp were markedly higher than those of sediment 231 534 mg kg 1 average 387 mg kg 1 and 40 of tp these observations demonstrated that the most of po from algae and spm could be released during or after sedimentation and thus provided primarily bioavailable po for algae results from 31p nmr and sequential extraction provided relative comparison differences between 31p nmr and sequential extraction were often described in lake sediments by previous studies dong et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 ni et al 2019 campos et al 2022 the range of po tp percentages from algae spm and sediment measured by 31p nmr ranged from 32 to 80 mean 58 from 20 to 50 mean 36 and from 26 to 42 mean 33 respectively fig 1 in contrast the range of po tp percentages from algae spm and sediment extracted by sequential extraction varied from 24 to 74 mean 44 from 25 to 49 mean 37 and from 33 to 47 mean 40 respectively fig s5 understanding the differences of po overestimation or underestimation is not straightforward particularly because of і fundamental difference of extracts in the two methods ii presence degradation of poly p and diester p during the pretreatment of sample and 31p nmr analysis cade menun et al 2006 wang et al 2021a iii re adsorption of extracted p onto colloidal particles and or caco3 of the residue wang et al 2013 iv the occurrence of molybdate reaction between molybdate and ortho p only rather than other pi forms e g pyro p and poly p and thus underestimating the pi concentrations of the extracts murphy and riley 1962 cade menun et al 2006 in addition it is important to highlight that these two methods are not accurately quantified bioavailable po therefore enzymatic hydrolysis was employed to further character the compositions and contents of bioavailable po in different p pools of algae spm and sediment 3 2 2 bio availability of po pools before performed by enzymatic hydrolysis we analyzed the contents e g pi and po see supplementary materials of different p pools from algae spm and sediment extracted by h2o nahco3 naoh and hcl which was shown in figs s6 and s7 after enzymatic hydrolysis results demonstrated that monoester p and diester p were the main po species in different po pools of algae spm and sediment fig 3 which was consistent with the distribution of monoester p and diester p in these substances measured by solution 31p nmr fig 1 monoester p and diester p from algae and spm were important po sources for algal blooms enzymatically hydrolyzable contents of monoester p diester p and phytate like p from algae average 695 mg kg 1 and spm average 824 mg kg 1 were substantially higher than those of sediment average 56 mg kg 1 in the h2o nahco3 and naoh extracts accounting for 126 61 and 58 of their correspondingly total po of these extracts respectively figs 3 and s8 similar results for contents of enzymatically hydrolyzable monoester p and diester p from sediment were observed in the same research area which ranged from 20 to 58 mg kg 1 pu et al 2023 no hydrolysable po in the hcl extract of algae spm and sediment was observed during the enzymatic hydrolysis experiment not shown which is similar to a previous report showing no hydrolysable po in the same p pool of sediment zhu et al 2013 furthermore based on the enzymatic hydrolysis pi released from spm po remineralization in the lake could be reached to 7 2 t which can increase the concentrations of srp by 3 μg l 1 altogether the above results indicated that the majority of po from algae and spm could be hydrolysable during or after sedimentation causing p released from algae and spm to water column and further providing p source for algae 3 3 shift in strategies for p uptake by algae previous studies have demonstrated that dissolved pi and po could be rapidly accumulated in algae and slowly utilized during the subsequent growth and reproduction jauzein et al 2010 laws et al 2011 ren et al 2017 furthermore apa was regulated by pi stress ren et al 2017 however these results were obtained in simulated system that performed in the laboratory our results from field investigations not only identify previous lab findings but also gain some new insights as was shown that i the higher degree of spm diester p remineralization in january and july than those in april was observed see 3 1 ii apa in water column in january and july was approximately 16 and 45 times than those in april respectively which reflected the higher degree of monoester p remineralization in january and july than those in april fig s9 iii contents of h2o pi and pyro p of algae in january were 22 times greater than that of algae in april and july figs 1 and 2 and fig s4 in addition algal abundance were gradually increased during the observation periods fig s10 these results reflected the shift strategies for p uptake and utilization by algae in different p quota of algal cell taken together dissolved pi from po remineralization in the water column could be directly stored in algae in the form of ortho p and pyro p in january algae heavily depended on its stored pi for growth and reproduction in april p supply for algal blooms in july can be heavily dependent on spm po remineralization however these samples were collected at long time intervals as a result which might be lost some important information associated with the strategies of p uptake and utilization of algae therefore increasing sample times are required to further clarify the strategies for p uptake and utilization by algae during the its growth and reproduction in ongoing work the hydrodynamics driven changes in spm mineralogy led to increasing p sorption as was shown by the higher contents of pi particularly h2o pi in spm than those in algae especially in july fig 2a b the underlying reason for the higher p contents of spm is that srp can bind preferentially with particulate surface beside biological uptake and assimilation yang et al 2021a therefore increasing the competition between algae and sorption sites of inorganic spm for dissolved pi in the water column during the algal blooms e g july might also lead algae to increasingly depend on pop remineralization to meet its p needs olander and vitousek 2005 helfenstein et al 2018 this was also expressed by the enhancing apa in the water column with the increasing algal abundance figs s9 and s10 to further reveal the p uptake and utilization strategies of algae future work is required to quantify the adsorption of dissolved pi on spm in the water column and its effect on algal growth and reproduction 3 4 microbially driven p release from suspended particulate matter bacteria also play an essential role in p release except for algae strong correlations among p pools and p compounds from spm to sediment and different bacterial communities at genus level in their corresponding mediums were observed suggesting that spm and sediment might enrich some specific taxa fig 4 a b we selected 10 genera in the water column and 10 genera in sediment as core genera due to their high relative abundances and significant positive or negative correlations with their corresponding p pools and p compounds fig 5 a b fortunately those of the selected core genera have members with reported capabilities in p solubilization mineralization e g pseudomonas in the water column thiobacillus in sediment which can transform po or insoluble pi into dissolved pi menkina 1950 paul and sundara rao 1971 illmer and schhinner 1992 jorquera et al 2008 in order to provide more information for p cycling we further analyzed the relative abundance of phosphorus solubilization mineralization bacteria including inorganic phosphorus solubilization bacteria ipb organic phosphorus mineralization bacteria opb at genus level in the water column and sediment these results indicate that relative abundance of both ipb mean 16 60 and opb mean 27 85 in the water column were greater than those of in sediment mean 0 84 for ipb and 2 29 for opb fig s11 which highlighted that these key bacteria genera were responsible for p released from spm during the sedimentation moreover iron cycling driven by redox transformations or microorganisms can also influence p release from p associated with iron hydr oxides fig s12 increasing studies have shown that the competition between some bacteria e g fe iii reducing bacteria ferb fe ii oxidizing bacteria feob and redox transformations for fe ii oxidation or fe iii reduction may increase crowe et al 2007 melton et al 2014 upreti et al 2019 fan et al 2021 chen et al 2022 in addition latest studies demonstrated that some bacteria e g sulfate reducing bacteria srb sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob with the capability of sulfate reduction or sulfide oxidization could affect the fe speciation by mediating the s speciation baldwin et al 2000 arning et al 2009 yu et al 2015 chen et al 2016 fan et al 2018 berg et al 2019 li et al 2022 therefore the relative abundance of ferb feob srb and sob was further analysis results demonstrated that the relative abundance of ferb mean 16 27 and srb mean 5 88 in the water column and ferb mean 2 04 and srb 1 59 in sediment were obviously higher than their corresponding relative abundance of feob mean 1 1 and sob mean 0 4 in the water column and feob 0 8 and sob 0 9 in sediment fig s13 respectively suggesting that ferb and srb contributed greatly to p remobilization from spm during sedimentation alternatively the pathway of p released from spm driven by abiotic reaction such as t ph do fig s14 might be nonnegligible pan et al 2013 further work is required to quantify the relative contribution of above listed factors for p release from spm 4 conclusions the integrated information from complementary technologies enabled us to summarize that p released from spm during or after sedimentation provided a major p source for algal blooms under dissolved p depleted water column p compounds from algae spm and sediment were identified including ortho p monoester p diester p and pyro p relative lower diester p monoester p ratios of spm in surface water in january and july than those of in april reflected the higher degree of diester p remineralization in the water column during these periods the h2o pi and po monoester p and diester p from spm were the primarily bioavailable p pools for algae the strategies of p uptake and utilization of algae were further identified in the field investigation dissolved pi in the water column could be stored in algae in the form of ortho p and pyro p in january algae heavily relied on its stored pi for growth and reproduction in april spm po remineralization provided the primary p source for algal blooms in july algae and bacteria e g pseudomonas were responsible for spm p remineralization and or remobilization overall our findings provide new insights into the understanding of algal blooms with dissolved p depleted water bodies which are valuable for understanding p

14681,the sequestration of organic carbon oc in wetland sediments is influenced by the presence of oxygen or lack thereof the mechanisms of oc sequestration under redox fluctuations particularly by the co mediation of reactive iron fe protection and thermodynamic limitation by the energetics of the oc itself remain unclear over the past 26 years a combination of field surveys and remote sensing images had revealed a strong decline in both natural and constructed wetland areas in tianjin this decline could be attributed to anthropogenic landfill practices and agricultural reclamation efforts which may have significant impacts on the oxidation reduction conditions for sedimentary oc the fe bound oc cbd extraction decreased by 2 to 10 fold from 8 3 to 10 to 0 7 4 5 with increasing sediment depth at three sites with varying water depths wd the high resolution spectro microscopy analysis demonstrated that fe oxyhydr oxides were colocalized with sedimentary oc corresponding to lower redox potential the nominal oxidation state of c nosc which corresponds to the energy content in oc became more negative energy content increased with increasing sediment depth taken together the preservation of sedimentary oc is contingent on the prevailing redox conditions in environments where oxygen availability is high reactive fe provides protection for oc while in anoxic environments thermodynamic constraints i e energetic constraints limit the oxidation of oc graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc reactive iron protection sedimentary carbon storage ft icr ms water depth wd data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global wetlands are a net carbon c sink of approximately 830 teragrams tg c year 1 with an average net retention rate of 118 g c m 2 year 1 mitsch et al 2013 wang et al 2017 anthropogenic activities have impacted wetlands over the past decades for example because of intensive anthropogenic activities china has lost 7562 km2 of wetland marshes 4 8 of the initial marsh area in china from 2000 to 2015 as indicated by 30 m resolution satellite images xu et al 2019 to date the consequences of land use or management changes in coastal wetlands remain largely undescribed hampering further assessment of the impact of c stabilization and ecological equilibrium the stability of organic matter om in wetlands to oxidation mineralization is mainly determined by organomineral complexation zhao et al 2018 on average 21 of om in sediments is preserved by reactive fe minerals on a global scale strongly depending on the local site characteristics lalonde et al 2012 these fe iii minerals have a high affinity for c via the formation of inner sphere complexes that protect om in sediments against microbial and enzymatic decomposition riedel et al 2013 sun et al 2020a reduced fe fe ii in wetlands however may act as catalysts accelerating om decomposition via the production of reactive oxygen species ros murphy et al 2014 tong et al 2016 in addition fe iii reduction is often coupled with om cycling which primarily occurs when microorganisms use om as electron donors to reduce fe iii to fe ii and the produced fe ii are unstable and thus form fe oxyhydr oxides to preserve om i e forming organo mineral complexes the formation of stable organo mineral complexes can retard amorphous fe recrystallization into secondary minerals trusiak et al 2018 winkler et al 2018 the divergent roles of fe minerals namely preservation and increased decomposition highlight the complex mechanisms by which they mediate c cycling in wetlands xie et al 2020 kleber et al 2021 yu and kuzyakov 2021 but is never simultaneously compared for c stored in sediments or soils the thermodynamically controlled preservation a mechanism relevant to the bioenergetic constraints on microbial oxidation of reduced c plays an essential role in om preservation in anoxic sediments boye et al 2017 keiluweit et al 2017 therefore the lack of oxygen and low oxidizing efficiency of alternative electron acceptors prevent microbial decomposition of reduced om in anoxic environments because om mineralization is constrained by a thermodynamic thresholds of electron acceptors thermodynamic constrains limitations prevent microbes from using dissolved om dom if they provide insufficient energy in anoxic environments boye et al 2017 keiluweit et al 2017 gunina and kuzyakov 2022 therefore competing or complementary mechanisms for preserving om coexist in wetland sediments with different redox states the relative contributions of these mechanisms to om stabilization functions however remain unclear the cycling and preservation of sedimentary om have been investigated by selective extraction methods such as citrate bicarbonate dithionite cbd extraction lalonde et al 2012 wang et al 2017 and advanced techniques e g nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims dorau et al 2019 mueller et al 2013 although the cbd extraction may be less efficient to measure fe bound organic c oc due to the incomplete reduction of reactive fe fed fisher et al 2020 2021 this method is still widely used to quantify the oc bound to reactive fe minerals lalonde et al 2012 nanosims enables om on mineral species with very high spatial resolution down to 50 nm inagaki et al 2020 chi et al 2022a 2022b it is difficult however to identify all the mineral species and functional groups e g aromatic c aliphatic c with nanosims in complex sediments owing to it parallel detection of a maximum of only seven elements or isotopes within a single image complementary to nanosims synchrotron radiation based micro fourier transform infrared μ ftir spectro microscopy allows the assessment of clays secondary minerals and om forms in the micrometer spatial resolution benning et al 2004 johnson et al 2015 sun et al 2019 du et al 2020 recently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been intensively used to characterize the chemistry of dom at the molecular level boye et al 2017 lv et al 2018 li et al 2019 zherebker et al 2020 for instance the om preservation investigated with ft icr ms at the molecular scale indicated that thermodynamic limitation constitutes an important complement to other preservation mechanisms boye et al 2017 gunina and kuzyakov 2022 this thermodynamic limitation mechanisms challenged the concept of molecular level interactions of om and fe under varying redox conditions highlighting that dom can be preserved without inner sphere complexation with minerals because much more information should be considered in the complex chemical physical and biological reactions xu et al 2019 and the accompanying change in redox conditions pallud et al 2020 sapkota and white 2020 the stability and mobilization of sedimentary om in wetlands need to be further explored investigating the mechanisms of sedimentary om preservation in coastal wetlands is a necessary step to further quantifying the oc stocks and to clarifying their stability and response to global warming the objectives of this study were i to investigate how reactive fe minerals and their associated om change with sediment depth ii to identify the spatial distribution of om on and within these fe minerals at a submicron scale and oc functional group level and iii to examine whether there were any thermodynamic limitations for the decomposition of sedimentary om depending on depths for these purposes three anthropogenically affected wetlands with increasing water depths wds aerobic 0 3 m and 0 5 m anaerobic 4 m in depth yu et al 2001 la et al 2022 were selected 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and sediment collection changes in coastal wetland area and wetland types in west bohai bay china in recent decades were first investigated by remote sensing combined with field surveys figs 1 s1 and table s1 to evaluate the characteristics and mechanisms of oc burial in sediments in the coastal wetland three sites in reservoir wetlands with distinct wds were selected in the beidagang wetland tianjin china in august 2019 fig 1 these reservoir wetlands are used to receive municipal sewage discharge and thus these sediment samples allow us to assess anthropogenic impacts on the environment sediment cores were collected through push coring ss h 02 easysensor china at the swan lake edge the depth of water above the sediment was 0 3 m wd 0 3 and center the depth of water above the sediment was 0 5 m wd 0 5 the sediments in the reservoir the depth of water above the sediment was 4 m wd 4 0 were collected using a gravity sampler both the wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 sites represented typical aerobic environments whereas wd 4 0 showed a typical anaerobic environment and much lower salinity than the other two sites table 1 and fig 2 sediment samples were collected from the uppermost 40 cm using plastic sleeves fig 1 then subsamples were obtained at 2 cm intervals utilizing segmented rings to identify texture and color and promptly transferred them to individual 50 ml centrifuge tubes to minimize exposure to oxygen n2 gas we injected continuously into each tube which was subsequently capped and sealed with parafilm these samples were shipped on ice to the lab within 2 h and then kept at 20 c these operations ensure that the sediments remain anaerobic during transfer and transport of sediments then these samples within 24 h of storage were freeze dried at 20 c for 48 h the freeze dried sediments were used for further analysis the details of total carbon tc total nitrogen tn total oc toc the anion and cation analyses can be seen in the supporting materials 2 2 reactive fe and fe bound oc analyses we extracted reactive iron oxides fed using a modified cbd method lalonde et al 2012 see supporting materials the extraction process involved cbd extraction including trisodium citrate and control extraction using nacl instead of cbd reagent under identical conditions fe bound oc was quantified as a percentage of toc using eq 1 1 fe bound oc o c nacl o c cbd toc 100 where ocnacl and occbd are the oc contents in the sediment residues after nacl and cbd extractions respectively and toc represents the total organic carbon in sediment 2 3 nanosims analysis the surface 0 2 cm and deep 32 34 cm sediment at the three sampling sites were selected for scanning electron microscopy sem and nanosims analysis inagaki et al 2020 yu et al 2020 the details can be seen in the supporting materials electron multipliers were used to collect the following secondary ions 56fe16o 12c14n and 16o the 12c14n ion was interpreted as organic matter while the 56fe16o ion was interpreted as fe oxides vogel et al 2014 yu et al 2021 the 16o ion represented the clay sized fraction and was also used to differentiate between the sediment particles and the silica wafer inagaki et al 2020 2 4 spatial related μ ftir analysis intact sediment particles 30 100 µm were picked with superfine tweezers from the surface and deep sediments frozen at 20 c and then cut on a cryomicrotome cryotome e thermo shandon limited uk sun et al 2020b chi et al 2022a the details about μ ftir can be seen in the supporting materials spatial related μ ftir spectro microscopy was performed using a thermo nicolet 6700 ftir spectrometer at the bl01b1 beamline at the shanghai synchrotron radiation facility ssrf china after baseline correction carboxylic oh stretching 3200 3400 cm 1 calderon et al 2013 chen et al 2019 aliphatic ch stretching 2920 cm 1 calderon et al 2013 aliphatic ch bending 1460 cm 1 chen et al 2019 and secondary minerals 1150 750 cm 1 including fe o si o and al o groups table s2 were identified for sediments 2 5 ft icr ms analysis and nosc calculation dom was collected from both surface and deep sediments and subjected to analysis using ft icr ms boye et al 2017 keiluweit et al 2017 garcia arredondo et al 2019 the sediment samples were processed by extracting the dom with a sediment to water weight ratio of 1 10 the mixture was then agitated for 8 h at 170 rpm before being filtered through 0 45 µm polytetrafluoroethylene filters the details about ft icr ms can be seen in the supporting materials to analyze the thermodynamic limitations on the decomposition of dom molecules and characterize their molecular properties the nominal oxidation state of c nosc was chosen and calculated as follows eq 2 keiluweit et al 2017 ding et al 2020 2 nosc 4 4 c h 2 o 3 n 2 s c where c h o n and s indicate the number of carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and sulfur atoms in the substance respectively the relative abundances of compound groups e g lipids proteins amino sugars carbohydrates tannins unsaturated hydrocarbons and condensed hydrocarbons were calculated by summing the relative intensities of all molecules in each compound group excluding lignin which is assumed to be very stable compared to other substances in anaerobic environments austin et al 2016 the averages of o c o c avg h c h c avg and the average nosc nosc avg were calculated based on the relative intensity of each molecule note that the while ft icr ms data can be used to calculate the relative abundances of compound groups this method is not without limitations and biases differences in ionization between various compound types can lead to inaccurate quantification of the compound groups potentially resulting in misleading interpretations of the organic matter composition therefore it is crucial to acknowledge these potential limitations when interpreting ft icr ms data 2 6 statistical analyses differences between samples means sd n 3 were assessed with one way analysis of variance anova tukey s honest significance test hsd was used and the significance level was set at p 0 05 a general linear model was conducted to examine the difference in nosc between surface and bottom sediments statistical analyses were performed using spss software package version 25 0 for windows spss chicago il 3 results 3 1 physico chemical characteristics reactive fe and fe bound oc depending on depth the ph values of the surface water were similar at all three sampling sites 8 3 table 1 the salinity levels of water at wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 were 24 higher compared to wd 4 0 which had a salinity level of only 1 4 table 1 notably the salinity levels of wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 were similar to the salinity level of bohai seawater which measures 30 the dissolved oxygen do in the surface water had the highest concentration at wd 0 5 9 06 mg l 1 followed by wd 4 0 7 36 mg l 1 and wd 0 3 2 7 mg l 1 the concentration profiles of cations na and nh4 and anions cl and so4 2 in the water extracts are shown in fig 2 specifically the surface extracts had 4 7 and 4 3 fold higher na than those in the deep sediments from wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 respectively in contrast the na concentration in the surface extract had 2 1 fold lower than those in the deep sediment from wd 4 0 which was opposite to the changes in na from wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 fig 2a similarly nh4 and cl concentrations were markedly higher in the surface extract from wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 than those from wd 4 0 fig 2b and 2c revealing a saline environment at both wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 the surface extracts from wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 showed 32 and 23 fold higher so4 2 concentration than in the deep sediments while the sediment from wd 4 0 exhibited 18 fold higher so4 2 levels fig 2d these findings imply that the majority of the salts originated from surface sources whereas the low sulfate concentration could be attributed to water stratification and anoxic condition in the bottom water at the three sites particularly at wd 4 0 notably the changes observed in nh4 na and cl support this conclusion with the latter two ions being especially indicative of surface input for the three selected sediment cores in the beidagang wetland fig 1 the fed content in the first 20 cm of depth slightly increased with depth for both wd 0 3 from 2 6 to 2 9 g kg 1 and wd 0 5 from 2 3 to 2 6 g kg 1 but markedly decreased with depth for wd 4 0 from 3 0 to 1 9 g kg 1 fig 4 at a depth of 25 35 cm however the fed content sharply declined 2 4 fold in wd 0 3 1 3 fold in wd 0 5 and 2 1 fold in wd 4 0 for all three sites these results revealed a higher content of reducible fe minerals in the surface sediment layer 0 20 cm similarly the fe bound oc percentage p 0 05 declined with increasing depth at all three sites fe bound oc accounted for 10 of toc fig 3 in the oxygenated surface layer 0 2 cm which was 2 4 times higher than that in the deep layer 30 35 cm highlighting the important role of reactive fe minerals in sedimentary oc storage at the water sediment interface aerobic area the fe l edge x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy xanes spectra revealed a stronger fe iii signal compared to fe ii across all three sampling sites figs s2 and s3 to determine the semiquantitative percentage of fe ii and fe iii in sediment layers a linear combination fitting lcf approach was employed the lcf fitting results indicated that the fe iii phase predominated across all sediment layers exceeding 66 and significantly surpassing the percentage of fe ii phase table s4 the fe k edge xanes spectra was shifted to the right more oxidized in the surface sediments relative to the deeper sediments more reduced consequently the bottom layer is developed in a more reduced conditions with a higher proportion of fe ii phase present than in the surface layers of wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 fig s4 the sulfur s k edge xanes spectra and its semiquantitative lcf results indicated that fes and fes2 were more predominant 40 in the sediments fig s5 and table s5 by combining the complementary information provided by fe l edge xanes spectra and fe k edge xanes spectra a more comprehensive understanding of the distribution of fe ii and fe iii phases was obtained in the sediment profile depending on water depths to evaluate the main process of c storage the molar ratio of fe bound oc to fed oc fed was further analyzed fig 3 overall the oc fed ratio decreased with sediment depth specifically the oc fed ratio increased from 1 6 to 11 in the wd 0 3 wd 0 5 sediment cores and the surface layer of wd 4 0 fig 3 in contrast a low oc fed ratio except for the surface layer i e oc fed 5 3 was found at the wd 4 0 site the positive correlation fig s7 between fe bound oc toc and doc in sediments and their salinity levels indicates that the salinity environment of wetlands plays a crucial role in carbon stabilization 3 2 visualizing fe bound organic carbon at the submicron scale at the sediment depths of wd 0 3 and wd 4 0 sem and nanosims images were used to analyze particle morphology and determine the high resolution fe oc associations in their spatial distribution fig 5 and figs s8 s10 nanosims images illustrated the submicron ion distribution and spatial heterogeneity in sediments fig 5 a strong spatial association of organic matter 12c14n with the clay sized fraction 16o was common in the surface fig 5a and deep fig 5b sediments fe bearing oxides 56fe16o showed a strong signal in the surface layer fig 5a compared to the deep layer fig 5b consistent with the results from selective extraction fig 4 a similarly the other two sites wd 0 5 and wd 4 0 fig s8 also showed highly heterogeneous spatial distribution patterns of fe bearing oxides and oc and a strong spatial association of organic matter with mineral phases fig s8c i the analysis of regions of interest rois indicated that fe oxides were more strongly correlated with the protection of organic matter in the surface sediments than in the bottom sediments at three sites figs s9 and s10 table s6 this suggests that fe oxides crucially contribute to organic matter in the surface sediments to identify the spatial distribution of functional groups depending on redox conditions high resolution spatially related μ ftir images were used figs 6 and s11 the µ ftir spectra were obtained from the optical images along the direction of the red arrow fig 6a b the organic compounds and secondary minerals showed signals of unique functional groups table s2 specifically carboxylic oh stretching 3200 3400 cm 1 aliphatic ch stretching 2920 cm 1 and aliphatic ch bending 1460 cm 1 heller et al 2015 sun et al 2023 were stronger in the surface than in the deep layer figs 6 and s11 spatially related µ ftir images showed a clear signal for secondary minerals 1150 750 cm 1 on both the surface and bottom layers figs 6 and s11 secondary minerals were located mainly in the interior of the particles 30 50 μm of the bottom sediment but were almost homogeneously distributed across the whole particle 10 90 μm in the surface sediment fig 6 the correlations between oc functional groups and secondary minerals revealed a stronger association of secondary minerals with aliphatic ch bending than with carboxylic oh stretching and aliphatic ch stretching in both the surface and bottom sediments figs 7 and s12 aliphatic ch bending refers to changes in the angle of two chemical bonds with one common atom while aliphatic ch stretching indicates the elongation and shortening of atoms along the bond axis and only changes in bond length lehmann and solomon 2010 notably a close correlation between secondary minerals and carboxylic oh stretching only occurred in the surface layer and not in the bottom layer fig 7a d overall the μ ftir images suggested that secondary minerals e g fe si or al may predominately retain aliphatic ch bending groups in the sedimentary oc which is stronger in the surface than in the bottom sediments except for wd 4 0 this submicron observation provides an explanation for the higher fraction of fe bound oc in the surface layer than the bottom layer as indicated by the results of the selective extraction fig 3 3 3 molecular diversity and thermodynamic protection to identify the diversity of organic molecules and thermodynamic protection of oc in the sediments and dom ft icr ms was used fig 8 the van krevelen diagrams visualized the compound distribution in the dom fig 8a and showed that lignin like compounds were the largest fraction 49 57 of organic compounds in the dom of the three sediments fig 8b all three surface sediments contained much more proteins amino sugars and carbohydrates than the deep sediments yet an inverse trend was found in the fractions of tannins and condensed hydrocarbons high molecular weight om reduced c i e more negative nosc existed in all three sediments figs 8c and 9 notably the average nosc values decreased with sediment depth 0 7 in wd 0 3 0 9 in wd 0 5 and 0 8 in wd 4 0 fig 8c reflecting that those deeper sediments may be less effective to decompose organic matter because of thermodynamic limitations and so at preserving organic matter for long periods each chemical class contained substances with a considerably wide range of noscs fig 9 sedimentary proteins and lipids had a more negative average nosc compared to other compounds 0 68 for proteins and 1 1 for lipids fig 8b whereas carbohydrates and aromatics had more positive nosc values specifically carbohydrates had an average nosc ranging from 0 14 to 0 24 lignins ranging from 0 1 to 0 04 and tannins ranging from 0 6 to 0 64 changes in each organic substance relative to water depths in the sediments fig 9 provided valuable insights into the thermodynamic protection of oc notably the average nosc of lipids proteins hydrocarbons aminosugars tannin and condensed hydrocarbons displayed a noteworthy difference between the surface and bottom sediments in the shallow overlying water i e wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 fig 9a b however in the deep overlying water 4 0 m these components showed minimal variation fig 9c specifically deep sediments in wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 possessed a higher nosc for lipids proteins and unsaturated hydrocarbons than surface sediments for the same organic class fig 9a b in contrast deep sediments in wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 had a lower nosc for tannins and condensed hydrocarbons than surface sediments the surface and deep sediments in wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 had similar nosc for amino sugars lignins and carbohydrates reflecting that these organic classes remained relatively stable and were independent of sediment depth 4 discussion 4 1 effects of the alternation of physico chemical characteristics in sediments on carbon storage wetlands are a net c sink and sedimentary oc storage is affected by altering oxygen availability and redox profiles as well as sediment salinity middelburg and levin 2009 herbert et al 2021 wallenius et al 2021 the so4 2 concentration decreased sharply from the surface to the deep layers 10 cm in both wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 fig 2d indicating that although the surface sediments are aerobic do may rapidly decrease with depth at wd 4 0 the so4 2 concentration in surface sediment was significantly lower roughly half as much compared to the levels observed at the other two sites this suggests that the reduction of sulfate from the upper water column onto surface sediments is more pronounced in wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 than in wd 4 0 which is supported by the significant difference in sulfate concentrations between wd 4 0 and the other two sites the lower sulfate concentration at wd 4 0 suggests either a stronger reduction of sulfate or a higher degree of conversion to sulfide it is also possible that sulfate in surface sediment at wd 4 0 has been more extensively reduced to sulfide indicating the strong anaerobic environment in the deep water region 4 m the pore water geochemistry supported the occurrence of sulfate reduction at wd 4 0 coupled with organic matter decomposition i e known as organoclastic sulfate reduction osr la et al 2022 based on the sulfate concentration in the overlying water at the three sites it is likely that the osr process dominates the sulfate reduction pathways in this depth furthermore the lcf results of s k edge xanes indicated that iron sulfides e g fes fes2 are more predominant in the sediments suggesting strongly reducing conditions and that the formation of iron sulfides also plays an important role in the oc sequestration picard et al 2019 ma et al 2022 nabeh et al 2022 in the beidagang wetland do concentrations in the bottom water were lower than the surface water from 7 4 mg l 1 to 2 7 mg l 1 and the surface sediments were anoxic and do may rapidly deplete below the sediment water interface la et al 2022 in situ o2 microprofiling showed that the penetration of oxygen was up to 6 cm depth in coastal sediments koop jakobsen and gutbrod 2019 in the beidagang wetlands the do concentrations in the bottom water were lower than those at the surface at all sites in summer water stratification can cause differences in do levels which may impact oc sequestration in wetland sediments surface water with high do levels can promote phytoplankton growth and increase organic matter production conversely low do levels in bottom water due to hypoxia can limit metabolism of benthic organisms and oc decomposition in sediments la et al 2022 therefore it is important to account for do variations when studying sediment oc sequestration organic carbon toc and doc content in the sediments increased with the salinity na cl level fig s7 salinity decreases the metabolic activity of microorganisms and the migration and distribution of oc distribution within sediments herbert et al 2015 therefore the salinity decline with depth may increase the sequestration of organic carbon in sediments the redox cycling processes in sediments change the reactivity of fe minerals and then influence the binding and decomposition of oc with increasing wds estes et al 2019 bishop et al 2020 fisher et al 2020 peiffer et al 2021 the findings in fig 4 which indicate a decrease in fe bound oc from the sediment surface to the bottom across all three sites these findings align with previous observations that both fed and oc associated with fe minerals tend to decrease as sediment depth increases wang et al 2017 fisher et al 2020 sun et al 2020a fe l edge xanes spectra further indicated that the decrease in fe bound oc may be caused by the formation of fe ii phases figs s2 s3 and table s4 deposited on the mineral surfaces and an accompanying release of the bound oc jelavic et al 2020 moreover the findings from the s k edge xanes spectra support the significant contribution of iron sulfides such as fes and fes2 in the oc sequestration in the deeper layers fig s5 note that freezing of samples may impact fe mineral composition e g crystallinity cause low crystallinity and particles with irregular layered shapes and alter fe oc complexation greffie et al 2001 saponjic et al 2017 whitaker et al 2021 this may raise the oc release from fe oxides in the sediments similarly under reducing conditions in an incubation experiment c was lost for 5 44 due to the reduction of fe iii minerals and fe release that destabilize fe bound oc adhikari and yang 2015 this c loss may be caused by the fe reduction driven formation of hydroxyl radicals that effectively catalyze oc decomposition during fe ii re oxidation van bodegom et al 2005 murphy et al 2014 tong et al 2016 yu and kuzyakov 2021 wan et al 2022 therefore the importance of in resolution porewater chemistry particularly fe2 and its derived ros on sedimentary oc preservation riedel et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 deserved to be investigated the oc fed ratio allows to distinguish between the sorption and coprecipitation as the main c storage process wagai and mayer 2007 an oc fed ratio 1 reflects sorption of oc on fe oxide surfaces wang et al 2017 whereas an oc fed ratio 6 shows coprecipitation and or chelation of oc with fe by generating low density organic rich structures lalonde et al 2012 the oc fed ratio suggested that coprecipitation rather than sorption dominated the oc storage in the wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 sediments and the surface layer of the wd 4 0 sediment fig 4 these oc fed ratios often exceed the maximum sorption capacity of iron oxides 1 0 but are consistent with the formation of oc fe chelates furthermore the trend of the oc fed ratio was similar to that of doc fig s6 in contrast sorption controlled the oc storage in wd 4 0 except for the surface layer caution is important when explaining sorption and coprecipitation processes based on the oc fed ratio as the cbd extraction may cause an underestimation of the actual oc fed ratio because a part of cbd extractable fe is oc free as inferred from xanes barber et al 2017 4 2 effects of sediment depth on submicron protection of carbon by fe oxides exploration of the associations between oc and fe oxides at the molecular level is imperative to understand the oc preservation in sediments adhikari and yang 2015 the nanosims results reveal a pronounced spatial correlation between organic matter and fe bearing oxides in the surface layer as opposed to the deep layer figs 5 and s8 these submicron images suggest that fe oxides may have a more significant influence on oc binding in the surface layer than in the deeper sediments based on this evidence we contend that the impact of fe oxides on oc binding is more pronounced in the upper than in the deeper layers additionally the submicron image of fe cn associations fig 5 provided direct evidence that fe oxides contribute more to oc storage in the surface sediments aerobic area than in the deep sediments which is consistent with the results from the selective extraction fig 4 note that fe bound oc typically constitutes less than 10 of the total oc in the examined sediments as such its role in the sequestration of oc in coastal wetlands is of minor importance when compared to other sediment types lalonde et al 2012 or soils kramer and chadwick 2018 iron oxides that change from an oxidized to a reduced state lose their ability to adsorb oc allowing microorganisms to degrade the released oc thus indirectly affecting the decomposition and accumulation of oc in sediments hayes et al 2017 jelavic et al 2020 therefore the redox changes in sediments will affect fe oxidation states figs s2 and s3 and the fate of oc associated with fe oxides organic matter stabilization strongly depends on its speciation in sediment particles stegen et al 2018 complementary to nanosims images the µ ftir images further demonstrated that more types of functional groups e g carboxylic acids aliphatics existed in the surface compared to the bottom layer figs 6 and s11 these functional groups may mainly be derived from plant residues e g lignin and microorganisms e g amino sugars zhang et al 2013 notably the strong absorbance of secondary minerals in the fingerprint region the low wavenumber region 1150 cm 1 xiao et al 2018 supported that fe oxides played a key role in sedimentary oc storage which was further confirmed by the nanosims images figs 5 and s8 4 3 effects of sediment depth on diversity of organic molecules and thermodynamic protection lignin 49 57 accounted for the largest fraction of doc in all three sediment sites fig 8 b consequently most oc buried in costal sediments may originate from partially decomposed plant residues transported from terrestrial ecosystems regnier et al 2013 larowe et al 2020 the amino sugar content strongly decreased with depth fig 8b suggesting that amino sugars derived from microbial necromass mainly contributed to a stable oc pool at the surface rather than at depth however this finding actually suggests that microbial necromass including amino sugars will decompose more rapidly than lignin surprisingly this means that amino sugars which are typically stable in aerobic environments such as upland soils will actually decompose more quickly in anaerobic environments this phenomenon may be attributed to two factors 1 sorption of amino sugars onto clays in the presence of excess water or cations from salts and 2 the lack of aggregate formation under flooding conditions the average nosc in the bottom sediments were obviously lower than that in the surface sediments fig 8c indicating a key role of thermodynamic preservation of oc in the deep sediments anaerobic environment this supports that aliphatic compounds are more resistant to be decomposed and thus can be preserved better in anaerobic environments e g in floodplains boye et al 2017 wetlands jokic et al 2003 and deep sediments hayes et al 2017 lorenz et al 2007 since substances with low nosc have high energy to sustain microbial demands fischer et al 2021 highly reduced low nosc e g lipids doc fig 8 was preferentially preserved in an anaerobic environment the mineralization of particulate organic carbon poc similar to doc mineralization is also subject to thermodynamic limitations canfield et al 1993 boye et al 2017 indicated that thermodynamic limitation mainly occurred when nosc 0 3 under sulfidic conditions anaerobic environment and nosc 0 6 under oxic conditions therefore water soluble organic compounds with an nosc below the thermodynamic threshold nosc 0 3 may not be directly degraded by microorganisms hall et al 2014 and thus be preserved by thermodynamic limitations in anoxic sediments 4 4 mechanisms of organic matter preservation in wetlands and environmental implications we further propose that iron oxide protection and thermodynamic limitations collectively dominate oc preservation in wetlands experiencing fluctuating water levels fig 10 fe oxyhydr oxides strongly concentrate organic substances compared to their concentrations in solution as highlighted by recent studies by faust et al 2021 and kleber et al 2021 this emphasizes the importance of mineral protected oc for the c cycle and its stability the mineralization of oc however is constrained by the oxidation of more reduced organic substrates such as alkanes lignin lipid derivatives which requires alternate electron acceptors aea like nitrate mn4 fe3 and sulfate boye et al 2017 keiluweit et al 2017 these bioenergetic constraints result in the enrichment or preservation of reduced compounds in anaerobic sediments which explains why sedimentary oc is not fully mineralized in deep sediments as it is thermodynamically unfavorable gunina and kuzyakov 2022 complementary to mineral protection functioning mainly in aerobic but also in anaerobic conditions these thermodynamic limitations on doc mineralization preserve oc in anaerobic wetlands therefore the oc protection mechanisms in wetlands are very dynamic depending on local redox states in addition the distinct mechanisms of sedimentary oc storage point to the complexity of c preservation in waterlogged wetlands especially in coastal wetlands that are heavily affected by both natural e g seawater intrusion wang et al 2019 and anthropogenic activities polizzotto et al 2008 xu et al 2019 given that our earth has moved into a new geological epoch i e the anthropocene malhi 2017 this proposed schematic illustration of om preservation in wetlands highlights that the interactions between intensive anthropogenic activities elhacham et al 2020 and sea level rise wang et al 2019 will further complicate the om cycle and stability in waterlogged wetlands because wetlands store approximately 21 of the global terrestrial c stock anthony and silver 2020 our findings allow to better understand the c cycle and stability in coastal wetlands notably the decreased wetland area will increase the production of ros e g hydrogen peroxide h2o2 superoxide o2 and hydroxyl radicals ho in coastal wetlands page et al 2013 tong et al 2016 trusiak et al 2018 yu and kuzyakov 2021 which will accelerate the exchanges between mineral protected and soluble c however since the c and fe cycles govern the turnover of heavy metals and organic pollutants wang et al 2020 xie et al 2020 this study also has important implications for pollutant mobilization in wetlands 5 conclusion by integrating multiple approaches selective extraction nanosims and spatial related μ ftir analyses we demonstrated that the fe bound organic carbon oc markedly decreased with increasing sediment depth at all water depth sites this result revealed that reactive fe played a key role in the preservation of oc at the sediment surfaces but had a weakening effect in the deeper layers the nominal oxidation state of c nosc the main thermodynamic parameter of oc in the bottom layer anoxic environment was lower than that in the surface layer suggesting that the decomposition of sedimentary oc was restricted by thermodynamic limitation of electron transfer in anaerobic environments in summary sedimentary oc storage in wetlands depends on the local oxic anoxic environments i e protected by reactive fe oxides in aerobic environments but is mainly restricted by thermodynamic limitation in anaerobic conditions the results were achieved through the utilization of a range of innovative and comprehensive complementary technologies specifically citrate bicarbonate dithionite cbd extraction was used for bulk analyses nanosims allowed to localize and specify organo mineral interactions at the 50 nm scale μ ftir was used for functional group speciation at the submicron scale and ft icr ms showed the full range of individual organic compounds by utilizing these technologies we quantified mineral protected organic matter observed the in situ associations between minerals and organic c at both the elemental and functional group levels and assess the thermodynamic limitations of organic matter in sediments we showed that bulk extractions are insufficient to capture the intricate micro to nanoscale details of organo mineral associations with high precision indeed nanosims and μ ftir provide a more mechanistic understanding of the bulk scale results although cbd extraction nanosims and μ ftir are extensively used to investigate mineral protected oc these methods are unable to assess the oc in solution intriguingly ft icr ms provides insights into the thermodynamic limitations of doc decomposition further investigation of the 14c ages of oc in wetlands is needed to be explored to identify the ancient oc stored by minerals especially fe bearing oxides together this suite of complementary technologies will allow us to better understand the c cycle and stability in wetland environments appendix a supplementary

14681,the sequestration of organic carbon oc in wetland sediments is influenced by the presence of oxygen or lack thereof the mechanisms of oc sequestration under redox fluctuations particularly by the co mediation of reactive iron fe protection and thermodynamic limitation by the energetics of the oc itself remain unclear over the past 26 years a combination of field surveys and remote sensing images had revealed a strong decline in both natural and constructed wetland areas in tianjin this decline could be attributed to anthropogenic landfill practices and agricultural reclamation efforts which may have significant impacts on the oxidation reduction conditions for sedimentary oc the fe bound oc cbd extraction decreased by 2 to 10 fold from 8 3 to 10 to 0 7 4 5 with increasing sediment depth at three sites with varying water depths wd the high resolution spectro microscopy analysis demonstrated that fe oxyhydr oxides were colocalized with sedimentary oc corresponding to lower redox potential the nominal oxidation state of c nosc which corresponds to the energy content in oc became more negative energy content increased with increasing sediment depth taken together the preservation of sedimentary oc is contingent on the prevailing redox conditions in environments where oxygen availability is high reactive fe provides protection for oc while in anoxic environments

sedimentary carbon storage ft icr ms water depth wd data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global wetlands are a net carbon c sink of approximately 830 teragrams tg c year 1 with an average net retention rate of 118 g c m 2 year 1 mitsch et al 2013 wang et al 2017 anthropogenic activities have impacted wetlands over the past decades for example because of intensive anthropogenic activities china has lost 7562 km2 of wetland marshes 4 8 of the initial marsh area in china from 2000 to 2015 as indicated by 30 m resolution satellite images xu et al 2019 to date the consequences of land use or management changes in coastal wetlands remain largely undescribed hampering further assessment of the impact of c stabilization and ecological equilibrium the stability of organic matter om in wetlands to oxidation mineralization is mainly determined by organomineral complexation zhao et al 2018 on average 21 of om in sediments is preserved by reactive fe minerals on a global scale strongly depending on the local site characteristics lalonde et al 2012 these fe iii minerals have a high affinity for c via the formation of inner sphere complexes that protect om in sediments against microbial and enzymatic decomposition riedel et al 2013 sun et al 2020a reduced fe fe ii in wetlands however may act as catalysts accelerating om decomposition via the production of reactive oxygen species ros murphy et al 2014 tong et al 2016 in addition fe iii reduction is often coupled with om cycling which primarily occurs when microorganisms use om as electron donors to reduce fe iii to fe ii and the produced fe ii are unstable and thus form fe oxyhydr oxides to preserve om i e forming organo mineral complexes the formation of stable organo mineral complexes can retard amorphous fe recrystallization into secondary minerals trusiak et al 2018 winkler et al 2018 the divergent roles of fe minerals namely preservation and increased decomposition highlight the complex mechanisms by which they mediate c cycling in wetlands xie et al 2020 kleber et al 2021 yu and kuzyakov 2021 but is never simultaneously compared for c stored in sediments or soils the thermodynamically controlled preservation a mechanism relevant to the bioenergetic constraints on microbial oxidation of reduced c plays an essential role in om preservation in anoxic sediments boye et al 2017 keiluweit et al 2017 therefore the lack of oxygen and low oxidizing efficiency of alternative electron acceptors prevent microbial decomposition of reduced om in anoxic environments because om mineralization is constrained by a thermodynamic thresholds of electron acceptors thermodynamic constrains limitations prevent microbes from using dissolved om dom if they provide insufficient energy in anoxic environments boye et al 2017 keiluweit et al 2017 gunina and kuzyakov 2022 therefore competing or complementary mechanisms for preserving om coexist in wetland sediments with different redox states the relative contributions of these mechanisms to om stabilization functions however remain unclear the cycling and preservation of sedimentary om have been investigated by selective extraction methods such as citrate bicarbonate dithionite cbd extraction lalonde et al 2012 wang et al 2017 and advanced techniques e g nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims dorau et al 2019 mueller et al 2013 although the cbd extraction may be less efficient to measure fe bound organic c oc due to the incomplete reduction of reactive fe fed fisher et al 2020 2021 this method is still widely used to quantify the oc bound to reactive fe minerals lalonde et al 2012 nanosims enables om on mineral species with very high spatial resolution down to 50 nm inagaki et al 2020 chi et al 2022a 2022b it is difficult however to identify all the mineral species and functional groups e g aromatic c aliphatic c with nanosims in complex sediments owing to it parallel detection of a maximum of only seven elements or isotopes within a single image complementary to nanosims synchrotron radiation based micro fourier transform infrared μ ftir spectro microscopy allows the assessment of clays secondary minerals and om forms in the micrometer spatial resolution benning et al 2004 johnson et al 2015 sun et al 2019 du et al 2020 recently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been intensively used to characterize the chemistry of dom at the molecular level boye et al 2017 lv et al 2018 li et al 2019 zherebker et al 2020 for instance the om preservation investigated with ft icr ms at the molecular scale indicated that thermodynamic limitation constitutes an important complement to other preservation mechanisms boye et al 2017 gunina and kuzyakov 2022 this thermodynamic limitation mechanisms challenged the concept of molecular level interactions of om and fe under varying redox conditions highlighting that dom can be preserved without inner sphere complexation with minerals because much more information should be considered in the complex chemical physical and biological reactions xu et al 2019 and the accompanying change in redox conditions pallud et al 2020 sapkota and white 2020 the stability and mobilization of sedimentary om in wetlands need to be further explored investigating the mechanisms of sedimentary om preservation in coastal wetlands is a necessary step to further quantifying the oc stocks and to clarifying their stability and response to global warming the objectives of this study were i to investigate how reactive fe minerals and their associated om change with sediment depth ii to identify the spatial distribution of om on and within these fe minerals at a submicron scale and oc functional group level and iii to examine whether there were any thermodynamic limitations for the decomposition of sedimentary om depending on depths for these purposes three anthropogenically affected wetlands with increasing water depths wds aerobic 0 3 m and 0 5 m anaerobic 4 m in depth yu et al 2001 la et al 2022 were selected 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and sediment collection changes in coastal wetland area and wetland types in west bohai bay china in recent decades were first investigated by remote sensing combined with field surveys figs 1 s1 and table s1 to evaluate the characteristics and mechanisms of oc burial in sediments in the coastal wetland three sites in reservoir wetlands with distinct wds were selected in the beidagang wetland tianjin china in august 2019 fig 1 these reservoir wetlands are used to receive municipal sewage discharge and thus these sediment samples allow us to assess anthropogenic impacts on the environment sediment cores were collected through push coring ss h 02 easysensor china at the swan lake edge the depth of water above the sediment was 0 3 m wd 0 3 and center the depth of water above the sediment was 0 5 m wd 0 5 the sediments in the reservoir the depth of water above the sediment was 4 m wd 4 0 were collected using a gravity sampler both the wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 sites represented typical aerobic environments whereas wd 4 0 showed a typical anaerobic environment and much lower salinity than the other two sites table 1 and fig 2 sediment samples were collected from the uppermost 40 cm using plastic sleeves fig 1 then subsamples were obtained at 2 cm intervals utilizing segmented rings to identify texture and color and promptly transferred them to individual 50 ml centrifuge tubes to minimize exposure to oxygen n2 gas we injected continuously into each tube which was subsequently capped and sealed with parafilm these samples were shipped on ice to the lab within 2 h and then kept at 20 c these operations ensure that the sediments remain anaerobic during transfer and transport of sediments then these samples within 24 h of storage were freeze dried at 20 c for 48 h the freeze dried sediments were used for further analysis the details of total carbon tc total nitrogen tn total oc toc the anion and cation analyses can be seen in the supporting materials 2 2 reactive fe and fe bound oc analyses we extracted reactive iron oxides fed using a modified cbd method lalonde et al 2012 see supporting materials the extraction process involved cbd extraction including trisodium citrate and control extraction using nacl instead of cbd reagent under identical conditions fe bound oc was quantified as a percentage of toc using eq 1 1 fe bound oc o c nacl o c cbd toc 100 where ocnacl and occbd are the oc contents in the sediment residues after nacl and cbd extractions respectively and toc represents the total organic carbon in sediment 2 3 nanosims analysis the surface 0 2 cm and deep 32 34 cm sediment at the three sampling sites were selected for scanning electron microscopy sem and nanosims analysis inagaki et al 2020 yu et al 2020 the details can be seen in the supporting materials electron multipliers were used to collect the following secondary ions 56fe16o 12c14n and 16o the 12c14n ion was interpreted as organic matter while the 56fe16o ion was interpreted as fe oxides vogel et al 2014 yu et al 2021 the 16o ion represented the clay sized fraction and was also used to differentiate between the sediment particles and the silica wafer inagaki et al 2020 2 4 spatial related μ ftir analysis intact sediment particles 30 100 µm were picked with superfine tweezers from the surface and deep sediments frozen at 20 c and then cut on a cryomicrotome cryotome e thermo shandon limited uk sun et al 2020b chi et al 2022a the details about μ ftir can be seen in the supporting materials spatial related μ ftir spectro microscopy was performed using a thermo nicolet 6700 ftir spectrometer at the bl01b1 beamline at the shanghai synchrotron radiation facility ssrf china after baseline correction carboxylic oh stretching 3200 3400 cm 1 calderon et al 2013 chen et al 2019 aliphatic ch stretching 2920 cm 1 calderon et al 2013 aliphatic ch bending 1460 cm 1 chen et al 2019 and secondary minerals 1150 750 cm 1 including fe o si o and al o groups table s2 were identified for sediments 2 5 ft icr ms analysis and nosc calculation dom was collected from both surface and deep sediments and subjected to analysis using ft icr ms boye et al 2017 keiluweit et al 2017 garcia arredondo et al 2019 the sediment samples were processed by extracting the dom with a sediment to water weight ratio of 1 10 the mixture was then agitated for 8 h at 170 rpm before being filtered through 0 45 µm polytetrafluoroethylene filters the details about ft icr ms can be seen in the supporting materials to analyze the thermodynamic limitations on the decomposition of dom molecules and characterize their molecular properties the nominal oxidation state of c nosc was chosen and calculated as follows eq 2 keiluweit et al 2017 ding et al 2020 2 nosc 4 4 c h 2 o 3 n 2 s c where c h o n and s indicate the number of carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and sulfur atoms in the substance respectively the relative abundances of compound groups e g lipids proteins amino sugars carbohydrates tannins unsaturated hydrocarbons and condensed hydrocarbons were calculated by summing the relative intensities of all molecules in each compound group excluding lignin which is assumed to be very stable compared to other substances in anaerobic environments austin et al 2016 the averages of o c o c avg h c h c avg and the average nosc nosc avg were calculated based on the relative intensity of each molecule note that the while ft icr ms data can be used to calculate the relative abundances of compound groups this method is not without limitations and biases differences in ionization between various compound types can lead to inaccurate quantification of the compound groups potentially resulting in misleading interpretations of the organic matter composition therefore it is crucial to acknowledge these potential limitations when interpreting ft icr ms data 2 6 statistical analyses differences between samples means sd n 3 were assessed with one way analysis of variance anova tukey s honest significance test hsd was used and the significance level was set at p 0 05 a general linear model was conducted to examine the difference in nosc between surface and bottom sediments statistical analyses were performed using spss software package version 25 0 for windows spss chicago il 3 results 3 1 physico chemical characteristics reactive fe and fe bound oc depending on depth the ph values of the surface water were similar at all three sampling sites 8 3 table 1 the salinity levels of water at wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 were 24 higher compared to wd 4 0 which had a salinity level of only 1 4 table 1 notably the salinity levels of wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 were similar to the salinity level of bohai seawater which measures 30 the dissolved oxygen do in the surface water had the highest concentration at wd 0 5 9 06 mg l 1 followed by wd 4 0 7 36 mg l 1 and wd 0 3 2 7 mg l 1 the concentration profiles of cations na and nh4 and anions cl and so4 2 in the water extracts are shown in fig 2 specifically the surface extracts had 4 7 and 4 3 fold higher na than those in the deep sediments from wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 respectively in contrast the na concentration in the surface extract had 2 1 fold lower than those in the deep sediment from wd 4 0 which was opposite to the changes in na from wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 fig 2a similarly nh4 and cl concentrations were markedly higher in the surface extract from wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 than those from wd 4 0 fig 2b and 2c revealing a saline environment at both wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 the surface extracts from wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 showed 32 and 23 fold higher so4 2 concentration than in the deep sediments while the sediment from wd 4 0 exhibited 18 fold higher so4 2 levels fig 2d these findings imply that the majority of the salts originated from surface sources whereas the low sulfate concentration could be attributed to water stratification and anoxic condition in the bottom water at the three sites particularly at wd 4 0 notably the changes observed in nh4 na and cl support this conclusion with the latter two ions being especially indicative of surface input for the three selected sediment cores in the beidagang wetland fig 1 the fed content in the first 20 cm of depth slightly increased with depth for both wd 0 3 from 2 6 to 2 9 g kg 1 and wd 0 5 from 2 3 to 2 6 g kg 1 but markedly decreased with depth for wd 4 0 from 3 0 to 1 9 g kg 1 fig 4 at a depth of 25 35 cm however the fed content sharply declined 2 4 fold in wd 0 3 1 3 fold in wd 0 5 and 2 1 fold in wd 4 0 for all three sites these results revealed a higher content of reducible fe minerals in the surface sediment layer 0 20 cm similarly the fe bound oc percentage p 0 05 declined with increasing depth at all three sites fe bound oc accounted for 10 of toc fig 3 in the oxygenated surface layer 0 2 cm which was 2 4 times higher than that in the deep layer 30 35 cm highlighting the important role of reactive fe minerals in sedimentary oc storage at the water sediment interface aerobic area the fe l edge x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy xanes spectra revealed a stronger fe iii signal compared to fe ii across all three sampling sites figs s2 and s3 to determine the semiquantitative percentage of fe ii and fe iii in sediment layers a linear combination fitting lcf approach was employed the lcf fitting results indicated that the fe iii phase predominated across all sediment layers exceeding 66 and significantly surpassing the percentage of fe ii phase table s4 the fe k edge xanes spectra was shifted to the right more oxidized in the surface sediments relative to the deeper sediments more reduced consequently the bottom layer is developed in a more reduced conditions with a higher proportion of fe ii phase present than in the surface layers of wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 fig s4 the sulfur s k edge xanes spectra and its semiquantitative lcf results indicated that fes and fes2 were more predominant 40 in the sediments fig s5 and table s5 by combining the complementary information provided by fe l edge xanes spectra and fe k edge xanes spectra a more comprehensive understanding of the distribution of fe ii and fe iii phases was obtained in the sediment profile depending on water depths to evaluate the main process of c storage the molar ratio of fe bound oc to fed oc fed was further analyzed fig 3 overall the oc fed ratio decreased with sediment depth specifically the oc fed ratio increased from 1 6 to 11 in the wd 0 3 wd 0 5 sediment cores and the surface layer of wd 4 0 fig 3 in contrast a low oc fed ratio except for the surface layer i e oc fed 5 3 was found at the wd 4 0 site the positive correlation fig s7 between fe bound oc toc and doc in sediments and their salinity levels indicates that the salinity environment of wetlands plays a crucial role in carbon stabilization 3 2 visualizing fe bound organic carbon at the submicron scale at the sediment depths of wd 0 3 and wd 4 0 sem and nanosims images were used to analyze particle morphology and determine the high resolution fe oc associations in their spatial distribution fig 5 and figs s8 s10 nanosims images illustrated the submicron ion distribution and spatial heterogeneity in sediments fig 5 a strong spatial association of organic matter 12c14n with the clay sized fraction 16o was common in the surface fig 5a and deep fig 5b sediments fe bearing oxides 56fe16o showed a strong signal in the surface layer fig 5a compared to the deep layer fig 5b consistent with the results from selective extraction fig 4 a similarly the other two sites wd 0 5 and wd 4 0 fig s8 also showed highly heterogeneous spatial distribution patterns of fe bearing oxides and oc and a strong spatial association of organic matter with mineral phases fig s8c i the analysis of regions of interest rois indicated that fe oxides were more strongly correlated with the protection of organic matter in the surface sediments than in the bottom sediments at three sites figs s9 and s10 table s6 this suggests that fe oxides crucially contribute to organic matter in the surface sediments to identify the spatial distribution of functional groups depending on redox conditions high resolution spatially related μ ftir images were used figs 6 and s11 the µ ftir spectra were obtained from the optical images along the direction of the red arrow fig 6a b the organic compounds and secondary minerals showed signals of unique functional groups table s2 specifically carboxylic oh stretching 3200 3400 cm 1 aliphatic ch stretching 2920 cm 1 and aliphatic ch bending 1460 cm 1 heller et al 2015 sun et al 2023 were stronger in the surface than in the deep layer figs 6 and s11 spatially related µ ftir images showed a clear signal for secondary minerals 1150 750 cm 1 on both the surface and bottom layers figs 6 and s11 secondary minerals were located mainly in the interior of the particles 30 50 μm of the bottom sediment but were almost homogeneously distributed across the whole particle 10 90 μm in the surface sediment fig 6 the correlations between oc functional groups and secondary minerals revealed a stronger association of secondary minerals with aliphatic ch bending than with carboxylic oh stretching and aliphatic ch stretching in both the surface and bottom sediments figs 7 and s12 aliphatic ch bending refers to changes in the angle of two chemical bonds with one common atom while aliphatic ch stretching indicates the elongation and shortening of atoms along the bond axis and only changes in bond length lehmann and solomon 2010 notably a close correlation between secondary minerals and carboxylic oh stretching only occurred in the surface layer and not in the bottom layer fig 7a d overall the μ ftir images suggested that secondary minerals e g fe si or al may predominately retain aliphatic ch bending groups in the sedimentary oc which is stronger in the surface than in the bottom sediments except for wd 4 0 this submicron observation provides an explanation for the higher fraction of fe bound oc in the surface layer than the bottom layer as indicated by the results of the selective extraction fig 3 3 3 molecular diversity and thermodynamic protection to identify the diversity of organic molecules and thermodynamic protection of oc in the sediments and dom ft icr ms was used fig 8 the van krevelen diagrams visualized the compound distribution in the dom fig 8a and showed that lignin like compounds were the largest fraction 49 57 of organic compounds in the dom of the three sediments fig 8b all three surface sediments contained much more proteins amino sugars and carbohydrates than the deep sediments yet an inverse trend was found in the fractions of tannins and condensed hydrocarbons high molecular weight om reduced c i e more negative nosc existed in all three sediments figs 8c and 9 notably the average nosc values decreased with sediment depth 0 7 in wd 0 3 0 9 in wd 0 5 and 0 8 in wd 4 0 fig 8c reflecting that those deeper sediments may be less effective to decompose organic matter because of thermodynamic limitations and so at preserving organic matter for long periods each chemical class contained substances with a considerably wide range of noscs fig 9 sedimentary proteins and lipids had a more negative average nosc compared to other compounds 0 68 for proteins and 1 1 for lipids fig 8b whereas carbohydrates and aromatics had more positive nosc values specifically carbohydrates had an average nosc ranging from 0 14 to 0 24 lignins ranging from 0 1 to 0 04 and tannins ranging from 0 6 to 0 64 changes in each organic substance relative to water depths in the sediments fig 9 provided valuable insights into the thermodynamic protection of oc notably the average nosc of lipids proteins hydrocarbons aminosugars tannin and condensed hydrocarbons displayed a noteworthy difference between the surface and bottom sediments in the shallow overlying water i e wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 fig 9a b however in the deep overlying water 4 0 m these components showed minimal variation fig 9c specifically deep sediments in wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 possessed a higher nosc for lipids proteins and unsaturated hydrocarbons than surface sediments for the same organic class fig 9a b in contrast deep sediments in wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 had a lower nosc for tannins and condensed hydrocarbons than surface sediments the surface and deep sediments in wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 had similar nosc for amino sugars lignins and carbohydrates reflecting that these organic classes remained relatively stable and were independent of sediment depth 4 discussion 4 1 effects of the alternation of physico chemical characteristics in sediments on carbon storage wetlands are a net c sink and sedimentary oc storage is affected by altering oxygen availability and redox profiles as well as sediment salinity middelburg and levin 2009 herbert et al 2021 wallenius et al 2021 the so4 2 concentration decreased sharply from the surface to the deep layers 10 cm in both wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 fig 2d indicating that although the surface sediments are aerobic do may rapidly decrease with depth at wd 4 0 the so4 2 concentration in surface sediment was significantly lower roughly half as much compared to the levels observed at the other two sites this suggests that the reduction of sulfate from the upper water column onto surface sediments is more pronounced in wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 than in wd 4 0 which is supported by the significant difference in sulfate concentrations between wd 4 0 and the other two sites the lower sulfate concentration at wd 4 0 suggests either a stronger reduction of sulfate or a higher degree of conversion to sulfide it is also possible that sulfate in surface sediment at wd 4 0 has been more extensively reduced to sulfide indicating the strong anaerobic environment in the deep water region 4 m the pore water geochemistry supported the occurrence of sulfate reduction at wd 4 0 coupled with organic matter decomposition i e known as organoclastic sulfate reduction osr la et al 2022 based on the sulfate concentration in the overlying water at the three sites it is likely that the osr process dominates the sulfate reduction pathways in this depth furthermore the lcf results of s k edge xanes indicated that iron sulfides e g fes fes2 are more predominant in the sediments suggesting strongly reducing conditions and that the formation of iron sulfides also plays an important role in the oc sequestration picard et al 2019 ma et al 2022 nabeh et al 2022 in the beidagang wetland do concentrations in the bottom water were lower than the surface water from 7 4 mg l 1 to 2 7 mg l 1 and the surface sediments were anoxic and do may rapidly deplete below the sediment water interface la et al 2022 in situ o2 microprofiling showed that the penetration of oxygen was up to 6 cm depth in coastal sediments koop jakobsen and gutbrod 2019 in the beidagang wetlands the do concentrations in the bottom water were lower than those at the surface at all sites in summer water stratification can cause differences in do levels which may impact oc sequestration in wetland sediments surface water with high do levels can promote phytoplankton growth and increase organic matter production conversely low do levels in bottom water due to hypoxia can limit metabolism of benthic organisms and oc decomposition in sediments la et al 2022 therefore it is important to account for do variations when studying sediment oc sequestration organic carbon toc and doc content in the sediments increased with the salinity na cl level fig s7 salinity decreases the metabolic activity of microorganisms and the migration and distribution of oc distribution within sediments herbert et al 2015 therefore the salinity decline with depth may increase the sequestration of organic carbon in sediments the redox cycling processes in sediments change the reactivity of fe minerals and then influence the binding and decomposition of oc with increasing wds estes et al 2019 bishop et al 2020 fisher et al 2020 peiffer et al 2021 the findings in fig 4 which indicate a decrease in fe bound oc from the sediment surface to the bottom across all three sites these findings align with previous observations that both fed and oc associated with fe minerals tend to decrease as sediment depth increases wang et al 2017 fisher et al 2020 sun et al 2020a fe l edge xanes spectra further indicated that the decrease in fe bound oc may be caused by the formation of fe ii phases figs s2 s3 and table s4 deposited on the mineral surfaces and an accompanying release of the bound oc jelavic et al 2020 moreover the findings from the s k edge xanes spectra support the significant contribution of iron sulfides such as fes and fes2 in the oc sequestration in the deeper layers fig s5 note that freezing of samples may impact fe mineral composition e g crystallinity cause low crystallinity and particles with irregular layered shapes and alter fe oc complexation greffie et al 2001 saponjic et al 2017 whitaker et al 2021 this may raise the oc release from fe oxides in the sediments similarly under reducing conditions in an incubation experiment c was lost for 5 44 due to the reduction of fe iii minerals and fe release that destabilize fe bound oc adhikari and yang 2015 this c loss may be caused by the fe reduction driven formation of hydroxyl radicals that effectively catalyze oc decomposition during fe ii re oxidation van bodegom et al 2005 murphy et al 2014 tong et al 2016 yu and kuzyakov 2021 wan et al 2022 therefore the importance of in resolution porewater chemistry particularly fe2 and its derived ros on sedimentary oc preservation riedel et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 deserved to be investigated the oc fed ratio allows to distinguish between the sorption and coprecipitation as the main c storage process wagai and mayer 2007 an oc fed ratio 1 reflects sorption of oc on fe oxide surfaces wang et al 2017 whereas an oc fed ratio 6 shows coprecipitation and or chelation of oc with fe by generating low density organic rich structures lalonde et al 2012 the oc fed ratio suggested that coprecipitation rather than sorption dominated the oc storage in the wd 0 3 and wd 0 5 sediments and the surface layer of the wd 4 0 sediment fig 4 these oc fed ratios often exceed the maximum sorption capacity of iron oxides 1 0 but are consistent with the formation of oc fe chelates furthermore the trend of the oc fed ratio was similar to that of doc fig s6 in contrast sorption controlled the oc storage in wd 4 0 except for the surface layer caution is important when explaining sorption and coprecipitation processes based on the oc fed ratio as the cbd extraction may cause an underestimation of the actual oc fed ratio because a part of cbd extractable fe is oc free as inferred from xanes barber et al 2017 4 2 effects of sediment depth on submicron protection of carbon by fe oxides exploration of the associations between oc and fe oxides at the molecular level is imperative to understand the oc preservation in sediments adhikari and yang 2015 the nanosims results reveal a pronounced spatial correlation between organic matter and fe bearing oxides in the surface layer as opposed to the deep layer figs 5 and s8 these submicron images suggest that fe oxides may have a more significant influence on oc binding in the surface layer than in the deeper sediments based on this evidence we contend that the impact of fe oxides on oc binding is more pronounced in the upper than in the deeper layers additionally the submicron image of fe cn associations fig 5 provided direct evidence that fe oxides contribute more to oc storage in the surface sediments aerobic area than in the deep sediments which is consistent with the results from the selective extraction fig 4 note that fe bound oc typically constitutes less than 10 of the total oc in the examined sediments as such its role in the sequestration of oc in coastal wetlands is of minor importance when compared to other sediment types lalonde et al 2012 or soils kramer and chadwick 2018 iron oxides that change from an oxidized to a reduced state lose their ability to adsorb oc allowing microorganisms to degrade the released oc thus indirectly affecting the decomposition and accumulation of oc in sediments hayes et al 2017 jelavic et al 2020 therefore the redox changes in sediments will affect fe oxidation states figs s2 and s3 and the fate of oc associated with fe oxides organic matter stabilization strongly depends on its speciation in sediment particles stegen et al 2018 complementary to nanosims images the µ ftir images further demonstrated that more types of functional groups e g carboxylic acids aliphatics existed in the surface compared to the bottom layer figs 6 and s11 these functional groups may mainly be derived from plant residues e g lignin and microorganisms e g amino sugars zhang et al 2013 notably the strong absorbance of secondary minerals in the fingerprint region the low wavenumber region 1150 cm 1 xiao et al 2018 supported that fe oxides played a key role in sedimentary oc storage which was further confirmed by the nanosims images figs 5 and s8 4 3 effects of sediment depth on diversity of organic molecules and thermodynamic protection lignin 49 57 accounted for the largest fraction of doc in all three sediment sites fig 8 b consequently most oc buried in costal sediments may originate from partially decomposed plant residues transported from terrestrial ecosystems regnier et al 2013 larowe et al 2020 the amino sugar content strongly decreased with depth fig 8b suggesting that amino sugars derived from microbial necromass mainly contributed to a stable oc pool at the surface rather than at depth however this finding actually suggests that microbial necromass including amino sugars will decompose more rapidly than lignin surprisingly this means that amino sugars which are typically stable in aerobic environments such as upland soils will actually decompose more quickly in anaerobic environments this phenomenon may be attributed to two factors 1 sorption of amino sugars onto clays in the presence of excess water or cations from salts and 2 the lack of aggregate formation under flooding conditions the average nosc in the bottom sediments were obviously lower than that in the surface sediments fig 8c indicating a key role of thermodynamic preservation of oc in the deep sediments anaerobic environment this supports that aliphatic compounds are more resistant to be decomposed and thus can be preserved better in anaerobic environments e g in floodplains boye et al 2017 wetlands jokic et al 2003 and deep sediments hayes et al 2017 lorenz et al 2007 since substances with low nosc have high energy to sustain microbial demands fischer et al 2021 highly reduced low nosc e g lipids doc fig 8 was preferentially preserved in an anaerobic environment the mineralization of particulate organic carbon poc similar to doc mineralization is also subject to thermodynamic limitations canfield et al 1993 boye et al 2017 indicated that thermodynamic limitation mainly occurred when nosc 0 3 under sulfidic conditions anaerobic environment and nosc 0 6 under oxic conditions therefore water soluble organic compounds with an nosc below the thermodynamic threshold nosc 0 3 may not be directly degraded by microorganisms hall et al 2014 and thus be preserved by thermodynamic limitations in anoxic sediments 4 4 mechanisms of organic matter preservation in wetlands and environmental implications we further propose that iron oxide protection and thermodynamic limitations collectively dominate oc preservation in wetlands experiencing fluctuating water levels fig 10 fe oxyhydr oxides strongly concentrate organic substances compared to their concentrations in solution as highlighted by recent studies by faust et al 2021 and kleber et al 2021 this emphasizes the importance of mineral protected oc for the c cycle and its stability the mineralization of oc however is constrained by the oxidation of more reduced organic substrates such as alkanes lignin lipid derivatives which requires alternate electron acceptors aea like nitrate mn4 fe3 and sulfate boye et al 2017 keiluweit et al 2017 these bioenergetic constraints result in the enrichment or preservation of reduced compounds in anaerobic sediments which explains why sedimentary oc is not fully mineralized in deep sediments as it is thermodynamically unfavorable gunina and kuzyakov 2022 complementary to mineral protection functioning mainly in aerobic but also in anaerobic conditions these thermodynamic limitations on doc mineralization preserve oc in anaerobic wetlands therefore the oc protection mechanisms in wetlands are very dynamic depending on local redox states in addition the distinct mechanisms of sedimentary oc storage point to the complexity of c preservation in waterlogged wetlands especially in coastal wetlands that are heavily affected by both natural e g seawater intrusion wang et al 2019 and anthropogenic activities polizzotto et al 2008 xu et al 2019 given that our earth has moved into a new geological epoch i e the anthropocene malhi 2017 this proposed schematic illustration of om preservation in wetlands highlights that the interactions between intensive anthropogenic activities elhacham et al 2020 and sea level rise wang et al 2019 will further complicate the om cycle and stability in waterlogged wetlands because wetlands store approximately 21 of the global terrestrial c stock anthony and silver 2020 our findings allow to better understand the c cycle and stability in coastal wetlands notably the decreased wetland area will increase the production of ros e g hydrogen peroxide h2o2 superoxide o2 and hydroxyl radicals ho in coastal wetlands page et al 2013 tong et al 2016 trusiak et al 2018 yu and kuzyakov 2021 which will accelerate the exchanges between mineral protected and soluble c however since the c and fe cycles govern the turnover of heavy metals and organic pollutants wang et al 2020 xie et al 2020 this study also has important implications for pollutant mobilization in wetlands 5 conclusion by integrating multiple approaches selective extraction nanosims and spatial related μ ftir analyses we demonstrated that the fe bound organic carbon oc markedly decreased with increasing sediment depth at all water depth sites this result revealed that reactive fe played a key role in the preservation of oc at the sediment surfaces but had a weakening effect in the deeper layers the nominal oxidation state of c nosc the main thermodynamic parameter of oc in the bottom layer anoxic environment was lower than that in the surface layer suggesting that the decomposition of sedimentary oc was restricted by thermodynamic limitation of electron transfer in anaerobic environments in summary sedimentary oc storage in wetlands depends on the local oxic anoxic environments i e protected by reactive fe oxides in aerobic environments but is mainly restricted by thermodynamic limitation in anaerobic conditions the results were achieved through the utilization of a range of innovative and comprehensive complementary technologies specifically citrate bicarbonate dithionite cbd extraction was used for bulk analyses nanosims allowed to localize and specify organo mineral interactions at the 50 nm scale μ ftir was used for functional group speciation at the submicron scale and ft icr ms showed the full range of individual organic compounds by utilizing these technologies we quantified mineral protected organic matter observed the in situ associations between minerals and organic c at both the elemental and functional group levels and assess the thermodynamic limitations of organic matter in sediments we showed that bulk extractions are insufficient to capture the intricate micro to nanoscale details of organo mineral associations with high precision indeed nanosims and μ ftir provide a more mechanistic understanding of the bulk scale results although cbd extraction nanosims and μ ftir are extensively used to investigate mineral protected oc these methods are unable to assess the oc in solution intriguingly ft icr ms provides insights into the thermodynamic limitations of doc decomposition further investigation of the 14c ages of oc in wetlands is needed to be explored to identify the ancient oc stored by minerals especially fe bearing oxides together this suite of complementary technologies will allow us to better understand the c cycle and stability in wetland environments appendix a supplementary

14682,air water diffusive carbon fluxes e g co2 and ch4 in reservoirs particularly those dammed in river valleys are the major pathway of reservoir carbon emissions hydrodynamic conditions caused by real time reservoir operation could potentially affect air water transfer of these greenhouse gases ghgs yet still under explored here we proposed an estimation method of gross carbon emissions based on a computational fluid dynamic cfd modelling approach the model assumed that air water mass transfer was primarily regulated by surface turbulence and disregarded contributions from biogeochemical processes as well as seasonality of meteorological parameters i e wind speed and direction air temperature through the hydrodynamic modeling reservoir water level flow velocity surface turbulence and air water transfer velocity of carbon fluxes were elaborated gross carbon emissions were integrated by the carbon fluxes in each discrete cell and time under real time reservoir operation the xiangjiaba reservoir xjb located in the upper yangtze basin was selected as the case of the study based on daily hydrological data in 2018 such as reservoir inflow outflow and water level the gross co2 and ch4 emissions in the reservoir were approximately 6 7 gg and 5 6 mg variations of daily water level and discharge induced by reservoir operation could evidently affect carbon emissions in particular when reservoir initiated its impoundment the discharge could be the probably critical factor that affected mass transfer velocity and carbon emissions in the reservoir our model could provide a new vision for evaluating the effect of real time reservoir operation on carbon emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gas hydroelectric reservoirs computational fluid dynamic model air water mass transfer high resolution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the growing global demand for freshwater resources and renewable clean energy more than 70 000 large reservoirs have been constructed worldwide along river corridors maavara et al 2015 maavara et al 2020 reservoir impoundments entail the flooding of a certain amount of land triggering decomposition of organic matter and production of excessive greenhouse gases ghgs such as co2 and ch4 li et al 2020 carbon emissions of global reservoirs reach approximately 134 9 tg co2 yr 1 and 17 7 tg ch4 yr 1 deemer et al 2016 keller et al 2021 which has drawn increasing global concern over the past decades one of the major pathways for reservoir carbon emissions is diffusive emission from the air water interface studies have indicated that for some reservoirs approximately 99 of co2 and more than 50 of ch4 in water are released into the atmosphere through the diffusive pathway santos et al 2006 deshmukh et al 2016 the gross reservoir surface carbon emissions can be defined as the product of the air water flux and surface area integrated within a certain time span unesco iha 2010 regarding the air water diffusive flux the gas transfer velocity and gas concentration in water phase are the decisive factors wanninkhof et al 2009 reservoir operation for specific purpose e g flood control hydropower production etc critically influences reservoir hydrodynamic conditions e g the water level flow rate and surface turbulence thereafter affecting carbon emissions alin et al 2011 ran et al 2015 in particular turbulence related hydrodynamic variables such as flow velocity discharge and water depth are the major parameters of water surface transfer velocity models zappa et al 2007 raymond et al 2012 ulseth et al 2019 thus real time reservoir hydrodynamic conditions caused by the operation schemes can affect its carbon emissions yet not extensively studied or reported field sampling campaigns frequently with a set of scattered sampling sites and weekly or monthly intervals are widely used to track reservoir carbon fluxes spatiotemporally unesco iha 2010 barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 yet such sampling strategy may inherently cause uncertainties in estimation of gross carbon emission due to the large surface area and the varying air water carbon fluxes in addition reservoir operation schemes for multiple purpose occur within a changing state regulating the hydrodynamic conditions and in further causing difficulties in estimation of gross carbon emissions with real time to track the dynamics of carbon emissions under real time reservoir operation computational fluid dynamic cfd modeling is becoming promising with the rapid development of numerical modeling it is possible to simulate spatiotemporal variations of reservoir environmental parameters under different hydrodynamic conditions wang et al 2021 park and lee 2002 burn and elnur 2002 kim et al 2017 particularly several numerical simulation software are becoming technically mature and could achieve reliable results alosairi and alsulaiman 2019 used the delft3d model to predict the transport of pollutants and dissolved oxygen under the combined action of tide climate and water density gao et al 2018 applied the efdc model to simulate the water quality and water age of xiangxi river bay in the three gorges reservoir nguyen et al 2019 used the mike11 model to simulate water quality variables such as chemical oxygen demand dissolved oxygen in the saigon dong nai river these efforts provide references for us to explore hydrodynamic conditions air water transfer and carbon emissions estimation under real time reservoir operation in this paper we proposed a novel method to estimate reservoir gross carbon emissions under real time reservoir operation the model assumed that air water mass transfer was primarily regulated by surface turbulence and disregarded contributions from biogeochemical processes as well as seasonality of meteorological parameters i e wind speed and direction air temperature using this method we elaborated the potential influence of reservoir operation as inflow outflow and reservoir depth on carbon emissions disregarding the influences of biogeochemical processes and variations of meteorological parameters the xiangjiaba reservoir xjb a river valley dammed reservoir in the upper yangtze river was selected as a case study according to the topographical model of the reservoir the carbon emissions throughout the year under real time reservoir operation were estimated by integrating the flux in each discrete cell over time under its cfd model we hope to provide a new tool for exploring the influence of reservoir operation such as variable reservoir flow and water depth on carbon emissions and improve the spatiotemporal resolution of reservoir carbon emissions estimation 2 materials and methods 2 1 modeling framework and assumptions the process of air water gas transfer is the determinant in reservoir carbon emissions estimation zhang et al 2021 in general both gas transfer velocity and gas concentration in water phase are all the critical variables regulating the air water transfer however we assumed here that physical processes especially water surface turbulence were the primary determinant that regulated air water gas transfer although biogeochemical processes in water column e g primary production degradation of organic carbon may also impact the concentrations of co2 and ch4 in surface water surface turbulence is structured by the wind speed heat flux wave characteristics and water flow and the impacts of surface turbulence characteristics are often considered as a driving factor in gas exchange research kitaigorodskii et al 1983 imberger 1985 agrawal et al 1992 this assumption was based on the recognition that short term physical control of air water gas transfer might be more significant than biological processes in water column duvert et al 2018 in addition this assumption would allow us to focus on the real time reservoir operation particularly the influence of reservoir hydrodynamic parameters on carbon emissions the effect of real time reservoir operation was reflected in the reservoir hydrodynamic conditions the hydrodynamic conditions e g flow velocity turbulent kinetic energy turbulent dissipation rate etc were simulated based on the pisofoam solver on the open source platform openfoam v6 0 openfoam foundation uk the rigid lid assumption for multiphase flow and the standard k ε model for turbulence was used the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm coupled the pressure and velocity in the reynolds average navier stokes rans simulation method central schemes were preferred consider that the continuity equation and momentum equation can be expressed as follows 1 u 0 2 u t u u p ρ ν k u where u is the velocity vector p is the pressure ρ is the density t is the time and ν k is the kinematic viscosity 3 k t u i k x i x i ν k ν t k x i g ε 4 ε t u i ε x i x i ν k ν t σ ε ε

and c 2 are model constants based on the hydrodynamic simulation the equation between hydrodynamic parameters and air water mass transfer velocity was established the transfer velocity k directly determines the magnitude of the air water gas flux raymond and cole 2001 wallin et al 2011 to scale and compare k between ghgs and temperatures t k can be normalized to a schmidt number sc of 600 referred to as k 600 5 k 600 k 600 s c ghg n where n ranges from 2 3 rigid surface to 1 2 free surface sc of co2 and ch4 can be calculated by temperature t as wanninkhof 1992 6 s c co 2 1911 1 118 11

k 600 in a lake with sulfur hexafluoride sf6 and proposed the following empirical equation between k 600 and wind velocity u 10 8 k 600 2 07 0 215 u 10 1 7 to explore the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on reservoir carbon emissions the relationship between the wind speed and the transfer velocity turbulence and the transfer velocity was assessed and converted based on a calibrated small eddy model k 600 can be calculated with the near surface turbulent dissipation rate as following vachon et al 2010 read et al 2012 9 k 600 s c 1 2 ε ν k 1 4 therefore the turbulent dissipation rate ε and gas transfer velocity k 600 of the reservoir surface could be estimated through the numerical simulation with turbulent parameter the gas flux f w across the air water interface acted on free surface boundary can be expressed as follows 10 f w k c c a where c a is the concentration of a given ghg under atmospheric pressure c is the ghg concentration in water the real time reservoir operation caused varying hydrodynamic conditions accordingly which could impact the mass transfer velocity on the reservoir water surface a method of differential cells in cfd was applied the water surface was divided with the differential cells the air water mass transfer velocity of each cell was simulated by the hydrodynamics model coupled with mass transfer velocity equation eq 9 the ghgs concentration for each cell was from the interpolation of on site measurement results as fig 1 concerning the entire water surface area of the reservoir carbon emissions j r can be defined as the integration of the flux in each cell over time j cell t 11 j r time domain j cell t time domain k c c a cell t considering the ghgs concentration was derived from the on site measurement results the value of mass transfer velocity had the decisive effect on carbon emissions estimation in this study thus it was necessary to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions accurately in the reservoir in order to validate the hydrodynamics model a water flume in laboratory was used to validate the model as text s1 comparing with the measured velocity of the cross section the average relative error of flow velocity was 1 73 the modeling result indicated this model matched the hydrodynamic conditions well 2 2 model comparations here we compared our modeling approach with the conventional method and our previous study huang et al 2022 in the conventional method ghg concentration and wind speed were frequently measured with a few scattered sampling sites as representativeness based on the thin boundary layer tbl method the carbon emissions of the whole reservoir area were estimated with the average flux of these sampling sites thus the amount and location of the sampling sites and the measured time point were decisive to the results of carbon emissions estimation in huang et al 2022 an improved method by integrating the flux in each discrete cell was proposed it conducted the higher resolution estimations in space compared with the conventional method but did not improve carbon emissions estimation over time i e real time level on this basis the carbon emissions estimation model in this study further considered the influence of real time reservoir operation based on the integration of the flux in each cell carbon emissions under different hydrodynamic conditions were estimated under the real time reservoir operation thus the emission results were not decided by the measured time point but reflected the relative hydrodynamic conditions for different time with higher temporal spatial resolution 2 3 site description and sampling campaigns the xiangjiaba reservoir located in the jinsha river was selected as the case in our study the jinsha river is the main stem of the upper yangtze river it has abundant water energy resources four cascade hydropower projects i e wudongde 10200 mw baihetan 16000 mw xiluodu 12600 mw and xiangjiaba 6400 mw have been operated in the lower reaches of the jinsha river fig 2 the xjb is the last cascade reservoir of the above cascade system the construction of the xjb started in november 2006 and the initial impoundment was in october 2012 the length of the xjb reservoir exceeds 150 km and the normal water level is 380 0 m above sea level with a total storage capacity of 5 16 km3 as the lowest reservoir in the cascade reservoir system the reservoir operation of the xjb is affected by the combined operation of the upstream reservoirs the daily variations in the water level and flow rate from january 1 2018 to january 31 2019 in the xjb are shown in fig 2 the xjb operation entered the water supply period from january and the flood season from july to september accordingly the reservoir outflow rate and inflow rate increased from july to september while they remained at a relatively low level in other months of the year under the combined operation of the upstream reservoirs the water level in the xjb varied between approximately 370 and 380 m above the sea level from july to september the hydraulic residence time of xjb was the shortest with an average of 6 5 days in other months of the year the hydraulic residence time fluctuated greatly and was relatively extended with an average of 22 1 days fig s4 field observations were conducted bimonthly from january 1 2018 to january 31 2019 zhang et al 2022 ten sampling sites p1 to p10 in the middle of the river and on the water surface along longitudinal gradients were established as shown in fig 3 the water temperature wind speed co2 and ch4 concentrations in both the water and air were measured the water temperature was monitored with an exo2 multiparameter sonde ysi inc oh usa with a precision of 0 01 c the wind speed was measured by an anemograph with a precision of 0 1 m s the co2 and ch4 concentrations were detected via the headspace technique water sample was collected by a 300 ml polypropylene syringe barrel and sealed underwater by its matching piston surplus water and possible air were ejected out carefully until the water sampling was 200 ml in the syringe then 100 ml of highly purified nitrogen was injected into the same syringe ghgs concentration in water and inert gas can reach the equilibrium states through intensive mixing for about 2 min then 100 ml gas mixture was injected into pre purified air sampling bag 0 3 l hede tech dalian china and detected by picarro g2201 i for ghgs concentration for air sample 100 ml of air was collected by polypropylene syringe and injected into pre purified air sampling bags then detected by picarro g2201 i for ghgs concentration more details about the field observation campaigns were provided in table 1 fig s5 fig s6 and fig s7 2 4 conditions for simulation set up the measured cases in the table 1 were simulated with the hydrodynamics model the measuring time of these cases covered a whole year with different seasons wind speeds flow rates and water levels the flow ranged from 2137 5 to 11300 m3 s and the water level ranged from 371 61 to 377 16 m almost including the maximum and minimum flow rate and water level in the year which was representative to a certain extent thus the mass transfer velocity equation could be proposed by the simulated hydrodynamic results of these cases under the daily hydrodynamics simulation the mass transfer velocity was calculated and carbon emissions were estimated the turbulent dissipation rate ε including the coupling effect of wind and current was calculated in the model and the mass transfer velocity k 600 was calculated with the eq 8 it was assumed that the wind direction was along the water flow direction based on the result of turbulent dissipation and mass transfer velocity of sampling sites in each sampling campaign it could structure an equation between the mass transfer velocity and the turbulent dissipation shown in eq 9 then carbon emissions could be estimated under the real time reservoir operation in 2018 the mass transfer velocity k 600 for each cell was calculated by the simulated turbulent dissipation rate ε and the ghgs concentration for the cell was the measured result of the sampling site which was the nearest the daily ghgs concentration was also interpolated by the measured result the daily ghgs concentration was the measured result closed to sampling time for carbon emissions estimation the average temperature in the year was used it was considered the carbon emissions were affected by the reservoir operation thus the wind speed was not involved in the estimation the entire xjb reservoir was selected as the simulation area with different reservoir operations and a topographical digital model with the real size of the xjb is showed in fig 3 to balance the computational efficiency channel meandering was not considered in the topographical modeling the modeling area of the xjb reservoir was divided into 10 m 10 m 10 m grids a uniform velocity profile was imposed at the inflow and a zero gradient for velocity was used at the outflow the boundary condition at the top of the computational domain was represented as the wind effect a no slip condition was set on the walls of the topographical digital model including the river bottom and bank 3 results 3 1 air water mass transfer velocity the cases in table 1 were simulated with the model based on the hydrodynamics model the results of flow velocity were shown in fig 4 the flow velocity on water surface was the combined effects of reservoir operation and the wind speed due to the effect of wind on the water surface the velocity on water surface was higher than that in other area the water depth increased from approximately 10 m to 115 m along the downstream direction in the reservoir area resulting a significant decrease of the flow velocity as fig 4 shows the flow velocity near the bottom of reservoir at the dam site was less than 0 3 m s while the upstream flow velocity could reach more than 3 m s for the sampling sites the turbulent dissipation rate ε was also impacted by reservoir operation and wind speed eq 8 was applied to calculate k 600 at the sampling sites during the dry season with low flow velocity since this equation was proposed for lakes with a low flow velocity linear regression with a forced zero intercept was performed on the sampling site data including k 600 and ε fig 5 shows the relationship between transfer velocity k 600 and sc 1 2 εν k 1 4 and the following equation can be obtained 12 k 600 0 0242 s c 1 2 ε ν k 1 4 this equation can be used to calculate the mass transfer velocity based on the turbulent conditions on the water surface of the reservoir which provides the foundation for the estimation of carbon emissions under real time reservoir operation 3 2 air water fluxes of co2 and ch4 based on daily reservoir operation in xjb throughout 2018 365 cases with varying hydraulic conditions were simulated to estimate the carbon fluxes the arithmetical mean fluxes of the whole reservoir were showed in fig 6 the results indicated that the reservoir was a carbon source under all hydrodynamic conditions the co2 and ch4 fluxes were in the low level during the low flow rate and high water level for co2 the minimum flux reached approximately 1 74 mmol m2 d and the minimum results of ch4 flux was 0 0047 mmol m2 d the flux was in the high level during the high flow rate and low water level the maximum fluxes of co2 and ch4 were 16 09 mmol m2 d and 0 022 mmol m2 d respectively 3 3 estimation of gross carbon emissions based on the integration of carbon flux and water surface area fig s8 the daily co2 and ch4 emissions in 2018 under reservoir operation are shown in fig 7 the seasonal trend of the carbon emissions was in consistent with flux the emissions of these two ghgs during the flood period were significantly higher than those during the dry period the co2 emission in the year varied accordingly the maximum and minimum daily co2 emission were 54 5 mg on august 15 and 2 99 mg on april 5 respectively the estimated maximum and minimum daily emission of ch4 were 0 035 mg on august 15 and 0 007 mg on january 1 respectively the annual co2 emission was evidently higher than that of ch4 the gross co2 and ch4 emissions in 2018 were approximately 6 7 gg co2 and 5 6 mg ch4 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 comparisons among different methods fig 6 shows the co2 and ch4 fluxes calculated with the methods developed in this study and conventional method respectively it can be seen that the flux in the whole reservoir calculated by a large number of differential cells were different with the average flux of several sampling sites fig 7 shows the co2 and ch4 emissions estimation in 2018 obtained with the methods developed in this study method discussed in huang et al 2022 and conventional method the carbon emissions estimation model in this study further considered the important influence of real time reservoir operation including changes in reservoir flow and water level but the method with huang et al 2022 and conventional method could estimate carbon emissions over a certain period of time the gross co2 and ch4 emissions in 2018 with conventional method were 7 6 gg co2 and 4 7 mg ch4 respectively the gross co2 and ch4 emissions in 2018 with huang et al 2022 were approximately 6 3 gg co2 and 5 5 mg ch4 respectively for conventional method the spatiotemporal arithmetical mean of estimation results was calculated as the emissions for the whole reservoir the method of huang et al 2022 considered the spatial resolution but didn t consider the hydrodynamic condition varied with time the carbon emissions estimation model in this study further considered the important influence of real time reservoir operation carbon emissions under different hydrodynamic conditions were calculated respectively under the real time reservoir operation which improved the temporal spatial resolution 4 2 effect of reservoir operation on carbon emissions to explore the effect of reservoir operation on carbon emissions the distribution of daily average mass transfer velocity with corresponding inflow rate outflow rate and average water depth in the xjb was shown in fig 8 the average transfer velocity was calculated by dividing the daily estimated flux by the mean of daily air water ghg concentration differences it showed that water level and discharge regulated by reservoir operation impacted the mass transfer velocity in particular due to the small variation of water level in xjb the influence of flow rate on mass transfer velocity was more significant when the inflow and outflow increased the average mass transfer velocity increased with increasing flow rate the flow velocity and turbulence in the reservoir area tended to increase resulting in an increase in the transfer velocity and the increase of air water mass transfer velocity would increase the carbon emissions this could also explain the high carbon emissions in the reservoir during the summer flood season fig s9 shows linear relationship between the daily average mass transfer velocity and the inflow rate outflow rate and average water depth in the xjb was established via fitting respectively r 2 of the linear fitting curve for water depth was merely 0 1 and 0 05 for co2 and ch4 respectively the correlation of the inflow rate and outflow rate on water turbulence in the reservoir was highly significant r 2 of the linear fitting curve with inflow rate was 0 61 and 0 49 for co2 and ch4 and 0 59 and 0 48 for outflow rate for co2 and ch4 respectively thus considering a reservoir under cascade operation when the water level variation is limited the effect of discharge on the carbon emissions in the reservoir is the primary factor 4 3 comparisons among other estimates fig 9 shows the co2 and ch4 flux results of other reservoirs around the world huttunen et al 2002 demarty et al 2011 gerardo nieto et al 2017 chanudet et al 2011 mosher et al 2015 huang et al 2015 dos santos et al 2006 guerin et al 2006 comparing the carbon emission fluxes from other global reservoirs or lakes in literature the flux results in this study were in a lower level most of these estimations of literature were calculated by the conventional method for the reservoirs with obvious changes in reservoir operation the method in this study can be applied to estimate carbon emissions so that the influence of the changes in hydrodynamic conditions can be involved and the estimated results with higher resolution can be obtained 4 4 effect of biogeochemical processes and meteorological variability this study focuses on the effects of hydrodynamics changes on carbon emissions caused by reservoir operation yet biogeochemical processes and meteorological variability also affect carbon emissions in the reservoir the influence of biogeochemical processes on carbon emissions is mainly reflected in the concentration of ghgs in water for instance photosynthesis could reduce the co2 concentration in surface water however elevation in trophic status could support formation of ch4 in water column natchimuthu and bastviken 2004 zhou et al 2020 both could evidently impact the concentration levels of co2 and ch4 in surface layer and in further affect air water transfer thus once the biogeochemical reactions of ghgs in water are included in the carbon emission estimation model uncertainties of the results will be significantly reduced reasonable estimates will be also obtained other than reservoir operation wind speed is another sensitive meteorological parameter that directly affect surface turbulence and carbon emissions in reservoir especially at the dam site when water velocity significantly reduced in our model the turbulent dissipation rate ε was used to describe the turbulence caused by wind and current then the relation between mass transfer velocity and ε was established thus when daily meteorological variability is incorporated into the model we will receive the estimates of carbon emissions that are greater than the stable condition since it is under the coupling effect of wind and current 4 5 limitations the accuracy of this method could decline when applied in an intensely turbulent system or water with high surface friction since wind conditions were not considered in the gross emission evaluation our next research could aim to determine the effect of wind conditions in various natural systems in addition factors such as the age geometry of reservoir power discharge and flooding discharge of the reservoir may impact emissions a more complicated model should be developed in the future in this paper the turbulent dissipation rate ε in water was obtained through hydrodynamics simulation and the mass transfer velocity under different wind speeds was calculated with the classical formula and then the relation between the mass transfer velocity and turbulent parameters was obtained through linear regression however the relation established with small eddy model is an empirical model the quantity and distribution of the data will affect the modeling results the carbon emissions estimation is based on this relation and the determination of this relation decides the value of mass transfer velocity under different reservoir operation conditions and affects the estimation of carbon emission accordingly thus future study will extend the regression model with inclusion of new data and reduce the potential uncertainties of the model the gas concentration in water phase is an important factor for the carbon emissions the interpolation of ghgs concentration caused the value of ghgs concentration incompatible with the real condition in which the biogeochemical processes in water column matters in addition the water surface was divided with a number of cells the ghg concentration for each cell was interpolated by the measurement results thus the different interpolation method will also impact the gas concentration distribution and the estimation results future study will try to take concentration changes into consideration including the diel dynamics of the fluxes 5 conclusion a reservoir carbon emissions estimation method was developed with the hydrodynamics model this method achieved an improved estimation resolution regarding the emissions of the entire reservoir by integrating the flux in thousands of discrete cells over time through numerical simulation the gross co2 and ch4 emissions in the xjb reservoir in 2018 reached approximately 6 7 gg co2 and 5 6 mg ch4 respectively in real time reservoir operation particularly in the cascade system reservoir discharge was the primary driven factor that impact its carbon emissions when water level variations were limited biogeochemical processes and meteorological parameters would be considered to upgrade the model in further study

co2 and ch4 emissions in the reservoir were approximately 6 7 gg and 5 6 mg variations of daily water level and discharge induced by reservoir operation could evidently affect carbon emissions in particular when reservoir initiated its impoundment the discharge could be the probably critical factor that affected mass transfer velocity and carbon emissions in the reservoir our model could provide a new vision for evaluating the effect of real time reservoir operation on carbon emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse gas hydroelectric reservoirs computational fluid dynamic model air water mass transfer high resolution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the growing global demand for freshwater resources and renewable clean energy more than 70 000 large reservoirs have been constructed worldwide along river corridors maavara et al 2015 maavara et al 2020 reservoir impoundments entail the flooding of a certain amount of land triggering decomposition of organic matter and production of excessive greenhouse gases ghgs such as co2 and ch4 li et al 2020 carbon emissions of global reservoirs reach approximately 134 9 tg co2 yr 1 and 17 7 tg ch4 yr 1 deemer et al 2016 keller et al 2021 which has drawn increasing global concern over the past decades one of the major pathways for reservoir carbon emissions is diffusive emission from the air water interface studies have indicated that for some reservoirs approximately 99 of co2 and more than 50 of ch4 in water are released into the atmosphere through the diffusive pathway santos et al 2006 deshmukh et al 2016 the gross reservoir surface carbon emissions can be defined as the product of the air water flux and surface area integrated within a certain time span unesco iha 2010 regarding the air water diffusive flux the gas transfer velocity and gas concentration in water phase are the decisive factors wanninkhof et al 2009 reservoir operation for specific purpose e g flood control hydropower production etc critically influences reservoir hydrodynamic conditions e g the water level flow rate and surface turbulence thereafter affecting carbon emissions alin et al 2011 ran et al 2015 in particular turbulence related hydrodynamic variables such as flow velocity discharge and water depth are the major parameters of water surface transfer velocity models zappa et al 2007 raymond et al 2012 ulseth et al 2019 thus real time reservoir hydrodynamic conditions caused by the operation schemes can affect its carbon emissions yet not extensively studied or reported field sampling campaigns frequently with a set of scattered sampling sites and weekly or monthly intervals are widely used to track reservoir carbon fluxes spatiotemporally unesco iha 2010 barros et al 2011 deemer et al 2016 yet such sampling strategy may inherently cause uncertainties in estimation of gross carbon emission due to the large surface area and the varying air water carbon fluxes in addition reservoir operation schemes for multiple purpose occur within a changing state regulating the hydrodynamic conditions and in further causing difficulties in estimation of gross carbon emissions with real time to track the dynamics of carbon emissions under real time reservoir operation computational fluid dynamic cfd modeling is becoming promising with the rapid development of numerical modeling it is possible to simulate spatiotemporal variations of reservoir environmental parameters under different hydrodynamic conditions wang et al 2021 park and lee 2002 burn and elnur 2002 kim et al 2017 particularly several numerical simulation software are becoming technically mature and could achieve reliable results alosairi and alsulaiman 2019 used the delft3d model to predict the transport of pollutants and dissolved oxygen under the combined action of tide climate and water density gao et al 2018 applied the efdc model to simulate the water quality and water age of xiangxi river bay in the three gorges reservoir nguyen et al 2019 used the mike11 model to simulate water quality variables such as chemical oxygen demand dissolved oxygen in the saigon dong nai river these efforts provide references for us to explore hydrodynamic conditions air water transfer and carbon emissions estimation under real time reservoir operation in this paper we proposed a novel method to estimate reservoir gross carbon emissions under real time reservoir operation the model assumed that air water mass transfer was primarily regulated by surface turbulence and disregarded contributions from biogeochemical processes as well as seasonality of meteorological parameters i e wind speed and direction air temperature using this method we elaborated the potential influence of reservoir operation as inflow outflow and reservoir depth on carbon emissions disregarding the influences of biogeochemical processes and variations of meteorological parameters the xiangjiaba reservoir xjb a river valley dammed reservoir in the upper yangtze river was selected as a case study according to the topographical model of the reservoir the carbon emissions throughout the year under real time reservoir operation were estimated by integrating the flux in each discrete cell over time under its cfd model we hope to provide a new tool for exploring the influence of reservoir operation such as variable reservoir flow and water depth on carbon emissions and improve the spatiotemporal resolution of reservoir carbon emissions estimation 2 materials and methods 2 1 modeling framework and assumptions the process of air water gas transfer is the determinant in reservoir carbon emissions estimation zhang et al 2021 in general both gas transfer velocity and gas concentration in water phase are all the critical variables regulating the air water transfer however we assumed here that physical processes especially water surface turbulence were the primary determinant that regulated air water gas transfer although biogeochemical processes in water column e g primary production degradation of organic carbon may also impact the concentrations of co2 and ch4 in surface water surface turbulence is structured by the wind speed heat flux wave characteristics and water flow and the impacts of surface turbulence characteristics are often considered as a driving factor in gas exchange research kitaigorodskii et al 1983 imberger 1985 agrawal et al 1992 this assumption was based on the recognition that short term physical control of air water gas transfer might be more significant than biological processes in water column duvert et al 2018 in addition this assumption would allow us to focus on the real time reservoir operation particularly the influence of reservoir hydrodynamic parameters on carbon emissions the effect of real time reservoir operation was reflected in the reservoir hydrodynamic conditions the hydrodynamic conditions e g flow velocity turbulent kinetic energy turbulent dissipation rate etc were simulated based on the pisofoam solver on the open source platform openfoam v6 0 openfoam foundation uk the rigid lid assumption for multiphase flow and the standard k ε model for turbulence was used the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm coupled the pressure and velocity in the reynolds average navier stokes rans simulation method central schemes were preferred consider that the continuity equation and momentum equation can be expressed as follows 1 u 0 2 u t

and c 2 are model constants based on the hydrodynamic simulation the equation between hydrodynamic parameters and air water mass transfer velocity was established the transfer velocity k directly determines the magnitude of the air water gas flux raymond and cole 2001 wallin et al 2011 to scale and compare k between ghgs and temperatures t k can be normalized to a schmidt number sc of 600 referred to as k 600 5 k 600 k 600 s c ghg n where n ranges from 2 3 rigid surface to 1 2 free surface sc of co2 and ch4 can be calculated by temperature t as wanninkhof 1992 6 s c co 2 1911 1 118 11

k 600 in a lake with sulfur hexafluoride sf6 and proposed the following empirical equation between k 600 and wind velocity u 10 8 k 600 2 07 0 215 u 10 1 7 to explore the influence of hydrodynamic conditions on reservoir carbon emissions the relationship between the wind speed and the transfer velocity turbulence and the transfer velocity was assessed and converted based on a calibrated small eddy model k 600 can be calculated with the near surface turbulent dissipation rate as following vachon et al 2010 read et al 2012 9 k 600 s c 1 2 ε ν k 1 4 therefore the turbulent dissipation rate ε and gas transfer velocity k 600 of the reservoir surface could be estimated through the numerical simulation with turbulent parameter the gas flux f w across the air water interface acted on free surface boundary can be expressed as follows 10 f w k c c a where c a is the concentration of a given ghg under atmospheric pressure c is the ghg concentration in water the real time reservoir operation caused varying hydrodynamic conditions accordingly which could impact the mass transfer velocity on the reservoir water surface a method of differential cells in cfd was applied the water surface was divided with the differential cells the air water mass transfer velocity of each cell was simulated by the hydrodynamics model coupled with mass transfer velocity equation eq 9 the ghgs concentration for each cell was from the interpolation of on site measurement results as fig 1 concerning the entire water surface area of the reservoir carbon emissions j r can be defined as the integration of the flux in each cell over time j cell t 11 j r time domain j cell t time domain k c c a cell t considering the ghgs concentration was derived from the on site measurement results the value of mass transfer velocity had the decisive effect on carbon emissions estimation in this study thus it was necessary to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions accurately in the reservoir in order to validate the hydrodynamics model a water flume in laboratory was used to validate the model as text s1 comparing with the measured velocity of the cross section the average relative error of flow velocity was 1 73 the modeling result indicated this model matched the hydrodynamic conditions well 2 2 model comparations here we compared our modeling approach with the conventional method and our previous study huang et al 2022 in the conventional method ghg concentration and wind speed were frequently measured with a few scattered sampling sites as representativeness based on the thin boundary layer tbl method the carbon emissions of the whole reservoir area were estimated with the average flux of these sampling sites thus the amount and location of the sampling sites and the measured time point were decisive to the results of carbon emissions estimation in huang et al 2022 an improved method by integrating the flux in each discrete cell was proposed it conducted the higher resolution estimations in space compared with the conventional method but did not improve carbon emissions estimation over time i e real time level on this basis the carbon emissions estimation model in this study further considered the influence of real time reservoir operation based on the integration of the flux in each cell carbon emissions under different hydrodynamic conditions were estimated under the real time reservoir operation thus the emission results were not decided by the measured time point but reflected the relative hydrodynamic conditions for different time with higher temporal spatial resolution 2 3 site description and sampling campaigns the xiangjiaba reservoir located in the jinsha river was selected as the case in our study the jinsha river is the main stem of the upper yangtze river it has abundant water energy resources four cascade hydropower projects i e wudongde 10200 mw baihetan 16000 mw xiluodu 12600 mw and xiangjiaba 6400 mw have been operated in the lower reaches of the jinsha river fig 2 the xjb is the last cascade reservoir of the above cascade system the construction of the xjb started in november 2006 and the initial impoundment was in october 2012 the length of the xjb reservoir exceeds 150 km and the normal water level is 380 0 m above sea level with a total storage capacity of 5 16 km3 as the lowest reservoir in the cascade reservoir system the reservoir operation of the xjb is affected by the combined operation of the upstream reservoirs the daily variations in the water level and flow rate from january 1 2018 to january 31 2019 in the xjb are shown in fig 2 the xjb operation entered the water supply period from january and the flood season from july to september accordingly the reservoir outflow rate and inflow rate increased from july to september while they remained at a relatively low level in other months of the year under the combined operation of the upstream reservoirs the water level in the xjb varied between approximately 370 and 380 m above the sea level from july to september the hydraulic residence time of xjb was the shortest with an average of 6 5 days in other months of the year the hydraulic residence time fluctuated greatly and was relatively extended with an average of 22 1 days fig s4 field observations were conducted bimonthly from january 1 2018 to january 31 2019 zhang et al 2022 ten sampling sites p1 to p10 in the middle of the river and on the water surface along longitudinal gradients were established as shown in fig 3 the water temperature wind speed co2 and ch4 concentrations in both the water and air were measured the water temperature was monitored with an exo2 multiparameter sonde ysi inc oh usa with a precision of 0 01 c the wind speed was measured by an anemograph with a precision of 0 1 m s the co2 and ch4 concentrations were detected via the headspace technique water sample was collected by a 300 ml polypropylene syringe barrel and sealed underwater by its matching piston surplus water and possible air were ejected out carefully until the water sampling was 200 ml in the syringe then 100 ml of highly purified nitrogen was injected into the same syringe ghgs concentration in water and inert gas can reach the equilibrium states through intensive mixing for about 2 min then 100 ml gas mixture was injected into pre purified air sampling bag 0 3 l hede tech dalian china and detected by picarro g2201 i for ghgs concentration for air sample 100 ml of air was collected by polypropylene syringe and injected into pre purified air sampling bags then detected by picarro g2201 i for ghgs concentration more details about the field observation campaigns were provided in table 1 fig s5 fig s6 and fig s7 2 4 conditions for simulation set up the measured cases in the table 1 were simulated with the hydrodynamics model the measuring time of these cases covered a whole year with different seasons wind speeds flow rates and water levels the flow ranged from 2137 5 to 11300 m3 s and the water level ranged from 371 61 to 377 16 m almost including the maximum and minimum flow rate and water level in the year which was representative to a certain extent thus the mass transfer velocity equation could be proposed by the simulated hydrodynamic results of these cases under the daily hydrodynamics simulation the mass transfer velocity was calculated and carbon emissions were estimated the turbulent dissipation rate ε including the coupling effect of wind and current was calculated in the model and the mass transfer velocity k 600 was calculated with the eq 8 it was assumed that the wind direction was along the water flow direction based on the result of turbulent dissipation and mass transfer velocity of sampling sites in each sampling campaign it could structure an equation between the mass transfer velocity and the turbulent dissipation shown in eq 9 then carbon emissions could be estimated under the real time reservoir operation in 2018 the mass transfer velocity k 600 for each cell was calculated by the simulated turbulent dissipation rate ε and the ghgs concentration for the cell was the measured result of the sampling site which was the nearest the daily ghgs concentration was also interpolated by the measured result the daily ghgs concentration was the measured result closed to sampling time for carbon emissions estimation the average temperature in the year was used it was considered the carbon emissions were affected by the reservoir operation thus the wind speed was not involved in the estimation the entire xjb reservoir was selected as the simulation area with different reservoir operations and a topographical digital model with the real size of the xjb is showed in fig 3 to balance the computational efficiency channel meandering was not considered in the topographical modeling the modeling area of the xjb reservoir was divided into 10 m 10 m 10 m grids a uniform velocity profile was imposed at the inflow and a zero gradient for velocity was used at the outflow the boundary condition at the top of the computational domain was represented as the wind effect a no slip condition was set on the walls of the topographical digital model including the river bottom and bank 3 results 3 1 air water mass transfer velocity the cases in table 1 were simulated with the model based on the hydrodynamics model the results of flow velocity were shown in fig 4 the flow velocity on water surface was the combined effects of reservoir operation and the wind speed due to the effect of wind on the water surface the velocity on water surface was higher than that in other area the water depth increased from approximately 10 m to 115 m along the downstream direction in the reservoir area resulting a significant decrease of the flow velocity as fig 4 shows the flow velocity near the bottom of reservoir at the dam site was less than 0 3 m s while the upstream flow velocity could reach more than 3 m s for the sampling sites the turbulent dissipation rate ε was also impacted by reservoir operation and wind speed eq 8 was applied to calculate k 600 at the sampling sites during the dry season with low flow velocity since this equation was proposed for lakes with a low flow velocity linear regression with a forced zero intercept was performed on the sampling site data including k 600 and ε fig 5 shows the relationship between transfer velocity k 600 and sc 1 2 εν k 1 4 and the following equation can be obtained 12 k 600 0 0242 s c 1 2 ε ν k 1 4 this equation can be used to calculate the mass transfer velocity based on the turbulent conditions on the water surface of the reservoir which provides the foundation for the estimation of carbon emissions under real time reservoir operation 3 2 air water fluxes of co2 and ch4 based on daily reservoir operation in xjb throughout 2018 365 cases with varying hydraulic conditions were simulated to estimate the carbon fluxes the arithmetical mean fluxes of the whole reservoir were showed in fig 6 the results indicated that the reservoir was a carbon source under all hydrodynamic conditions the co2 and ch4 fluxes were in the low level during the low flow rate and high water level for co2 the minimum flux reached approximately 1 74 mmol m2 d and the minimum results of ch4 flux was 0 0047 mmol m2 d the flux was in the high level during the high flow rate and low water level the maximum fluxes of co2 and ch4 were 16 09 mmol m2 d and 0 022 mmol m2 d respectively 3 3 estimation of gross carbon emissions based on the integration of carbon flux and water surface area fig s8 the daily co2 and ch4 emissions in 2018 under reservoir operation are shown in fig 7 the seasonal trend of the carbon emissions was in consistent with flux the emissions of these two ghgs during the flood period were significantly higher than those during the dry period the co2 emission in the year varied accordingly the maximum and minimum daily co2 emission were 54 5 mg on august 15 and 2 99 mg on april 5 respectively the estimated maximum and minimum daily emission of ch4 were 0 035 mg on august 15 and 0 007 mg on january 1 respectively the annual co2 emission was evidently higher than that of ch4 the gross co2 and ch4 emissions in 2018 were approximately 6 7 gg co2 and 5 6 mg ch4 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 comparisons among different methods fig 6 shows the co2 and ch4 fluxes calculated with the methods developed in this study and conventional method respectively it can be seen that the flux in the whole reservoir calculated by a large number of differential cells were different with the average flux of several sampling sites fig 7 shows the co2 and ch4 emissions estimation in 2018 obtained with the methods developed in this study method discussed in huang et al 2022 and conventional method the carbon emissions estimation model in this study further considered the important influence of real time reservoir operation including changes in reservoir flow and water level but the method with huang et al 2022 and conventional method could estimate carbon emissions over a certain period of time the gross co2 and ch4 emissions in 2018 with conventional method were 7 6 gg co2 and 4 7 mg ch4 respectively the gross co2 and ch4 emissions in 2018 with huang et al 2022 were approximately 6 3 gg co2 and 5 5 mg ch4 respectively for conventional method the spatiotemporal arithmetical mean of estimation results was calculated as the emissions for the whole reservoir the method of huang et al 2022 considered the spatial resolution but didn t consider the hydrodynamic condition varied with time the carbon emissions estimation model in this study further considered the important influence of real time reservoir operation carbon emissions under different hydrodynamic conditions were calculated respectively under the real time reservoir operation which improved the temporal spatial resolution 4 2 effect of reservoir operation on carbon emissions to explore the effect of reservoir operation on carbon emissions the distribution of daily average mass transfer velocity with corresponding inflow rate outflow rate and average water depth in the xjb was shown in fig 8 the average transfer velocity was calculated by dividing the daily estimated flux by the mean of daily air water ghg concentration differences it showed that water level and discharge regulated by reservoir operation impacted the mass transfer velocity in particular due to the small variation of water level in xjb the influence of flow rate on mass transfer velocity was more significant when the inflow and outflow increased the average mass transfer velocity increased with increasing flow rate the flow velocity and turbulence in the reservoir area tended to increase resulting in an increase in the transfer velocity and the increase of air water mass transfer velocity would increase the carbon emissions this could also explain the high carbon emissions in the reservoir during the summer flood season fig s9 shows linear relationship between the daily average mass transfer velocity and the inflow rate outflow rate and average water depth in the xjb was established via fitting respectively r 2 of the linear fitting curve for water depth was merely 0 1 and 0 05 for co2 and ch4 respectively the correlation of the inflow rate and outflow rate on water turbulence in the reservoir was highly significant r 2 of the linear fitting curve with inflow rate was 0 61 and 0 49 for co2 and ch4 and 0 59 and 0 48 for outflow rate for co2 and ch4 respectively thus considering a reservoir under cascade operation when the water level variation is limited the effect of discharge on the carbon emissions in the reservoir is the primary factor 4 3 comparisons among other estimates fig 9 shows the co2 and ch4 flux results of other reservoirs around the world huttunen et al 2002 demarty et al 2011 gerardo nieto et al 2017 chanudet et al 2011 mosher et al 2015 huang et al 2015 dos santos et al 2006 guerin et al 2006 comparing the carbon emission fluxes from other global reservoirs or lakes in literature the flux results in this study were in a lower level most of these estimations of literature were calculated by the conventional method for the reservoirs with obvious changes in reservoir operation the method in this study can be applied to estimate carbon emissions so that the influence of the changes in hydrodynamic conditions can be involved and the estimated results with higher resolution can be obtained 4 4 effect of biogeochemical processes and meteorological variability this study focuses on the effects of hydrodynamics changes on carbon emissions caused by reservoir operation yet biogeochemical processes and meteorological variability also affect carbon emissions in the reservoir the influence of biogeochemical processes on carbon emissions is mainly reflected in the concentration of ghgs in water for instance photosynthesis could reduce the co2 concentration in surface water however elevation in trophic status could support formation of ch4 in water column natchimuthu and bastviken 2004 zhou et al 2020 both could evidently impact the concentration levels of co2 and ch4 in surface layer and in further affect air water transfer thus once the biogeochemical reactions of ghgs in water are included in the carbon emission estimation model uncertainties of the results will be significantly reduced reasonable estimates will be also obtained other than reservoir operation wind speed is another sensitive meteorological parameter that directly affect surface turbulence and carbon emissions in reservoir especially at the dam site when water velocity significantly reduced in our model the turbulent dissipation rate ε was used to describe the turbulence caused by wind and current then the relation between mass transfer velocity and ε was established thus when daily meteorological variability is incorporated into the model we will receive the estimates of carbon emissions that are greater than the stable condition since it is under the coupling effect of wind and current 4 5 limitations the accuracy of this method could decline when applied in an intensely turbulent system or water with high surface friction since wind conditions were not considered in the gross emission evaluation our next research could aim to determine the effect of wind conditions in various natural systems in addition factors such as the age geometry of reservoir power discharge and flooding discharge of the reservoir may impact emissions a more complicated model should be developed in the future in this paper the turbulent dissipation rate ε in water was obtained through hydrodynamics simulation and the mass transfer velocity under different wind speeds was calculated with the classical formula and then the relation between the mass transfer velocity and turbulent parameters was obtained through linear regression however the relation established with small eddy model is an empirical model the quantity and distribution of the data will affect the modeling results the carbon emissions estimation is based on this relation and the determination of this relation decides the value of mass transfer velocity under different reservoir operation conditions and affects the estimation of carbon emission accordingly thus future study will extend the regression model with inclusion of new data and reduce the potential uncertainties of the model the gas concentration in water phase is an important factor for the carbon emissions the interpolation of ghgs concentration caused the value of ghgs concentration incompatible with the real condition in which the biogeochemical processes in water column matters in addition the water surface was divided with a number of cells the ghg concentration for each cell was interpolated by the measurement results thus the different interpolation method will also impact the gas concentration distribution and the estimation results future study will try to take concentration changes into consideration including the diel dynamics of the fluxes 5 conclusion a reservoir carbon emissions estimation method was developed with the hydrodynamics model this method achieved an improved estimation resolution regarding the emissions of the entire reservoir by integrating the flux in thousands of discrete cells over time through numerical simulation the gross co2 and ch4 emissions in the xjb reservoir in 2018 reached approximately 6 7 gg co2 and 5 6 mg ch4 respectively in real time reservoir operation particularly in the cascade system reservoir discharge was the primary driven factor that impact its carbon emissions when water level variations were limited biogeochemical processes and meteorological parameters would be considered to upgrade the model in further study

14683,during the 2015 2016 zika virus zikv epidemic in the americas serological cross reactivity with other flaviviruses and relatively high costs of nucleic acid testing in the region hindered the capacity for widespread diagnostic testing in such cases where individual testing is not feasible wastewater monitoring approaches may offer a means of community level public health surveillance to inform such approaches we characterized the persistence and recovery of zikv rna in experiments where we spiked cultured zikv into surface water wastewater and a combination of both to examine the potential for detection in open sewers serving communities most affected by the zikv outbreak such as those in salvador bahia brazil we used reverse transcription droplet digital pcr to quantify zikv rna in our persistence experiments we found that the persistence of zikv rna decreased with increasing temperature significantly decreased in surface water versus wastewater and significantly decreased when the initial concentration of virus was lowered by one order of magnitude in our recovery experiments we found higher percent recovery of zikv rna in pellets versus supernatants from the same sample higher recoveries in pellets using skimmed milk flocculation lower recoveries of zikv rna in surface water versus wastewater and lower recoveries from a freeze thaw we also analyzed samples collected from salvador brazil during the zikv outbreak 2015 2016 that consisted of archived samples obtained from open sewers or environmental waters thought to be contaminated by sewage although we did not detect any zikv rna in the archived brazil samples results from these persistence and recovery experiments serve to inform future wastewater monitoring efforts in open sewers an understudied and important application of wastewater monitoring keywords zika virus wastewater based epidemiology resource constrained settings data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although zika virus zikv was first isolated in 1947 in africa the severe complications and sequelae of zikv infections did not become evident until more recent outbreaks in asia and the americas during 2007 to 2016 zikv infections are mostly asymptomatic and symptomatic cases often present with mild non specific symptoms like many other arboviruses circulating in tropical settings kuno 2016 musso and gubler 2016 however during the zikv 2015 2016 epidemic in the americas the emergence of increased numbers of babies born with microcephaly sequelae evidenced by increased reports of guillain barre syndrome and the first reported zikv associated deaths alarmed the public health community musso et al 2019 the increases in microcephaly cases were of particular concern leading the world health organization who to declare a public health emergency of international concern in 2016 challenges to widespread diagnosis of zikv infections hampered response to the outbreaks musso et al 2019 victora et al 2016 cross reactivity with other circulating flaviviruses is a key challenge complicating serological testing for zikv aubry et al 2015 duffy et al 2023 priyamvada et al 2016 while tests detecting nucleic acids can provide more definitive evidence of infection limited resources and relatively higher costs of nucleic acid testing reagents in latin america deterred widespread nucleic acid testing fischer et al 2018 thus surveillance during the outbreak largely relied on monitoring more severe complications associated with zikv infections cases of microcephaly other congenital anomalies and fetal loss lowe et al 2018 victora et al 2016 the dramatic emergence of zikv in the americas and lack of widespread diagnostic testing illustrate the need for approaches to monitor public health in communities when limited resources restrict individual testing wastewater monitoring or wastewater based epidemiology wbe potentially offers one such approach by leveraging existing wastewater collection networks to collect a composite sample from many individuals while recently employed to perform public health surveillance for viral infections including sars cov 2 infections karthikeyan et al 2021 wastewater monitoring has historically been used as a surveillance tool including for informing polio eradication efforts pogka et al 2017 associations between nucleic acid detection in wastewater and reported cases are also being investigated with the goal of predicting incident cases as a leading indicator of an outbreak brouwer et al 2018 gonzalez et al 2020 graham et al 2021 hellmér et al 2014 medema et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 tiwari et al 2022 wastewater monitoring is especially useful where most transmission is undetected by clinical surveillance including where cases are mainly asymptomatic or clinical data are limited by insufficient testing capacity zikv exhibits broad tropism in body tissues miner and diamond 2017 with potential to be shed into wastewater through saliva serum urine or feces bingham et al 2016 bôtto menezes et al 2019 gourinat et al 2015 concentrations of zikv in urine have been estimated to be up to 108 copies ml in infected humans lamb et al 2016 the potential for zikv to re emerge nolen 2022 the severe complications of zikv infections in those who are pregnant and the shedding of zikv in wastewater coalesce to make zikv a candidate target of wastewater monitoring approaches to date wastewater monitoring approaches have largely been focused on settings where conventional underground piped sewers are the prevalent form of sewerage in the context of the 2015 brazil zikv outbreak the communities that bore the higher burden of zikv infections were often communities classified as lower socioeconomic status which used open sewers netto et al 2017 open sewers are low cost sewer systems that rely on gravity driven ditches to convey wastewater but because they are open to the atmosphere they can accumulate rainfall surface run off surface water and wastewater for resource constrained settings which often lack conventional piped sewage networks knowledge is needed about how to implement and interpret wastewater monitoring basu et al 2022 understanding the persistence of zikv rna in open sewer like matrices will improve our ability to interpret monitoring results in settings where zikv is likely to emerge or re emerge our study aim was to examine the persistence and recovery of zikv rna in scenarios relevant to resource constrained settings under three main goals 1 characterize the persistence of zikv rna under experimental conditions relevant to resource constrained settings varying temperatures from 4 to 35 c varying matrices using surface water wastewater and a combined matrix of surface water and wastewater and varying initial concentrations 2 characterize the recovery of zikv rna in the pellet versus supernatant after centrifugation using skimmed milk flocculation a concentration method with appropriate characteristics for use in resource constrained settings with and without freeze thaw after concentration but before nucleic acid extraction and at varying inoculum concentrations 3 assay archived samples of environmental waters collected in salvador brazil during the 2015 2016 outbreak to determine if zikv rna could be recovered we used reverse transcription droplet digital pcr rt ddpcr to quantify zikv rna because of the advantages over reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr in analyzing environmental matrices cao et al 2015 staley et al 2018 and in monitoring pathogens in wastewater ahmed et al 2022 ciesielski et al 2021 additionally robust qpcr standard curves for rna viruses can be challenging to establish because the standard curve benefits when the standard curve template closely mimics the target template and because standard curves should be run often if not with every qpcr run bustin 2004 dpcr approaches do not require a standard curve for each quantification run further making dpcr an appealing tool for routine monitoring approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 zikv culture we obtained a frozen aliquot of zikv strain mex 1 44 generously shared by dr robert tesh through the world reference center for emerging viruses and arboviruses wrceva university of texas medical branch galveston tx we grew vero 76 cells atcc manassas va usa in high glucose dulbecco s modified eagle medium dmem containing 10 fetal bovine serum 4 mm glutamine 1 mm sodium pyruvate 1x nonessential amino acids and penicillin streptomycin solution at 100 u ml and 100 µg ml respectively we incubated vero 76 cells in the dmem at 37 c in 5 co2 to produce confluent monolayers within t175 flasks we cultured zikv by infecting the monolayers at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 0 1 the culture media was harvested and replaced with fresh media at 48 h after infection we then clarified the culture fluid by centrifugation and stored aliquots at 80 c we determined the infectivity titer by plaque assay on vero 76 cells to be on the order of 106 pfu ml this virus pool was used in all experiments in this study 2 2 wastewater and surface water sample collection we collected primary influent from a wastewater treatment plant receiving 40 million gallons per day or approximately 150 000 m3 per day in atlanta ga after collection we stored the wastewater at 4 c for no longer than seven days before use in persistence and concentration experiments we collected surface water from local streams or creeks that are monitored by the united states geological survey usgs in the city of atlanta we sampled within 8 12 h of rainfall targeting turbidity as measured through usgs gages above 100 ntu and frequently between 200 and 300 ntu we stored surface water at 4 c for up to 7 days prior to use 2 3 persistence experiments we conducted persistence experiments by spiking clarified zikv mex 1 44 culture fluid into a variety of matrices using two different levels of initial concentrations incubating the resulting microcosms at a variety of temperatures and sampling up to 28 days this study expands on the system originally developed in muirhead et al 2020 in the first persistence experiment we varied incubation temperature using 4 25 and 35 c and matrices using deionized di water non pasteurized surface water and non pasteurized wastewater table 1 we spiked zikv into separate microcosms of di water surface water and wastewater to achieve an initial concentration of 109 marker copies ml of matrix zikv cultured to 106 pfu ml and diluted 0 5 ml of cultured zikv into 4 5 ml of matrix for each matrix di water surface water and wastewater we created biological triplicate microcosms a b and c we did not agitate microcosms during incubation but vortexed each microcosm at maximum speed for 30 s before sampling for each time point we then sampled from the biological triplicates of each of the three matrices i e di water a b and c surface water a b and c wastewater a b and c at 0 1 3 7 14 21 and 28 days for a total of 189 samples we incubated the microcosms in the dark in incubators or a refrigerator to obtain the respective temperatures as zikv negative controls we incubated one microcosm of each matrix without zikv at each of the three temperatures for a total of nine biological negative microcosms and sampled from zikv negative microcosms at the same time intervals in the second persistence experiment we varied the initial concentration of zikv using initial concentrations of 108 or 109 zikv marker copies ml in non pasteurized primary influent and incubated at only 25 c in the dark and one zikv negative biological replicate sampled for 28 days as described in the first experiment in the third persistence experiment we varied the matrix by using surface water wastewater and a combination of surface water and wastewater at an initial zikv concentration of 108 zikv marker copies ml we combined the surface water and wastewater at a mixing ratio of 50 volume to volume and incubated at 25 c in the dark over 28 days we performed rna extractions directly from 200 µl of each of the persistence microcosms using the qiagen qiaamp minelute virus kit hilden germany according to the manufacturer s instructions and eluted using 50 µl of qiagen buffer ave hilden germany following elution we created duplicate 25 µl of each extract to minimize freeze thaw on individual samples which were stored at 20 c until analysis 6 months 2 4 experiments comparing concentration and extraction methods because the method used to concentrate the archived brazil samples see section 2 5 was intended for the analysis of bacteria leptospira and not viruses we performed experiments to help us interpret results from our analysis of the archived samples first we conducted viral rna recovery experiments comparing skimmed milk flocculation smf versus the centrifugation method used to concentrate the archived samples table 2 smf has been used to recover other viral rna from wastewaters poliovirus type 1 and sars cov 2 and is conducive to use in resource constrained settings because it can be completed in less than one day the reagent costs are low refrigeration is not always required and it requires only standard laboratory equipment calgua et al 2008 falman et al 2019 philo et al 2022 2021 we used a modified version of the method as described by falman et al 2019 briefly we performed skim milk flocculation by preparing 1 weight to volume solutions of skimmed milk we added 1 ml of the skimmed milk solution to 100 ml of each sample adjusted the ph to 3 4 using 5 m hcl and incubated on a rotating shaker at 25 c at 200 rpm for 2 h centrifuged for 30 min at 3500 x g at 4 c and carefully removed the supernatant via pipetting we vortexed the conical tube to loosen the pellet and recorded the volume if necessary we added a small amount 100 µl to 250ul of supernatant from the same sample to resuspend the pellet for the centrifugation method used to concentrate the archived samples we performed the concentration as described in section 2 5 second we compared the amount of zikv nucleic acid in the pellet versus the supernatant to understand the distribution of zikv rna in each phase because the archived samples contained only the pellet after the environmental water samples were centrifuged we compared recovery of zikv rna in the pellet versus the supernatant finally we explored the effect of a freeze thaw cycle after smf concentration but before nucleic acid extraction we spiked zikv into primary influent at two final concentrations of 105 and 107 zikv marker copies ml of wastewater using six biological replicates of each concentration we then performed smf and after concentration we stored three of the biological replicates at 4 c for 24 h and the other three biological replicates at 80 c for 72 h to ensure a complete freeze for the recovery experiments we compared two extraction kits the qiagen qiaamp minelute virus kit and the qiagen rneasy powermicrobiome kit hilden germany the powermicrobiome kit includes a bead beating step and consequently may be more effective at extracting zikv rna from solids rich matrices the minelute virus kit does not have a bead beating step and consequently may perform better when used with supernatant rather than pellet material the minelute virus kit also does not use beta mercaptoethanol a toxic reagent that requires careful disposal we used the minelute virus kit as described above in section 2 3 for the powermicrobiome kit we used 250 µl of sample followed the manufacturer s instructions and eluted in 50 µl of rnase free water following elution we created duplicate aliquots of 25 µl for each extract to minimize freeze thaws on individual aliquots and stored aliquots at 20 c until analysis 6 months in the concentration and recovery experiments we always extracted and analyzed rna from both the supernatant and pellet for each experimental treatment we calculated recoveries by quantifying zikv rna in aliquots of extracted zikv culture stock used to inoculate the microcosm or concentration samples we extracted using four biological replicates for each rna extraction kit used both powermicrobiome and rna mini kit and analyzed each of these eight total extractions using rt ddpcr we then averaged the stock concentrations for each extraction kit and multiplied the concentrations by the dilution factors we used for each experiment to obtain expected concentrations 2 5 analysis of environmental water samples from brazilian communities during the 2015 2016 zika virus epidemic we analyzed archived environmental water samples collected from various locations distributed through the community of pau de lima salvador brazil during the 2015 2016 epidemic these archived samples were collected at various sites and elevations representing various types of impacted open sewers and impacted surface waters in the community the samples were concentrated using methods intended for the analysis of leptospira riediger et al 2016 briefly 50 ml of water from either an open sewer or standing water nearby an open sewer was collected and stored at 4 c for up to 18 h before processing a 40 ml aliquot of each sample was centrifuged at 15 000 x g for 20 min at 4 c following centrifugation the supernatant was discarded and the resulting pellet no resuspension was archived at 80 c we extracted the archived samples using the qiagen rneasy powermicrobiome kit hilden germany based on the results of a pilot experiment data not shown in which we spiked zikv into simulated samples and found that the powermicrobiome kit yielded higher recoveries than the minelute virus kit we used the powermicrobiome kit according to the manufacturer s instructions spiking in 5 µl of bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv vaccine inforce 3 zoetis new jersey usa into each bead beating tube and eluting each sample using 50 µl of buffer ave following elution we created duplicate aliquots of 25 µl for each extract to minimize freeze thaws on individual aliquots and stored aliquots at 20 c until analysis 6 months 2 6 reverse transcription droplet digital pcr we used reverse transcription droplet digital pcr rt ddpcr to quantify zikv rna in this study a minimum information for publication of digital pcr experiments table is included in the supplementary information table s4 whale et al 2020 briefly we conducted rt ddpcr analyses using a bio rad qx200 droplet digital pcr system hercules ca usa and the zikv 5 utr assay targeting the 5 untranslated region of the zikv genome chan et al 2017 following initial testing between two assays zikv 5 utr assay and the zikv 5 assay lanciotti et al 2008 we proceeded with the zikv 5 utr assay because it contained 100 identity and 100 coverage matches when basic local alignment search tool blast searched against the mex 1 44 genome that we used to spike in our persistence and recovery experiments and other zikv genomes sequenced from the brazil 2015 2016 epidemic the rt ddpcr system consisted of a qx200 droplet reader c1000 touch thermal cycler with 96 deep well reaction module qx200 droplet generator and a px1 pcr plate sealer we performed droplet reading and data analysis using the qx200 droplet reader and bio rad quantasoft software version 1 7 4 0917 to determine the threshold between positive and negative droplets we calculated the halfway point between the peaks of the positive and negative droplets and set the threshold at that halfway point we ran no template controls ntcs consisting of uv treated 20 min molecular grade water all ntc wells were below the thresholds used to determine positive droplets we analyzed 25 of persistence samples in duplicates of 2 µl technical duplicates and analyzed 100 of brazil archived samples in duplicates of 5 µl we set analytical limits analyical limit of detection and analytical limit of quantification using approaches described previously zhu et al 2020 with dilutions of atcc quantitative zikv genomic rna vr 1843dq manassas va us in qiagen buffer ave hilden germany 2 7 data analysis we used the geeraerd and van impe inactivation model fitting tool ginafit geeraerd et al 2005 to fit models to our time series data comparing the fit of the different models using adjusted r2 values we found that a first order inactivation model with the following formulation fit best c t c 0 e k t within each persistence experiment we used z tests to compare rate constants k values between experimental treatments by assuming a normal distribution of k values brooks and field 2016 mattioli et al 2017 and used the standard error outputted from ginafit in calculating z values we conducted each z test for all nine possible combinations between biological triplicates for the two experimental treatments being compared hereafter referred to as pairwise comparisons brooks and field 2016 mattioli et al 2017 we considered results of hypothesis testing statistically significant at p 0 05 while using bonferroni correction due to comparisons across biological triplicates we completed z testing in microsoft excel version 2204 using ginafit we calculated k values standard errors and accompanying lower and upper 95 confidence intervals 1 96 standard error for each biological replicate in each persistence experiment as well as t90 values the number of sampling time points included in each decay model is listed in table s2 we also used a multilevel model with random effects to examine the relationship between the various conditions tested and concentrations of zikv rna in the persistence experiments we fitted parameters for day matrix type further sublevels include di water surface water wastewater and a combination of surface water and wastewater temperature further sublevels include 4 25 and 35 c while using 4 c as the reference category initial concentration further sublevels include 108 and 109 zikv marker copies ml of matrix and a random effects parameter we then standardized the parameters by dividing each parameter estimate by the standard error of the corresponding dataset to allow for comparison of the influence of each variable on concentrations of zikv rna we completed the multilevel modeling in sas 9 1 3 results 3 1 varying temperature and matrix persistence experiments of the three matrices we tested zikv rna signal was the most persistent in sterile di water fig 1 the k values calculated for the 4 and 25 c time series were close to zero mean of 0 02 and 0 01 days 1 respectively and were not significantly different from each other 4 versus 25 c table 3 s5 comparing zikv rna in di water at 25 versus 35 c k values at 35 c were significantly larger than those for 25 c mean of 0 07 versus 0 01 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons between the biological triplicates the zikv rna signal was the least persistent in surface water at 25 c the k values were significantly larger than k values at 4 c mean of 0 27 versus 0 08 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons between the biological triplicates comparing k values at 25 versus 35 c five out of nine pairwise comparisons showed that 35 c had significantly larger k values than those at 25 c mean of 0 46 versus 0 27 days 1 respectively at 25 c k values for surface water were significantly larger than k values for wastewater at 25 c mean of 0 27 versus 0 15 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons between biological triplicates zikv rna signal in wastewater exhibited significant differences between k values for all temperatures comparing the 4 to the 25 c k values increased from a mean of 0 04 to 0 15 days 1 respectively then comparing the 25 to the 35 c k values increased from a mean of 0 15 to 0 35 days 1 respectively 3 2 varying initial concentration persistence experiments we found most pairwise comparisons to have significantly higher k values from time series with an initial concentration of 108 zikv marker copies ml of wastewater than those from time series with an initial concentration of 109 zikv marker copies ml of wastewater mean of 0 31 versus 0 19 days 1 respectively table 4 s5 pairwise comparisons that did not yield a significant difference were from the b biological replicate for the 109 zikv marker copies ml time series which had a higher k value compared to its other biological replicates 0 24 days 1 compared to 0 17 and 0 16 days 1 3 3 combined surface water and wastewater in comparisons between surface waste and a combination of both waters we found again that surface water had significantly larger k values when compared to those from wastewater 0 56 versus 0 22 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons and when compared to those from the combined waters 0 56 versus 0 22 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons table 5 s7 k values from the combined waters time series were not significantly different from k values from the wastewater time series 0 22 versus 0 22 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons multilevel modeling suggested that of the variables tested in this study time had the biggest influence on zikv rna concentration as highlighted in the comparison of k values spike concentration and differing water types also influenced the persistence of the zikv rna signal table s3 3 4 concentration and extraction comparison experiments regardless of experimental conditions when comparing zikv rna recovery between pellet and supernatant pellets had a mean of 2 6 log10 higher recoveries with a minimum of 1 5 log10 difference and maximum of 5 2 log10 difference table s8 percent recoveries of zikv rna signal from direct extraction of the supernatant were consistently low throughout the recovery experiments with a mean of 0 025 ranged from a minimum of 0 not detected to a maximum of 0 15 table s8 pellet recovery using smf ranged from 5 to 50 depending on the experimental condition we found that recoveries were 84 to 97 lower in pellets generated from surface water than wastewater we also found that a freeze thaw negatively impacted zikv rna recoveries from wastewater at both 107 and 105 zikv marker copies ml of virus table 6 3 5 archived environmental water samples collected from the 2015 2016 brazil outbreak we did not detect zikv rna signal in any of the 73 archived samples we analyzed for each of these samples we detected a human specific fecal marker hcytb484 above quantifiable levels confirming that the samples contained human waste in addition we tested for inhibition of dna polymerase activity using an internal amplification control as part of the human associated fecal marker assay hf183 bacr287 and did not find evidence of any dna polymerase inhibition finally prior to extraction we spiked in bovine respiratory syncytial virus vaccine as an extraction control for a single stranded rna virus we detected brsv above quantifiable levels confirming that we successfully extracted rna from the archived samples 4 discussion 4 1 trends in persistence of zikv rna as seen in other studies investigating the persistence of detectable viral rna from enveloped rna viruses in wastewater ahmed et al 2020 bivins et al 2020 chandra et al 2021 muirhead et al 2020 the persistence of zikv rna signal decreased with increasing temperature chandra et al 2021 observed a steep increase in k values from 6 to 25 c followed by a much smaller increase from 25 to 37 c we observed a more linear increase in k values over the range of temperatures tested resulting in t90 values or the time needed for concentrations to decrease by 90 of the original concentration decreasing from 65 to 15 to 6 6 days respectively table s1 however our experiment with lower initial inoculum produced k values similar to the chandra et al 2021 as when we decreased the initial zikv concentration we observed a significantly larger k value and a corresponding decrease in the mean t90 value from 12 4 to 7 6 days 39 decrease of the matrices tested zikv rna persisted the longest in sterile di water an effect observed in similar studies casanova et al 2009 including di water in persistence experiments serves to confirm the effects of matrix on persistence rather than intrinsic degradation of the rna target and serves as a reference matrix for comparison from study to study pinon and vialette 2019 we found the persistence of zikv rna was consistently lower in surface water versus wastewater notably when we combined both surface water and wastewater the persistence of the combined waters was similar to that of wastewater than surface water as shown in other studies viral persistence may be influenced by factors such as aggregation of the virus young and sharp 1977 the presence of organic matter influence of the microbial population and differences in sediment type kline et al 2022 because open sewer environments are a mixture of surface waters and wastewater further exploration into the variability of zikv rna persistence within similar matrices may be crucial for estimating expected ranges of viral rna persistence during wastewater monitoring of open sewers 4 2 concentration and extraction comparison experiments we observed a substantial difference between mean recoveries from the pellet versus the supernatant with the concentration methods we examined these results suggest that zikv was preferentially separated through association with solids with or without the smf this solids association behavior agrees with observations for other enveloped viruses in wastewater graham et al 2021 ye et al 2016 these results highlight potential difficulties in interpreting wastewater monitoring results from open sewer like matrices versus less dilute matrices such as wastewater or fecal sludges smf resulted in a higher percent recovery of zikv rna from pellets than the centrifugation method the recoveries we observed for smf were similar to recoveries of the rna of other enveloped viruses from wastewater using smf philo et al 2022 2021 smf is a practical choice for a concentration method in resource constrained settings because it does not require difficult to obtain supplies or equipment when used to concentrate other enveloped viruses human coronavirus oc43 and sars cov 2 from wastewater smf was shown to yield higher mean recoveries than those of polyethylene glycol peg precipitation falman et al 2019 philo et al 2022 2021 recovery of zikv rna from samples with and without subjecting the samples prior to nucleic acid extraction to a freeze thaw were comparable but the effect of one freeze thaw cycle was more apparent at lower zikv concentrations table s8 we observed a smaller impact of a freeze thaw event than others possibly due to differences in detection efficiency by rt qpcr versus rt ddpcr robinson et al 2022 as well as differences in matrix simpson et al 2021 although recovery varied between extraction kits trends for the different experimental conditions tested remained constant between the two extraction kits with bead beating step resulting in higher viral rna concentrations recovered from pellets 4 3 archived environmental water samples collected from the 2015 2016 brazil outbreak although we did not detect zikv rna in any of the archived samples from brazil results from our controls suggest that our lack of detection was likely due to zikv rna not being present at detectable amounts in our samples rather than any of the following possibilities first concentrations of the human mtdna marker indicate that there was human waste in the samples at a level about one order of magnitude lower than those found in municipal wastewater samples from the us zhu et al 2020 if zikv rna was present in our samples it is possible that excretions of zikv due to infections in the area during this phase of the outbreak were too low for us to detect second we did not find any evidence of pcr inhibition when using an internal amplification control green et al 2014 a common concern with lack of detections in environmental samples is the presence of inhibitory compounds although we implemented an amplification control to assess pcr inhibition we did not implement an rna amplification control to assess rt reverse transcription inhibition third we were able to detect our extraction control bovine respiratory syncytial virus rna boxus et al 2005 at consistent concentration suggesting successful and consistent rna extraction and performance of the reverse transcription process while not conclusive the results from our controls provide some evidence that we did not detect zikv rna from the archived samples because it was not there in high enough quantities to be measured with the methods and storage conditions under which it was treated when comparing surface water versus wastewater in both the persistence and recovery experiments we observed lower persistence and more limited recovery in surface water future efforts in using smf to recover zikv rna from surface water could investigate adjusting conductivity gonzales gustavson et al 2017 to further improve recoveries these results suggest that surface water may be suboptimal as a matrix for wastewater monitoring approaches open sewers are a common and crucial form of wastewater conveyance in low to middle income countries lmics however open sewers are largely understudied in approaches for wastewater monitoring however because zikv endemic communities often rely on open sewers further investigation into if and how open sewers can be utilized as a sampling matrix to support wastewater monitoring approaches in the context of the limitations in persistence and recovery of zikv rna observed in this study based on results of this study exploration into how persistence and recovery vary with different ratios of surface water and wastewater could provide insight into variability in persistence and recovery signals due to factors such as different population densities or between dry and wet seasons 4 4 limitations to understand how persistence varies under controlled conditions persistence experiments attempt to replicate real scenarios using model systems and consequently should be interpreted with the limitations of the system in mind the difficulty in extracting generalizable knowledge from persistence experiments has been discussed korajkic et al 2019 we used zikv cultured from mammalian cells due to the difficulty in acquiring stool and urine from humans shedding zikv rna which may limit our ability to mimic the physical state in which virus particles are shed from humans aggregates of viral particles may influence the persistence of zikv particles young and sharp 1977 and consequently its rna evidence is accumulating for the role of simultaneous delivery of multiple virus particles to infect a cell for many viruses including zikv sexton et al 2021 furthermore because we quantified zikv rna harvested from a cell culture it is likely we included incomplete viral particles in our quantification including zikv genomic rna or sub genomic rna as highlighted in the difference between pfu and measured zikv rna marker concentration an initial concentration of virus so that the viral rna signal can be quantified over time is crucial for fitting a persistence model however such high initial concentrations are not likely to be encountered in realistic scenarios finally it is important to recognize that the waters used in these persistence and recovery experiments were collected from the united states and may differ in properties from waters collected in brazil further work exploring associations of water quality parameters turbidity organic matter etc on zikv rna persistence may yield further insight into under what conditions zikv persistence may be expected to vary 5 conclusions increasing temperature reduced persistence of zikv rna in surface water and wastewater surface water versus wastewater was an important predictor of reduced zikv rna persistence lowering the initial virus concentration from 109 to 108 zikv marker copies ml significantly reduced zikv rna persistence zikv rna percent recoveries using skim milk flocculation and centrifugation methods were lower in surface water than those in wastewater results from testing skimmed milk flocculation

14683,during the 2015 2016 zika virus zikv epidemic in the americas serological cross reactivity with other flaviviruses and relatively high costs of nucleic acid testing in the region hindered the capacity for widespread diagnostic testing in such cases where individual testing is not feasible wastewater monitoring approaches may offer a means of community level public health surveillance to inform such approaches we characterized the persistence and recovery of zikv rna in experiments where we spiked cultured zikv into surface water wastewater and a combination of both to examine the potential for detection in open sewers serving communities most affected by the zikv outbreak such as those in salvador bahia brazil we used reverse transcription droplet digital pcr to quantify zikv rna in our persistence experiments we found that the persistence of zikv rna decreased with increasing temperature significantly decreased in surface water versus wastewater and significantly decreased when the initial concentration of virus was lowered by one order of magnitude in our recovery experiments we found higher percent recovery of zikv rna in pellets versus supernatants from the same sample higher recoveries in pellets using skimmed milk flocculation lower recoveries of zikv rna in surface water versus wastewater and lower recoveries from a freeze thaw we also analyzed samples collected from salvador brazil during the zikv outbreak 2015 2016 that consisted of archived samples obtained from open sewers or environmental waters thought to be contaminated by sewage although we did not detect any zikv rna in the archived brazil samples results from these persistence and recovery experiments serve to inform future wastewater monitoring efforts in open sewers an understudied and important application of wastewater monitoring keywords zika virus wastewater based epidemiology resource constrained settings data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although zika virus zikv was first isolated in 1947 in africa the severe complications and sequelae of zikv infections did not become evident until more recent outbreaks in asia and the americas during 2007 to 2016 zikv infections are mostly asymptomatic and symptomatic cases often present with mild non specific symptoms like many other arboviruses circulating in tropical settings kuno 2016 musso and gubler 2016 however during the zikv 2015 2016 epidemic in the americas the emergence of increased numbers of babies born with microcephaly sequelae evidenced by increased reports of guillain barre syndrome and the first reported zikv associated deaths alarmed the public health community musso et al 2019 the increases in microcephaly cases were of particular concern leading the world health organization who to declare a public health emergency of international concern in 2016 challenges to widespread diagnosis of zikv infections hampered response to the outbreaks musso et al 2019 victora et al 2016 cross reactivity with other circulating flaviviruses is a key challenge complicating serological testing for zikv aubry et al 2015 duffy et al 2023 priyamvada et al 2016 while tests detecting nucleic acids can provide more definitive evidence of infection limited resources and relatively higher costs of nucleic acid testing reagents in latin america deterred widespread nucleic acid testing fischer et al 2018 thus surveillance during the outbreak largely relied on monitoring more severe complications associated with zikv infections cases of microcephaly other congenital anomalies and fetal loss lowe et al 2018 victora et al 2016 the dramatic emergence of zikv in the americas and lack of widespread diagnostic testing illustrate the need for approaches to monitor public health in communities when limited resources restrict individual testing wastewater monitoring or wastewater based epidemiology wbe potentially offers one such approach by leveraging existing wastewater collection networks to collect a composite sample from many individuals while recently employed to perform public health surveillance for viral infections including sars cov 2 infections karthikeyan et al 2021 wastewater monitoring has historically been used as a surveillance tool including for informing polio eradication efforts pogka et al 2017 associations between nucleic acid detection in wastewater and reported cases are also being investigated with the goal of predicting incident cases as a leading indicator of an outbreak brouwer et al 2018 gonzalez et al 2020 graham et al 2021 hellmér et al 2014 medema et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 tiwari et al 2022 wastewater monitoring is especially useful where most transmission is undetected by clinical surveillance including where cases are mainly asymptomatic or clinical data are limited by insufficient testing capacity zikv exhibits broad tropism in body tissues miner and diamond 2017 with potential to be shed into wastewater through saliva serum urine or feces bingham et al 2016 bôtto menezes et al 2019 gourinat et al 2015 concentrations of zikv in urine have been estimated to be up to 108 copies ml in infected humans lamb et al 2016 the potential for zikv to re emerge nolen 2022 the severe complications of zikv infections in those who are pregnant and the shedding of zikv in wastewater coalesce to make zikv a candidate target of wastewater monitoring approaches to date wastewater monitoring approaches have largely been focused on settings where conventional underground piped sewers are the prevalent form of sewerage in the context of the 2015 brazil zikv outbreak the communities that bore the higher burden of zikv infections were often communities classified as lower socioeconomic status which used open sewers netto et al 2017 open sewers are low cost sewer systems that rely on gravity driven ditches to convey wastewater but because they are open to the atmosphere they can accumulate rainfall surface run off surface water and wastewater for resource constrained settings which often lack conventional piped sewage networks knowledge is needed about how to implement and interpret wastewater monitoring basu et al 2022 understanding the persistence of zikv rna in open sewer like matrices will improve our ability to interpret monitoring results in settings where zikv is likely to emerge or re emerge our study aim was to examine the persistence and recovery of zikv rna in scenarios relevant to resource constrained settings under three main goals 1 characterize the persistence of zikv rna under experimental conditions relevant to resource constrained settings varying temperatures from 4 to 35 c varying matrices using surface water wastewater and a combined matrix of surface water and wastewater and varying initial concentrations 2 characterize the recovery of zikv rna in the pellet versus supernatant after centrifugation using skimmed milk flocculation a concentration method with appropriate characteristics for use in resource constrained settings with and without freeze thaw after concentration but before nucleic acid extraction and at varying inoculum concentrations 3 assay archived samples of environmental waters collected in salvador brazil during the 2015 2016 outbreak to determine if zikv rna could be recovered we used reverse transcription droplet digital pcr rt ddpcr to quantify zikv rna because of the advantages over reverse transcription quantitative pcr rt qpcr in analyzing environmental matrices cao et al 2015 staley et al 2018 and in monitoring pathogens in wastewater ahmed et al 2022 ciesielski et al 2021 additionally robust qpcr standard curves for rna viruses can be challenging to establish because the standard curve benefits when the standard curve template closely mimics the target template and because standard curves should be run often if not with every qpcr run bustin 2004 dpcr approaches do not require a standard curve for each quantification run further making dpcr an appealing tool for routine monitoring approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 zikv culture we obtained a frozen aliquot of zikv strain mex 1 44 generously shared by dr robert tesh through the world reference center for emerging viruses and arboviruses wrceva university of texas medical branch galveston tx we grew vero 76 cells atcc manassas va usa in high glucose dulbecco s modified eagle medium dmem containing 10 fetal bovine serum 4 mm glutamine 1 mm sodium pyruvate 1x nonessential amino acids and penicillin streptomycin solution at 100 u ml and 100 µg ml respectively we incubated vero 76 cells in the dmem at 37 c in 5 co2 to produce confluent monolayers within t175 flasks we cultured zikv by infecting the monolayers at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 0 1 the culture media was harvested and replaced with fresh media at 48 h after infection we then clarified the culture fluid by centrifugation and stored aliquots at 80 c we determined the infectivity titer by plaque assay on vero 76 cells to be on the order of 106 pfu ml this virus pool was used in all experiments in this study 2 2 wastewater and surface water sample collection we collected primary influent from a wastewater treatment plant receiving 40 million gallons per day or approximately 150 000 m3 per day in atlanta ga after collection we stored the wastewater at 4 c for no longer than seven days before use in persistence and concentration experiments we collected surface water from local streams or creeks that are monitored by the united states geological survey usgs in the city of atlanta we sampled within 8 12 h of rainfall targeting turbidity as measured through usgs gages above 100 ntu and frequently between 200 and 300 ntu we stored surface water at 4 c for up to 7 days prior to use 2 3 persistence experiments we conducted persistence experiments by spiking clarified zikv mex 1 44 culture fluid into a variety of matrices using two different levels of initial concentrations incubating the resulting microcosms at a variety of temperatures and sampling up to 28 days this study expands on the system originally developed in muirhead et al 2020 in the first persistence experiment we varied incubation temperature using 4 25 and 35 c and matrices using deionized di water non pasteurized surface water and non pasteurized wastewater table 1 we spiked zikv into separate microcosms of di water surface water and wastewater to achieve an initial concentration of 109 marker copies ml of matrix zikv cultured to 106 pfu ml and diluted 0 5 ml of cultured zikv into 4 5 ml of matrix for each matrix di water surface water and wastewater we created biological triplicate microcosms a b and c we did not agitate microcosms during incubation but vortexed each microcosm at maximum speed for 30 s before sampling for each time point we then sampled from the biological triplicates of each of the three matrices i e di water a b and c surface water a b and c wastewater a b and c at 0 1 3 7 14 21 and 28 days for a total of 189 samples we incubated the microcosms in the dark in incubators or a refrigerator to obtain the respective temperatures as zikv negative controls we incubated one microcosm of each matrix without zikv at each of the three temperatures for a total of nine biological negative microcosms and sampled from zikv negative microcosms at the same time intervals in the second persistence experiment we varied the initial concentration of zikv using initial concentrations of 108 or 109 zikv marker copies ml in non pasteurized primary influent and incubated at only 25 c in the dark and one zikv negative biological replicate sampled for 28 days as described in the first experiment in the third persistence experiment we varied the matrix by using surface water wastewater and a combination of surface water and wastewater at an initial zikv concentration of 108 zikv marker copies ml we combined the surface water and wastewater at a mixing ratio of 50 volume to volume and incubated at 25 c in the dark over 28 days we performed rna extractions directly from 200 µl of each of the persistence microcosms using the qiagen qiaamp minelute virus kit hilden germany according to the manufacturer s instructions and eluted using 50 µl of qiagen buffer ave hilden germany following elution we created duplicate 25 µl of each extract to minimize freeze thaw on individual samples which were stored at 20 c until analysis 6 months 2 4 experiments comparing concentration and extraction methods because the method used to concentrate the archived brazil samples see section 2 5 was intended for the analysis of bacteria leptospira and not viruses we performed experiments to help us interpret results from our analysis of the archived samples first we conducted viral rna recovery experiments comparing skimmed milk flocculation smf versus the centrifugation method used to concentrate the archived samples table 2 smf has been used to recover other viral rna from wastewaters poliovirus type 1 and sars cov 2 and is conducive to use in resource constrained settings because it can be completed in less than one day the reagent costs are low refrigeration is not always required and it requires only standard laboratory equipment calgua et al 2008 falman et al 2019 philo et al 2022 2021 we used a modified version of the method as described by falman et al 2019 briefly we performed skim milk flocculation by preparing 1 weight to volume solutions of skimmed milk we added 1 ml of the skimmed milk solution to 100 ml of each sample adjusted the ph to 3 4 using 5 m hcl and incubated on a rotating shaker at 25 c at 200 rpm for 2 h centrifuged for 30 min at 3500 x g at 4 c and carefully removed the supernatant via pipetting we vortexed the conical tube to loosen the pellet and recorded the volume if necessary we added a small amount 100 µl to 250ul of supernatant from the same sample to resuspend the pellet for the centrifugation method used to concentrate the archived samples we performed the concentration as described in section 2 5 second we compared the amount of zikv nucleic acid in the pellet versus the supernatant to understand the distribution of zikv rna in each phase because the archived samples contained only the pellet after the environmental water samples were centrifuged we compared recovery of zikv rna in the pellet versus the supernatant finally we explored the effect of a freeze thaw cycle after smf concentration but before nucleic acid extraction we spiked zikv into primary influent at two final concentrations of 105 and 107 zikv marker copies ml of wastewater using six biological replicates of each concentration we then performed smf and after concentration we stored three of the biological replicates at 4 c for 24 h and the other three biological replicates at 80 c for 72 h to ensure a complete freeze for the recovery experiments we compared two extraction kits the qiagen qiaamp minelute virus kit and the qiagen rneasy powermicrobiome kit hilden germany the powermicrobiome kit includes a bead beating step and consequently may be more effective at extracting zikv rna from solids rich matrices the minelute virus kit does not have a bead beating step and consequently may perform better when used with supernatant rather than pellet material the minelute virus kit also does not use beta mercaptoethanol a toxic reagent that requires careful disposal we used the minelute virus kit as described above in section 2 3 for the powermicrobiome kit we used 250 µl of sample followed the manufacturer s instructions and eluted in 50 µl of rnase free water following elution we created duplicate aliquots of 25 µl for each extract to minimize freeze thaws on individual aliquots and stored aliquots at 20 c until analysis 6 months in the concentration and recovery experiments we always extracted and analyzed rna from both the supernatant and pellet for each experimental treatment we calculated recoveries by quantifying zikv rna in aliquots of extracted zikv culture stock used to inoculate the microcosm or concentration samples we extracted using four biological replicates for each rna extraction kit used both powermicrobiome and rna mini kit and analyzed each of these eight total extractions using rt ddpcr we then averaged the stock concentrations for each extraction kit and multiplied the concentrations by the dilution factors we used for each experiment to obtain expected concentrations 2 5 analysis of environmental water samples from brazilian communities during the 2015 2016 zika virus epidemic we analyzed archived environmental water samples collected from various locations distributed through the community of pau de lima salvador brazil during the 2015 2016 epidemic these archived samples were collected at various sites and elevations representing various types of impacted open sewers and impacted surface waters in the community the samples were concentrated using methods intended for the analysis of leptospira riediger et al 2016 briefly 50 ml of water from either an open sewer or standing water nearby an open sewer was collected and stored at 4 c for up to 18 h before processing a 40 ml aliquot of each sample was centrifuged at 15 000 x g for 20 min at 4 c following centrifugation the supernatant was discarded and the resulting pellet no resuspension was archived at 80 c we extracted the archived samples using the qiagen rneasy powermicrobiome kit hilden germany based on the results of a pilot experiment data not shown in which we spiked zikv into simulated samples and found that the powermicrobiome kit yielded higher recoveries than the minelute virus kit we used the powermicrobiome kit according to the manufacturer s instructions spiking in 5 µl of bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv vaccine inforce 3 zoetis new jersey usa into each bead beating tube and eluting each sample using 50 µl of buffer ave following elution we created duplicate aliquots of 25 µl for each extract to minimize freeze thaws on individual aliquots and stored aliquots at 20 c until analysis 6 months 2 6 reverse transcription droplet digital pcr we used reverse transcription droplet digital pcr rt ddpcr to quantify zikv rna in this study a minimum information for publication of digital pcr experiments table is included in the supplementary information table s4 whale et al 2020 briefly we conducted rt ddpcr analyses using a bio rad qx200 droplet digital pcr system hercules ca usa and the zikv 5 utr assay targeting the 5 untranslated region of the zikv genome chan et al 2017 following initial testing between two assays zikv 5 utr assay and the zikv 5 assay lanciotti et al 2008 we proceeded with the zikv 5 utr assay because it contained 100 identity and 100 coverage matches when basic local alignment search tool blast searched against the mex 1 44 genome that we used to spike in our persistence and recovery experiments and other zikv genomes sequenced from the brazil 2015 2016 epidemic the rt ddpcr system consisted of a qx200 droplet reader c1000 touch thermal cycler with 96 deep well reaction module qx200 droplet generator and a px1 pcr plate sealer we performed droplet reading and data analysis using the qx200 droplet reader and bio rad quantasoft software version 1 7 4 0917 to determine the threshold between positive and negative droplets we calculated the halfway point between the peaks of the positive and negative droplets and set the threshold at that halfway point we ran no template controls ntcs consisting of uv treated 20 min molecular grade water all ntc wells were below the thresholds used to determine positive droplets we analyzed 25 of persistence samples in duplicates of 2 µl technical duplicates and analyzed 100 of brazil archived samples in duplicates of 5 µl we set analytical limits analyical limit of detection and analytical limit of quantification using approaches described previously zhu et al 2020 with dilutions of atcc quantitative zikv genomic rna vr 1843dq manassas va us in qiagen buffer ave hilden germany 2 7 data analysis we used the geeraerd and van impe inactivation model fitting tool ginafit geeraerd et al 2005 to fit models to our time series data comparing the fit of the different models using adjusted r2 values we found that a first order inactivation model with the following formulation fit best c t c 0 e k t within each persistence experiment we used z tests to compare rate constants k values between experimental treatments by assuming a normal distribution of k values brooks and field 2016 mattioli et al 2017 and used the standard error outputted from ginafit in calculating z values we conducted each z test for all nine possible combinations between biological triplicates for the two experimental treatments being compared hereafter referred to as pairwise comparisons brooks and field 2016 mattioli et al 2017 we considered results of hypothesis testing statistically significant at p 0 05 while using bonferroni correction due to comparisons across biological triplicates we completed z testing in microsoft excel version 2204 using ginafit we calculated k values standard errors and accompanying lower and upper 95 confidence intervals 1 96 standard error for each biological replicate in each persistence experiment as well as t90 values the number of sampling time points included in each decay model is listed in table s2 we also used a multilevel model with random effects to examine the relationship between the various conditions tested and concentrations of zikv rna in the persistence experiments we fitted parameters for day matrix type further sublevels include di water surface water wastewater and a combination of surface water and wastewater temperature further sublevels include 4 25 and 35 c while using 4 c as the reference category initial concentration further sublevels include 108 and 109 zikv marker copies ml of matrix and a random effects parameter we then standardized the parameters by dividing each parameter estimate by the standard error of the corresponding dataset to allow for comparison of the influence of each variable on concentrations of zikv rna we completed the multilevel modeling in sas 9 1 3 results 3 1 varying temperature and matrix persistence experiments of the three matrices we tested zikv rna signal was the most persistent in sterile di water fig 1 the k values calculated for the 4 and 25 c time series were close to zero mean of 0 02 and 0 01 days 1 respectively and were not significantly different from each other 4 versus 25 c table 3 s5 comparing zikv rna in di water at 25 versus 35 c k values at 35 c were significantly larger than those for 25 c mean of 0 07 versus 0 01 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons between the biological triplicates the zikv rna signal was the least persistent in surface water at 25 c the k values were significantly larger than k values at 4 c mean of 0 27 versus 0 08 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons between the biological triplicates comparing k values at 25 versus 35 c five out of nine pairwise comparisons showed that 35 c had significantly larger k values than those at 25 c mean of 0 46 versus 0 27 days 1 respectively at 25 c k values for surface water were significantly larger than k values for wastewater at 25 c mean of 0 27 versus 0 15 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons between biological triplicates zikv rna signal in wastewater exhibited significant differences between k values for all temperatures comparing the 4 to the 25 c k values increased from a mean of 0 04 to 0 15 days 1 respectively then comparing the 25 to the 35 c k values increased from a mean of 0 15 to 0 35 days 1 respectively 3 2 varying initial concentration persistence experiments we found most pairwise comparisons to have significantly higher k values from time series with an initial concentration of 108 zikv marker copies ml of wastewater than those from time series with an initial concentration of 109 zikv marker copies ml of wastewater mean of 0 31 versus 0 19 days 1 respectively table 4 s5 pairwise comparisons that did not yield a significant difference were from the b biological replicate for the 109 zikv marker copies ml time series which had a higher k value compared to its other biological replicates 0 24 days 1 compared to 0 17 and 0 16 days 1 3 3 combined surface water and wastewater in comparisons between surface waste and a combination of both waters we found again that surface water had significantly larger k values when compared to those from wastewater 0 56 versus 0 22 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons and when compared to those from the combined waters 0 56 versus 0 22 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons table 5 s7 k values from the combined waters time series were not significantly different from k values from the wastewater time series 0 22 versus 0 22 days 1 respectively for all pairwise comparisons multilevel modeling suggested that of the variables tested in this study time had the biggest influence on zikv rna concentration as highlighted in the comparison of k values spike concentration and differing water types also influenced the persistence of the zikv rna signal table s3 3 4 concentration and extraction comparison experiments regardless of experimental conditions when comparing zikv rna recovery between pellet and supernatant pellets had a mean of 2 6 log10 higher recoveries with a minimum of 1 5 log10 difference and maximum of 5 2 log10 difference table s8 percent recoveries of zikv rna signal from direct extraction of the supernatant were consistently low throughout the recovery experiments with a mean of 0 025 ranged from a minimum of 0 not detected to a maximum of 0 15 table s8 pellet recovery using smf ranged from 5 to 50 depending on the experimental condition we found that recoveries were 84 to 97 lower in pellets generated from surface water than wastewater we also found that a freeze thaw negatively impacted zikv rna recoveries from wastewater at both 107 and 105 zikv marker copies ml of virus table 6 3 5 archived environmental water samples collected from the 2015 2016 brazil outbreak we did not detect zikv rna signal in any of the 73 archived samples we analyzed for each of these samples we detected a human specific fecal marker hcytb484 above quantifiable levels confirming that the samples contained human waste in addition we tested for inhibition of dna polymerase activity using an internal amplification control as part of the human associated fecal marker assay hf183 bacr287 and did not find evidence of any dna polymerase inhibition finally prior to extraction we spiked in bovine respiratory syncytial virus vaccine as an extraction control for a single stranded rna virus we detected brsv above quantifiable levels confirming that we successfully extracted rna from the archived samples 4 discussion 4 1 trends in persistence of zikv rna as seen in other studies investigating the persistence of detectable viral rna from enveloped rna viruses in wastewater ahmed et al 2020 bivins et al 2020 chandra et al 2021 muirhead et al 2020 the persistence of zikv rna signal decreased with increasing temperature chandra et al 2021 observed a steep increase in k values from 6 to 25 c followed by a much smaller increase from 25 to 37 c we observed a more linear increase in k values over the range of temperatures tested resulting in t90 values or the time needed for concentrations to decrease by 90 of the original concentration decreasing from 65 to 15 to 6 6 days respectively table s1 however our experiment with lower initial inoculum produced k values similar to the chandra et al 2021 as when we decreased the initial zikv concentration we observed a significantly larger k value and a corresponding decrease in the mean t90 value from 12 4 to 7 6 days 39 decrease of the matrices tested zikv rna persisted the longest in sterile di water an effect observed in similar studies casanova et al 2009 including di water in persistence experiments serves to confirm the effects of matrix on persistence rather than intrinsic degradation of the rna target and serves as a reference matrix for comparison from study to study pinon and vialette 2019 we found the persistence of zikv rna was consistently lower in surface water versus wastewater notably when we combined both surface water and wastewater the persistence of the combined waters was similar to that of wastewater than surface water as shown in other studies viral persistence may be influenced by factors such as aggregation of the virus young and sharp 1977 the presence of organic matter influence of the microbial population and differences in sediment type kline et al 2022 because open sewer environments are a mixture of surface waters and wastewater further exploration into the variability of zikv rna persistence within similar matrices may be crucial for estimating expected ranges of viral rna persistence during wastewater monitoring of open sewers 4 2 concentration and extraction comparison experiments we observed a substantial difference between mean recoveries from the pellet versus the supernatant with the concentration methods we examined these results suggest that zikv was preferentially separated through association with solids with or without the smf this solids association behavior agrees with observations for other enveloped viruses in wastewater graham et al 2021 ye et al 2016 these results highlight potential difficulties in interpreting wastewater monitoring results from open sewer like matrices versus less dilute matrices such as wastewater or fecal sludges smf resulted in a higher percent recovery of zikv rna from pellets than the centrifugation method the recoveries we observed for smf were similar to recoveries of the rna of other enveloped viruses from wastewater using smf philo et al 2022 2021 smf is a practical choice for a concentration method in resource constrained settings because it does not require difficult to obtain supplies or equipment when used to concentrate other enveloped viruses human coronavirus oc43 and sars cov 2 from wastewater smf was shown to yield higher mean recoveries than those of polyethylene glycol peg precipitation falman et al 2019 philo et al 2022 2021 recovery of zikv rna from samples with and without subjecting the samples prior to nucleic acid extraction to a freeze thaw were comparable but the effect of one freeze thaw cycle was more apparent at lower zikv concentrations table s8 we observed a smaller impact of a freeze thaw event than others possibly due to differences in detection efficiency by rt qpcr versus rt ddpcr robinson et al 2022 as well as differences in matrix simpson et al 2021 although recovery varied between extraction kits trends for the different experimental conditions tested remained constant between the two extraction kits with bead beating step resulting in higher viral rna concentrations recovered from pellets 4 3 archived environmental water samples collected from the 2015 2016 brazil outbreak although we did not detect zikv rna in any of the archived samples from brazil results from our controls suggest that our lack of detection was likely due to zikv rna not being present at detectable amounts in our samples rather than any of the following possibilities first concentrations of the human mtdna marker indicate that there was human waste in the samples at a level about one order of magnitude lower than those found in municipal wastewater samples from the us zhu et al 2020 if zikv rna was present in our samples it is possible that excretions of zikv due to infections in the area during this phase of the outbreak were too low for us to detect second we did not find any evidence of pcr inhibition when using an internal amplification control green et al 2014 a common concern with lack of detections in environmental samples is the presence of inhibitory compounds although we implemented an amplification control to assess pcr inhibition we did not implement an rna amplification control to assess rt reverse transcription inhibition third we were able to detect our extraction control bovine respiratory syncytial virus rna boxus et al 2005 at consistent concentration suggesting successful and consistent rna extraction and performance of the reverse transcription process while not conclusive the results from our controls provide some evidence that we did not detect zikv rna from the archived samples because it was not there in high enough quantities to be measured with the methods and storage conditions under which it was treated when comparing surface water versus wastewater in both the persistence and recovery experiments we observed lower persistence and more limited recovery in surface water future efforts in using smf to recover zikv rna from surface water could investigate adjusting conductivity gonzales gustavson et al 2017 to further improve recoveries these results suggest that surface water may be suboptimal as a matrix for wastewater monitoring approaches open sewers are a common and crucial form of wastewater conveyance in low to middle income countries lmics however open sewers are largely understudied in approaches for wastewater monitoring however because zikv endemic communities often rely on open sewers further investigation into if and how open sewers can be utilized as a sampling matrix to support wastewater monitoring approaches in the context of the limitations in persistence and recovery of zikv rna observed in this study based on results of this study exploration into how persistence and recovery vary with different ratios of surface water and wastewater could provide insight into variability in persistence and recovery signals due to factors such as different population densities or between dry and wet seasons 4 4 limitations to understand how persistence varies under controlled conditions persistence experiments attempt to replicate real scenarios using model systems and consequently should be interpreted with the limitations of the system in mind the difficulty in extracting generalizable knowledge from persistence experiments has been discussed korajkic et al 2019 we used zikv cultured from mammalian cells due to the difficulty in acquiring stool and urine from humans shedding zikv rna which may limit our ability to mimic the physical state in which virus particles are shed from humans aggregates of viral particles may influence the persistence of zikv particles young and sharp 1977 and consequently its rna evidence is accumulating for the role of simultaneous delivery of multiple virus particles to infect a cell for many viruses including zikv sexton et al 2021 furthermore because we quantified zikv rna harvested from a cell culture it is likely we included incomplete viral particles in our quantification including zikv genomic rna or sub genomic rna as highlighted in the difference between pfu and measured zikv rna marker concentration an initial concentration of virus so that the viral rna signal can be quantified over time is crucial for fitting a persistence model however such high initial concentrations are not likely to be encountered in realistic scenarios finally it is important to recognize that the waters used in these persistence and recovery experiments were collected from the united states and may differ in properties from waters collected in brazil further work exploring associations of water quality parameters turbidity organic matter etc on zikv rna persistence may yield further insight into under what conditions zikv persistence may be expected to vary 5 conclusions increasing temperature reduced persistence of zikv rna in surface water and wastewater surface water versus wastewater was an important predictor of reduced zikv rna persistence lowering the initial virus concentration from 109 to 108 zikv marker copies ml significantly reduced zikv rna persistence zikv rna percent recoveries using skim milk flocculation and centrifugation methods were lower in surface water than those in wastewater results from testing skimmed milk flocculation

detection in wastewater and clinical samples out of 261 wastewater samples analyzed from bg wwtp 60 were rna hav 23 by rt real time pcr rna hav was detected throughout the entire period studied obtaining varied detection frequencies according to the year between 2 9 and 56 5 thus the overall detection rates per year in bg wwtp were 30 3 10 in 2017 41 7 5 12 in 2018 9 1 1 11 in 2019 7 8 5 64 in 2020 10 8 11 102 in 2021 and 56 5 35 62 in 2022 the years with highest detection rates were 2017 2018 and 2022 which coincides with the highest number of ha clinical cases in the city of córdoba that were officially reported to the notification system of the province of córdoba n 16 n 22 y n 8 respectively fig 2 a additionally in 2017 and 2018 the first rna hav detection in wastewater corresponded to the month of august almost two months before the unusual increase in the number of ha clinical cases was reported to the notification system that originated the outbreak in msm in córdoba fig 2b moreover a similar situation could be recognized in 2022 when a continuous hav circulation in sewage bg wwtp preceded the rise of the hav positive cases notified by up to 6 epidemiological weeks fig 2c the presence of rna hav was detected at all lncs fig 2c the overall hav detection rates at the lncs were 2 9 10 341 in 2021 and 9 1 19 209 in 2022 and there were slight differences between different locations hav detection per epidemiological week in each neighborhood are shown in fig 2c positive samples were repeatedly identified during 2022 at lncs 3 4 6 and 7 even though there were no ha cases reported during the same epidemiological weeks as it is shown in fig 2c there are some discrepancies in hav detections in bg wwtp and at the lncs while in some epidemiological weeks viral rna signals are detected in bg wwtp it was not detected at the 7 lncs included in the study similarly although rna hav was detected in some epidemiological weeks at some of the lncs non detection of rna hav was observed in bg wwtp during those weeks out of the 54 clinical samples from reported ha cases derived to the institute of virology dr j m vanella 35 64 8 tested rna hav positive by real time rt pcr and 87 0 were males 47 54 the mean age of these individuals was 33 3 years old 96 3 52 54 were adult patients from 16 to 66 years old and 3 7 2 54 were unvaccinated children one from peru and the other one from bolivia both living in the province of córdoba 3 2 genotyping and phylogenetic analysis out of all the positive samples obtained both from patients and sewage 28 could be amplified by rt nested pcr and sequenced afterward epidemiological data from the sequenced samples recovered from ha clinical cases are detailed in table 2 and data from sequenced wastewater samples in supplementary table 1 all the sequences analyzed were identified as hav genotype ia fig 3 the phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences recovered from wastewater specimens obtained between 2017 2018 held a close identity with sequences of ha clinical cases obtained in the same period of time fig 3 blue shading when the outbreak among msm described in córdoba occurred mariojoules et al 2019 in addition the same homology pattern could be identified for the sequences obtained from clinical and environmental samples corresponding to 2022 which formed a monophyletic clade separated from the one previously mentioned fig 3 red shading on the other hand four sequences recovered from clinical samples in 2017 2019 and 2021 fig 3 yellow shading were segregated into separated groups two of them belonged to cases imported from venezuela and ecuador and another sequence belonged to an unvaccinated child from bolivia 4 discussion the present study describes a large scale environmental hav surveillance in central argentina involving a parallel environmental clinical surveillance the results of this research show that untreated wastewaters from córdoba city constitute silent sentinels of the hav circulation trend in the region being a sensitive indicator that reports if hav circulates among the population and if its transmission is increasing or decreasing as previously reported in countries with low endemicity for hav infections wastewater monitoring has revealed sustained virus circulation in the community and when clinical surveillance misses mild asymptomatic or subclinical infections wbe reflects the real magnitude of circulating virus la rosa et al 2014 in this sense bisseux et al 2018 found high detection rates in raw wastewater 60 in france despite few symptomatic acute infections being notified in this study despite the almost complete absence of clinical case notifications hav was still detected in wastewater during 2020 and 2021 with detection rates of 7 8 and 10 8 respectively the lack of clinical case reports and low hav detection rates registered in wastewater may be explained probably by the low circulation of other viruses during the ongoing pandemic in those years a similar situation occurred in chile where plaza garrido et al 2023 reported that hav was not detected among the studied wwtps during 2021 furthermore wastewaters reflect the dynamic turnover of circulating virus variants ranta et al 2001 therefore conducting a genetic comparison between hav strains identified in sewage and clinical samples may deepen our understanding of the epidemiology of this virus pintó et al 2007 50 similar reports have highlighted the crucial role of wbe in supporting research on hav outbreaks within the community la rosa et al 2014 pellegrinelli et al 2019 prado et al 2012 prado et al 2021 in this sense the highest rna hav detection rates registered in this study in sewage were associated with a simultaneous increase in the notification of ha clinical cases this was recorded in 2017 and 2018 when a higher detection of viral excretion in sewers was observed during an outbreak of ha the hav strains detected both in clinical and wastewater samples clustered with sequences obtained during the 2017 2018 outbreak that occurred in córdoba caused by the hav ia strain vrd 521 2016 mariojoules et al 2019 additionally these findings show that the detection of the same hav strain in environmental samples before and at the beginning of its spread among the population demonstrates that this outbreak might have been predicted by sewage samples monitoring as it has also been previously reported la rosa et al 2014 pellegrinelli et al 2019 hellmér et al 2014 consistent with these results hellmér et al 2014 showed that one of the two strains causing an ha outbreak in sweden was detected in sewage in weeks 7 and 9 together with samples from three patients infected with these strains who were diagnosed with acute hepatitis a in weeks 10 and 19 la rosa et al 2014 also documented hav circulation in sewage during july december 2012 before the ha outbreak reported in january 2013 in italy accordingly we detected a slight rise in reported ha cases in 2022 coincided with a continuous and increased detection of rna hav in the central sewer pipe of bg wwtp even some weeks before the first clinical case reported these findings suggest that the implementation of the weekly sampling strategy at this site would be a useful tool to provide data on hav circulation as a complement to clinical surveillance this information added to the phylogenetic correlation between the sequences detected in clinical and wastewater samples from the same period of time evidence once again that environmental surveillance might constitute a replica of the clinical epidemiological scenario of viral circulation in the population phylogenetic analysis in this research showed that select samples from 2017 2019 and 2021 grouped outside the 2 main monophyletic clusters two of them belonged to travelers coming from other parts of south america venezuela and ecuador and other sequence belonged to an unvaccinated child from bolivia which reveals new viral introductions with the potential to spread to the local population in this sense environmental surveillance becomes a valuable tool for monitoring different hav variants to verify whether new viral strain introductions become the most dominant ones in a community throughout time these approaches are necessary in order to review public policies in the context of a changing epidemiological scenario in latin america particularly due to the hav vaccine introduction in nine countries from the region in the last few years andani et al 2020 however in this study these different strains could not be detected in wastewater samples probably due to their low representativeness in the number of infected individuals excreting these variants into the sewer collection system in this sense it is important to highlight that we performed sanger sequencing that mainly detects the majority variants of a viral population thus this is a limitation of the study as ngs has higher sensitivity to detect low frequency variants it might be a more effective methodology to capture more of the variability that might be present in the wastewater samples to identify new viral introductions from abroad which could represent a relevant contribution to posterior molecular epidemiology studies most of the reported clinical cases from this study were among young adults aged between 25 and 37 years indicating that this age group is highly susceptible to hav infection as a consequence of the recent implementation of socio economic and sanitary improvements in our region there has been an increase in the number of young individuals who have never been infected during childhood and therefore lack natural immunity moreover despite the availability of pediatric immunization programs since their introduction in argentina in 2005 many of these young adults may not have been eligible for inclusion in hav vaccine programs according to previous local reports dirección de control de enfermedades inmunoprevenibles m de s de a 2021 dirección de control de enfermedades inmunoprevenibles m de s de a 2020 vaccination coverage among individuals under 17 years old including those that were vaccinated from 2005 to 2022 is greater than 75 and those over 35 years old have 75 of igg anti hav prevalence due to naturally acquired immunity before vaccination was implemented yanez et al 2014 however yanez et al 2014 and angeleri et al 2019 reported an igg anti hav prevalence of less than 59 in young adults under 30 years of age from different regions of argentina indicating an increased risk of infection in this specific group in argentina vaccination is recommended for people at risk of hav infection including men who have sex with men individuals with chronic liver disease and others ministerio de salud de argentina 2012 therefore it is crucial to emphasize hav serological data collection derived from igg anti hav antibody testing among young adults within our region to determine immunity status vaccination promotion is essential for susceptible individuals especially those with risk factors and or who are traveling to endemic areas without immunization programs to identify specific hotspots of hav excretion in the city this study also implemented decentralized sewage monitoring through hav detection at multiple local neighborhood collector sewers this approach complemented the information obtained from the bg wwtp providing a more comprehensive understanding of hav circulation in the study area this surveillance strategy would allow alerting and taking particular control and preventive measures in targeted areas detection of rna hav at bg wwtp in the absence of hav detection at the lncs could probably indicate that the virus was circulating through one or some of the other 32 neighborhoods of córdoba city not included in the sampling of this study on the contrary detection of rna hav during some epidemiological weeks at some of the lncs with no detection of hav in bg wwtp might be due to a dilution effect despite these discrepancies these results indicate that hav monitoring in wastewater in cordoba is effective and sampling the central sewer pipe of bg wwtp is useful as a representation of the clinical scenario in the city of córdoba finally it is worth mentioning that the presence of rna hav in sewage could have a considerable impact on other environmental matrices due to the fragility of the excreta disposal system in our region raw or inadequately treated wastewater is often released into surface watercourses used for recreational purposes and or for irrigation as it has been previously studied in the region yanez et al 2014 blanco fernández et al 2012 this situation leads to new plausible environmental scenarios with the potential for viral transmission to the exposed population 5 conclusions the results provide evidence that reinforces the importance of wastewater monitoring as a powerful and effective tool for hav surveillance in argentina multiple advantages of it that were observed in this study can be mentioned 1 in terms of operability and efficiency it is an effective method that does not require large resources 2 it generates valuable information in a short period of time since a single sample summarizes the enteric viral excretion of many viruses that can be detected simultaneously 3 it provides an overview of the global epidemiology of hav in the community independently of the report of ha clinical cases as sewage monitoring can detect asymptomatic individuals that might not be included in the official notification system 4 in some cases it might be useful to anticipate an increase in the number of ha clinical cases 5 it allows the monitoring of the trends of hav variants circulation in the community since there are no current environmental surveillance programs in argentina and the epidemiological surveillance system of clinical cases is often uncertain and problematic we propose that similar long term studies related to wbe should be undertaken in other regions of argentina and in other latin american countries offering this tool as a complement to clinical epidemiological surveillance systems would contribute to a more thorough knowledge of hav in new post vaccination epidemiological

specific local ethical regulations legislature of the province of córdoba 2009 the research evaluation committee of the institute of virology dr josé maría vanella approved to perform this study 2 8

detection in wastewater and clinical samples out of 261 wastewater samples analyzed from bg wwtp 60 were rna hav 23 by rt real time pcr rna hav was detected throughout the entire period studied obtaining varied detection frequencies according to the year between 2 9 and 56 5 thus the overall detection rates per year in bg wwtp were 30 3 10 in 2017 41 7 5 12 in 2018 9 1 1 11 in 2019 7 8 5 64 in 2020 10 8 11 102 in 2021 and 56 5 35 62 in 2022 the years with highest detection rates were 2017 2018 and 2022 which coincides with the highest number of ha clinical cases in the city of córdoba that were officially reported to the notification system of the province of córdoba n 16 n 22 y n 8 respectively fig 2 a additionally in 2017 and 2018 the first rna hav detection in wastewater corresponded to the month of august almost two months before the unusual increase in the number of ha clinical cases was reported to the notification system that originated the outbreak in msm in córdoba fig 2b moreover a similar situation could be recognized in 2022 when a continuous hav circulation in sewage bg wwtp preceded the rise of the hav positive cases notified by up to 6 epidemiological weeks fig 2c the presence of rna hav was detected at all lncs fig 2c the overall hav detection rates at the lncs were 2 9 10 341 in 2021 and 9 1 19 209 in 2022 and there were slight differences between different locations hav detection per epidemiological week in each neighborhood are shown in fig 2c positive samples were repeatedly identified during 2022 at lncs 3 4 6 and 7 even though there were no ha cases reported during the same epidemiological weeks as it is shown in fig 2c there are some discrepancies in hav detections in bg wwtp and at the lncs while in some epidemiological weeks viral rna signals are detected in bg wwtp it was not detected at the 7 lncs included in the study similarly although rna hav was detected in some epidemiological weeks at some of the lncs non detection of rna hav was observed in bg wwtp during those weeks out of the 54 clinical samples from reported ha cases derived to the institute of virology dr j m vanella 35 64 8 tested rna hav positive by real time rt pcr and 87 0 were males 47 54 the mean age of these individuals was 33 3 years old 96 3 52 54 were adult patients from 16 to 66 years old and 3 7 2 54 were unvaccinated children one from peru and the other one from bolivia both living in the province of córdoba 3 2 genotyping and phylogenetic analysis out of all the positive samples obtained both from patients and sewage 28 could be amplified by rt nested pcr and sequenced afterward epidemiological data from the sequenced samples recovered from ha clinical cases are detailed in table 2 and data from sequenced wastewater samples in supplementary table 1 all the sequences analyzed were identified as hav genotype ia fig 3 the phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences recovered from wastewater specimens obtained between 2017 2018 held a close identity with sequences of ha clinical cases obtained in the same period of time fig 3 blue shading when the outbreak among msm described in córdoba occurred mariojoules et al 2019 in addition the same homology pattern could be identified for the sequences obtained from clinical and environmental samples corresponding to 2022 which formed a monophyletic clade separated from the one previously mentioned fig 3 red shading on the other hand four sequences recovered from clinical samples in 2017 2019 and 2021 fig 3 yellow shading were segregated into separated groups two of them belonged to cases imported from venezuela and ecuador and another sequence belonged to an unvaccinated child from bolivia 4 discussion the present study describes a large scale environmental hav surveillance in central argentina involving a parallel environmental clinical surveillance the results of this research show that untreated wastewaters from córdoba city constitute silent sentinels of the hav circulation trend in the region being a sensitive indicator that reports if hav circulates among the population and if its transmission is increasing or decreasing as previously reported in countries with low endemicity for hav infections wastewater monitoring has revealed sustained virus circulation in the community and when clinical surveillance misses mild asymptomatic or subclinical infections wbe reflects the real magnitude of circulating virus la rosa et al 2014 in this sense bisseux et al 2018 found high detection rates in raw wastewater 60 in france despite few symptomatic acute infections being notified in this study despite the almost complete absence of clinical case notifications hav was still detected in wastewater during 2020 and 2021 with detection rates of 7 8 and 10 8 respectively the lack of clinical case reports and low hav detection rates registered in wastewater may be explained probably by the low circulation of other viruses during the ongoing pandemic in those years a similar situation occurred in chile where plaza garrido et al 2023 reported that hav was not detected among the studied wwtps during 2021 furthermore wastewaters reflect the dynamic turnover of circulating virus variants ranta et al 2001 therefore conducting a genetic comparison between hav strains identified in sewage and clinical samples may deepen our understanding of the epidemiology of this virus pintó et al 2007 50 similar reports have highlighted the crucial role of wbe in supporting research on hav outbreaks within the community la rosa et al 2014 pellegrinelli et al 2019 prado et al 2012 prado et al 2021 in this sense the highest rna hav detection rates registered in this study in sewage were associated with a simultaneous increase in the notification of ha clinical cases this was recorded in 2017 and 2018 when a higher detection of viral excretion in sewers was observed during an outbreak of ha the hav strains detected both in clinical and wastewater samples clustered with sequences obtained during the 2017 2018 outbreak that occurred in córdoba caused by the hav ia strain vrd 521 2016 mariojoules et al 2019 additionally these findings show that the detection of the same hav strain in environmental samples before and at the beginning of its spread among the population demonstrates that this outbreak might have been predicted by sewage samples monitoring as it has also been previously reported la rosa et al 2014 pellegrinelli et al 2019 hellmér et al 2014 consistent with these results hellmér et al 2014 showed that one of the two strains causing an ha outbreak in sweden was detected in sewage in weeks 7 and 9 together with samples from three patients infected with these strains who were diagnosed with acute hepatitis a in weeks 10 and 19 la rosa et al 2014 also documented hav circulation in sewage during july december 2012 before the ha outbreak reported in january 2013 in italy accordingly we detected a slight rise in reported ha cases in 2022 coincided with a continuous and increased detection of rna hav in the central sewer pipe of bg wwtp even some weeks before the first clinical case reported these findings suggest that the implementation of the weekly sampling strategy at this site would be a useful tool to provide data on hav circulation as a complement to clinical surveillance this information added to the phylogenetic correlation between the sequences detected in clinical and wastewater samples from the same period of time evidence once again that environmental surveillance might constitute a replica of the clinical epidemiological scenario of viral circulation in the population phylogenetic analysis in this research showed that select samples from 2017 2019 and 2021 grouped outside the 2 main monophyletic clusters two of them belonged to travelers coming from other parts of south america venezuela and ecuador and other sequence belonged to an unvaccinated child from bolivia which reveals new viral introductions with the potential to spread to the local population in this sense environmental surveillance becomes a valuable tool for monitoring different hav variants to verify whether new viral strain introductions become the most dominant ones in a community throughout time these approaches are necessary in order to review public policies in the context of a changing epidemiological scenario in latin america particularly due to the hav vaccine introduction in nine countries from the region in the last few years andani et al 2020 however in this study these different strains could not be detected in wastewater samples probably due to their low representativeness in the number of infected individuals excreting these variants into the sewer collection system in this sense it is important to highlight that we performed sanger sequencing that mainly detects the majority variants of a viral population thus this is a limitation of the study as ngs has higher sensitivity to detect low frequency variants it might be a more effective methodology to capture more of the variability that might be present in the wastewater samples to identify new viral introductions from abroad which could represent a relevant contribution to posterior molecular epidemiology studies most of the reported clinical cases from this study were among young adults aged between 25 and 37 years indicating that this age group is highly susceptible to hav infection as a consequence of the recent implementation of socio economic and sanitary improvements in our region there has been an increase in the number of young individuals who have never been infected during childhood and therefore lack natural immunity moreover despite the availability of pediatric immunization programs since their introduction in argentina in 2005 many of these young adults may not have been eligible for inclusion in hav vaccine programs according to previous local reports dirección de control de enfermedades inmunoprevenibles m de s de a 2021 dirección de control de enfermedades inmunoprevenibles m de s de a 2020 vaccination coverage among individuals under 17 years old including those that were vaccinated from 2005 to 2022 is greater than 75 and those over 35 years old have 75 of igg anti hav prevalence due to naturally acquired immunity before vaccination was implemented yanez et al 2014 however yanez et al 2014 and angeleri et al 2019 reported an igg anti hav prevalence of less than 59 in young adults under 30 years of age from different regions of argentina indicating an increased risk of infection in this specific group in argentina vaccination is recommended for people at risk of hav infection including men who have sex with men individuals with chronic liver disease and others ministerio de salud de argentina 2012 therefore it is crucial to emphasize hav serological data collection derived from igg anti hav antibody testing among young adults within our region to determine immunity status vaccination promotion is essential for susceptible individuals especially those with risk factors and or who are traveling to endemic areas without immunization programs to identify specific hotspots of hav excretion in the city this study also implemented decentralized sewage monitoring through hav detection at multiple local neighborhood collector sewers this approach complemented the information obtained from the bg wwtp providing a more comprehensive understanding of hav circulation in the study area this surveillance strategy would allow alerting and taking particular control and preventive measures in targeted areas detection of rna hav at bg wwtp in the absence of hav detection at the lncs could probably indicate that the virus was circulating through one or some of the other 32 neighborhoods of córdoba city not included in the sampling of this study on the contrary detection of rna hav during some epidemiological weeks at some of the lncs with no detection of hav in bg wwtp might be due to a dilution effect despite these discrepancies these results indicate that hav monitoring in wastewater in cordoba is effective and sampling the central sewer pipe of bg wwtp is useful as a representation of the clinical scenario in the city of córdoba finally it is worth mentioning that the presence of rna hav in sewage could have a considerable impact on other environmental matrices due to the fragility of the excreta disposal system in our region raw or inadequately treated wastewater is often released into surface watercourses used for recreational purposes and or for irrigation as it has been previously studied in the region yanez et al 2014 blanco fernández et al 2012 this situation leads to new plausible environmental scenarios with the potential for viral transmission to the exposed population 5 conclusions the results provide evidence that reinforces the importance of wastewater monitoring as a powerful and effective tool for hav surveillance in argentina multiple advantages of it that were observed in this study can be mentioned 1 in terms of operability and efficiency it is an effective method that does not require large resources 2 it generates valuable information in a short period of time since a single sample summarizes the enteric viral excretion of many viruses that can be detected simultaneously 3 it provides an overview of the global epidemiology of hav in the community independently of the report of ha clinical cases as sewage monitoring can detect asymptomatic individuals that might not be included in the official notification system 4 in some cases it might be useful to anticipate an increase in the number of ha clinical cases 5 it allows the monitoring of the trends of hav variants circulation in the community since there are no current environmental surveillance programs in argentina and the epidemiological surveillance system of clinical cases is often uncertain and problematic we propose that similar long term studies related to wbe should be undertaken in other regions of argentina and in other latin american countries offering this tool as a complement to clinical epidemiological surveillance systems would contribute to a more thorough knowledge of hav in new post vaccination epidemiological
