4295,maintaining ecological flow and mitigating impacts on river health are among the core requirements for sustainable hydropower development designing specific operational modes to fit specific ecological conditions of rivers remains a key practical challenge for hydropower operation especially in terms of balancing the various tradeoffs among multiple objectives in the context of coordinated operation of cascade hydropower plants taking the yalong river china as an example this study develops a decision making support model that can quantitatively analyse the tradeoffs between the hydro energy generation and river ecosystem projection under different hydrological conditions the model contains three main components calculation of ecological flow multi objective optimal operation and determination of optimal schemes for the ecological flow determination we propose a revised variable monthly flow method rvmf which incorporates variations of hydrological conditions also combines the classification concept of the tennant method for these objectives we consider cascade power generation the assurance rate of cascade power generation and the assurance rate of ecological flow the preliminary application in the yalong river case has shown that 1 with the increase in environmental flow requirements of the river the cascade power generation has dropped significantly and the most affected is the jinping ii hydropower plant 2 there are clear tradeoffs between the cascade power generation and the assurance rate of cascade power generation and the cascade power generation and the assurance rate of cascade power generation under different riparian ecological conditions and 3 being able to quantify those tradeoffs provides crucial scientific evidence for stakeholder dialogue and informed decision making for hydropower operation modes that can achieve the best desirable balances between power generation and river health conservation keywords ecological operation multi objective operation cascade hydropower plants ecological flow tradeoff relationship yalong river 1 introduction concepts such as river health and ecological flow are current academic research hotspots arthington et al 2006 huang et al 2014 poff and matthews 2013 rees et al 2020 tan et al 2018 and are also the focus of attention for the comprehensive benefits of water conservancy and hydropower projects ren et al 2019 renofalt et al 2010 parish et al 2019 the multi objective optimal operation of cascade hydropower plants considering ecological flow can not only explore the possible comprehensive benefits of ecology power generation flood control water supply shipping and tourism for water conservancy and hydropower projects but also analyse the benefit tradeoff between different operation targets besides the operation can also be optimised by considering the environmental flow requirements efrs of the river reach which provides vital technical support for decision making among operators of cascade hydropower plants jiang et al 2019 ding et al 2020 chen et al 2014 currently most hydropower plants have multiple functions such as power generation flood control water supply and pursue the high efficiency utilisation of water resources and maximising economic benefits zhang et al 2019 however the modes of operation of these hydropower plants do not adequately consider the efrs of the dewatered river reach downstream of the dam causing varying degrees of damage to the river ecosystem zhou and guo 2013 magilligan nislow 2005 grill et al 2019 for instance dam construction blocks river flow cause changes in hydrological conditions and the biological habitat affect the spawning and reproduction of migratory fish leading to changes in the population and structural characteristics of the river biome gibeau et al 2017 therefore researchers take ecological factors into account during hydropower plant operation xu 2017 since schluter 1971 first proposed the theory that the operation of reservoirs should maintain the diversity of the riverine ecosystem petts and geoffrey 1996 proposed an ecologically acceptable ecological flow method and shown that 60 of the available resources are needed to maintain the river as a trout stream hughes and ziervogel 1998 first established an ecological operation model of the reservoir i e the damifr model which can simulate the effects of a variety of different release priorities recently ecological and environmental protection has received more attention and attention and related research results have become more abundant steinschneider et al 2014 developed a large scale optimal operation model to explore the contribution of optimal operation management of large scale hydropower plants to ecological benefit tsai et al 2015 employed a hybrid artificial neural network to quantify the relationship between flow regimes and fish communities and guided the ecological operation of the shihmen reservoir in northern taiwan huang et al 2019 quantitatively analysed the tradeoffs among social economic and ecological benefits during the flood season for the three gorges project china and the results indicated that a smaller flood peak leads to less sediment and p transports to the downstream similarly zhang et al 2019 established ecological operation models of cascade hydropower plants and quantified the interaction between power generation and degree of ecological flow satisfaction under different modes of operation recently feng et al 2020 developed a novel multi strategy gravitational search algorithm and applied it to the ecological operation problem of the wu hydropower system which can make obvious reductions in the inappropriate ecological water volume the determination of ecological flow is the prerequisite and basis for the study of the ecological operation of hydropower plants zhang et al 2019 the ecological flow of the river is defined as the proper flow needed for rivers to maintain the health of the river ecosystem and ensure the survival and development of human beings poff and matthews 2013 the main ecological flow methods are hydrological methods hydraulic methods habitat simulation methods and holistic methods pastor et al 2014 respectively among these methods the hydrology method is the earliest method to calculate ecological flow and it is also the most widely used method because it has the advantages of a lower data demand simple operation and lower cost pastor et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 comprehensively considered the 7q10 method hydrological method rva hydrological method and river2d model habitat simulation method to compute the comprehensive ecological water demand of the study area and established three ecological operation models to quantify the relationship between power generation and ecological system protection the research results showed that power generation and ecological demand are mutually restrictive and conflicting shadkam et al 2016 calculated the environmental flow requirements of high salt lakes based on the variable monthly flow vmf method hydrological method and estimated that 3 7 109 m3 a 1 water was needed to preserve urmia lake until recently most research on the ecological operation of hydropower plants employs a single target ecological flow to characterise the efrs of the dewatered river reach downstream of the dam such as ecological base flow which is used to maintain the vital ecosystem of the river ignoring other ecological conditions e g optimum excellent and good ecological conditions wu et al 2011 also relatively few studies have focused on the tradeoffs between hydropower production and river ecosystem projection considering different efrs of the downstream river reach for the cascade hydropower plants some existing studies have assessed the tradeoff between human needs and the riverine ecosystem with optimizing the operation strategies xu 2020 taken a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii to solve the multi objective optimal operation to tradeoff between efrs and agricultural irrigation xu et al 2020a developed a multi objective optimization model to quantitatively analyse the tradeoffs between hydropower generation and biodiversity conservation the research results showed that the optimal operation of reservoirs is effective for maintaining ecological flow in the downstream river reach of hydropower plants the main aim of this study is to quantify the tradeoffs between the hydro energy generation and river ecosystem projection under various riparian ecological conditions in different hydrological conditions following a decision making support model in this study a revised ecological flow method is firstly proposed to determine the efrs under different ecological conditions in downstream river reach of hydropower plants then a decision making support model is developed which contains three main components calculation of ecological flow multi objective optimal operation and determination of optimal schemes finally the cascade hydropower plants of the lower reaches of the yalong river basin in china are taken a research case study and the multi objective optimal operation model is solved by nsga ii algorithm and the tradeoffs between three optimal objectives are evaluated the present research results can provide scientific evidence for the ecological restoration and protection of the lower reaches of the yalong river and at the same time provide a reference for the ecological operation of cascade hydropower plants under various ecological conditions 2 methodology an ecological flow method revised variable monthly flow rvmf was proposed for a variety of ecological conditions based on the variable monthly flow vmf method and was combined with the classification concept in the tennant method this paper established six ecological scenarios based on the ecological flow calculation results of the rvmf method a multi objective optimal operation model was constructed under three objectives i e cascade power generation assurance rate of cascade power generation and assurance rate of cascade power generation which was solved by the nsga ii algorithm to obtain the pareto optimal sets of solutions the optimal or recommended schemes were determined by a multi objective decision making method the entropy weighted topsis method these methods or models were established to analyse the relationship between power generation and ecosystem protection quantitatively the flow chart through the methods used in this study is shown in fig 1 2 1 calculation of ecological flow at present there are more than 200 ecological flow methods tharme 2003 which are mainly classified into four types hydrological methods tennant method tennant 1976 iha and rva hydraulic rating methods r2cross habitat simulation methods wua and river2d and holistic methods eloha pastor et al 2014 these methods have their advantages and disadvantages and the advantage of hydrological methods is that they are fast straightforward ecological flow methods for use in preliminary assessments or when ecological data sets are unavailable the tennant method tennant 1976 is an empirical relationship between flow and habitat quality established based on observational data and is the most widely used hydrological method in the world the method is simple and convenient to use because it only needs historical flow data to determine the environmental flow requirements efrs of the river which have macroscopic guiding significance the tennant method qualitatively describes the habitat as eight ecological conditions based on a specific percentage of the annual mean flow maf which are severe degradation poor or minimum fair or degrading good excellent outstanding optimum range and flushing or maximum respectively however the method does not reflect the high flow intermediate flow and low flow months of the ecological flow during the year thus the tennant method is suitable for large and perennial rivers but not for seasonal rivers the variable monthly flow vmf method is an ecological flow method developed by pastor et al 2014 which was a hydrological method this method uses an algorithm to classify the flow regime into high intermediate and low flow months and takes intra annual variability into account by allocating efrs with a percentage of mean monthly flow mmf which increases the protection of freshwater ecosystems during the low flow season the vmf method offers better performance compared with the other three widely used hydrological methods tennant method smakhtin method smakhtin et al 2004 and tessmann method however it is designed to achieve a fair ecological condition for river flow which does not take into account other ecological conditions such as poor good and excellent conditions although the grading standard of the tennant method is not universal the grading idea of an arithmetic progression is based on many field observations hydraulic analysis and statistical analysis which have been universally recognised tharme 2003 in the present work we revised the vmf method based on the ecological flow standard of the tennant method and proposed an ecological flow method revised vmf rvmf for multiple ecological conditions that is based on a specific percentage 10 of the mmf the ecological conditions of the river were qualitatively described by six levels poor fair good excellent outstanding and optimum respectively the vmf method allocated water for freshwater ecosystems in fair ecological conditions and the corresponding ecological flow in different months is 30 mmf in high flow months 45 mmf in intermediate flow months and 60 mmf in low flow months pastor et al 2014 this paper referred to the ecological flow classification standard of the tennant method and used 10 of mmf as the minimum ecological flow which was a poor ecological condition at the same time five levels were set from the ecological condition fair to the ecological condition optimum by gradually increasing the mmf by 10 when the ecological flow is 100 mmf the optimum ecological condition is reached table 1 the specific calculation formula of ecological flow is as follows 1 ef α m m f where ef is the ecological flow of the river m3 s α is the flow coefficient see table 1 for specific values for example when the hydrological season is high flow months and the ecological condition of the river is poor α is equal to 10 mmf is the mean monthly flow m3 s 2 2 multi objective optimal operation model for cascade hydropower plants 2 2 1 objective functions the main objective of cascade hydropower plants operation is to maximize the power generation benefits so this study considers cascade power generation as an objective in multi objective optimal operation the main goal of the ecological operation of hydropower plants is to ensure that the discharge flow meets the water demands of the downstream river ecosystems thus the ecological benefits of the operation of cascade hydropower plants are expressed by the assurance rate of ecological flow of the downstream river in this study also this study considers various ecological conditions in the downstream river moreover in addition for in conduit hydropower plants assurance output may not be met when large amounts of water are used to meet the water needs of downstream river ecosystems rather than for power generation therefore we took the assurance rate of cascade power generation as one operation objective the three objectives are in a mutually competitive relationship and the corresponding functions are described as follows 1 maximum cascade power generation cpg 2 e 1 m a x i 1 n t 1 t η i h i t q i t δ t where e 1 is the maximum annual power generation of cascade hydropower plants 108 kwh n is the number of reservoirs t is the numbers of months in a year t 12 η i is comprehensive power coefficient of the i th hydropower plant h i t is the average head at time t m q i t is the turbine release while producing power m3 s δ t is the time step s 2 the maximum assurance rate of cascade power generation arcpg 3 e 2 m a x 1 n t i 1 n t 1 t p i t 100 4 p i t 0 n i t n i m i n 1 n i t n i m i n where e 2 is the assurance rate of cascade power generation to the total number of periods n i m i n is guaranteed output of the i th hydropower plant mw 3 the maximum assurance rate of ecological flow aref 5 e 3 m a x 1 n t i 1 n t 1 t m i t 100 6 m i t 0 ef i t eft i t 1 ef i t eft i t where e 3 is the assurance rate of ecological flow in the river section to the total number of periods ef i t and eft i t are the ecological flow and target ecological flow of the downstream river of plant i at time t respectively m3 s and the eft i t is determined by the rvmf method proposed in this study 2 2 2 constraint conditions the multi objective optimal operation model is subject to the following constraints 1 water balance constraint 6 v i t 1 v i t i i t q i t δ t e i t l i t where v i t 1 and v i t refer to the average storage of reservoir i in the t 1 th and t th time steps respectively m3 i i t and q i t are the average inflow and outflow of reservoir i at time t respectively m3 s e i t is the evaporation of reservoir i at time t m3 l i t is the leakage of water from reservoir i m3 2 water level constraints 7 z i t min z i t z i t max where z i t is the average water level of the reservoir i at time t z i t min and z i t max are the minimum and maximum water level limits of reservoir i at time t respectively m 3 discharge flow constraints 8 0 q i t q i t max where q i t max is the maximum discharge from reservoir i at time t m3 s 4 output constraints 9 0 n i t n i m a x where n i m a x is the maximum power output limit of hydropower plant i at time t mw 2 2 3 constraint handling strategy here we developed a constraint handling method through constraint transformation based on the characteristics of the actual operation of cascade hydropower plants the optimal operation of cascade power plants mainly includes three constraints of water level discharge flow and output for the constraints of water level discharge flow firstly we employed the water level as a decision variable then we converted the maximum flow constraint into a water level interval through the water balance equation finally the intersection of the water level constraint interval and the water level interval obtained by the discharge flow constraint conversion is taken to obtain the feasible region of the decision variable for the output constraint the upper limit is taken when the output at time i is greater than the upper limit of the output of the hydropower plant in this way the numerous constraints of the original problem are converted into the water level restrictions of each reservoir in each operation period which is relatively simple to deal with 2 2 4 solution method at present the research into the algorithm for solving the optimal operation model of hydropower plants has achieved fruitful results according to the number of objectives it is mainly divided into single objective optimisation algorithms linear programming dynamic programming non linear programming optimal recursive algorithm etc and multi objective optimisation algorithms multiple target genetic algorithms multi objective particle swarm optimisation multi objective differential evolution algorithms etc the above optimal operation model belongs to a multi objective multi constrained multi dimensional and non linear complex optimisation problem thus we selected the fast elitist multi objective genetic algorithm nsga ⅱ deb et al 2002 which has the advantages of rapidity and good convergence also the algorithm is widely used in solving the multi objective optimal operation of hydropower plants boyaghchi and sohbatloo 2018 huang et al 2019 the general procedure of nsga ⅱ is shown in fig s1 modified from li et al 2018 2 3 multi objective decision making model pareto optimal solutions could be obtained after solving the multi objective optimal operation problem of cascade hydropower plants decision makers need to finally obtain the optimal or recommended schemes through the multi objective decision making model the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution topsis method had no strict restrictions and requirements in terms of the number of indicators also referred to as criteria samples and data the method has been widely used in multi index and multi scheme decision analysis problems and is also an effective and standard decision making optimisation method liu and yin 2019 xu et al 2020b the present research employed the entropy weighted topsis method which could avoid the irrationality of the subjective weighting of the traditional topsis method hussain et al 2020 2 3 1 entropy weight method the entropy method is an objective weighting method which only relies on the discreteness of the data itself and has the characteristics of strong operability and objectivity in the evaluation process the higher the degree of dispersion of an indicator is the greater the weight of the indicator hussain et al 2020 the specific calculation steps are as follows step 1 indicator normalisation if the a ij is the benefit indicator the indicator normalisation is followed as eq 10 if the a ij is the cost indicator the indicator normalisation is followed as eq 11 10 a ij a ij m i n a ij max a ij m i n a ij 11 a ij max a ij a ij max a ij m i n a ij step 2 calculate the proportion of the i th sample value with normalisation under the j th indicator p ij 12 p ij a ij i 1 n a ij where a ij is the i th sample value with normalisation under the j th indicator step 3 calculate the entropy value of the j th indicator 13 e j 1 ln n i 1 n p ij ln p ij i j 1 2 n where e j is the entropy value of the j th indicator n represents many alternatives step 4 calculate the weight of the j th indicator u j 14 u j 1 e j n j 1 n e j 2 3 2 topsis method hwang and yoon hwang and yoon 1981 proposed the topsis method which is a powerful and commonly used analysis method for multi objective decision making problems based on the idea that the best alternative should have the smallest distance i e euclidean distance from the ideal solution the topsis method is used to estimate distances to both ideal and anti ideal solutions and is a useful and straightforward method for ranking many desirable alternatives to identify the closest to ideal solutions hussain et al 2020 the main steps of the topsis method could be elaborated as follows step 1 construct a standardised initial matrix z 15 z z 11 z 21 z 12 z 22 z 1 n z 2 n z m 1 z m 2 z mn step 2 construct a normalised weight matrix here the entropy method was used to calculate the indicator weight w w 1 w 2 w n then the weighted normalised decision matrix was estimated by using eq 14 with the performance value of the normalised matrix 16 r z d i a g w r ij w j z ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where diag w is the diagonal matrix corresponding to the indicator weight w step 3 calculate the ideal and anti ideal solutions calculate the ideal and anti ideal solutions s and s based on the weighting matrix s s 1 s 2 s n s s 1 s 2 s n the ideal values s j and s j are estimated by using eq 15 17 s j max 1 i m r ij s j min 1 i m r ij step 4 compute the euclidean distance the separation of each alternative from the positive and negative ideal solution is given below respectively 18 d i j 1 n s j r ij 2 i 1 2 m 19 d i j 1 n s j r ij 2 i 1 2 m step 5 calculate the performance score value 20 c i d i d i d i i 1 2 m where c i is the performance score value c i 0 1 step 6 finally the ranking of alternatives is set based on the performance score value 3 case study 3 1 study area we selected the cascade hydropower plants in the lower reach of the yalong river as a case study the yalong river is the largest tributary of the jinsha river in china with a total length of 1571 km a natural drop of 3830 m an annual runoff of 60 9 billion m3 a drainage basin area of approximately 136 000 km2 and average annual precipitation of 500 to 2470 mm the basin has abundant water resources and is one of the most critical water resources for strategic reserve areas in china five cascade hydropower plants have been built in the lower reach of the yalong river namely jinping i jinping ii guandi ertan and tongzilin respectively jinping i is a yearly regulating reservoir ertan is a seasonal regulating reservoir guandi and tongzilin have daily regulating capacity and jinping ii is an in conduit hydropower plant with a dewatered river reach of 119 km between the water intake and the plant yu et al 2019 the case study is generalised into the form of two reservoirs and five levels that is the reservoir capacities of jinping ii guandi and tongzilin reservoirs are generalised to equivalent storage capacity and the corresponding reservoir water level is a fixed value taking the average of the normal water level and the dead water level throughout the entire period the distribution of hydropower plants on the yalong river and their characteristic parameters are shown in fig 2 and table 2 3 2 basic data the flood season in the yalong river basin lasts from june to october and the reservoir reaches its normal water level at the end of october therefore the hydrological year and the scheduling period of the basin were set to run from november to october five typical years were selected based on the streamflow data from the cascade hydropower plants from 1958 to 2018 i e wet year 2012 p 10 relatively wet year 2008 p 30 normal year 2015 p 50 relatively dry year 2002 p 70 and dry year 2006 p 90 used for input of the multi objective optimal operation model the typical yearly inflow to the jinping i hydropower plant is shown in fig s2 3 3 scenarios three periods were classified based on the rvmf method in the yalong river basin i e high flow months june to october intermediate flow months may november and december and low flow months january to april the efrs of the jinping i are listed in table 3 when the ecological condition of the river is poor the average ecological flow is 14 58 mmf when the ecological conditions are optimum the average ecological flow is 83 75 mmf the jinping ii is an in conduit hydropower plant and the diversion gate is located 7 5 km downstream of the dam site at jinping i when the jinping ii power plant diverts the water to generate electricity it will form a dewatered river reach of 119 km dahewan reach between the water intake and the plant the relationship between the ecological flow of the dewatered river reach and jinping i and ii power plants can be expressed as table 4 21 q j p 1 t θ q e t t 1 2 t 22 q j p 1 t q j p 2 t θ q e t t 1 2 t where q j p 1 t is the outflow of jinping i at time t m3 s q e t is the ecological flow of dahewan reach at time t m3 s q j p 2 t is diversion flow of jinping ii at time t m3 s θ is the slack variable θ 0 1 and its value is equal to the ecological flow satisfaction of the cascade hydropower plants according to the ecological conditions in the river six scenarios of ecological flow were established namely s1 s6 as listed in table 3 scenario s1 means that only the minimum ecological flow is considered for the operation of hydropower plants reference scenario which is also the current operating mode of most hydropower plants considering ecological flow at the same time s6 is the scenario where the ecological flow reaches the level of the optimum ecological conditions in the river 4 results 4 1 rationality of ecological flow method the determination of the ecological flow is the prerequisite and basis for the study of the ecological operation of hydropower plants an ecological flow method rvmf was proposed under a variety of ecological conditions and its rationality was the critical point of the paper also jinping ii is an in conduit power plant which has formed a 119 km dewatered river reach dahewan reach between the water intake and the power plant the mode of operation of the power plant had the most significant influence on the ecology of the dahewan reach therefore dahewan reach was taken as an example to discuss the rationality of the rvmf method the tennant method is an empirical relationship between ecological flow and habitat quality based on observational data and is also the most widely used hydrological method in the world tennant 1976 in this paper the rvmf method and the tennant method were used to calculate the ecological flow under the six scenarios of the dahewan reach and the calculation results were compared and analysed the calculation results of the rvmf method were consistent with the changing trend of natural flow in dahewan reach which could reflect the seasonal change of ecological flow to a certain extent in contrast the change of the tennant method is singular during a given year only reflecting the difference between flood season and dry season fig 3 the natural flow characteristics of rivers constitute the integrity of the ecosystem hydrological rhythm refers to the periodic and rhythmic changes in the hydrologic regime of rivers and lakes and is closely connected with the riverine ecosystem when the hydrological rhythm changes it will affect the reproduction growth and development of aquatic organisms to a certain extent wheeler et al 2017 the distribution of hotspots on monthly scales of standardised natural flow and ecological flow divide by the maximum value of the corresponding flow is shown in fig 4 the comparative analysis shows that the hydrological rhythm of natural mmf increases month by month from march to july and decreases month by month from august to february the rvmf method simulates the hydrological rhythm of ecological flow in a manner consistent with the natural flow in contrast the calculation results of the tennant method do not change significantly during the year this means that the tennant method cannot reflect the natural change in hydrological rhythm which may cause the abundance of some aquatic organisms that are highly dependent on hydrological rhythms to decrease or disappear together the rvmf method is deemed to have been more reasonable than the tennant method at present there have been some relevant research results on ecological base flow in the dahewan reach of the yalong river wang et al 2007 calculated the minimum ecological flow in dahewan reach using hydraulic methods and their results showed that 45 m3 s of discharge from the sluice gate in the dry season can meet the living conditions of fish of about 95 of the river section under hydraulic factors prevailing in the dewatered river reach of jinping ii hydropower plant chen et al 2014 combined the low power generation loss and optimal ecological flow plan and recommended a discharge flow of 36 50 m3 s in the dahewan reach in the dry season which can ensure that at least 50 of the target fish habitat in the river is protected besides the actual operation of the ecological sluice gate in the jinping ii hydropower plant must pass 45 74 m3 s to ensure the minimum ecological flow in the dahewan reach here we employed the rvmf method to calculate the minimum ecological flow the ecological condition is poor the dry season flow is 67 4 m3 s which agrees with previous studies chen et al 2014 wang et al 2007 and is also closer to the actual operating results to further illustrate the rationality of the rvmf method we selected a case study to compare and analyse the calculation results of ecological flow wan and xia 2007 calculated the minimum ecological flow at the reba dam site in the upper reaches of the yalong river through five ecological flow methods which are tennant method texas method minimum flow method hydraulic radius method and wetted perimeter method respectively fig 5 shows the comparison of the annual average minimum ecological flow at the reba dam site calculated by different methods it can be seen that the minimum ecological flow at the reba dam site is between 36 3 46 8 m3 s with an average value of 41 2 m3 s which is consistent with the results calculated by the rvmf method in this study 43 7 m3 s in summary the rvmf method proposed is reasonable and reliable to a certain extent 4 2 cascade hydropower plants operation results analysis in a normal year the pareto non inferior set of solutions and the best compromise solutions of the six ecological scenarios s1 s6 are shown in fig 6 a f the cpg and the arcpg restrict and conflict with each other showing a significant negative correlation that is as the cpg increases the arcpg decreases in contrast the correlation between the cpg and the aref is insignificant and the correlation between the arcpg and the aref is also insignificant besides this study constructs the three objectives of cpg arcpg and aref as the evaluation indicators system of operation schemes and uses the pareto non inferior set of solutions as the input of the multi objective decision making model the optimal schemes and their values of scenarios s1 s6 are determined by the entropy based topsis model as shown in table s1 and their weights as shown in table s2 among them the cpg the arcpg and the aref for scenario s1 and scenario s6 are 777 25 108 kwh 93 33 and 100 584 17 108 kwh 78 33 and 100 respectively the arefs for scenarios s1 s6 are all 100 which shows that while the cascade hydropower plants in the yalong river are pursuing power generation benefits they can meet the optimum ecological condition of the river however the power loss of the cascade hydropower plants is relatively significant compared with s1 at this time 193 08 108 kwh also as the demand for the ecological flow of rivers increases the power generation of the yalong river cascade hydropower plants has dropped significantly besides we analysed the changes of power generation efficiency indicators of cascade hydropower plants for optimal schemes under six ecological scenarios namely the rate of power generation water consumption the water through the turbine per unit of hydropower electricity generation chang et al 2017 as summarised in table 4 it can be seen from the table that the ecological flow demand of rivers increases and the power generation efficiency of cascade hydropower plants decreases among them scenario s1 has the highest power generation efficiency and its rate of water consumption is 2 78 m3 kwh and scenario s6 is the lowest with a rate of water consumption of 3 25 m3 kwh furthermore fig 7 shows the power generation of five power plants under scenarios s1 s6 in a normal year only the power generation of jinping ⅱ hydropower plant has changed significantly from 253 41 s1 to 63 92 108 kwh s2 and the other four plants have little change this shows that different efrs in the downstream river reach mainly affect the power generation of jinping ⅱ hydropower plant and then affect the cpg the main reason is that the jinping ⅱ hydropower plant is an in conduit power plant when the optimal ecological condition s6 of the river is reached most of the outflow from jinping ⅰ hydropower plant is used for the ecological needs of the dahewan reach rather than the power generation of the jinping ⅱ hydropower plant this means that for the dammed hydropower plant e g jinping ⅰ the tradeoff relationship between ecological flow and power generation is weak because the power flow can meet the efrs of downstream rivers however for the in conduit power plant jinping ⅱ there is a significant tradeoff relationship between ecological flow and power generation so the ecological problems of its dewatered river reach need to be paid attention to jinping i and ertan hydropower plants are controlled reservoirs with strong regulation ability in the lower reach of the yalong river basin their operating water level and outflow are closely related to the power generation of downstream power plants and the ecological flow of the river fig s3 shows the monthly operating water levels of jinping i and ertan hydropower plants under scenarios s1 s6 in a normal year the water level of the reservoir drops to the lower limit under the six scenarios which vacates enough storage capacity to ensure the safety of flood control during the flood season at the ending of the flood season the reservoir will gradually store water and it will be stored to the normal water level to ensure water use during the dry season by the end of october moreover fig s4 shows the outflow from jinping i and ertan hydropower plants under scenarios s1 s6 in a normal year the outflow from the reservoir during the dry season is less than the annual mean flow at the dam site while the opposite is true in the flood season that is the outflow from the reservoir is greater than the annual mean flow at the dam site under all six scenarios table 5 lists the cascade power loss in five typical years under scenarios s2 s6 compared to s1 reference scenario the annual average cascade power losses under scenarios s2 s6 are 60 20 89 41 115 19 136 69 and 161 91 108 kwh respectively which indicates that the ecological flow of the river has a significant effect on power generation and the operation of the cascade hydropower plants is considered such that the better the efrs of the river the higher the cascade power loss besides the effect of ecological flow on the cascade power generation is inconsistent in different typical years and the release of ecological flow in the wet year has the least influence on cascade power generation 4 3 relationship between abandoned water and ecological flow the issue of abandoned water is unavoidable in the sustainable development of hydropower and the operation and management of power plants ye et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 for example the total energy loss of abandoned water in sichuan province china in 2016 was 287 3 108 kwh ye et al 2018 which is close to 0 4 times the average power generation of the lower cascade hydropower plants in the yalong river resulting in much waste of clean energy which is not conducive to the sustainability of hydropower development here the status of abandoned water from cascade hydropower plants in the lower reach of the yalong river under five hydrological years and six ecological scenarios is analysed and the relationship between abandoned water and ecological flow is explored table 6 lists the abandoned water from the cascade hydropower plants in the lower reach of the yalong river during five hydrological years and under six ecological scenarios the issue of abandoned water in the lower reach of the yalong river mainly occurs in wet and relatively wet years while less water is discarded in normal relatively dry and dry years among them there is almost no abandonment in the dry year also we found that the degree of water abandonment in different ecological scenarios and hydrological years is inconsistent in a wet year the annual abandoned water shows a significant downward trend from scenario s1 to s6 from 318 57 to 246 72 108 m3 respectively however scenario s3 is the smallest amount of abandoned water among the six scenarios for other typical years the better to explore the problem of abandoned water for hydropower the hydrological year in which the most severe abandonment occurs was taken as an example i e the wet year and the distribution characteristics of the abandoned water of cascade hydropower plants during the year were analysed the water is mainly abandoned in the lower reach of the yalong river from july to october during the flood season and no water is abandoned in the dry season the amount of abandoned water in july is the largest and the amount of abandoned water from july to october shows a decreasing trend also we found that the cascade abandoned water decreases with the decrease of the average ecological flow under flood season showing a positive correlation fig s5 5 discussion the traditional operation of cascade hydropower plants reduces the peak discharge in flood seasons and increases the water volume in the dry season through the storage function of reservoirs at the same time these plants bring huge power generation benefits but ignore or underestimate the ecological environment impact also the modes of operation of cascade hydropower plants are closely related to the ecological health of the river in the present study the main goal of optimal operation of cascade hydropower plants is to pursue the maximization of comprehensive benefits of hydro energy generation and ecological flows and explore the tradeoff relationship of three optimal objectives under six scenarios s1 s6 in different hydrological conditions here we took a normal year as an example to illustrate the tradeoffs between two optimal objectives i e the cpg and the arcpg the cpg and the aref and the arcpg and the aref it can be seen from fig 6 that these three objectives have a certain degree of tradeoff relationship therefore when analysing the tradeoff relationship between the two objectives it is necessary to exclude the influence of the third objective on the two objectives for the arcpg and the aref discrete value we employed the controlled variable method such as analysing the tradeoff relationship between the cpg and the arcpg under the same aref at the same time the appropriate number of representative values is selected so that they can represent the entire range for the cpg continuous value we selected scenarios s2 s4 and s6 as representatives to illustrate the tradeoff relationship between the arcpg and aref 5 1 tradeoff between cascade power generation and the assurance rate of cascade power generation to illustrate the tradeoff relationship between cpg and the arcpg the pareto non inferior set of solutions are presented in fig 8 as seen in this figure there is a significant tradeoff between the two objectives under scenarios s1 s6 that is when the cpg increases the arcpg decreases also it is found that these pareto fronts have some turning points dotted circle under scenarios s1 s6 for instance for scenario s1 the arcpg slowly decreases as cpg increases from 773 80 to 777 25 108 kwh however the arcpg decreases sharply after cpg increases beyond 777 25 108 kwh fig 8 this means that cpg should be controlled at this turning point to avoid severe damage to the power generation reliability of cascade hydropower plants 5 2 tradeoff between cascade power generation and the assurance rate of ecological flow to illustrate the tradeoff relationship between cpg and the aref the pareto non inferior set of solutions are presented in fig 9 as seen in this figure there is a significant tradeoff between the cpg and the aref under scenarios s2 s6 that is when the cpg increases the aref decreases sharply it is added that the number of non inferior solutions in scenario s1 is small so we did not analyse it here this means that cpg has a remarkably adverse impact on the aref thus it is necessary to consider the tradeoff between the two objectives when decision makers choose the appropriate operation mode of cascade hydropower plants 5 3 tradeoff between the assurance rate cascade power generation and the assurance rate of ecological flow to illustrate the tradeoff relationship between the arcpg and the aref we had standardised the cpg which can more clearly show the tradeoff between these two objectives under the same cpg the pareto non inferior set of solutions are presented in fig 10 it is difficult to find a significant tradeoff relationship between the two objectives from the figure thus decision makers do not consider the tradeoff between the two objectives when they choose the appropriate operation mode of cascade hydropower plants overall there is a significant tradeoff relationship between the cpg and the arcpg and the cpg and the aref that is as the cpg increases the arcpg and the aref show a downward trend it is worth noting that there is a clear turning point in these pareto frontiers fig 8 however there is no obvious tradeoff between the arcpg and the aref therefore this reminds decision makers of the operation for cascade hydropower plants to focus on the tradeoffs between the cpg and the arcpg and the cpg and the aref 5 4 limitations and future research directions this study designs a set of methods for in depth study of the multi objective ecological operation of cascade hydropower plants including ecological flow method multi objective optimal operation model multi objective solution algorithm and multi objective decision making method the advantages and disadvantages of these methods will be briefly discussed below the revised vmf method rvmf originally proposed in this study aims to calculate the ecological flow under different river ecological conditions for the study area with only hydrological data however the rationality of this method needs to be further demonstrated in combination with more measured data including hydrology hydraulics and ecology to realize its application and promotion the nsga ⅱ algorithm has the advantages of rapidity and good convergence but its global search ability is poor and it is easy to appear early converging phenomenon the entropy weighted topsis method has no strict restrictions and requirements in terms of the number of indicators also referred to as criteria samples and data also this method can avoid the irrationality of the subjective weighting of the traditional topsis method however we found that the weights obtained by the entropy method tended to be ecological indicators table s2 therefore the combined weighting method coupled subjective and objective weighting method needs to be considered in the next research to make the calculation of weights more reasonable also we only analysed the tradeoffs between the two objectives not the overall tradeoff relationship between the three objectives in future studies in combination with external factors such as climate change population growth and the low carbon economy the uncertain analysis of the cascade optimal operation model considering multiple ecological flow warrants further research further how to quantify the economic benefits of ecological flow may be very important to the research into the benefit tradeoff of hydro energy generation and river ecosystem projection for cascade hydropower plants 6 conclusion an ecological flow method rvmf was proposed for various ecological conditions in the river based on the vmf method and combined with the classification idea of the tennant method and six ecological scenarios s1 s6 were established with concomitant calculation results a decision making support model was developed to quantify the benefit tradeoffs between the optimal objectives the main results were as follows 1 the rvmf method qualitatively describes river habitats based on a specific percentage of monthly mean flow mmf into six levels poor fair good excellent outstanding and optimum the corresponding average values of ecological flow are 14 58 43 75 53 75 63 75 73 75 and 83 75 mmf respectively the analysis of the seasonal variation of runoff and the hydrological rhythm of natural runoff shows that the rvmf method is reasonable and has been applied in the yalong river basin 2 a multi objective optimal operation model was established to minimise the contradiction between the hydro energy generation and river ecosystem projection the pareto non inferior set of solutions for five typical years was obtained and the entropy weighted topsis model was used to determine the optimal schemes the results of the optimal operation showed that as the efrs of the river increase the cpg decreases significantly and the most affected hydropower plant is the jinping ii 3 the tradeoffs between hydro energy generation and river ecosystem projection with three optimal objectives were quantified under different scenarios s1 s6 in five typical years there are clear tradeoffs between the cpg and the arcpg and the cpg and the arcpg under different riparian ecological conditions however the tradeoff between the arcpg and aref is not significant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

4295,maintaining ecological flow and mitigating impacts on river health are among the core requirements for sustainable hydropower development designing specific operational modes to fit specific ecological conditions of rivers remains a key practical challenge for hydropower operation especially in terms of balancing the various tradeoffs among multiple objectives in the context of coordinated operation of cascade hydropower plants taking the yalong river china as an example this study develops a decision making support model that can quantitatively analyse the tradeoffs between the hydro energy generation and river ecosystem projection under different hydrological conditions the model contains three main components calculation of ecological flow multi objective optimal operation and determination of optimal schemes for the ecological flow determination we propose a revised variable monthly flow method rvmf which incorporates variations of hydrological conditions also combines the classification concept of the tennant method for these objectives we consider cascade power generation the assurance rate of cascade power generation and the assurance rate of ecological flow the preliminary application in the yalong river case has shown that 1 with the increase in environmental flow requirements of the river the cascade power generation has dropped significantly and the most affected is the jinping ii hydropower plant 2 there are clear tradeoffs between the cascade power generation and the assurance rate of cascade power generation and the cascade power generation and the assurance rate of cascade power generation under different riparian ecological conditions and 3 being able to quantify those tradeoffs provides crucial scientific evidence for stakeholder dialogue and informed decision making for hydropower operation modes that can achieve the best desirable balances between power generation and river health conservation keywords ecological operation multi objective operation cascade hydropower plants ecological flow tradeoff relationship yalong river 1 introduction concepts such as river health and ecological flow are current academic research hotspots arthington et al 2006 huang et al 2014 poff and matthews 2013 rees et al 2020 tan et al 2018 and are also the focus of attention for the comprehensive benefits of water conservancy and hydropower projects ren et al 2019 renofalt et al 2010 parish et al 2019 the multi objective optimal operation of cascade hydropower plants considering ecological flow can not only explore the possible comprehensive benefits of ecology power generation flood control water supply shipping and tourism for water conservancy and hydropower projects but also analyse the benefit tradeoff between different operation targets besides the operation can also be optimised by considering the environmental flow requirements efrs of the river reach which provides vital technical support for decision making among operators of cascade hydropower plants jiang et al 2019 ding et al 2020 chen et al 2014 currently most hydropower plants have multiple functions such as power generation flood control water supply and pursue the high efficiency utilisation of water resources and maximising economic benefits zhang et al 2019 however the modes of operation of these hydropower plants do not adequately consider the efrs of the dewatered river reach downstream of the dam causing varying degrees of damage to the river ecosystem zhou and guo 2013 magilligan nislow 2005 grill et al 2019 for instance dam construction blocks river flow cause changes in hydrological conditions and the biological habitat affect the spawning and reproduction of migratory fish leading to changes in the population and structural characteristics of the river biome gibeau et al 2017 therefore researchers take ecological factors into account during hydropower plant operation xu 2017 since schluter 1971 first proposed the theory that the operation of reservoirs should maintain the diversity of the riverine ecosystem petts and geoffrey 1996 proposed an ecologically acceptable ecological flow method and shown that 60 of the available resources are needed to maintain the river as a trout stream hughes and ziervogel 1998 first established an ecological operation model of the reservoir i e the damifr model which can simulate the effects of a variety of different release priorities recently ecological and environmental protection has received more attention and attention and related research results have become more abundant steinschneider et al 2014 developed a large scale optimal operation model to explore the contribution of optimal operation management of large scale hydropower plants to ecological benefit tsai et al 2015 employed a hybrid artificial neural network to quantify the relationship between flow regimes and fish communities and guided the ecological operation of the shihmen reservoir in northern taiwan huang et al 2019 quantitatively analysed the tradeoffs among social economic and ecological benefits during the flood season for the three gorges project china and the results indicated that a smaller flood peak leads to less sediment and p transports to the downstream similarly zhang et al 2019 established ecological operation models of cascade hydropower plants and quantified the interaction between power generation and degree of ecological flow satisfaction under different modes of operation recently feng et al 2020 developed a novel multi strategy gravitational search algorithm and applied it to the ecological operation problem of the wu hydropower system which can make obvious reductions in the inappropriate ecological water volume the determination of ecological flow is the prerequisite and basis for the study of the ecological operation of hydropower plants zhang et al 2019 the ecological flow of the river is defined as the proper flow needed for rivers to maintain the health of the river ecosystem and ensure the survival and development of human beings poff and matthews 2013 the main ecological flow methods are hydrological methods hydraulic methods habitat simulation methods and holistic methods pastor et al 2014 respectively among these methods the hydrology method is the earliest method to calculate ecological flow and it is also the most widely used method because it has the advantages of a lower data demand simple operation and lower cost pastor et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 comprehensively considered the 7q10 method hydrological method rva hydrological method and river2d model habitat simulation method to compute the comprehensive ecological water demand of the study area and established three ecological operation models to quantify the relationship between power generation and ecological system protection the research results showed that power generation and ecological demand are mutually restrictive and conflicting shadkam et al 2016 calculated the environmental flow requirements of high salt lakes based on the variable monthly flow vmf method hydrological method and estimated that 3 7 109 m3 a 1 water was needed to preserve urmia lake until recently most research on the ecological operation of hydropower plants employs a single target ecological flow to characterise the efrs of the dewatered river reach downstream of the dam such as ecological base flow which is used to maintain the vital ecosystem of the river ignoring other ecological conditions e g optimum excellent and good ecological conditions wu et al 2011 also relatively few studies have focused on the tradeoffs between hydropower production and river ecosystem projection considering different efrs of the downstream river reach for the cascade hydropower plants some existing studies have assessed the tradeoff between human needs and the riverine ecosystem with optimizing the operation strategies xu 2020 taken a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii to solve the multi objective optimal operation to tradeoff between efrs and agricultural irrigation xu et al 2020a developed a multi objective optimization model to quantitatively analyse the tradeoffs between hydropower generation and biodiversity conservation the research results showed that the optimal operation of reservoirs is effective for maintaining ecological flow in the downstream river reach of hydropower plants the main aim of this study is to quantify the tradeoffs between the hydro energy generation and river ecosystem projection under various riparian ecological conditions in different hydrological conditions following a decision making support model in this study a revised ecological flow method is firstly proposed to determine the efrs under different ecological conditions in downstream river reach of hydropower plants then a decision making support model is developed which contains three main components calculation of ecological flow multi objective optimal operation and determination of optimal schemes finally the cascade hydropower plants of the lower reaches of the yalong river basin in china are taken a research case study and the multi objective optimal operation model is solved by nsga ii algorithm and the tradeoffs between three optimal objectives are evaluated the present research results can provide scientific evidence for the ecological restoration and protection of the lower reaches of the yalong river and at the same time provide a reference for the ecological operation of cascade hydropower plants under various ecological conditions 2 methodology an ecological flow method revised variable monthly flow rvmf was proposed for a variety of ecological conditions based on the variable monthly flow vmf method and was combined with the classification concept in the tennant method this paper established six ecological scenarios based on the ecological flow calculation results of the rvmf method a multi objective optimal operation model was constructed under three objectives i e cascade power generation assurance rate of cascade power generation and assurance rate of cascade power generation which was solved by the nsga ii algorithm to obtain the pareto optimal sets of solutions the optimal or recommended schemes were determined by a multi objective decision making method the entropy weighted topsis method these methods or models were established to analyse the relationship between power generation and ecosystem protection quantitatively the flow chart through the methods used in this study is shown in fig 1 2 1 calculation of ecological flow at present there are more than 200 ecological flow methods tharme 2003 which are mainly classified into four types hydrological methods tennant method tennant 1976 iha and rva hydraulic rating methods r2cross habitat simulation methods wua and river2d and holistic methods eloha pastor et al 2014 these methods have their advantages and disadvantages and the advantage of hydrological methods is that they are fast straightforward ecological flow methods for use in preliminary assessments or when ecological data sets are unavailable the tennant method tennant 1976 is an empirical relationship between flow and habitat quality established based on observational data and is the most widely used hydrological method in the world the method is simple and convenient to use because it only needs historical flow data to determine the environmental flow requirements efrs of the river which have macroscopic guiding significance the tennant method qualitatively describes the habitat as eight ecological conditions based on a specific percentage of the annual mean flow maf which are severe degradation poor or minimum fair or degrading good excellent outstanding optimum range and flushing or maximum respectively however the method does not reflect the high flow intermediate flow and low flow months of the ecological flow during the year thus the tennant method is suitable for large and perennial rivers but not for seasonal rivers the variable monthly flow vmf method is an ecological flow method developed by pastor et al 2014 which was a hydrological method this method uses an algorithm to classify the flow regime into high intermediate and low flow months and takes intra annual variability into account by allocating efrs with a percentage of mean monthly flow mmf which increases the protection of freshwater ecosystems during the low flow season the vmf method offers better performance compared with the other three widely used hydrological methods tennant method smakhtin method smakhtin et al 2004 and tessmann method however it is designed to achieve a fair ecological condition for river flow which does not take into account other ecological conditions such as poor good and excellent conditions although the grading standard of the tennant method is not universal the grading idea of an arithmetic progression is based on many field observations hydraulic analysis and statistical analysis which have been universally recognised tharme 2003 in the present work we revised the vmf method based on the ecological flow standard of the tennant method and proposed an ecological flow method revised vmf rvmf for multiple ecological conditions that is based on a specific percentage 10 of the mmf the ecological conditions of the river were qualitatively described by six levels poor fair good excellent outstanding and optimum respectively the vmf method allocated water for freshwater ecosystems in fair ecological conditions and the corresponding ecological flow in different months is 30 mmf in high flow months 45 mmf in intermediate flow months and 60 mmf in low flow months pastor et al 2014 this paper referred to the ecological flow classification standard of the tennant method and used 10 of mmf as the minimum ecological flow which was a poor ecological condition at the same time five levels were set from the ecological condition fair to the ecological condition optimum by gradually increasing the mmf by 10 when the ecological flow is 100 mmf the optimum ecological condition is reached table 1 the specific calculation formula of ecological flow is as follows 1 ef α m m f where ef is the ecological flow of the river m3 s α is the flow coefficient see table 1 for specific values for example when the hydrological season is high flow months and the ecological condition of the river is poor α is equal to 10 mmf is the mean monthly flow m3 s 2 2 multi objective optimal operation model for cascade hydropower plants 2 2 1 objective functions the main objective of cascade hydropower plants operation is to maximize the power generation benefits so this study considers cascade power generation as an objective in multi objective optimal operation the main goal of the ecological operation of hydropower plants is to ensure that the discharge flow meets the water demands of the downstream river ecosystems thus the ecological benefits of the operation of cascade hydropower plants are expressed by the assurance rate of ecological flow of the downstream river in this study also this study considers various ecological conditions in the downstream river moreover in addition for in conduit hydropower plants assurance output may not be met when large amounts of water are used to meet the water needs of downstream river ecosystems rather than for power generation therefore we took the assurance rate of cascade power generation as one operation objective the three objectives are in a mutually competitive relationship and the corresponding functions are described as follows 1 maximum cascade power generation cpg 2 e 1 m a x i 1 n t 1 t η i h i t q i t δ t where e 1 is the maximum annual power generation of cascade hydropower plants 108 kwh n is the number of reservoirs t is the numbers of months in a year t 12 η i is comprehensive power coefficient of the i th hydropower plant h i t is the average head at time t m q i t is the turbine release while producing power m3 s δ t is the time step s 2 the maximum assurance rate of cascade power generation arcpg 3 e 2 m a x 1 n t i 1 n t 1 t p i t 100 4 p i t 0 n i t n i m i n 1 n i t n i m i n where e 2 is the assurance rate of cascade power generation to the total number of periods n i m i n is guaranteed output of the i th hydropower plant mw 3 the maximum assurance rate of ecological flow aref 5 e 3 m a x 1 n t i 1 n t 1 t m i t 100 6 m i t 0 ef i t eft i t 1 ef i t eft i t where e 3 is the assurance rate of ecological flow in the river section to the total number of periods ef i t and eft i t are the ecological flow and target ecological flow of the downstream river of plant i at time t respectively m3 s and the eft i t is determined by the rvmf method proposed in this study 2 2 2 constraint conditions the multi objective optimal operation model is subject to the following constraints 1 water balance constraint 6 v i t 1 v i t i i t q i t δ t e i t l i t where v i t 1 and v i t refer to the average storage of reservoir i in the t 1 th and t th time steps respectively m3 i i t and q i t are the average inflow and outflow of reservoir i at time t respectively m3 s e i t is the evaporation of reservoir i at time t m3 l i t is the leakage of water from reservoir i m3 2 water level constraints 7 z i t min z i t z i t max where z i t is the average water level of the reservoir i at time t z i t min and z i t max are the minimum and maximum water level limits of reservoir i at time t respectively m 3 discharge flow constraints 8 0 q i t q i t max where q i t max is the maximum discharge from reservoir i at time t m3 s 4 output constraints 9 0 n i t n i m a x where n i m a x is the maximum power output limit of hydropower plant i at time t mw 2 2 3 constraint handling strategy here we developed a constraint handling method through constraint transformation based on the characteristics of the actual operation of cascade hydropower plants the optimal operation of cascade power plants mainly includes three constraints of water level discharge flow and output for the constraints of water level discharge flow firstly we employed the water level as a decision variable then we converted the maximum flow constraint into a water level interval through the water balance equation finally the intersection of the water level constraint interval and the water level interval obtained by the discharge flow constraint conversion is taken to obtain the feasible region of the decision variable for the output constraint the upper limit is taken when the output at time i is greater than the upper limit of the output of the hydropower plant in this way the numerous constraints of the original problem are converted into the water level restrictions of each reservoir in each operation period which is relatively simple to deal with 2 2 4 solution method at present the research into the algorithm for solving the optimal operation model of hydropower plants has achieved fruitful results according to the number of objectives it is mainly divided into single objective optimisation algorithms linear programming dynamic programming non linear programming optimal recursive algorithm etc and multi objective optimisation algorithms multiple target genetic algorithms multi objective particle swarm optimisation multi objective differential evolution algorithms etc the above optimal operation model belongs to a multi objective multi constrained multi dimensional and non linear complex optimisation problem thus we selected the fast elitist multi objective genetic algorithm nsga ⅱ deb et al 2002 which has the advantages of rapidity and good convergence also the algorithm is widely used in solving the multi objective optimal operation of hydropower plants boyaghchi and sohbatloo 2018 huang et al 2019 the general procedure of nsga ⅱ is shown in fig s1 modified from li et al 2018 2 3 multi objective decision making model pareto optimal solutions could be obtained after solving the multi objective optimal operation problem of cascade hydropower plants decision makers need to finally obtain the optimal or recommended schemes through the multi objective decision making model the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution topsis method had no strict restrictions and requirements in terms of the number of indicators also referred to as criteria samples and data the method has been widely used in multi index and multi scheme decision analysis problems and is also an effective and standard decision making optimisation method liu and yin 2019 xu et al 2020b the present research employed the entropy weighted topsis method which could avoid the irrationality of the subjective weighting of the traditional topsis method hussain et al 2020 2 3 1 entropy weight method the entropy method is an objective weighting method which only relies on the discreteness of the data itself and has the characteristics of strong operability and objectivity in the evaluation process the higher the degree of dispersion of an indicator is the greater the weight of the indicator hussain et al 2020 the specific calculation steps are as follows step 1 indicator normalisation if the a ij is the benefit indicator the indicator normalisation is followed as eq 10 if the a ij is the cost indicator the indicator normalisation is followed as eq 11 10 a ij a ij m i n a ij max a ij m i n a ij 11 a ij max a ij a ij max a ij m i n a ij step 2 calculate the proportion of the i th sample value with normalisation under the j th indicator p ij 12 p ij a ij i 1 n a ij where a ij is the i th sample value with normalisation under the j th indicator step 3 calculate the entropy value of the j th indicator 13 e j 1 ln n i 1 n p ij ln p ij i j 1 2 n where e j is the entropy value of the j th indicator n represents many alternatives step 4 calculate the weight of the j th indicator u j 14 u j 1 e j n j 1 n e j 2 3 2 topsis method hwang and yoon hwang and yoon 1981 proposed the topsis method which is a powerful and commonly used analysis method for multi objective decision making problems based on the idea that the best alternative should have the smallest distance i e euclidean distance from the ideal solution the topsis method is used to estimate distances to both ideal and anti ideal solutions and is a useful and straightforward method for ranking many desirable alternatives to identify the closest to ideal solutions hussain et al 2020 the main steps of the topsis method could be elaborated as follows step 1 construct a standardised initial matrix z 15 z z 11 z 21 z 12 z 22 z 1 n z 2 n z m 1 z m 2 z mn step 2 construct a normalised weight matrix here the entropy method was used to calculate the indicator weight w w 1 w 2 w n then the weighted normalised decision matrix was estimated by using eq 14 with the performance value of the normalised matrix 16 r z d i a g w r ij w j z ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n where diag w is the diagonal matrix corresponding to the indicator weight w step 3 calculate the ideal and anti ideal solutions calculate the ideal and anti ideal solutions s and s based on the weighting matrix s s 1 s 2 s n s s 1 s 2 s n the ideal values s j and s j are estimated by using eq 15 17 s j max 1 i m r ij s j min 1 i m r ij step 4 compute the euclidean distance the separation of each alternative from the positive and negative ideal solution is given below respectively 18 d i j 1 n s j r ij 2 i 1 2 m 19 d i j 1 n s j r ij 2 i 1 2 m step 5 calculate the performance score value 20 c i d i d i d i i 1 2 m where c i is the performance score value c i 0 1 step 6 finally the ranking of alternatives is set based on the performance score value 3 case study 3 1 study area we selected the cascade hydropower plants in the lower reach of the yalong river as a case study the yalong river is the largest tributary of the jinsha river in china with a total length of 1571 km a natural drop of 3830 m an annual runoff of 60 9 billion m3 a drainage basin area of approximately 136 000 km2 and average annual precipitation of 500 to 2470 mm the basin has abundant water resources and is one of the most critical water resources for strategic reserve areas in china five cascade hydropower plants have been built in the lower reach of the yalong river namely jinping i jinping ii guandi ertan and tongzilin respectively jinping i is a yearly regulating reservoir ertan is a seasonal regulating reservoir guandi and tongzilin have daily regulating capacity and jinping ii is an in conduit hydropower plant with a dewatered river reach of 119 km between the water intake and the plant yu et al 2019 the case study is generalised into the form of two reservoirs and five levels that is the reservoir capacities of jinping ii guandi and tongzilin reservoirs are generalised to equivalent storage capacity and the corresponding reservoir water level is a fixed value taking the average of the normal water level and the dead water level throughout the entire period the distribution of hydropower plants on the yalong river and their characteristic parameters are shown in fig 2 and table 2 3 2 basic data the flood season in the yalong river basin lasts from june to october and the reservoir reaches its normal water level at the end of october therefore the hydrological year and the scheduling period of the basin were set to run from november to october five typical years were selected based on the streamflow data from the cascade hydropower plants from 1958 to 2018 i e wet year 2012 p 10 relatively wet year 2008 p 30 normal year 2015 p 50 relatively dry year 2002 p 70 and dry year 2006 p 90 used for input of the multi objective optimal operation model the typical yearly inflow to the jinping i hydropower plant is shown in fig s2 3 3 scenarios three periods were classified based on the rvmf method in the yalong river basin i e high flow months june to october intermediate flow months may november and december and low flow months january to april the efrs of the jinping i are listed in table 3 when the ecological condition of the river is poor the average ecological flow is 14 58 mmf when the ecological conditions are optimum the average ecological flow is 83 75 mmf the jinping ii is an in conduit hydropower plant and the diversion gate is located 7 5 km downstream of the dam site at jinping i when the jinping ii power plant diverts the water to generate electricity it will form a dewatered river reach of 119 km dahewan reach between the water intake and the plant the relationship between the ecological flow of the dewatered river reach and jinping i and ii power plants can be expressed as table 4 21 q j p 1 t θ q e t t 1 2 t 22 q j p 1 t q j p 2 t θ q e t t 1 2 t where q j p 1 t is the outflow of jinping i at time t m3 s q e t is the ecological flow of dahewan reach at time t m3 s q j p 2 t is diversion flow of jinping ii at time t m3 s θ is the slack variable θ 0 1 and its value is equal to the ecological flow satisfaction of the cascade hydropower plants according to the ecological conditions in the river six scenarios of ecological flow were established namely s1 s6 as listed in table 3 scenario s1 means that only the minimum ecological flow is considered for the operation of hydropower plants reference scenario which is also the current operating mode of most hydropower plants considering ecological flow at the same time s6 is the scenario where the ecological flow reaches the level of the optimum ecological conditions in the river 4 results 4 1 rationality of ecological flow method the determination of the ecological flow is the prerequisite and basis for the study of the ecological operation of hydropower plants an ecological flow method rvmf was proposed under a variety of ecological conditions and its rationality was the critical point of the paper also jinping ii is an in conduit power plant which has formed a 119 km dewatered river reach dahewan reach between the water intake and the power plant the mode of operation of the power plant had the most significant influence on the ecology of the dahewan reach therefore dahewan reach was taken as an example to discuss the rationality of the rvmf method the tennant method is an empirical relationship between ecological flow and habitat quality based on observational data and is also the most widely used hydrological method in the world tennant 1976 in this paper the rvmf method and the tennant method were used to calculate the ecological flow under the six scenarios of the dahewan reach and the calculation results were compared and analysed the calculation results of the rvmf method were consistent with the changing trend of natural flow in dahewan reach which could reflect the seasonal change of ecological flow to a certain extent in contrast the change of the tennant method is singular during a given year only reflecting the difference between flood season and dry season fig 3 the natural flow characteristics of rivers constitute the integrity of the ecosystem hydrological rhythm refers to the periodic and rhythmic changes in the hydrologic regime of rivers and lakes and is closely connected with the riverine ecosystem when the hydrological rhythm changes it will affect the reproduction growth and development of aquatic organisms to a certain extent wheeler et al 2017 the distribution of hotspots on monthly scales of standardised natural flow and ecological flow divide by the maximum value of the corresponding flow is shown in fig 4 the comparative analysis shows that the hydrological rhythm of natural mmf increases month by month from march to july and decreases month by month from august to february the rvmf method simulates the hydrological rhythm of ecological flow in a manner consistent with the natural flow in contrast the calculation results of the tennant method do not change significantly during the year this means that the tennant method cannot reflect the natural change in hydrological rhythm which may cause the abundance of some aquatic organisms that are highly dependent on hydrological rhythms to decrease or disappear together the rvmf method is deemed to have been more reasonable than the tennant method at present there have been some relevant research results on ecological base flow in the dahewan reach of the yalong river wang et al 2007 calculated the minimum ecological flow in dahewan reach using hydraulic methods and their results showed that 45 m3 s of discharge from the sluice gate in the dry season can meet the living conditions of fish of about 95 of the river section under hydraulic factors prevailing in the dewatered river reach of jinping ii hydropower plant chen et al 2014 combined the low power generation loss and optimal ecological flow plan and recommended a discharge flow of 36 50 m3 s in the dahewan reach in the dry season which can ensure that at least 50 of the target fish habitat in the river is protected besides the actual operation of the ecological sluice gate in the jinping ii hydropower plant must pass 45 74 m3 s to ensure the minimum ecological flow in the dahewan reach here we employed the rvmf method to calculate the minimum ecological flow the ecological condition is poor the dry season flow is 67 4 m3 s which agrees with previous studies chen et al 2014 wang et al 2007 and is also closer to the actual operating results to further illustrate the rationality of the rvmf method we selected a case study to compare and analyse the calculation results of ecological flow wan and xia 2007 calculated the minimum ecological flow at the reba dam site in the upper reaches of the yalong river through five ecological flow methods which are tennant method texas method minimum flow method hydraulic radius method and wetted perimeter method respectively fig 5 shows the comparison of the annual average minimum ecological flow at the reba dam site calculated by different methods it can be seen that the minimum ecological flow at the reba dam site is between 36 3 46 8 m3 s with an average value of 41 2 m3 s which is consistent with the results calculated by the rvmf method in this study 43 7 m3 s in summary the rvmf method proposed is reasonable and reliable to a certain extent 4 2 cascade hydropower plants operation results analysis in a normal year the pareto non inferior set of solutions and the best compromise solutions of the six ecological scenarios s1 s6 are shown in fig 6 a f the cpg and the arcpg restrict and conflict with each other showing a significant negative correlation that is as the cpg increases the arcpg decreases in contrast the correlation between the cpg and the aref is insignificant and the correlation between the arcpg and the aref is also insignificant besides this study constructs the three objectives of cpg arcpg and aref as the evaluation indicators system of operation schemes and uses the pareto non inferior set of solutions as the input of the multi objective decision making model the optimal schemes and their values of scenarios s1 s6 are determined by the entropy based topsis model as shown in table s1 and their weights as shown in table s2 among them the cpg the arcpg and the aref for scenario s1 and scenario s6 are 777 25 108 kwh 93 33 and 100 584 17 108 kwh 78 33 and 100 respectively the arefs for scenarios s1 s6 are all 100 which shows that while the cascade hydropower plants in the yalong river are pursuing power generation benefits they can meet the optimum ecological condition of the river however the power loss of the cascade hydropower plants is relatively significant compared with s1 at this time 193 08 108 kwh also as the demand for the ecological flow of rivers increases the power generation of the yalong river cascade hydropower plants has dropped significantly besides we analysed the changes of power generation efficiency indicators of cascade hydropower plants for optimal schemes under six ecological scenarios namely the rate of power generation water consumption the water through the turbine per unit of hydropower electricity generation chang et al 2017 as summarised in table 4 it can be seen from the table that the ecological flow demand of rivers increases and the power generation efficiency of cascade hydropower plants decreases among them scenario s1 has the highest power generation efficiency and its rate of water consumption is 2 78 m3 kwh and scenario s6 is the lowest with a rate of water consumption of 3 25 m3 kwh furthermore fig 7 shows the power generation of five power plants under scenarios s1 s6 in a normal year only the power generation of jinping ⅱ hydropower plant has changed significantly from 253 41 s1 to 63 92 108 kwh s2 and the other four plants have little change this shows that different efrs in the downstream river reach mainly affect the power generation of jinping ⅱ hydropower plant and then affect the cpg the main reason is that the jinping ⅱ hydropower plant is an in conduit power plant when the optimal ecological condition s6 of the river is reached most of the outflow from jinping ⅰ hydropower plant is used for the ecological needs of the dahewan reach rather than the power generation of the jinping ⅱ hydropower plant this means that for the dammed hydropower plant e g jinping ⅰ the tradeoff relationship between ecological flow and power generation is weak because the power flow can meet the efrs of downstream rivers however for the in conduit power plant jinping ⅱ there is a significant tradeoff relationship between ecological flow and power generation so the ecological problems of its dewatered river reach need to be paid attention to jinping i and ertan hydropower plants are controlled reservoirs with strong regulation ability in the lower reach of the yalong river basin their operating water level and outflow are closely related to the power generation of downstream power plants and the ecological flow of the river fig s3 shows the monthly operating water levels of jinping i and ertan hydropower plants under scenarios s1 s6 in a normal year the water level of the reservoir drops to the lower limit under the six scenarios which vacates enough storage capacity to ensure the safety of flood control during the flood season at the ending of the flood season the reservoir will gradually store water and it will be stored to the normal water level to ensure water use during the dry season by the end of october moreover fig s4 shows the outflow from jinping i and ertan hydropower plants under scenarios s1 s6 in a normal year the outflow from the reservoir during the dry season is less than the annual mean flow at the dam site while the opposite is true in the flood season that is the outflow from the reservoir is greater than the annual mean flow at the dam site under all six scenarios table 5 lists the cascade power loss in five typical years under scenarios s2 s6 compared to s1 reference scenario the annual average cascade power losses under scenarios s2 s6 are 60 20 89 41 115 19 136 69 and 161 91 108 kwh respectively which indicates that the ecological flow of the river has a significant effect on power generation and the operation of the cascade hydropower plants is considered such that the better the efrs of the river the higher the cascade power loss besides the effect of ecological flow on the cascade power generation is inconsistent in different typical years and the release of ecological flow in the wet year has the least influence on cascade power generation 4 3 relationship between abandoned water and ecological flow the issue of abandoned water is unavoidable in the sustainable development of hydropower and the operation and management of power plants ye et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 for example the total energy loss of abandoned water in sichuan province china in 2016 was 287 3 108 kwh ye et al 2018 which is close to 0 4 times the average power generation of the lower cascade hydropower plants in the yalong river resulting in much waste of clean energy which is not conducive to the sustainability of hydropower development here the status of abandoned water from cascade hydropower plants in the lower reach of the yalong river under five hydrological years and six ecological scenarios is analysed and the relationship between abandoned water and ecological flow is explored table 6 lists the abandoned water from the cascade hydropower plants in the lower reach of the yalong river during five hydrological years and under six ecological scenarios the issue of abandoned water in the lower reach of the yalong river mainly occurs in wet and relatively wet years while less water is discarded in normal relatively dry and dry years among them there is almost no abandonment in the dry year also we found that the degree of water abandonment in different ecological scenarios and hydrological years is inconsistent in a wet year the annual abandoned water shows a significant downward trend from scenario s1 to s6 from 318 57 to 246 72 108 m3 respectively however scenario s3 is the smallest amount of abandoned water among the six scenarios for other typical years the better to explore the problem of abandoned water for hydropower the hydrological year in which the most severe abandonment occurs was taken as an example i e the wet year and the distribution characteristics of the abandoned water of cascade hydropower plants during the year were analysed the water is mainly abandoned in the lower reach of the yalong river from july to october during the flood season and no water is abandoned in the dry season the amount of abandoned water in july is the largest and the amount of abandoned water from july to october shows a decreasing trend also we found that the cascade abandoned water decreases with the decrease of the average ecological flow under flood season showing a positive correlation fig s5 5 discussion the traditional operation of cascade hydropower plants reduces the peak discharge in flood seasons and increases the water volume in the dry season through the storage function of reservoirs at the same time these plants bring huge power generation benefits but ignore or underestimate the ecological environment impact also the modes of operation of cascade hydropower plants are closely related to the ecological health of the river in the present study the main goal of optimal operation of cascade hydropower plants is to pursue the maximization of comprehensive benefits of hydro energy generation and ecological flows and explore the tradeoff relationship of three optimal objectives under six scenarios s1 s6 in different hydrological conditions here we took a normal year as an example to illustrate the tradeoffs between two optimal objectives i e the cpg and the arcpg the cpg and the aref and the arcpg and the aref it can be seen from fig 6 that these three objectives have a certain degree of tradeoff relationship therefore when analysing the tradeoff relationship between the two objectives it is necessary to exclude the influence of the third objective on the two objectives for the arcpg and the aref discrete value we employed the controlled variable method such as analysing the tradeoff relationship between the cpg and the arcpg under the same aref at the same time the appropriate number of representative values is selected so that they can represent the entire range for the cpg continuous value we selected scenarios s2 s4 and s6 as representatives to illustrate the tradeoff relationship between the arcpg and aref 5 1 tradeoff between cascade power generation and the assurance rate of cascade power generation to illustrate the tradeoff relationship between cpg and the arcpg the pareto non inferior set of solutions are presented in fig 8 as seen in this figure there is a significant tradeoff between the two objectives under scenarios s1 s6 that is when the cpg increases the arcpg decreases also it is found that these pareto fronts have some turning points dotted circle under scenarios s1 s6 for instance for scenario s1 the arcpg slowly decreases as cpg increases from 773 80 to 777 25 108 kwh however the arcpg decreases sharply after cpg increases beyond 777 25 108 kwh fig 8 this means that cpg should be controlled at this turning point to avoid severe damage to the power generation reliability of cascade hydropower plants 5 2 tradeoff between cascade power generation and the assurance rate of ecological flow to illustrate the tradeoff relationship between cpg and the aref the pareto non inferior set of solutions are presented in fig 9 as seen in this figure there is a significant tradeoff between the cpg and the aref under scenarios s2 s6 that is when the cpg increases the aref decreases sharply it is added that the number of non inferior solutions in scenario s1 is small so we did not analyse it here this means that cpg has a remarkably adverse impact on the aref thus it is necessary to consider the tradeoff between the two objectives when decision makers choose the appropriate operation mode of cascade hydropower plants 5 3 tradeoff between the assurance rate cascade power generation and the assurance rate of ecological flow to illustrate the tradeoff relationship between the arcpg and the aref we had standardised the cpg which can more clearly show the tradeoff between these two objectives under the same cpg the pareto non inferior set of solutions are presented in fig 10 it is difficult to find a significant tradeoff relationship between the two objectives from the figure thus decision makers do not consider the tradeoff between the two objectives when they choose the appropriate operation mode of cascade hydropower plants overall there is a significant tradeoff relationship between the cpg and the arcpg and the cpg and the aref that is as the cpg increases the arcpg and the aref show a downward trend it is worth noting that there is a clear turning point in these pareto frontiers fig 8 however there is no obvious tradeoff between the arcpg and the aref therefore this reminds decision makers of the operation for cascade hydropower plants to focus on the tradeoffs between the cpg and the arcpg and the cpg and the aref 5 4 limitations and future research directions this study designs a set of methods for in depth study of the multi objective ecological operation of cascade hydropower plants including ecological flow method multi objective optimal operation model multi objective solution algorithm and multi objective decision making method the advantages and disadvantages of these methods will be briefly discussed below the revised vmf method rvmf originally proposed in this study aims to calculate the ecological flow under different river ecological conditions for the study area with only hydrological data however the rationality of this method needs to be further demonstrated in combination with more measured data including hydrology hydraulics and ecology to realize its application and promotion the nsga ⅱ algorithm has the advantages of rapidity and good convergence but its global search ability is poor and it is easy to appear early converging phenomenon the entropy weighted topsis method has no strict restrictions and requirements in terms of the number of indicators also referred to as criteria samples and data also this method can avoid the irrationality of the subjective weighting of the traditional topsis method however we found that the weights obtained by the entropy method tended to be ecological indicators table s2 therefore the combined weighting method coupled subjective and objective weighting method needs to be considered in the next research to make the calculation of weights more reasonable also we only analysed the tradeoffs between the two objectives not the overall tradeoff relationship between the three objectives in future studies in combination with external factors such as climate change population growth and the low carbon economy the uncertain analysis of the cascade optimal operation model considering multiple ecological flow warrants further research further how to quantify the economic benefits of ecological flow may be very important to the research into the benefit tradeoff of hydro energy generation and river ecosystem projection for cascade hydropower plants 6 conclusion an ecological flow method rvmf was proposed for various ecological conditions in the river based on the vmf method and combined with the classification idea of the tennant method and six ecological scenarios s1 s6 were established with concomitant calculation results a decision making support model was developed to quantify the benefit tradeoffs between the optimal objectives the main results were as follows 1 the rvmf method qualitatively describes river habitats based on a specific percentage of monthly mean flow mmf into six levels poor fair good excellent outstanding and optimum the corresponding average values of ecological flow are 14 58 43 75 53 75 63 75 73 75 and 83 75 mmf respectively the analysis of the seasonal variation of runoff and the hydrological rhythm of natural runoff shows that the rvmf method is reasonable and has been applied in the yalong river basin 2 a multi objective optimal operation model was established to minimise the contradiction between the hydro energy generation and river ecosystem projection the pareto non inferior set of solutions for five typical years was obtained and the entropy weighted topsis model was used to determine the optimal schemes the results of the optimal operation showed that as the efrs of the river increase the cpg decreases significantly and the most affected hydropower plant is the jinping ii 3 the tradeoffs between hydro energy generation and river ecosystem projection with three optimal objectives were quantified under different scenarios s1 s6 in five typical years there are clear tradeoffs between the cpg and the arcpg and the cpg and the arcpg under different riparian ecological conditions however the tradeoff between the arcpg and aref is not significant declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

gauge data is an important means of obtaining precipitation products with high accuracy and high spatial temporal resolution however due to the change of the raindrop size distribution itself and the uncertainty of the radar observational data it is an indisputable fact that a and b in the z r radar reflectivity factor z to rainfall rate r relationship are complex functions of space and time which has a great influence on the accuracy of radar rain gauge quantitative precipitation estimation qpe in this study in an effort to further improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe spatial temporal local weighted linear regression stlwlr and its corresponding regression kriging stlwlrk are proposed for merging radar and rain gauge data for qpe for which the maximum number of z r pairs in the spatial temporal neighborhood n the spatial temporal distance transformation parameter μ and the specified threshold c of e σ are three key parameters specifically cases that occurred on hainan island and the cross validation mode were used to calibrate the three key parameters and to evaluate the two methods with the relative mean absolute error rmae and bias as evaluation indicators the results show that compared with the real time adjusted z r relationship azr scheme and the two step calibration technique of radar qpe the aid scheme stlwlr and stlwlrk with optimization parameters could further improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe for 10 fold cross validation of the cases occurring on hainan island from 1 may to 31 october 2018 and for 1 hr 3 hr 6 hr 12 hr and 24 hr time scales the rmae of stlwlrk decreased by 6 3 8 4 8 4 8 2 and 7 9 respectively compared with that of the aid scheme the results also show that increasing time scale could reduce the error of radar rain gauge qpe for different methods as stlwlr is based on solid geography mathematics and radar meteorology and has been tested by a large number of cases stlwlr and its optimization parameters should have certain universality overall compared with traditional methods stlwlrk is a more robust easier to implement more accurate and less computationally expensive method keywords weather radar rain gauge quantitative precipitation estimation spatial temporal local weighted linear regression kriging 1 introduction quantitative precipitation estimation qpe products with high accuracy and high spatial temporal resolution are very valuable for monitoring and analyzing weather and climate verifying and calibrating numerical prediction models evaluating disasters caused by heavy rainfall and for distributed hydrological models at present rain gauge observation radar qpe and satellite qpe are the three main sources of precipitation observational data but these three types of data have advantages and disadvantages in terms of spatial and temporal resolution observational accuracy and coverage li et al 2016 tapiador et al 2012 therefore it has become a hot topic in recent years to fuse two or three of these datasets to realize their complementary advantages and obtain qpe products with high accuracy and high spatial temporal resolution prat and nelson 2015 tapiador et al 2012 however according to the published literature the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe is often better than that of satellite rain gauge qpe especially for qpe products over a short time scale up until now the china new generation weather radar cinrad network which is composed of more than 200 doppler weather radars over mainland china min et al 2019 has been deployed by the china meteorological administration cma cinrad network is similar to the us nexrad wsr 88d network in terms of technical system and detection capabilities and is being upgraded with dual polarization through a multi radar mosaic products covering the central and eastern regions with high spatial temporal resolution such as reflectivity can be produced min et al 2019 wang et al 2012a it has been 23 years since the first new generation weather radar was put into operation in china and a large amount of historical observational data has been accumulated the same situation may exist in other countries such as the united states compared with the new generation weather radar dual polarization and phased array weather radar are more advanced technologically but they also face the problem of how to estimate precipitation jointly with rain gauges tapiador et al 2012 therefore to improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe is of great significance not only for using the historical data from the new generation weather radar but also for the operational applications of the new generation weather radar dual polarization weather radar and phased array weather radar in the future different types of radar can produce different parameters so that there can be different precipitation estimation methods such as the z r radar reflectivity factor z to rainfall rate r relationship method the two factor method and the orthogonal polarization method bringi and chandrasekar 2001 tapiador et al 2012 but they generally contain the reflectivity factor z based on this precipitation can be estimated directly from the radar reflectivity factor up to now there have been three main methods to determine the z r relationship the first is the theoretical calculation method under certain assumptions for example under the m p distribution assumption marshall and palmer gave the classic exponential relationship between radar reflectivity factor and rainfall rate z 200r 1 6 marshall and palmer 1948 the second is the statistical method using raindrop size distribution data zhang et al 2019 2018 the third is the direct statistical method such methods can be further subdivided into optimization methods battan 1973 marshall and palmer 1948 a value averaging wan et al 2013 probability pairing ayat et al 2018 rosenfeld et al 1993 and weighted least squares pu et al 2008 due to the change of the raindrop size distribution itself and the uncertainty of the radar observational data it is an indisputable fact that a and b in the z r relationship are complex functions of space and time alfieri et al 2010 chapon et al 2008 lee and zawadzki 2005 libertino et al 2015 smith and krajewski 1993 villarini and krajewski 2010 wang et al 2012a it is not appropriate to describe z r relationship that changes with space and time with several dozens or even hundreds of z r relationships therefore spatial temporal dynamic z r relationship methods have become a hot topic of research into radar rain gauge qpe in recent years alfieri et al 2010 libertino et al 2015 wang et al 2012a however these spatial temporal dynamic z r relationship methods still have problems of low estimation accuracy or they need further correction although rain gauge correction can reduce the systematic error in the radar qpe there may still be a large local error in fact from the perspective of spatial statistics the fact that radar qpe products still need further correction may be due to the complex changes of the z r relationship not being properly modeled according to the first law of geography everything is related to everything else but near things are more related than distant things tobler 1970 therefore classical regression models or optimization methods are not particularly suitable for analyzing non stationary spatial temporal data accordingly spatial temporal local modeling methods such as moving window regression or geographically weighted regression came into being brunsdon et al 1999 fotheringham et al 2002 huang et al 2010 lloyd 2011 spatial temporal local models can be used to model the non stationarity of the spatial temporal relationship and have been widely used in soil organic carbon prediction modeling of the relationship between surface temperature and environmental factors precipitation interpolation temperature interpolation and so on li et al 2010 sun et al 2015 szymanowski et al 2014 wang et al 2012b in view of this spatial temporal local weighted linear regression was proposed for modeling the z r relationship which changes with space and time in order to further improve the accuracy of the radar rain gauge qpe in addition spatial temporal local weighted linear regression kriging was also used to check whether the qpe of the proposed method needed further correction 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hainan island 18 10 20 10 n 108 37 111 03 e is located in the tropics and has a tropical monsoon climate with sufficient water vapor sources fig 1 it is one of the regions with the highest precipitation at the same latitude in the world the precipitation on hainan island is unevenly distributed in space and time the annual precipitation is 940 8 2388 2 mm in a ring shaped distribution the rainy season generally occurs from may to october the rainy season rainfall accounts for 80 4 90 5 of the annual precipitation and is often concentrated in several heavy rains the types of precipitation on hainan island are very diverse including tropical cyclone type cold air type tropical convergence zone type southwest monsoon trough type and subtropical high margin type therefore hainan island is an ideal place to study and test radar qpe technology 2 2 dataset to illustrate the functionality of the proposed methodology three cases which occurred from 14 august to 19 october 2016 table 1 and almost all cases which occurred from 1 may to 31 october corresponding to the rainy season 2018 were selected correspondingly observational data from haikou new generation weather radar and 331 rain gauges within 150 km from the radar were collected affected by the 8th typhoon dianmu a strong tropical storm from 14 august to 19 august 2016 heavy rainfall occurred in the western and northern areas of the island within 150 km from the radar 87 rain gauges accumulated rainfall of more than 300 mm and 63 rain gauges accumulated rainfall of more than 400 mm from 12 october to 14 october 2016 there was a heavy precipitation process in the eastern half of the island within 150 km from the radar 103 rain gauges accumulated rainfall of more than 200 mm and 1 rain gauge accumulated rainfall of more than 400 mm affected by the 20th typhoon sarika a strong typhoon from 18 october to 19 october 2016 heavy rainfall occurred in the northern eastern central and western regions of the island within 150 km from the radar 90 rain gauges accumulated rainfall of more than 200 mm and 7 rain gauges accumulated rainfall of more than 300 mm as can be seen from fig 2 within 150 km from the radar there are always rain gauges with observations greater than 0 1 mm every day from 1 may to 31 october 2018 the types of these rainfall cases include convective rainfall stratiform rainfall and mixed rainfall haikou new generation weather radar fig 1 which is managed by hainan provincial meteorological service and upgraded with dual polarization in 2019 is an s band doppler radar system with a digital receiver at 118 m above sea level due to its tropical location the radar is basically unaffected by the 0 c layer during the rainy season however due to blockage by low hills and tall buildings at close range the scan volume data with an elevation angle of 0 5 degrees was influenced by partial beam blockage therefore in order to ensure the reliability of the research results only horizontal reflectivity with an elevation angle of 1 5 degrees within 150 km from the radar was used in this study fig 1 the hainan provincial meteorological service also manages the rain gauge network which consists of more than 500 rain gauges distributed over hainan island although only 331 rain gauges within 150 km from the radar were used in this study the type of all the rain gauges is tipping bucket the resolution of all the rain gauges is 0 1 mm the temporal resolution of the rain gauge data is 10 min the preliminary quality control of the observed data was carried out by setting the lower limit of 10 min rainfall of the rain gauge to 0 1 mm the raw horizontal reflectivity of each piece of scan volume data with an elevation angle of 1 5 degrees was interpolated on a cartesian grid of 1 km 1 km by the barnes formula askelson et al 2000 shapiro et al 2003 since the time resolution of the radar detection data is 6 min and that of the rain gauge is 10 min the gridded radar reflectivity was first averaged with time as the weight to match the rain gauge observations for example let t1 08 00 t2 08 10 t 1 t 2 and t 3 were three observation times of the radar for one grid point fig 3 respectively then the average radar reflectivity of this grid point could be expressed by formula 1 where 10 log z t 1 10 log z t 2 and 10 log z t 3 were the radar reflectivity of the grid point at times t 1 t 2 and t 3 generally the observation time of the radar reflectivity involved in the calculation should be within the interval t1 6 min t2 1 10 log z t 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 10 log z t 1 t 3 t 2 t 2 t 1 10 log z t 2 t 2 t 3 t 2 t 1 10 log z t 3 then for each rain gauge its rainfall and the nearest grid point s radar reflectivity were used to establish the z r pairs since z r pairs and 10logz 10logr pairs could be converted into each other they would not be distinguished in this study the z r pairs of the three cases would be treated as a whole for parameter calibration and model evaluation but the z r pairs of 1 may to 31 october 2018 would only be used for model evaluation 2 3 spatial temporal local weighted linear regression and its corresponding regression kriging according to marshall and palmer 1948 when the raindrop size distribution meets the standard diameter distribution the radar reflectivity factor z mm6 m3 and the rainfall rate r mm h satisfy the following formula 2 z a r b where a and b are coefficients related to the raindrop size distribution taking the logarithm of both sides of formula 2 the following linear formula could be obtained 3 10 log r 1 b 10 log z 10 log a b then according to formula 2 formula 3 or other variants of formula 2 the corresponding z r relationships can be obtained by using samples from different spatial temporal ranges different objective functions and different optimization methods correspondingly different radar rain gauge qpe methods can be developed alfieri et al 2010 libertino et al 2015 wan et al 2010 wang et al 2012a for example according to formula 3 wang et al 2012a proposed using real time z r pairs and linear least squares to obtain the real time z r relationship however according to existing researches when formula 3 and least squares methods were used to establish the z r relationship and to estimate precipitation there was heteroscedasticity cocks et al 2017 pu et al 2008 seo and breidenbach 2002 wang et al 2012a which implied the need for a weighted linear regression model 4 β x t wx 1 x t w y with w as a weight matrix 5 w g 1 s 0 0 0 0 g 2 s 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 gn s where β is the estimated value of the coefficient vector 10 log a b 1 b x 1 10 log z 1 1 10 log z 2 1 10 log z n y 10 log g 1 10 log g 2 10 log g n 10 log z 1 10 log g 1 10 log z 2 10 log g 2 10 log z n 10 log g n are the observations of n z r pairs s i 1 n g i and g i mm h is the observed rainfall rate of the ith z r pair when the z r relationship cannot be established by the above method or the rainfall rate estimated by the established z r relationship is greater than a certain threshold e g 100 mm 10 min the empirical z r relationship z 40r 2 5 which was established by libertino et al 2015 will be used for qpe in this study the spatial temporal local weighted linear regression stlwlr means that when using the above mentioned weighted linear regression to construct the instantaneous z r relationship of any radar reflectivity grid point at most n such as n 30 z r pairs in its spatial temporal neighborhood were used fig 4 this type of method requires the conversion of space and time scales during modeling according to the research of huang et al 2010 formula 6 could be used to define spatial temporal distance 6 d u i u 0 2 v i v 0 2 μ t i t 0 2 where u 0 v 0 t 0 and u i v i t i are the spatial temporal coordinates of spatial temporal positions x 0 and x i respectively and μ is the spatial temporal distance transformation parameter which can be determined according to prior knowledge or using the cross validation method huang et al 2010 for one radar grid point or sample point once μ has been determined the spatial temporal distances from this point to the sample points in a certain period e g 1 h can be calculated the above samples are sorted by distance and a certain number of nearest samples are taken at most n then the z r relationship for this point could be constructed using these samples and stlwlr the difference is that the work of alfieri et al 2010 and libertino et al 2015 used fixed and semi fixed cylindrical spatial temporal neighborhood and this study will adopt an adaptive semi ellipsoidal spatial temporal neighborhood for real time estimation the real time adjusted z r relationship azr scheme wang et al 2012a could be regarded as a special case of stlwlr but unlike azr as long as conditions permitted stlwlr was used to estimate radar precipitation regardless of the magnitude of the correlation coefficient in addition following libertino et al 2015 a time window of 1 h was also used if the z r relationship is stable the a and b obtained by stlwlr will be almost the same at different spatial temporal points however if the z r relationship is not stable the a and b obtained by stlwlr will be different from point to point therefore stlwlr has the potential to further improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe after the z r relationships of all radar reflectivity grid points at the same time e g 08 10 had been constructed using stlwlr the radar precipitation estimates could be obtained then the radar precipitation estimates r i of all rain gauges could be removed from the observations g i and formulas 7 and 8 could be used to estimate the residual e x 0 at location x 0 without an observation station where ω i is the ordinary kriging weight and n is the number of neighbors for kriging interpolation finally the estimated precipitation value p x 0 of location x 0 could be obtained with formula 9 the first part of the right hand side of formula 9 represents the radar precipitation estimate obtained by stlwlr and the second part represents the kriging interpolation value of the regression residuals in this study the variogram was estimated dynamically every 10 min the spherical exponential and the gaussian theoretical variogram were estimated firstly then the theoretical variogram for which the mean squared error between empirical variogram and theoretical variogram was a minimum was taken 7 e x i g i r i 8 e x 0 i 1 n ω i e x i 9 p x 0 r x 0 e x 0 the above interpolation method is called stlwlr kriging stlwlrk stlwlrk is a method which could integrate stlwlr and kriging to achieve more accurate estimation when the regression residuals are still spatially autocorrelated hengl et al 2007 commonly used optimal interpolation correction methods can be regarded as special cases of stlwlrk including the two step calibration technique of radar qpe the aid scheme wang et al 2012a as a comparison two schemes similar to the schemes in wang et al 2012a which only use z r pairs from the same time when constructing the z r relationship were also carried out 2 4 quality control of z r pairs based on spatial temporal local weighted linear regression in order to obtain a relatively reasonable z r relationship the usual practice is to remove z r pairs where z or r is null and carry out a quality control exercise on the remaining z r pairs wang et al 2012a in this study stlwlr was also used for the quality control of z r pairs that is for each z r pair an stlwlr model was constructed using at most n z r pairs in its spatial temporal neighborhood let e was the error calculated with formula 7 for the z r pair requiring quality control and σ was the standard deviation of the corresponding stlwlr model which could be calculated with formula 10 10 σ 1 n 1 i 1 n e x i 1 n i 1 n e x i 2 where n was the number of z r pairs actually used if e σ was greater than a specified threshold c fig 5 the z r pair was judged to be an outlier and the z r pair would not be used to construct the z r relationship but considering the construction process of the z r pairs almost all of the z r pairs would participate in the evaluation of the model aggarwal 2013 unless e σ was very large e g bigger than c 0 where c 0 30000 for this study if the number of z r pairs in the spatial temporal neighborhood was not enough the z r pair requiring quality control would not be controlled 2 5 parameter calibration and model evaluation as mentioned above the parameters n μ and c are three key parameters of stlwlr and stlwlrk for given situations the size of n determines the size of the spatial temporal neighborhood if n is too large only the z r relationship in the average sense could be obtained while if n is too small a stable z r relationship may not be obtained the size of μ determines how many kilometers a 10 min interval is equivalent to in space if μ is equal to 0 the z r paris in the neighborhood will mainly consist of z r paris in the time dimension of several stations while if μ is equal to the z r paris in the neighborhood will mainly consist of z r paris in the spatial dimension neither of which are conducive to modeling the z r relationship that changes with space and time the size of c determines which samples are involved in the construction of the z r relationship if c is too large lots of weak outliers will be involved in the construction of the z r relationship while if c is too small lots of normal data will be judged to be outliers and cannot be used to construct the z r relationship which is equivalent to reducing the station density therefore all three parameters need to be calibrated and optimized in this study the calibration of the three parameters of the methods was carried out by 10 fold cross validation with the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 the evaluations of the methods were carried out by 10 fold cross validation of the above three cases and almost all cases occurring from 1 may to 31 october 2018 in particular all rain gauges for each case were randomly divided into 10 nearly equal parts during each cross validation process for simplicity the three parameters were optimized in sequence first under the assumption that μ was equal to 50 and c was equal to c 0 n was set to change from 5 to 40 in steps of 5 and the optimized value of n was obtained second under the assumption that c was equal to c 0 and the condition that n was the above optimal value μ was set to change from 1 and then 5 to 50 in steps of 5 and the optimized value of μ was obtained third under the condition that n and μ were the optimal values above c was set to change from 1 to 3 in steps of 0 2 and the optimized value of c was obtained the feasibility of the approach was confirmed by the research results from this study the selection of evaluation indicators is also a very important issue because it is related not only to the evaluation of model performance but also to the calibration of model parameters up to now a wide variety of evaluation indicators have been used for the evaluation of qpe algorithms or product accuracy such as the mean error me alfieri et al 2010 montopoli et al 2017 yang et al 2016 the mean absolute error mae alfieri et al 2010 martinaitis et al 2018 wei and hsieh 2020 the root mean square error rmse alfieri et al 2010 wei and hsieh 2020 yang et al 2016 montopoli et al 2017 or the mean square error the correlation coefficient cc martinaitis et al 2018 wang et al 2012a montopoli et al 2017 the bias bias martinaitis et al 2018 nelson et al 2015 wang et al 2012a the relative mean error rme lim et al 2014 the relative mean absolute error rmae lim et al 2014 wei and hsieh 2020 yang et al 2016 the relative root mean square error rrmse wei and hsieh 2020 montopoli et al 2017 among others however me mae and rmse are absolute evaluation indicators and cannot be used to compare different cases rmse cc and rrmse are susceptible to outliers and rme can be derived from bias whereas bias and rmae are relative evaluation indicators which means they can even be used to compare different cases from different areas also they are not susceptible to outliers therefore in this study bias and rmae were used for parameter calibration and model evaluation however for comparison with other studies cc was also retained 11 mae 1 n i j r ij g ij 12 cc i j g ij g ij r ij r ij i j g ij g ij 2 r ij r ij 2 13 bias r ij g ij 14 rmae mae g ij where r ij is the hourly estimated rainfall at the ith hour of the jth rain gauge g ij is the hourly observed rainfall at the ith hour of the jth rain gauge r ij is the average hourly estimated rainfall of all rain gauges and g ij is the average hourly observed rainfall of all rain gauges formulas 11 14 could also be used for other time scales parameter calibration and model evaluation such as 3 hr 6 hr etc in this study rainfall will first be estimated on the 10 min time scale and then accumulated to 1 hr 3 hr 6 hr 12 hr and 24 hr time scales for parameter calibration and model evaluation 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the effect of parameter n on the accuracy of stlwlr fig 6 shows the 10 fold cross validation rmae and bias of stlwlr for the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 under the assumption that μ was equal to 50 and c was equal to c 0 when n was set to vary from 5 to 40 as n changes from 5 to 40 for different time scales the rmae first decreases and then increases for the same n as the time scale increases from 1 hr to 24 hr the rmae gradually becomes smaller as n changes from 5 to 40 the bias the bias of different time scales is the same is very close to but larger than 1 in summary through trade offs the optimized value of n was set to 10 the conclusion increasing time scale could reduce the error of radar rain gauge qpe is reflected in the following different models and their configurations which will not be explained hereafter 3 2 evaluation of the effect of parameter μ on the accuracy of stlwlr fig 7 displays the 10 fold cross validation rmae and bias of stlwlr for the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 under the assumption that c was equal to c 0 and the condition that n was 10 when μ was set to vary from 1 and then 5 to 50 in steps of 5 as μ changes from 1 and then 5 to 50 in steps of 5 for different time scales the rmae of stlwlr first decreases and then increases as an approximation when μ is equal to 25 the rmae of different time scales reach smaller values as μ changes from 1 and then 5 to 50 in steps of 5 the bias is very close to but larger than 1 in summary in this study the optimized value of μ was set to 25 3 3 evaluation of the effect of parameter c on the accuracy of stlwlr fig 8 shows the 10 fold cross validation rmae and bias of stlwlr for the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 under the condition that n was equal to 10 and μ was equal to 25 when c was set to vary from 1 to 3 in steps of 0 2 as c changes from 1 to 3 for different time scales the rmae of stlwlr first decreases and then increases as an approximation when c is equal to 2 0 the rmae of different time scales reach smaller values as c changes from 1 to 3 the bias gradually becomes bigger when c is equal to 2 2 the bias is closest to 1 in summary in this study the optimized value of c was set to 2 0 3 4 comparison of estimation accuracy for different methods fig 9 displays the 10 fold cross validation rmae and bias of azr aid stlwlr and stlwlrk for the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 for stlwlr and stlwlrk the parameters n μ and c were set to 10 25 and 2 0 respectively which were all the optimized values above for comparison azr and aid were also carried out under the same quality control conditions as can be seen for rmae the improvement from azr to aid is great while the difference between stlwlr and stlwlrk is very small for different time scales further calculations show that for 1 hr 3 hr 6 hr 12 hr and 24 hr time scales the rmae of stlwlrk decreased by 5 6 9 8 11 9 12 7 and 13 6 respectively compared with that of aid for different time scales the rmae of aid was greater than that of stlwlrk which all passed the t test of 0 01 significance level moreover for all time scales of different cases the rmae of stlwlrk was not greater than that of aid at the 0 01 significance level similar to rmae for bias the improvement from azr to aid is great while the difference between stlwlr and stlwlrk is very small fig 10 shows the scatter plots and q q plots between observed rainfall and rainfall estimated by stlwlrk 10 fold cross validation for 1 hr 6 hr 12 hr and 24 hr time scales the characteristics of the scatter plots and q q plots at different time scales show good correspondence with the two evaluation indicators of bias and rmae at the same time the phenomenon of heteroscedasticity is weakened fig 11 and fig 12 are the same as fig 9 and fig 10 respectively but for the cases occurring from 1 may to 31 october 2018 overall the results of azr aid stlwlr and stlwlrk for the cases occurring from 1 may to 31 october 2018 are similar to but not as good as the results for the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 for 1 hr 3 hr 6 hr 12 hr and 24 hr time scales the rmae of stlwlrk decreased by 6 3 8 4 8 4 8 2 and 7 9 respectively compared with that of aid for different time scales the rmae of aid was greater than that of stlwlrk which all passed the t test of 0 01 significance level further calculations show that at the 0 01 significance level for all time scales of different months the rmae of stlwlrk was not greater than that of aid 4 discussion a large number of studies have shown that the z r relationship not only changes with geographical location season radar detection distance precipitation type and precipitation intensity even for the same precipitation process the z r relationship could change at different locations and times in addition some studies also indicate that the changes of the z r relationship can also be related to uncertainty in data analysis estimation methods or observational data villarini and krajewski 2010 therefore when using the z r relationship to estimate surface precipitation both the temporal evolution of the z r relationship and the spatial evolution of the z r relationship need to be considered in this study in order to further improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe spatial temporal local weighted linear regression stlwlr and its corresponding regression kriging stlwlrk were proposed for merging radar and rain gauge data for qpe the maximum number of z r pairs in the spatial temporal neighborhood n the spatial temporal distance transformation parameter μ and the specified threshold c of e σ were the three key parameters of stlwlr and stlwlrk three cases that occurred on hainan island from 14 august to 19 october 2016 were used to calibrate the three key parameters and to evaluate the two methods with the relative mean absolute error rmae and bias as evaluation indicators to further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods almost all cases occurring on hainan island from 1 may to 31 october 2018 were also used to evaluate the two methods in addition two traditional methods azr and aid were also studied as controls the results show that under the same conditions whether for rmae or bias the difference between stlwlr and stlwlrk was very small which indicated that stlwlr was better at modeling the z r relationship that changed with space and time this is also why stlwlr was used for the quality control of z r pairs compared with the method used by g wang et al 2012a stlwlr is a type of spatial temporal local method which is more conducive to the detection of spatial temporal local abnormal z r pairs the effectiveness of this quality control method was also confirmed in the above case study the rmae of aid was much smaller than that of azr indicated that stlwlr was better than azr at modeling the z r relationship which changed with space and time for the same method as the time scale increases from 1 hr to 24 hr the rmae gradually becomes smaller which reflects the fact that accumulation over time can improve the accuracy of qpe overall the results of azr aid stlwlr and stlwlrk for the cases occurring in 2018 are similar to but not as good as the results for the three cases occurring in 2016 which could be caused by many small scale rainfall cases or light rainfall cases the results also show that the optimization parameters obtained by 10 fold cross validation were not sensitive for stlwlr when they took values within a certain range which may indicate the universality of this set of parameters the parameters n and μ together determine the spatial temporal neighborhood in this study the optimized value of n and μ was 10 and 25 respectively in maths only two z r pairs are needed to determine the z r relationship since there are only two undetermined parameters in the z r relationship thus the optimized value of n was feasible μ was equal to 25 meant that a 10 min interval was equivalent to 5 km in space within 150 km from haikou new generation radar the average distance of inter station is about 8 4 km on hainan island in this case the number of z r pairs at most n 10 needed to construct the z r relationship could be easily achieved with only a few stations and times which also makes stlwlr not sensitive to μ thus the optimized values of n and μ may reflect the drastic changes of z r relationship in space and time to limit the required z r pairs to a small adaptive spatial temporal neighborhood is conducive to more accurate modeling of z r relationship which changes with space and time on the one hand and on the other hand could reduce the influences of systematic and local bias of reflectivity which are caused by various reasons e g radar miscalibration attenuation beam blockage and the influence of abnormal z r pairs on the modeling of z r relationship at the same time these also make stlwlr to be a more robust method and be applicable to c band and x band weather radar which are susceptible to attenuation the optimized value of c was 2 0 which may correspond to the classic 2σ criterion in statistics when c was too small for example c 1 0 a large number of z r pairs with large deviation and often with large precipitation were excluded and couldn t participate in the modeling of z r relationship using stlwlr which led to the precipitation estimation value lower than the measured value on the one hand and on the other hand reduced the station density and further led to larger rmae when c was too big for example c 3 0 z r pairs with very large deviation were retained and participated in the modeling of z r relationship using stlwlr which led to the precipitation estimation value higher than the measured value compared with the current popular deep learning models the three key parameters are more like hyperparameters of stlwlr which may be another important reason why stlwlr is not sensitive to the three key parameters however the stlwlr is more transparent and interpretable in this study the three key parameters were first optimized with two typhoon cases and one heavy rainfall case occurring on hainan island in 2016 and then were further evaluated by the cases occurring in 2018 as is known for the above three cases convective rainfall and stratiform rainfall existed simultaneously the cases occurring on hainan island from 1 may to 31 october 2018 also included a large number of convective rainfall cases stratiform rainfall cases and even a large number of mixed rainfall cases thus the above optimized values of the three key parameters were comprehensive results of all situations as can be seen the optimization of the three key parameters is a multi objective optimization problem it is difficult to find a set of parameters that are optimal for all evaluation indicators all time scales and all cases however on the whole when the optimized values of the three parameters were used for the cases occurring on hainan island in 2016 and the cases occurring in 2018 the results of stlwlr and stlwlrk outperformed those of azr and aid therefore the optimized values for the three parameters may be not optimal for all evaluation indicators all time scales and all cases but they ensure that stlwlr and stlwlrk outperformed azr and aid on the whole and the rmae of stlwlrk was not greater than that of aid for different situations which was exactly what could be expected in theory using case by case optimized key parameters or even key parameters that are dynamically optimized over time may be able to obtain better results but this will face the problem that multi objective optimization is difficult to automate considering that stlwlr is based on solid geography mathematics and radar meteorology and has been tested by a large number of cases stlwlr and its optimization parameters should have certain universality nevertheless for a specific region optimizing the three key parameters as in this paper may be a better choice in theory stlwlrk could achieve more accurate estimation when the regression residuals are still spatially autocorrelated and obtain results comparable to stlwlr when the regression residuals are not spatially autocorrelated thus compared with stlwlr stlwlrk is a more robust method in fact in the study of some cases from other regions compared with stlwlr stlwlrk shows somewhat improvement for the bias therefore although stlwlrk wasn t better than stlwlr for the selected cases in this paper the authors recommend the readers adopt stlwlrk in specific implementation the kind of z r pairs used to evaluate one method is very important some studies deleted z r pairs with a large difference between radar precipitation and rain gauge observations or z r pairs whose reflectivity was less than a certain threshold e g 10 dbz 15 dbz 20 dbz when evaluating one method alfieri et al 2010 libertino et al 2015 wang et al 2012a however considering the limitations of radar detection itself and the fact that precipitation is often highly variable in space and time they were not necessarily unrealistic therefore in order to carry out a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation of the methods the vast majority of the z r pairs were retained in this study unless there was a very large deviation from the local quality control compared with the dynamic z r relationship methods based on nonlinear regression alfieri et al 2010 libertino et al 2015 stlwlr is easier to implement and less computationally expensive since it does not involve nonlinear optimization problems nevertheless the comparison of estimation accuracy for different methods in different regions needs to be carried out in the future 5 conclusions this study proposed and verified the effectiveness of stlwlr and stlwlrk in merging radar and rain gauge data for qpe specially three key parameters that is the maximum number of z r pairs in the spatial temporal neighborhood n the spatial temporal distance transformation parameter μ and the specified threshold c of e σ were calibrated which could be used directly in other regions or provide references for other studies or in operational use the scale and amount of rainfall the time scale of rainfall accumulation and the method of radar rain gauge qpe all have an important influence on the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe therefore adopting an appropriate method is very important for the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe although the estimation accuracy of the methods proposed in this study is higher than that of traditional methods their accuracy is still not high especially for qpe over a short time scale which shows that the search for qpe with high accuracy and high spatial temporal resolution should still be an important research direction in the future possible directions include the fusion of more data sources e g commercial microwave links qpe products and the use of more advanced data fusion methods according to the methods proposed in this study several directions may further improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe first the three key parameters may also change with space and time thus the use of dynamic key parameters may further improve the accuracy of qpe however this needs to solve the multi objective optimization problem second a multi parameter spatial temporal distance function can describe more complicated spatial temporal relationships which may be beneficial for improving the accuracy of qpe third using spatial temporal kriging to interpolate regression residuals may also further improve the accuracy of qpe fourth in this study only real time versions of stlwlr and stlwlrk were conducted according to alfieri et al 2010 continuous time versions of stlwlr and stlwlrk can also be implemented moreover the continuous time versions of stlwlr and stlwlrk could be better than the real time versions however the final effect

gauge data is an important means of obtaining precipitation products with high accuracy and high spatial temporal resolution however due to the change of the raindrop size distribution itself and the uncertainty of the radar observational data it is an indisputable fact that a and b in the z r radar reflectivity factor z to rainfall rate r relationship are complex functions of space and time which has a great influence on the accuracy of radar rain gauge quantitative precipitation estimation qpe in this study in an effort to further improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe spatial temporal local weighted linear regression stlwlr and its corresponding regression kriging stlwlrk are proposed for merging radar and rain gauge data for qpe for which the maximum number of z r pairs in the spatial temporal neighborhood n the spatial temporal distance transformation parameter μ and the specified threshold c of e σ are three key parameters specifically cases that occurred on hainan island and the cross validation mode were used to calibrate the three key parameters and to evaluate the two methods with the relative mean absolute error rmae and bias as evaluation indicators the results show that compared with the real time adjusted z r relationship azr scheme and the two step calibration technique of radar qpe the aid scheme stlwlr and stlwlrk with optimization parameters could further improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe for 10 fold cross validation of the cases occurring on hainan island from 1 may to 31 october 2018 and for 1 hr 3 hr 6 hr 12 hr and 24 hr time scales the rmae of stlwlrk decreased by 6 3 8 4 8 4 8 2 and 7 9 respectively compared with that of the aid scheme the results also show that increasing time scale could reduce the error of radar rain gauge qpe for different methods as stlwlr is based on solid geography mathematics and radar meteorology and has been tested by a large number of cases stlwlr and its optimization parameters should have certain universality overall compared with traditional methods stlwlrk is a more robust easier to implement more accurate and less computationally expensive method keywords weather radar rain gauge quantitative precipitation estimation spatial temporal local weighted linear regression kriging 1 introduction quantitative precipitation estimation qpe products with high accuracy and high spatial temporal resolution are very valuable for monitoring and analyzing weather and climate verifying and calibrating numerical prediction models evaluating disasters caused by heavy rainfall and for distributed hydrological models at present rain gauge observation radar qpe and satellite qpe are the three main sources of precipitation observational data but these three types of data have advantages and disadvantages in terms of spatial and temporal resolution observational accuracy and coverage li et al 2016 tapiador et al 2012 therefore it has become a hot topic in recent years to fuse two or three of these datasets to realize their complementary advantages and obtain qpe products with high accuracy and high spatial temporal resolution prat and nelson 2015 tapiador et al 2012 however according to the published literature the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe is often better than that of satellite rain gauge qpe especially for qpe products over a short time scale up until now the china new generation weather radar cinrad network which is composed of more than 200 doppler weather radars over mainland china min et al 2019 has been deployed by the china meteorological administration cma cinrad network is similar to the us nexrad wsr 88d network in terms of technical system and detection capabilities and is being upgraded with dual polarization through a multi radar mosaic products covering the central and eastern regions with high spatial temporal resolution such as reflectivity can be produced min et al 2019 wang et al 2012a it has been 23 years since the first new generation weather radar was put into operation in china and a large amount of historical observational data has been accumulated the same situation may exist in other countries such as the united states compared with the new generation weather radar dual polarization and phased array weather radar are more advanced technologically but they also face the problem of how to estimate precipitation jointly with rain gauges tapiador et al 2012 therefore to improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe is of great significance not only for using the historical data from the new generation weather radar but also for the operational applications of the new generation weather radar dual polarization weather radar and phased array weather radar in the future different types of radar can produce different parameters so that there can be different precipitation estimation methods such as the z r radar reflectivity factor z to rainfall rate r relationship method the two factor method and the orthogonal polarization method bringi and chandrasekar 2001 tapiador et al 2012 but they generally contain the reflectivity factor z based on this precipitation can be estimated directly from the radar reflectivity factor up to now there have been three main methods to determine the z r relationship the first is the theoretical calculation method under certain assumptions for example under the m p distribution assumption marshall and palmer gave the classic exponential relationship between radar reflectivity factor and rainfall rate z 200r 1 6 marshall and palmer 1948 the second is the statistical method using raindrop size distribution data zhang et al 2019 2018 the third is the direct statistical method such methods can be further subdivided into optimization methods battan 1973 marshall and palmer 1948 a value averaging wan et al 2013 probability pairing ayat et al 2018 rosenfeld et al 1993 and weighted least squares pu et al 2008 due to the change of the raindrop size distribution itself and the uncertainty of the radar observational data it is an indisputable fact that a and b in the z r relationship are complex functions of space and time alfieri et al 2010 chapon et al 2008 lee and zawadzki 2005 libertino et al 2015 smith and krajewski 1993 villarini and krajewski 2010 wang et al 2012a it is not appropriate to describe z r relationship that changes with space and time with several dozens or even hundreds of z r relationships therefore spatial temporal dynamic z r relationship methods have become a hot topic of research into radar rain gauge qpe in recent years alfieri et al 2010 libertino et al 2015 wang et al 2012a however these spatial temporal dynamic z r relationship methods still have problems of low estimation accuracy or they need further correction although rain gauge correction can reduce the systematic error in the radar qpe there may still be a large local error in fact from the perspective of spatial statistics the fact that radar qpe products still need further correction may be due to the complex changes of the z r relationship not being properly modeled according to the first law of geography everything is related to everything else but near things are more related than distant things tobler 1970 therefore classical regression models or optimization methods are not particularly suitable for analyzing non stationary spatial temporal data accordingly spatial temporal local modeling methods such as moving window regression or geographically weighted regression came into being brunsdon et al 1999 fotheringham et al 2002 huang et al 2010 lloyd 2011 spatial temporal local models can be used to model the non stationarity of the spatial temporal relationship and have been widely used in soil organic carbon prediction modeling of the relationship between surface temperature and environmental factors precipitation interpolation temperature interpolation and so on li et al 2010 sun et al 2015 szymanowski et al 2014 wang et al 2012b in view of this spatial temporal local weighted linear regression was proposed for modeling the z r relationship which changes with space and time in order to further improve the accuracy of the radar rain gauge qpe in addition spatial temporal local weighted linear regression kriging was also used to check whether the qpe of the proposed method needed further correction 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hainan island 18 10 20 10 n 108 37 111 03 e is located in the tropics and has a tropical monsoon climate with sufficient water vapor sources fig 1 it is one of the regions with the highest precipitation at the same latitude in the world the precipitation on hainan island is unevenly distributed in space and time the annual precipitation is 940 8 2388 2 mm in a ring shaped distribution the rainy season generally occurs from may to october the rainy season rainfall accounts for 80 4 90 5 of the annual precipitation and is often concentrated in several heavy rains the types of precipitation on hainan island are very diverse including tropical cyclone type cold air type tropical convergence zone type southwest monsoon trough type and subtropical high margin type therefore hainan island is an ideal place to study and test radar qpe technology 2 2 dataset to illustrate the functionality of the proposed methodology three cases which occurred from 14 august to 19 october 2016 table 1 and almost all cases which occurred from 1 may to 31 october corresponding to the rainy season 2018 were selected correspondingly observational data from haikou new generation weather radar and 331 rain gauges within 150 km from the radar were collected affected by the 8th typhoon dianmu a strong tropical storm from 14 august to 19 august 2016 heavy rainfall occurred in the western and northern areas of the island within 150 km from the radar 87 rain gauges accumulated rainfall of more than 300 mm and 63 rain gauges accumulated rainfall of more than 400 mm from 12 october to 14 october 2016 there was a heavy precipitation process in the eastern half of the island within 150 km from the radar 103 rain gauges accumulated rainfall of more than 200 mm and 1 rain gauge accumulated rainfall of more than 400 mm affected by the 20th typhoon sarika a strong typhoon from 18 october to 19 october 2016 heavy rainfall occurred in the northern eastern central and western regions of the island within 150 km from the radar 90 rain gauges accumulated rainfall of more than 200 mm and 7 rain gauges accumulated rainfall of more than 300 mm as can be seen from fig 2 within 150 km from the radar there are always rain gauges with observations greater than 0 1 mm every day from 1 may to 31 october 2018 the types of these rainfall cases include convective rainfall stratiform rainfall and mixed rainfall haikou new generation weather radar fig 1 which is managed by hainan provincial meteorological service and upgraded with dual polarization in 2019 is an s band doppler radar system with a digital receiver at 118 m above sea level due to its tropical location the radar is basically unaffected by the 0 c layer during the rainy season however due to blockage by low hills and tall buildings at close range the scan volume data with an elevation angle of 0 5 degrees was influenced by partial beam blockage therefore in order to ensure the reliability of the research results only horizontal reflectivity with an elevation angle of 1 5 degrees within 150 km from the radar was used in this study fig 1 the hainan provincial meteorological service also manages the rain gauge network which consists of more than 500 rain gauges distributed over hainan island although only 331 rain gauges within 150 km from the radar were used in this study the type of all the rain gauges is tipping bucket the resolution of all the rain gauges is 0 1 mm the temporal resolution of the rain gauge data is 10 min the preliminary quality control of the observed data was carried out by setting the lower limit of 10 min rainfall of the rain gauge to 0 1 mm the raw horizontal reflectivity of each piece of scan volume data with an elevation angle of 1 5 degrees was interpolated on a cartesian grid of 1 km 1 km by the barnes formula askelson et al 2000 shapiro et al 2003 since the time resolution of the radar detection data is 6 min and that of the rain gauge is 10 min the gridded radar reflectivity was first averaged with time as the weight to match the rain gauge observations for example let t1 08 00 t2 08 10 t 1 t 2 and t 3 were three observation times of the radar for one grid point fig 3 respectively then the average radar reflectivity of this grid point could be expressed by formula 1 where 10 log z t 1 10 log z t 2 and 10 log z t 3 were the radar reflectivity of the grid point at times t 1 t 2 and t 3 generally the observation time of the radar reflectivity involved in the calculation should be within the interval t1 6 min t2 1 10 log z t 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 10 log z t 1 t 3 t 2 t 2 t 1 10 log z t 2 t 2 t 3 t 2 t 1 10 log z t 3 then for each rain gauge its rainfall and the nearest grid point s radar reflectivity were used to establish the z r pairs since z r pairs and 10logz 10logr pairs could be converted into each other they would not be distinguished in this study the z r pairs of the three cases would be treated as a whole for parameter calibration and model evaluation but the z r pairs of 1 may to 31 october 2018 would only be used for model evaluation 2 3 spatial temporal local weighted linear regression and its corresponding regression kriging according to marshall and palmer 1948 when the raindrop size distribution meets the standard diameter distribution the radar reflectivity factor z mm6 m3 and the rainfall rate r mm h satisfy the following formula 2 z a r b where a and b are coefficients related to the raindrop size distribution taking the logarithm of both sides of formula 2 the following linear formula could be obtained 3 10 log r 1 b 10 log z 10 log a b then according to formula 2 formula 3 or other variants of formula 2 the corresponding z r relationships can be obtained by using samples from different spatial temporal ranges different objective functions and different optimization methods correspondingly different radar rain gauge qpe methods can be developed alfieri et al 2010 libertino et al 2015 wan et al 2010 wang et al 2012a for example according to formula 3 wang et al 2012a proposed using real time z r pairs and linear least squares to obtain the real time z r relationship however according to existing researches when formula 3 and least squares methods were used to establish the z r relationship and to estimate precipitation there was heteroscedasticity cocks et al 2017 pu et al 2008 seo and breidenbach 2002 wang et al 2012a which implied the need for a weighted linear regression model 4 β x t wx 1 x t w y with w as a weight matrix 5 w g 1 s 0 0 0 0 g 2 s 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 gn s where β is the estimated value of the coefficient vector 10 log a b 1 b x 1 10 log z 1 1 10 log z 2 1 10 log z n y 10 log g 1 10 log g 2 10 log g n 10 log z 1 10 log g 1 10 log z 2 10 log g 2 10 log z n 10 log g n are the observations of n z r pairs s i 1 n g i and g i mm h is the observed rainfall rate of the ith z r pair when the z r relationship cannot be established by the above method or the rainfall rate estimated by the established z r relationship is greater than a certain threshold e g 100 mm 10 min the empirical z r relationship z 40r 2 5 which was established by libertino et al 2015 will be used for qpe in this study the spatial temporal local weighted linear regression stlwlr means that when using the above mentioned weighted linear regression to construct the instantaneous z r relationship of any radar reflectivity grid point at most n such as n 30 z r pairs in its spatial temporal neighborhood were used fig 4 this type of method requires the conversion of space and time scales during modeling according to the research of huang et al 2010 formula 6 could be used to define spatial temporal distance 6 d u i u 0 2 v i v 0 2 μ t i t 0 2 where u 0 v 0 t 0 and u i v i t i are the spatial temporal coordinates of spatial temporal positions x 0 and x i respectively and μ is the spatial temporal distance transformation parameter which can be determined according to prior knowledge or using the cross validation method huang et al 2010 for one radar grid point or sample point once μ has been determined the spatial temporal distances from this point to the sample points in a certain period e g 1 h can be calculated the above samples are sorted by distance and a certain number of nearest samples are taken at most n then the z r relationship for this point could be constructed using these samples and stlwlr the difference is that the work of alfieri et al 2010 and libertino et al 2015 used fixed and semi fixed cylindrical spatial temporal neighborhood and this study will adopt an adaptive semi ellipsoidal spatial temporal neighborhood for real time estimation the real time adjusted z r relationship azr scheme wang et al 2012a could be regarded as a special case of stlwlr but unlike azr as long as conditions permitted stlwlr was used to estimate radar precipitation regardless of the magnitude of the correlation coefficient in addition following libertino et al 2015 a time window of 1 h was also used if the z r relationship is stable the a and b obtained by stlwlr will be almost the same at different spatial temporal points however if the z r relationship is not stable the a and b obtained by stlwlr will be different from point to point therefore stlwlr has the potential to further improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe after the z r relationships of all radar reflectivity grid points at the same time e g 08 10 had been constructed using stlwlr the radar precipitation estimates could be obtained then the radar precipitation estimates r i of all rain gauges could be removed from the observations g i and formulas 7 and 8 could be used to estimate the residual e x 0 at location x 0 without an observation station where ω i is the ordinary kriging weight and n is the number of neighbors for kriging interpolation finally the estimated precipitation value p x 0 of location x 0 could be obtained with formula 9 the first part of the right hand side of formula 9 represents the radar precipitation estimate obtained by stlwlr and the second part represents the kriging interpolation value of the regression residuals in this study the variogram was estimated dynamically every 10 min the spherical exponential and the gaussian theoretical variogram were estimated firstly then the theoretical variogram for which the mean squared error between empirical variogram and theoretical variogram was a minimum was taken 7 e x i g i r i 8 e x 0 i 1 n ω i e x i 9 p x 0 r x 0 e x 0 the above interpolation method is called stlwlr kriging stlwlrk stlwlrk is a method which could integrate stlwlr and kriging to achieve more accurate estimation when the regression residuals are still spatially autocorrelated hengl et al 2007 commonly used optimal interpolation correction methods can be regarded as special cases of stlwlrk including the two step calibration technique of radar qpe the aid scheme wang et al 2012a as a comparison two schemes similar to the schemes in wang et al 2012a which only use z r pairs from the same time when constructing the z r relationship were also carried out 2 4 quality control of z r pairs based on spatial temporal local weighted linear regression in order to obtain a relatively reasonable z r relationship the usual practice is to remove z r pairs where z or r is null and carry out a quality control exercise on the remaining z r pairs wang et al 2012a in this study stlwlr was also used for the quality control of z r pairs that is for each z r pair an stlwlr model was constructed using at most n z r pairs in its spatial temporal neighborhood let e was the error calculated with formula 7 for the z r pair requiring quality control and σ was the standard deviation of the corresponding stlwlr model which could be calculated with formula 10 10 σ 1 n 1 i 1 n e x i 1 n i 1 n e x i 2 where n was the number of z r pairs actually used if e σ was greater than a specified threshold c fig 5 the z r pair was judged to be an outlier and the z r pair would not be used to construct the z r relationship but considering the construction process of the z r pairs almost all of the z r pairs would participate in the evaluation of the model aggarwal 2013 unless e σ was very large e g bigger than c 0 where c 0 30000 for this study if the number of z r pairs in the spatial temporal neighborhood was not enough the z r pair requiring quality control would not be controlled 2 5 parameter calibration and model evaluation as mentioned above the parameters n μ and c are three key parameters of stlwlr and stlwlrk for given situations the size of n determines the size of the spatial temporal neighborhood if n is too large only the z r relationship in the average sense could be obtained while if n is too small a stable z r relationship may not be obtained the size of μ determines how many kilometers a 10 min interval is equivalent to in space if μ is equal to 0 the z r paris in the neighborhood will mainly consist of z r paris in the time dimension of several stations while if μ is equal to the z r paris in the neighborhood will mainly consist of z r paris in the spatial dimension neither of which are conducive to modeling the z r relationship that changes with space and time the size of c determines which samples are involved in the construction of the z r relationship if c is too large lots of weak outliers will be involved in the construction of the z r relationship while if c is too small lots of normal data will be judged to be outliers and cannot be used to construct the z r relationship which is equivalent to reducing the station density therefore all three parameters need to be calibrated and optimized in this study the calibration of the three parameters of the methods was carried out by 10 fold cross validation with the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 the evaluations of the methods were carried out by 10 fold cross validation of the above three cases and almost all cases occurring from 1 may to 31 october 2018 in particular all rain gauges for each case were randomly divided into 10 nearly equal parts during each cross validation process for simplicity the three parameters were optimized in sequence first under the assumption that μ was equal to 50 and c was equal to c 0 n was set to change from 5 to 40 in steps of 5 and the optimized value of n was obtained second under the assumption that c was equal to c 0 and the condition that n was the above optimal value μ was set to change from 1 and then 5 to 50 in steps of 5 and the optimized value of μ was obtained third under the condition that n and μ were the optimal values above c was set to change from 1 to 3 in steps of 0 2 and the optimized value of c was obtained the feasibility of the approach was confirmed by the research results from this study the selection of evaluation indicators is also a very important issue because it is related not only to the evaluation of model performance but also to the calibration of model parameters up to now a wide variety of evaluation indicators have been used for the evaluation of qpe algorithms or product accuracy such as the mean error me alfieri et al 2010 montopoli et al 2017 yang et al 2016 the mean absolute error mae alfieri et al 2010 martinaitis et al 2018 wei and hsieh 2020 the root mean square error rmse alfieri et al 2010 wei and hsieh 2020 yang et al 2016 montopoli et al 2017 or the mean square error the correlation coefficient cc martinaitis et al 2018 wang et al 2012a montopoli et al 2017 the bias bias martinaitis et al 2018 nelson et al 2015 wang et al 2012a the relative mean error rme lim et al 2014 the relative mean absolute error rmae lim et al 2014 wei and hsieh 2020 yang et al 2016 the relative root mean square error rrmse wei and hsieh 2020 montopoli et al 2017 among others however me mae and rmse are absolute evaluation indicators and cannot be used to compare different cases rmse cc and rrmse are susceptible to outliers and rme can be derived from bias whereas bias and rmae are relative evaluation indicators which means they can even be used to compare different cases from different areas also they are not susceptible to outliers therefore in this study bias and rmae were used for parameter calibration and model evaluation however for comparison with other studies cc was also retained 11 mae 1 n i j r ij g ij 12 cc i j g ij g ij r ij r ij i j g ij g ij 2 r ij r ij 2 13 bias r ij g ij 14 rmae mae g ij where r ij is the hourly estimated rainfall at the ith hour of the jth rain gauge g ij is the hourly observed rainfall at the ith hour of the jth rain gauge r ij is the average hourly estimated rainfall of all rain gauges and g ij is the average hourly observed rainfall of all rain gauges formulas 11 14 could also be used for other time scales parameter calibration and model evaluation such as 3 hr 6 hr etc in this study rainfall will first be estimated on the 10 min time scale and then accumulated to 1 hr 3 hr 6 hr 12 hr and 24 hr time scales for parameter calibration and model evaluation 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the effect of parameter n on the accuracy of stlwlr fig 6 shows the 10 fold cross validation rmae and bias of stlwlr for the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 under the assumption that μ was equal to 50 and c was equal to c 0 when n was set to vary from 5 to 40 as n changes from 5 to 40 for different time scales the rmae first decreases and then increases for the same n as the time scale increases from 1 hr to 24 hr the rmae gradually becomes smaller as n changes from 5 to 40 the bias the bias of different time scales is the same is very close to but larger than 1 in summary through trade offs the optimized value of n was set to 10 the conclusion increasing time scale could reduce the error of radar rain gauge qpe is reflected in the following different models and their configurations which will not be explained hereafter 3 2 evaluation of the effect of parameter μ on the accuracy of stlwlr fig 7 displays the 10 fold cross validation rmae and bias of stlwlr for the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 under the assumption that c was equal to c 0 and the condition that n was 10 when μ was set to vary from 1 and then 5 to 50 in steps of 5 as μ changes from 1 and then 5 to 50 in steps of 5 for different time scales the rmae of stlwlr first decreases and then increases as an approximation when μ is equal to 25 the rmae of different time scales reach smaller values as μ changes from 1 and then 5 to 50 in steps of 5 the bias is very close to but larger than 1 in summary in this study the optimized value of μ was set to 25 3 3 evaluation of the effect of parameter c on the accuracy of stlwlr fig 8 shows the 10 fold cross validation rmae and bias of stlwlr for the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 under the condition that n was equal to 10 and μ was equal to 25 when c was set to vary from 1 to 3 in steps of 0 2 as c changes from 1 to 3 for different time scales the rmae of stlwlr first decreases and then increases as an approximation when c is equal to 2 0 the rmae of different time scales reach smaller values as c changes from 1 to 3 the bias gradually becomes bigger when c is equal to 2 2 the bias is closest to 1 in summary in this study the optimized value of c was set to 2 0 3 4 comparison of estimation accuracy for different methods fig 9 displays the 10 fold cross validation rmae and bias of azr aid stlwlr and stlwlrk for the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 for stlwlr and stlwlrk the parameters n μ and c were set to 10 25 and 2 0 respectively which were all the optimized values above for comparison azr and aid were also carried out under the same quality control conditions as can be seen for rmae the improvement from azr to aid is great while the difference between stlwlr and stlwlrk is very small for different time scales further calculations show that for 1 hr 3 hr 6 hr 12 hr and 24 hr time scales the rmae of stlwlrk decreased by 5 6 9 8 11 9 12 7 and 13 6 respectively compared with that of aid for different time scales the rmae of aid was greater than that of stlwlrk which all passed the t test of 0 01 significance level moreover for all time scales of different cases the rmae of stlwlrk was not greater than that of aid at the 0 01 significance level similar to rmae for bias the improvement from azr to aid is great while the difference between stlwlr and stlwlrk is very small fig 10 shows the scatter plots and q q plots between observed rainfall and rainfall estimated by stlwlrk 10 fold cross validation for 1 hr 6 hr 12 hr and 24 hr time scales the characteristics of the scatter plots and q q plots at different time scales show good correspondence with the two evaluation indicators of bias and rmae at the same time the phenomenon of heteroscedasticity is weakened fig 11 and fig 12 are the same as fig 9 and fig 10 respectively but for the cases occurring from 1 may to 31 october 2018 overall the results of azr aid stlwlr and stlwlrk for the cases occurring from 1 may to 31 october 2018 are similar to but not as good as the results for the three cases occurring from 14 august to 19 october 2016 for 1 hr 3 hr 6 hr 12 hr and 24 hr time scales the rmae of stlwlrk decreased by 6 3 8 4 8 4 8 2 and 7 9 respectively compared with that of aid for different time scales the rmae of aid was greater than that of stlwlrk which all passed the t test of 0 01 significance level further calculations show that at the 0 01 significance level for all time scales of different months the rmae of stlwlrk was not greater than that of aid 4 discussion a large number of studies have shown that the z r relationship not only changes with geographical location season radar detection distance precipitation type and precipitation intensity even for the same precipitation process the z r relationship could change at different locations and times in addition some studies also indicate that the changes of the z r relationship can also be related to uncertainty in data analysis estimation methods or observational data villarini and krajewski 2010 therefore when using the z r relationship to estimate surface precipitation both the temporal evolution of the z r relationship and the spatial evolution of the z r relationship need to be considered in this study in order to further improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe spatial temporal local weighted linear regression stlwlr and its corresponding regression kriging stlwlrk were proposed for merging radar and rain gauge data for qpe the maximum number of z r pairs in the spatial temporal neighborhood n the spatial temporal distance transformation parameter μ and the specified threshold c of e σ were the three key parameters of stlwlr and stlwlrk three cases that occurred on hainan island from 14 august to 19 october 2016 were used to calibrate the three key parameters and to evaluate the two methods with the relative mean absolute error rmae and bias as evaluation indicators to further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods almost all cases occurring on hainan island from 1 may to 31 october 2018 were also used to evaluate the two methods in addition two traditional methods azr and aid were also studied as controls the results show that under the same conditions whether for rmae or bias the difference between stlwlr and stlwlrk was very small which indicated that stlwlr was better at modeling the z r relationship that changed with space and time this is also why stlwlr was used for the quality control of z r pairs compared with the method used by g wang et al 2012a stlwlr is a type of spatial temporal local method which is more conducive to the detection of spatial temporal local abnormal z r pairs the effectiveness of this quality control method was also confirmed in the above case study the rmae of aid was much smaller than that of azr indicated that stlwlr was better than azr at modeling the z r relationship which changed with space and time for the same method as the time scale increases from 1 hr to 24 hr the rmae gradually becomes smaller which reflects the fact that accumulation over time can improve the accuracy of qpe overall the results of azr aid stlwlr and stlwlrk for the cases occurring in 2018 are similar to but not as good as the results for the three cases occurring in 2016 which could be caused by many small scale rainfall cases or light rainfall cases the results also show that the optimization parameters obtained by 10 fold cross validation were not sensitive for stlwlr when they took values within a certain range which may indicate the universality of this set of parameters the parameters n and μ together determine the spatial temporal neighborhood in this study the optimized value of n and μ was 10 and 25 respectively in maths only two z r pairs are needed to determine the z r relationship since there are only two undetermined parameters in the z r relationship thus the optimized value of n was feasible μ was equal to 25 meant that a 10 min interval was equivalent to 5 km in space within 150 km from haikou new generation radar the average distance of inter station is about 8 4 km on hainan island in this case the number of z r pairs at most n 10 needed to construct the z r relationship could be easily achieved with only a few stations and times which also makes stlwlr not sensitive to μ thus the optimized values of n and μ may reflect the drastic changes of z r relationship in space and time to limit the required z r pairs to a small adaptive spatial temporal neighborhood is conducive to more accurate modeling of z r relationship which changes with space and time on the one hand and on the other hand could reduce the influences of systematic and local bias of reflectivity which are caused by various reasons e g radar miscalibration attenuation beam blockage and the influence of abnormal z r pairs on the modeling of z r relationship at the same time these also make stlwlr to be a more robust method and be applicable to c band and x band weather radar which are susceptible to attenuation the optimized value of c was 2 0 which may correspond to the classic 2σ criterion in statistics when c was too small for example c 1 0 a large number of z r pairs with large deviation and often with large precipitation were excluded and couldn t participate in the modeling of z r relationship using stlwlr which led to the precipitation estimation value lower than the measured value on the one hand and on the other hand reduced the station density and further led to larger rmae when c was too big for example c 3 0 z r pairs with very large deviation were retained and participated in the modeling of z r relationship using stlwlr which led to the precipitation estimation value higher than the measured value compared with the current popular deep learning models the three key parameters are more like hyperparameters of stlwlr which may be another important reason why stlwlr is not sensitive to the three key parameters however the stlwlr is more transparent and interpretable in this study the three key parameters were first optimized with two typhoon cases and one heavy rainfall case occurring on hainan island in 2016 and then were further evaluated by the cases occurring in 2018 as is known for the above three cases convective rainfall and stratiform rainfall existed simultaneously the cases occurring on hainan island from 1 may to 31 october 2018 also included a large number of convective rainfall cases stratiform rainfall cases and even a large number of mixed rainfall cases thus the above optimized values of the three key parameters were comprehensive results of all situations as can be seen the optimization of the three key parameters is a multi objective optimization problem it is difficult to find a set of parameters that are optimal for all evaluation indicators all time scales and all cases however on the whole when the optimized values of the three parameters were used for the cases occurring on hainan island in 2016 and the cases occurring in 2018 the results of stlwlr and stlwlrk outperformed those of azr and aid therefore the optimized values for the three parameters may be not optimal for all evaluation indicators all time scales and all cases but they ensure that stlwlr and stlwlrk outperformed azr and aid on the whole and the rmae of stlwlrk was not greater than that of aid for different situations which was exactly what could be expected in theory using case by case optimized key parameters or even key parameters that are dynamically optimized over time may be able to obtain better results but this will face the problem that multi objective optimization is difficult to automate considering that stlwlr is based on solid geography mathematics and radar meteorology and has been tested by a large number of cases stlwlr and its optimization parameters should have certain universality nevertheless for a specific region optimizing the three key parameters as in this paper may be a better choice in theory stlwlrk could achieve more accurate estimation when the regression residuals are still spatially autocorrelated and obtain results comparable to stlwlr when the regression residuals are not spatially autocorrelated thus compared with stlwlr stlwlrk is a more robust method in fact in the study of some cases from other regions compared with stlwlr stlwlrk shows somewhat improvement for the bias therefore although stlwlrk wasn t better than stlwlr for the selected cases in this paper the authors recommend the readers adopt stlwlrk in specific implementation the kind of z r pairs used to evaluate one method is very important some studies deleted z r pairs with a large difference between radar precipitation and rain gauge observations or z r pairs whose reflectivity was less than a certain threshold e g 10 dbz 15 dbz 20 dbz when evaluating one method alfieri et al 2010 libertino et al 2015 wang et al 2012a however considering the limitations of radar detection itself and the fact that precipitation is often highly variable in space and time they were not necessarily unrealistic therefore in order to carry out a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation of the methods the vast majority of the z r pairs were retained in this study unless there was a very large deviation from the local quality control compared with the dynamic z r relationship methods based on nonlinear regression alfieri et al 2010 libertino et al 2015 stlwlr is easier to implement and less computationally expensive since it does not involve nonlinear optimization problems nevertheless the comparison of estimation accuracy for different methods in different regions needs to be carried out in the future 5 conclusions this study proposed and verified the effectiveness of stlwlr and stlwlrk in merging radar and rain gauge data for qpe specially three key parameters that is the maximum number of z r pairs in the spatial temporal neighborhood n the spatial temporal distance transformation parameter μ and the specified threshold c of e σ were calibrated which could be used directly in other regions or provide references for other studies or in operational use the scale and amount of rainfall the time scale of rainfall accumulation and the method of radar rain gauge qpe all have an important influence on the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe therefore adopting an appropriate method is very important for the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe although the estimation accuracy of the methods proposed in this study is higher than that of traditional methods their accuracy is still not high especially for qpe over a short time scale which shows that the search for qpe with high accuracy and high spatial temporal resolution should still be an important research direction in the future possible directions include the fusion of more data sources e g commercial microwave links qpe products and the use of more advanced data fusion methods according to the methods proposed in this study several directions may further improve the accuracy of radar rain gauge qpe first the three key parameters may also change with space and time thus the use of dynamic key parameters may further improve the accuracy of qpe however this needs to solve the multi objective optimization problem second a multi parameter spatial temporal distance function can describe more complicated spatial temporal relationships which may be beneficial for improving the accuracy of qpe third using spatial temporal kriging to interpolate regression residuals may also further improve the accuracy of qpe fourth in this study only real time versions of stlwlr and stlwlrk were conducted according to alfieri et al 2010 continuous time versions of stlwlr and stlwlrk can also be implemented moreover the continuous time versions of stlwlr and stlwlrk could be better than the real time versions however the final effect

on the projection method to create an fdr pre allocation plan and iteratively improved it until it exceeded the standards of a harmonious diagnosis method thereby obtaining a harmonious allocation plan the jiangsu section of the sunan canal in the yangtze river delta region of china was taken as an example using data from 2009 to 2018 to study the suitability of our approach and compare it with other indicator systems our results showed that 1 in the fdr pre allocation the proportions of fdr obtained by suzhou zhenjiang wuxi and changzhou were 32 81 19 83 24 68 and 22 69 respectively however the fdr pre allocation scheme did not pass the harmonious diagnosis and would have been objectionable to some regions 2 after two rounds of harmonious adjustment the model yielded a final scheme that would promote the harmonious development of the region and improve the acceptability of the fdr allocation plan in the harmonious distribution of fdr the proportions of fdr obtained by suzhou zhenjiang wuxi and changzhou were changed to 29 18 20 03 28 10 and 22 69 respectively 3 the allocation results based on our five principle approach were the most harmonious of the tested plans our method is geared toward solving the problem of flood drainage conflicts between regions to ensure an orderly flood drainage situation reduce flood losses and promote the harmonious development of the entire watershed as such it provides a reference for governments and agencies involved in fdr management abbreviations fdr flood drainage right gdp gross domestic product ahp analytic hierarchy process keywords yangtze river delta flood resilience strategy sustainable development indicator system watershed management 1 introduction flood plains and deltas tend to provide abundant water resources and fertile soil and they are often convenient hubs for shipping these are among the reasons people occupy and develop these riparian areas islam 2016 nicholls et al 2011 however economic growth population agglomeration and construction associated with rapid urban development have rendered cities in flood plains and deltas increasingly vulnerable to flooding de moel et al 2011 in the past decades climate change has exacerbated the effects of urbanization and complex infrastructure construction by increasing the frequency of extreme weather events causing flood disasters in an increasing number of regions vermuyten et al 2020 some notable events included the flooding of the river rhine in the netherlands in 1995 zlatanova et al 2014 hurricane harvey in the united states in 2017 zhang et al 2018 and the impacts of typhoon nepartak in china in 2016 lyu et al 2018 floods have incurred substantial economic losses on residents of flood plains and deltas such costs are expected to continue to rise in the future with the risk of flood disasters expected to triple by 2050 jongman et al 2012 field et al 2012 a growing body of research has emerged to identify and examine methods of mitigating the losses caused by flood disasters in china the government owns the rights to discharge floodwaters as needed as a flood control measure toward ensuring the safety of citizens and infrastructure referred to as flood drainage rights fdr fdr management aims to minimize runoff through the optimal allocation of floodwater capacity resources and to promote social equity sun et al 2020 a substantial body of contemporary research explores fdr allocation and management strategies to cope with flood disasters a traditional approach was to adopt a flood resistance strategy through constructing physical barriers to resist floods and prevent flood disasters although this structural kind of measure can play a certain role it is both expensive and harmful to the surrounding environment and is not conducive to the sustainable development of human society werritty 2006 in the context of climate change the intensity and frequency of floods continue to increase westra et al 2014 and it is impossible to prevent floods by using physical barriers alone therefore a more contemporary approach is a flood resilience strategy which advocates that society expects to live with and adapt to floods as much as possible a flood resilience strategy can reduce flood disaster losses and improve the sustainable development of a region further the riparian flood plains that become flooded by periodic lateral overflows of the river di baldassarre et al 2013 typically represent high value ecosystems that provide abundant ecosystem services and support a wide array of biodiversity opperman et al 2009 currently the most widely used basic flood risk management system developed two decades ago advocates the use of a resilience based strategy plate 2002 the system is based on flood control strategies and water conservancy engineering measures as well as flood defense strategies such as flood forecasting before the event flood dispatching plans during the event and post event land management and flood disaster loss assessment hegger et al 2016 thieken et al 2016 therefore the flood risk management system promotes the use of sustainable development management methods although the current flood risk management system is relatively complete it has certain limitations for example using a flood dispatching plan to manage floods based on water conservancy projects only considers hydrological factors ignoring economic development politics environment and other critical factors among different regions in the watershed in china the central government often is in charge of formulating flood dispatch plans and local governments implement the plans however in actual operation illegal flood drainage and excessive flood drainage occur making the flood dispatching plan unable to be implemented in accordance with the original plan therefore the flood dispatching plan likely reduces the flood discharge efficiency leading to an unsatisfactory flood drainage effect shen et al 2019 most notably the mechanism by which flood drainage volume is allocated between regions in a watershed is supported by insufficient research and is prone to errors for example in july 2016 the rainy season caused flooding in many areas of china due to the poor planning of regional flood drainage rights fdr the excessive flood drainage into the taihu lake s upper reaches caused flooding in some villages in yixing city the incident affected more than 130 000 residents who experienced extensive risk to their safety and property the population centers within this watershed are concentrated in an upstream region and a downstream region along the river channel an upstream region can drain its floodwater into the river system before a downstream region can causing a sharp increase in river water volume and flow rate for those living downstream when the flood drainage demand of each region exceeds the limited water capacity of the river channel the flood drainage from the upstream region will add pressure to the downstream region this results in competition between regions to secure access to flood drainage which is especially prominent in china the proper flood drainage of a river is considered a public pond resource which has the characteristics of non exclusivity and competition the upper and lower reaches of a river and its left and right banks can discharge water into the river or prevent it from escaping the channel each location with a great demand for fdr will prioritize reducing their losses caused by flood disasters rather than considering the overall interests of the watershed or those downstream from them as they rush to drain the flood to the river to protect their citizens and interests they create a disorderly flood drainage situation and risk triggering flood drainage conflicts disorderly flood drainage will result in inefficiency and unfairness in flood management to ensure orderly flood drainage that minimizes harm throughout a watershed it is necessary to plan and implement a comprehensive fdr system that considers all regions in a watershed during periods of heavy rainfall if each part in a watershed drains water according to the prescribed fdr plan floods can be staggered water can be detained in some regions for a period of time and the damage can be minimized the optimal balance can be achieved between the watershed s limited flood control capacity and the regional flood drainage demand with this approach which is based on hydrological economic cultural and political characteristics and other factors of each region in the watershed the flood drainage needs of each region are explored in a more comprehensive perspective the flood drainage capacity of each region is allocated to each region and flood control benefits in the watershed can be maximized during a flood event each region can drainage flood according to the allocated fdr and the region with a greater fdr can drainage more floodwater therefore the design of a fair efficient and sustainable fdr allocation method is the key to solving the problem of flood drainage competition between regions in a watershed at present research on fdr is in its infancy shen et al 2019 used a chaos optimization projection pursuit model to study the fdr s allocation in the jiangsu section of the huai river basin based on economic historical loss and ecological factors in a previous study zhang et al 2019 quantified the allocation of fdr based on natural conditions socioeconomic development level and technical management using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and the gini coefficient zhang et al 2020 employed the entropy topsis method to allocate fdr in the huai river basin from the perspective of fairness efficiency and sustainable development the existing research on fdr allocation has certain limitations 1 the indicator system used for fdr allocation is not scientific and reasonable having an emphasis on fairness efficiency and sustainable development but with little regard to flood resilience strategies and the historical patterns of flood management yet the flood resilience strategy has been recognized worldwide since it can improve a region s adaptability to flood disasters and promote the sustainable development of the region therefore resilience needs to be considered when constructing the allocation of fdr indicator system at the same time when differences between fdr allocation and the existing regional flood drainage patterns are too great this mismatch will inevitably generate dissatisfaction in any regions that feel that their interests are being damaged and cause disharmony under a flood risk management system that advocates a flood resilience strategy relevant factors should be considered to construct a more scientific and reasonable fdr allocation indicator system 2 the majority of existing studies on fdr allocation are based on single year datasets however natural environmental phenomena such as precipitation and soil erosion are unpredictable and time variable therefore allocation based on data from only one year are likely to prove inconsistent with the actual situation which affects the fairness of the fdr allocation results 3 existing research on fdr allocation has used mathematical models to calculate the objective factors of the region though it has not the built in analysis of the rationality of the allocation plans that result therefore it has been difficult to determine the practicality of these fdr allocation plans toward solving these problems we constructed an indicator system for the allocation of fdr based on the combined principles of fairness efficiency sustainable development respect for flood management history and flood resilience strategies to demonstrate this approach we used the two stage fdr allocation method of initial allocation harmony diagnosis to study the allocation of fdr in various regions in a watershed finally we applied our allocation process to the southern jiangsu canal in china based on an extensive dataset spanning from 2009 to 2018 this served as a case study aimed at making up for the lack of planning of the fdr of various regions in the current flood management plan and showing a scientific reasonable and harmonious fdr allocation this research is intended to guide researchers and agencies toward improvements in the effectiveness practicality and community acceptance of flood management plans thereby alleviating flood drainage conflicts and reducing flood disaster losses in a watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the sunan canal is located in the economically developed yangtze river delta region of china and belongs to the taihu lake system in the yangtze river basin fig 1 with a total area of approximately 21 600 km2 it connects the taihu lake basin in the west the huangpu river in the east the yangtze river in the north and the taihu dike in the south the sunan canal is located mainly in jiangsu province but it also extends into shanghai zhejiang and anhui it is a crucial component of the taihu lake system its support for shipping water diversion irrigation and biodiversity gives it an extremely high ecological and economic value for the yangtze river delta socioeconomics the cities along the jiangsu section of the sunan canal are located in the yangtze river delta s core area they are numerous densely populated and economically developed fig 2 in 2018 the total population of the four cities in the jiangsu section of the sunan canal exceeded 25 million 1 8 of china s total population and the urbanization rate reached 73 94 statistical yearbook of china 2019 these four cities in southern jiangsu comprise one of the most economically developed regions in china with a gross domestic product gdp of 6 42688 105 billion u s dollars 1 u s dollar 6 5 yuan accounting for 4 6 of national gdp and a per capita gdp of about 2 41538 107 u s dollars i e 2 43 times the national per capita gdp climate the area along the sunan canal has a subtropical humid monsoon climate with four distinct seasons including a hot and rainy summer affected by the monsoon spring and autumn are short winter and summer are relatively longer the annual average temperature ranges between 13 6 16 1 the area has abundant precipitation with the annual precipitation of 1000 to 1250 mm which shows a clear seasonal distribution most precipitation occurs in summer as storms accounting for half of the annual precipitation precipitation in winter is the least affected by tropical storms and typhoons from may to august this area is prone to catastrophic weather events with heavy rains and wind gusts which bring in severe impacts to local environment and society the riparian area along the sunan canal has a complex water system and experiences frequent floods which could be more vulnerable to weather extremes under the changing climate fore example in the past six consecutive years 2015 2020 the flood level along the sunan canal and throughout the region was higher than the historical average 2 2 methods we adopted a two stage initial fdr allocation plan namely the initial allocation harmony diagnosis approach which is an interval multi objective distribution model based on projection once the initial allocation model was complete we evaluated the acceptability of the pre allocation plan and adjusted it using the harmony diagnosis method the detailed procedure of the method is shown in fig 3 2 2 1 principles of drainage rights distribution in the first step we refined the principles of fdr allocation to minimize economic losses while achieving sustainable social development by comprehensively considering the social and economic conditions ecological needs flood control capacity historical flood drainage needs and other factors of each flood drainage region we used the following principles in constructing our fdr allocation plans 1 fairness a fair allocation is of fundamental importance only a fair fdr allocation system can reduce the resistance and dissatisfaction of each region and increase the acceptability of the system each region has its own land area population environment and other characteristics rosegrant et al 1995 syme et al 1999 resulting in different demands for flood drainage to achieve fairness in the design of an fdr allocation plan factors such as land area population and natural environment of each region should be fully considered to meet the actual needs of each region to an equivalent extent and achieve fairness 2 high efficiency we sought to maximize the efficiency of our allocation plan by allocation fdr based on the flood drainage capacity and efficiency of each region which has been shown to reduce the loss generated by floods in the whole watershed bennett et al 2000 keller and keller 1995 we adjusted the flood drainage volume among regions based on regional safety and fairness in general fdr was inclined towards areas with high flood drainage efficiency so that the unit flood drainage could produce more significant social ecological and economic benefits 3 respect for historical context some regions have failed to carry out proper flood drainage planning in the past neglecting the whole watershed perspective resulting in harm to their neighbors while this has often been overlooked during fdr allocation we attempted to correct these existing unreasonable phenomena in a sensitive way since these corrections inevitably led to changes in the benefit patterns of fdr plans with small differences between their allocation results and the current situation will be more readily accepted and put into practice su et al 2001 accounting for the historical and current management of the region was necessary for our fdr allocation plan 4 sustainable development we emphasized the coordination between economic growth and environmental protection in order to promote the long term development of human society sophocleous 2005 in a watershed this entailed strengthening the defenses of the ecological environment reducing the occurrence of soil erosion and reducing water resources pollution 5 floods resilience strategy our plans adhered to a flood resilience strategy by accepting the inevitability of floods we eschewed the strategy of blindly heightening and strengthening water conservancy and flood control facilities inundating polders and green rivers in economically underdeveloped areas can be used to shift peaks reduce flood intensity and protect economically developed regions all while reinforcing ecosystems 2 2 2 the construction of the indicator system we selected indicators capable of reflecting our five principles including fairness efficiency sustainability historical respect and flood resilience table 1 they were selected based on their merits conceptual clarity clarity of their definition meaning reliability of the data mutual independence and ease of calculation han et al 2019 2 2 3 model construction 2 2 3 1 interval multi objective allocation model in the second step we selected the multi objective decision making model because of its solid foundation in the context of resource allocation where it allows an effective allocation of water resources and the maximization of economic benefits wang et al 2010 we incorporated interval programming into our multi objective allocation model to optimize uncertain parameters using the maximum and minimum values in a certain interval this method yields results that are closer to reality as it can eliminate one sided problems and the influence of data sampling errors given that no single year is representative of broader trends the use of maximum and minimum values of the interval are designed to solve the one sidedness problem and ensure a good allocation of fdr the initial flood drainage in a system was defined as t 1 t 2 t j t n t 0 where t j is the drainage allocated to region j which drains to a river and t 0 indicates the maximum flood volume that a given river can bear the pre allocation ratio for the fdr ratio was s j 0 s 1 0 s 2 0 s i 0 s m 0 where i is an indicator the five steps of the interval multi object allocation calculation are as follows 1 data standardization according to the indicator i i 1 2 n fdr allocation was performed in j regions the attribute range x ij of the indicator i corresponding to region j was expressed as 1 x ij x ij l x ij h where x ij l is the lower limit and x ij h is the upper limit as some indicators have both forward and reverse attributes it was necessary to standardize the indicator values the following equations were used to normalize positive indicators x 1 and negative indicators cheng et al 2017 x 2 2 positive indicator r ij l x ij l j 1 m x ij h 2 r ij h x ij h j 1 m x ij l 2 i x 1 3 negative indicator r ij l 1 x ij h j 1 m 1 x ij l 2 r ij h 1 x ij l j 1 m 1 x ij h 2 i x 2 where r ij l is the normalized value of x ij l and r ij h is the normalized value of x ij h 2 calculation of comprehensive weights the subjective weights of indicator i expressed as w i 1 were determined by the analytic hierarchy process ahp method ahp is the most widely used subjective assignment method and the specific calculations are described in saaty 1987 once the subjective weights were calculated the objective weight of indicator i expressed as w i 2 was determined by using the interval number deviation the attribute value of the interval number was designed to reflect the different levels of development across regions the concept of interval number deviation was used to determine the objective weight interval number deviation deals with the deviation of indicator value which in turn determines the weight of the indicator whose value is an interval number the idea of using interval number deviation to determine indicator weight is that it can distinguish among the development levels of different regions the main steps of the comprehensive weight calculation method were 4 d r ij r ik r ij l r ik l 2 r ij h r ik h 2 5 w i 2 i 1 n k 1 n d r ij r kj j 1 m i 1 n k 1 n d r ij r kj 6 w i w i 1 w i 2 2 where d r ij r kj is the distance between the normalized values of two indicators r ij and r kj and w i is the comprehensive weight of indicator i j and k refer to different regions 3 construction of weighted and normalized intervals the weighted and normalized intervals could then be derived as 7 z ij l w i r ij l 8 z ij h w i r ij h 9 z ij z ij l z ij h 10 z i z i l z i h maxz ij l maxz ij h where z ij l is the weighted value of the normalized value r ij l z ij h is the weighted value of the normalized value r ij h and z j is the ideal interval of indicator i 4 calculation of the projection value according to the ideal interval and projection definition we used eq 11 to calculate the projection value p z z j 11 p z z j i 1 n z ij l z i l z ij h z i h i 1 n z i l 2 z i h 2 5 determination of the pre allocation ratio in the third step the pre allocation ratio of the fdr in each region was calculated as 12 s j p z z j j 1 m p z z j where s j is the pre allocation ratio of the fdr in region j 2 2 3 2 harmonious diagnosis model in any resource allocation method the indicator weights will be affected by decision makers preferences affecting the fairness and practicability of the plan and causing conflicts between regions and industries ansink and weikard 2009 to account for this we used harmony diagnosis to measure the harmony across allocation rights it is intended to reduce the influence of decision maker preferences on the indicator weights and the dissatisfaction of various regions with the initial allocation plan we used this evaluation to examine the initial allocation results and then to guide our plan adjustments and improve its practical utility it was equipped to consider scientific harmonious evaluation indicators as guidelines with the idea of obtaining a harmonious configuration plan through corresponding backward tracking adjustment and circular discriminant adjustment we expected this method to ensure that the allocation plan is satisfactory to all parties so as to achieve regional harmony voluntary participation chen et al 2011 li et al 2020 wu et al 2010 our harmonious diagnosis included two processes directional diagnosis and degree diagnosis the purpose of the directional diagnosis was to determine whether the size relationships between regions within the allocation plan were reasonable as long as indicator values in regions with larger quotas were better than in regions with smaller quotas the allocation result was considered to have passed the directional diagnosis the degree diagnosis aimed to determine whether the size of fdr between regions is reasonable accordingly the regional differences in fdr should remain within a specific relatively narrow range the specific procedure and calculations for the diagnoses follow 1 selection of the harmonious diagnosis indicator in the fourth step the harmony diagnosis index should be determined before the last step of harmony diagnosis according to previous work experience li et al 2020 wu and wu 2011 the number of harmony indicators is generally 4 6 the determination of harmony indicators is usually determined by experts in the relevant research field or staff from relevant work with certain work experience and weight values are assigned to these indicators 2 directional diagnosis the diagnostic was set so that if it found that region a j obtained more fdr than region a k i e s j s k then the directional diagnosis searched for a certain proportion of a better indicator to compensate for the worse indicator in region a j relative to region a k wu and chen 2010 this was acchieved according to the following steps step 1 we invited watershed organization managers and experts in related fields to determine the weights of these six indicators based on their relative importance namely w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 w 5 and w 6 i 1 6 w i 1 step 2 for research convenience the comparison between any two regions was a regional pair for the regional pair a j a k if region aj has more fdr than region ak i e s j s k and a certain proportion of indicator values in region aj are better than in region a k then that fdr allocation was considered reasonable if s j s k the indicator set needed to satisfy the conditions 13 s j s k i jk i i a j a k w i i i a j a k w i β i jk i i a j a k w i i i a j a k w i 1 where i a j a k indicates that the indicator value in region a j is better than that in region a k and is defined as i a j a k i 1 i 6 h ji h ki i a j a k indicates that the indicator value in region a j is equal to that in region a k and is defined as i a j a k i 1 i 6 h ji h ki i a j a k indicates that the indicator value in region a j is worse than that in region a k and is defines as i a j a k i 1 i 6 h ji h ki and β is the threshold of the directional diagnosis which was determined based on the characteristics of the watershed according to the results of research related to the harmonious diagnosis li et al 2020 wu and wu 2011 and the characteristics of the sunan canal basin such that β 0 5 0 8 3 degree diagnosis the harmonious diagnosis required that the differences in the fdr across different areas was within a certain acceptable range the following equations were used to determine the criteria for the degree diagnosis 14 δ a j a k i 1 6 w i h ji h ki η min δ a j a k s j s k η max δ a j a k where δ a j a k is the weighted comprehensive index coefficient and η min and η m ax represent the lower and upper limits of the matching coefficient respectively which were determined based on regional characteristics such that η min 0 1 and η max 1 4 determination of the upper and lower limits of the matching coefficient to satisfy eq 14 it was necessary to determine the upper and lower limits of the matching coefficient η min and η m ax can be understood as people s requirements for harmony that is when η min and η m ax were both close to 1 such that 1 η min and η m ax 1 were both close to 0 the matching degree between the fdr allocation ratio and the comprehensive index was the highest with a gradual increase of 1 η min and η m ax 1 the matching degree gradually decreases as in li et al 2020 at this time we can divide η min and η m ax into three levels 0 η min 0 35 l o w m a t c h i n g d e g r e e 0 35 η min 0 7 m e d i u m m a t c h i n g d e g r e e 0 7 η min 1 h i g h m a t c h i n g d e g r e e 2 2 3 3 harmonious adjustment of the pre allocation plan whenever the pre allocation plan of fdr was disharmonious we adjusted it we applied the evolutionary stability strategy to the harmonious evolution using the method of backward tracking to adjust the amount of fdr in a disharmonious area the adjustment steps were as follows 1 determination of disharmonious regions if the fdr pre allocation plan failed to pass the directional diagnosis phase some indicator weights were redistributed the method of ahp can be used to re redistribute the weights of the indicators to adjust the fdr allocation plan if the plan failed to pass the degree diagnosis then the plan was adjusted the number of the degree diagnosed between regions a j and a k was n 1 the amount of drainage rights that should be increased or decreased in region a j was calculated as 15 δ s j k 1 k j n δ s jk where δ s j is the increase or decrease of fdr in region a j and δ s jk indicates the amount of fdr that should be reduced or increased in region a j relative to region a k 2 reverse tracking of fdr if the pre allocation plan failed to pass the degree diagnosis based on the comprehensive indicators this was interpreted to indicate that the allocation ratio of fdr between some regional pair a j a k was not in the range of η min δ a j a k η max δ a j a k that is η min δ a j a k s j s k or η max δ a j a k s j s k thus in region a j relative to region a k the magnitude of the required fdr adjustment was defined as 16 v 1 min v 2 η max δ a 1 a 2 v 3 η max δ a 1 a 3 v 4 η max δ a 1 a 4 and 17 δ s jk s jk s j where s jk refers to the adjusted amount of fdr in region a j relative to region a k if η min δ a j a k s j s k then s jk η min δ a j a k and if η max δ a j a k s j s k then s jk η max δ a j a k the term δ s j is the adjusted amount of fdr in region a j the sum of the adjusted fdr in all regions is by definition zero j 1 n δ s j 0 2 2 4 data the data for the four cities in the jiangsu section of the sunan canal watershed were obtained from the jiangsu statistical yearbook bureau of statistics of jiangsu 2009 2018 the china urban statistical yearbook urban bureau of statistics of china 2009 2018 and the jiangsu water conservancy yearbook department of water resources of jiangsu province 2009 2018 these data all originate from the china statistical yearbooks which are published annually by the chinese government national bureau of statistics with data covering all provinces the data are publicly available in chinese and in english and are considered to be reliable 2 2 5 application of the model first we used the comprehensive weight method to process the collected data on the four cities in the jiangsu section of the sunan canal to obtain the weight of each indicator in the fdr indicator allocation system after that we used the interval multi objective decision making model based on projection to calculate the fdr of each city and to obtain a pre allocation plan for fdr between regions finally we used the harmonious diagnosis model to perform a harmonious diagnosis of the fdr pre allocation plan and to adjust it to obtain a harmonious allocation plan of fdr among the regions in the watershed when determining the indicators of the harmony diagnosis firstly the indicator with the largest weight in each principle was selected as part of the indicator for harmony diagnosis secondly according to the principle of the harmonious diagnosis method the harmonious diagnosis indicators are usually 4 6 the purpose of the chinese government in managing floods disaster is to reduce casualties as much as possible therefore according to the actual situation and discussion with experts population density f4 is selected as a harmonious diagnosis indicator therefore six indicators were chosen as harmony diagnosis indicators then according to regional characteristics and expert suggestions as well as the results of other studies the weights were determined for each harmony diagnosis indicator and the threshold was set as β 0 6 li et al 2020 wu and wu 2011 wu and chen 2010 finally the allocation results from our five principle model were compared with three other allocation results based on the following principle combinations fairness fairness and efficiency and fairness efficiency and sustainable development 3 results 3 1 indicator weights the comprehensive weight results for the fdr allocation indicator system are shown in table 2 in the indicator layer the three indicators with the largest weight values were the proportion of the watershed area in the region to the total watershed area 7 77 per capita income 7 46 and ability to cope with floods 7 36 the three indicators with the smallest weight values are average annual rainfall 1 24 engel coefficient 1 27 and forest cover rate 2 09 3 2 fdr pre allocation plan the results of the fdr pre allocation plan are preented in table 3 and fig 4 the pre allocation results reveal that suzhou has the largest fdr allocation 32 81 followed by wuxi 24 68 changzhou 22 69 and zhenjiang 19 83 3 3 results of the harmony diagnosis of the pre allocation plan the six indicators chosen for harmony diagnosis were proportion of watershed s area in the region to the total watershed s area f2 population density f4 per capita income e5 green area s2 number of people affected by floods r1 and the ability to cope with floods c2 the raw data values of the harmony diagnosis indicators are shown in table 4 3 3 1 directional diagnosis the results of the directional diagnosis are shown in table 5 the value of i jk for each of the six region pairs was greater than β 0 6 and in each case i jk 1 therefore the fdr pre allocation plan passed the directional diagnosis 3 3 2 degree diagnosis the weighted comprehensive index coefficient values δ a j a k of the six region pairs are shown in table 6 the ratio of fdr s j s k in the six regions pairs were obtained table 7 the values of η min and η max were obtained according to regional characteristics based on the characteristics of the jiangsu section of the sunan canal and according to the characteristics of eq 14 and meet the requirements of high harmony matching degree η min was set as 0 7 since η max 2 η min therefore η max 1 3 the degree diagnosis results based on this are shown in table 8 the region pairs 1 2 and 3 exceeded the value of η max δ a j a k this means that the fdr pre allocation plan failed to pass the degree diagnosis test and therefore had to be adjusted 1 in the first round of adjustment the adjusted values of fdr for suzhou were as follows 1 suzhou a1 zhenjiang a2 v 1 v 2 η max δ a 1 a 2 19 83 1 5007 29 76 2 suzhou a1 wuxi a3 v 1 v 3 η max δ a 1 a 3 24 68 1 1893 29 35 3 suzhou a1 changzhou a4 v 1 v 4 η max δ a 1 a 4 22 69 1 2862 29 18 the adjusted fdr of suzhou was v 1 29 18 because suzhou s fdr was reduced the excess fdr was allocated to other regions the reduction in fdr for suzhou was δ v v 1 v 1 3 63 if this reduction were re allocated to zhenjiang then the fdr of zhenjiang would be greater than that of changzhou which is inconsistent with the results of the directional diagnosis similarly the fdr could not be allocated to changzhou because its total would be greater than that of wuxi which is also inconsistent with the directional diagnosis results therefore the allocation of the reduced fdr in suzhou was best made to wuxi since it will not affect the results of the directional diagnosis the results of the first round of adjustment of the fdr allocation are shown in table 9 2 for the second round of adjustment a new degree diagnosis was obtained table 10 table 10 reveals that pair 4 had a value lower than η min δ a j a k after the first round of adjustment so it did not pass the degree diagnosis and a second round of adjustment was required after a second round the adjusted value of fdr in zhenjiang was found to be v 2 v 3 η min δ a 2 a 3 20 03 so its fdr increased by δ v v 2 v 2 0 2 at that point only pair 4 was not harmonious but the increased fdr in zhenjiang needed to be subtracted from that of wuxi therefore the fdr in wuxi was v 3 v 3 0 2 28 10 the final results of the second round of adjustment are shown in table 11 the new degree diagnosis indicated that the second round of adjustments resulted in an fdr allocation plan that can be approved table 12 from this we concluded that harmony had been achieved for this fdr allocation plan 3 3 3 harmonious allocation plan after the harmony diagnosis and two rounds of adjustments to the pre allocation plan a harmonious fdr allocation plan was obtained fig 5 is a presentation of the pre and post adjustment fdrs for the four cities in the jiangsu section of the sunan canal the changes were notable especially for suzhou and wuxi in the fdr pre allocation plan suzhou had the largest proportion of fdr reaching 32 81 while zhenjiang had the smallest one at only 19 83 as such the fdr of suzhou was 12 99 higher than that of zhenjiang while wuxi and changzhou ranked second and third respectively the fdr of suzhou was 8 13 higher than that of wuxi and 10 12 higher than that of changzhou after the harmonious adjustment the fdr values of suzhou wuxi changzhou and zhenjiang were 29 18 28 10 22 69 and 20 03 respectively by comparing the pre allocation plan with the plan after harmonious diagnosis we found that the fdr in suzhou decreased by 3 63 so it was 8 88 6 49 and 1 08 higher than in zhenjiang changzhou and wuxi respectively as such the fdr gap between regions was greatly narrowed while the proportion of fdr allocation in suzhou decreased it remained the highest of the four regions 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of the harmonious allocation plan the final allocation of fdr recommended by our analysis demonstrates the existence of a large gap in fdr between regions suppose the respective proportions of fdr allocation in suzhou and wuxi are too large in that case this will lead to insufficient values of fdr in other regions thus aggravating flood disaster losses and causing dissatisfaction in other regions and flood discharge conflicts therefore it is necessary to adjust the fdr of suzhou wuxi and zhenjiang without affecting their flood drainage benefits the results of the allocation plan can be explored based on the principles that guided the development of our method suzhou s results reflect its economic importance e g 1 from the perspective of fairness suzhou has the largest land area the proportion of watershed s area in the region to total watershed s area embankment length and built up area the plan reflected these indicators which reflect suzhou s need for more fdr than the other regions 2 from the efficiency perspective suzhou has the largest per capita gdp per capita income and urbanization rate but the lowest engel coefficient these four indicators represent the efficiency in the use of fdr since they favor more developed regional economies such areas have higher flood drainage efficiency justifying the use of more fdr 3 in terms of flood resilience suzhou has a strong ability to cope with floods thus while the fdr of suzhou was reduced by the harmony adjustments it can still meet the flood drainage demands of suzhou and promote the cooperation and safety of the entire basin zhenjiang s fdr increased from 19 83 to 20 03 during the adjustment with an increase of just 0 2 keeping it in its spot as the lowest among the studied cities the reasons for the small proportion of zhenjiang s fdr allocation are as follows 1 from the perspective of fairness zhenjiang has a small land area and a small population and the sunan canal only flows through a small part of this city thus it requires less fdr 2 from the perspective of efficiency zhenjiang s per capita gdp and per capita income are also the lowest of the region which means that zhenjiang s economy is relatively undeveloped and its flood discharge efficiency is very low 3 on the other hand the historical context reveals that zhenjiang has had the largest number of people affected by floods over the years which means that it is the most affected by floods and needs more fdr overall however zhenjiang s small size and infrastructure keep it at the low end of the fdr distribution the fdr in wuxi was reduced by 0 2 during the harmonious adjustment which increased the proportion of fdr in zhenjiang while not affecting the flood drainage benefit of wuxi however the fdr in changzhou remained unchanged at 22 69 4 2 comparison of harmonious allocation results based on different allocation principles the principles that underlie an allocation method are of great importance as they dramatically alter the results of fdr allocation the results of comparing our method s output with other combinations of principles are shown in fig 6 all of the allocation plans yielded the same order of fdr from the largest to smallest suzhou wuxi changzhou and zhenjiang this shows that the allocation results in this paper are in line with the actual development despite this common pattern the specific allocation results were different in important ways for example scenario 2 resulted in extensive gaps in fdr allocation between cities its fdr recommendation of suzhou was 45 37 while zhenjiang would receive less than a third of that only 14 30 such a scenario ignores the history of flood damage in zhenjiang and emphasizes size and wealth this would be likely to cause dissatisfaction and a lack of cooperation among regions the addition of the principle of efficiency in scenario 3 caused minor changes to its outcome but the basic situation is similar to scenario 2 the gap between regions in scenario 4 was narrowed after considering the factor of sustainable development which drove down the fdr in suzhou and increased that in zhenjiang scenario 1 produced the smallest gaps in fdr among the regions taking into account the floods resilience strategy and the respect for the regions history by comparing the four allocation plans we can see that the consideration of only one allocation principle will lead to a large gap in the proportion of fdr among regions in this way it is difficult to achieve the fairness and rationality of the fdr allocation results with the consideration of various allocation principles the gaps between regions in the allocation plan gradually narrows therefore our allocation plan based on the five distribution principles can better reflect the development status and the actual interests of each region a well balanced allocation plan is easier for all parties to accept and implement in each region thereby promoting a coordinated development across the regions in order to reduce flood disaster losses and alleviate the current situation of flood drainage conflicts between regions governments should actively implement fdr allocation systems that weigh the needs strengths and interests of its regions such a plan should be able to reduce the overall flood disaster losses and promote the sustainable development of the watershed we hope that this paper encourages governments and agencies to explore the approach demonstrated here and that it serves as a reference 5 conclusions the aim of this paper was to contribute towards solving the problem of flood drainage conflicts caused by the competition for fdr between regions during flood disasters which further aggravates flood disaster losses based on the five principles of fairness high efficiency sustainable development respect for historical context and flood resilience strategy an initial allocation harmony diagnosis approach to developing watershed fdr allocation plans was established our case study of the jiangsu section of the sunan canal in china led to the following conclusions 1 our model identified excessive gaps between certain regions in the fdr pre allocation plan as it failed to pass the harmony diagnosis this plan would be unappealing to some regions and warranted adjustment to ensure harmony 2 two rounds of harmonious adjustments were made to the pre allocation plan which successfully yielded a more harmonious fdr allocation plan the fdr gaps among regions were greatly reduced moreover while it did not affect the interests of various regions this plan is capable of promoting the harmonious development of the entire basin to be easily accepted by all regions and improving the practicality of the fdr allocation plan 3 the allocation results based on the five principles indicator system established in this paper were more harmonious and should be more easily accepted by regions less favored by simpler approaches in particular historical context and flood resilience is often ignored when allocating fdr but our results show that these principles should be considered as they improve allocation outcomes given limitations imposed by available data and current research based conceptual models we acknowledge that there may be other allocation principles and allocation indicators that could have an important impact on the allocation of fdr this paper focuses on the five principles of fairness efficiency sustainable development respect for historical context and flood resilience strategy in follow up research one could explore

4297,flood drainage rights fdr refer to the rights of all regions in a watershed to drain floodwaters into river reaches under the permission of law fdr is an important measure used to manage the flooding in various regions of china this paper explores the problem of flood drainage conflicts caused by regional competition for fdr during flood disasters we designed an fdr allocation indicator system based on the principles of fairness efficiency sustainable development respect for historical context and flood resilience strategy we used the interval multi objective allocation model based on the projection method to create an fdr pre allocation plan and iteratively improved it until it exceeded the standards of a harmonious diagnosis method thereby obtaining a harmonious allocation plan the jiangsu section of the sunan canal in the yangtze river delta region of china was taken as an example using data from 2009 to 2018 to study the suitability of our approach and compare it with other indicator systems our results showed that 1 in the fdr pre allocation the proportions of fdr obtained by suzhou zhenjiang wuxi and changzhou were 32 81 19 83 24 68 and 22 69 respectively however the fdr pre allocation scheme did not pass the harmonious diagnosis and would have been objectionable to some regions 2 after two rounds of harmonious adjustment the model yielded a final scheme that would promote the harmonious development of the region and improve the acceptability of the fdr allocation plan in the harmonious distribution of fdr the proportions of fdr obtained by suzhou zhenjiang wuxi and changzhou were changed to 29 18 20 03 28 10 and 22 69 respectively 3 the allocation results based on our five principle approach were the most harmonious of the tested plans our method is geared toward solving the problem of flood drainage conflicts between regions to ensure an orderly flood drainage situation reduce flood losses and promote the harmonious development of the entire watershed as such it provides a reference for governments and agencies involved in fdr management abbreviations fdr flood drainage right gdp gross domestic product ahp analytic hierarchy process keywords yangtze river delta flood resilience strategy sustainable development indicator system watershed management 1 introduction flood plains and deltas tend to provide abundant water resources and fertile soil and they are often convenient hubs for shipping these are among the reasons people occupy and develop these riparian areas islam 2016 nicholls et al 2011 however economic growth population agglomeration and construction associated with rapid urban development have rendered cities in flood plains and deltas increasingly vulnerable to flooding de moel et al 2011 in the past decades climate change has exacerbated the effects of urbanization and complex infrastructure construction by increasing the frequency of extreme weather events causing flood disasters in an increasing number of regions vermuyten et al 2020 some notable events included the flooding of the river rhine in the netherlands in 1995 zlatanova et al 2014 hurricane harvey in the united states in 2017 zhang et al 2018 and the impacts of typhoon nepartak in china in 2016 lyu et al 2018 floods have incurred substantial economic losses on residents of flood plains and deltas such costs are expected to continue to rise in the future with the risk of flood disasters expected to triple by 2050 jongman et al 2012 field et al 2012 a growing body of research has emerged to identify and examine methods of mitigating the losses caused by flood disasters in china the government owns the rights to discharge floodwaters as needed as a flood control measure toward ensuring the safety of citizens and infrastructure referred to as flood drainage rights fdr fdr management aims to minimize runoff through the optimal allocation of floodwater capacity resources and to promote social equity sun et al 2020 a substantial body of contemporary research explores fdr allocation and management strategies to cope with flood disasters a traditional approach was to adopt a flood resistance strategy through constructing physical barriers to resist floods and prevent flood disasters although this structural kind of measure can play a certain role it is both expensive and harmful to the surrounding environment and is not conducive to the sustainable development of human society werritty 2006 in the context of climate change the intensity and frequency of floods continue to increase westra et al 2014 and it is impossible to prevent floods by using physical barriers alone therefore a more contemporary approach is a flood resilience strategy which advocates that society expects to live with and adapt to floods as much as possible a flood resilience strategy can reduce flood disaster losses and improve the sustainable development of a region further the riparian flood plains that become flooded by periodic lateral overflows of the river di baldassarre et al 2013 typically represent high value ecosystems that provide abundant ecosystem services and support a wide array of biodiversity opperman et al 2009 currently the most widely used basic flood risk management system developed two decades ago advocates the use of a resilience based strategy plate 2002 the system is based on flood control strategies and water conservancy engineering measures as well as flood defense strategies such as flood forecasting before the event flood dispatching plans during the event and post event land management and flood disaster loss assessment hegger et al 2016 thieken et al 2016 therefore the flood risk management system promotes the use of sustainable development management methods although the current flood risk management system is relatively complete it has certain limitations for example using a flood dispatching plan to manage floods based on water conservancy projects only considers hydrological factors ignoring economic development politics environment and other critical factors among different regions in the watershed in china the central government often is in charge of formulating flood dispatch plans and local governments implement the plans however in actual operation illegal flood drainage and excessive flood drainage occur making the flood dispatching plan unable to be implemented in accordance with the original plan therefore the flood dispatching plan likely reduces the flood discharge efficiency leading to an unsatisfactory flood drainage effect shen et al 2019 most notably the mechanism by which flood drainage volume is allocated between regions in a watershed is supported by insufficient research and is prone to errors for example in july 2016 the rainy season caused flooding in many areas of china due to the poor planning of regional flood drainage rights fdr the excessive flood drainage into the taihu lake s upper reaches caused flooding in some villages in yixing city the incident affected more than 130 000 residents who experienced extensive risk to their safety and property the population centers within this watershed are concentrated in an upstream region and a downstream region along the river channel an upstream region can drain its floodwater into the river system before a downstream region can causing a sharp increase in river water volume and flow rate for those living downstream when the flood drainage demand of each region exceeds the limited water capacity of the river channel the flood drainage from the upstream region will add pressure to the downstream region this results in competition between regions to secure access to flood drainage which is especially prominent in china the proper flood drainage of a river is considered a public pond resource which has the characteristics of non exclusivity and competition the upper and lower reaches of a river and its left and right banks can discharge water into the river or prevent it from escaping the channel each location with a great demand for fdr will prioritize reducing their losses caused by flood disasters rather than considering the overall interests of the watershed or those downstream from them as they rush to drain the flood to the river to protect their citizens and interests they create a disorderly flood drainage situation and risk triggering flood drainage conflicts disorderly flood drainage will result in inefficiency and unfairness in flood management to ensure orderly flood drainage that minimizes harm throughout a watershed it is necessary to plan and implement a comprehensive fdr system that considers all regions in a watershed during periods of heavy rainfall if each part in a watershed drains water according to the prescribed fdr plan floods can be staggered water can be detained in some regions for a period of time and the damage can be minimized the optimal balance can be achieved between the watershed s limited flood control capacity and the regional flood drainage demand with this approach which is based on hydrological economic cultural and political characteristics and other factors of each region in the watershed the flood drainage needs of each region are explored in a more comprehensive perspective the flood drainage capacity of each region is allocated to each region and flood control benefits in the watershed can be maximized during a flood event each region can drainage flood according to the allocated fdr and the region with a greater fdr can drainage more floodwater therefore the design of a fair efficient and sustainable fdr allocation method is the key to solving the problem of flood drainage competition between regions in a watershed at present research on fdr is in its infancy shen et al 2019 used a chaos optimization projection pursuit model to study the fdr s allocation in the jiangsu section of the huai river basin based on economic historical loss and ecological factors in a previous study zhang et al 2019 quantified the allocation of fdr based on natural conditions socioeconomic development level and technical management using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and the gini coefficient zhang et al 2020 employed the entropy topsis method to allocate fdr in the huai river basin from the perspective of fairness efficiency and sustainable development the existing research on fdr allocation has certain limitations 1 the indicator system used for fdr allocation is not scientific and reasonable having an emphasis on fairness efficiency and sustainable development but with little regard to flood resilience strategies and the historical patterns of flood management yet the flood resilience strategy has been recognized worldwide since it can improve a region s adaptability to flood disasters and promote the sustainable development of the region therefore resilience needs to be considered when constructing the allocation of fdr indicator system at the same time when differences between fdr allocation and the existing regional flood drainage patterns are too great this mismatch will inevitably generate dissatisfaction in any regions that feel that their interests are being damaged and cause disharmony under a flood risk management system that advocates a flood resilience strategy relevant factors should be considered to construct a more scientific and reasonable fdr allocation indicator system 2 the majority of existing studies on fdr allocation are based on single year datasets however natural environmental phenomena such as precipitation and soil erosion are unpredictable and time variable therefore allocation based on data from only one year are likely to prove inconsistent with the actual situation which affects the fairness of the fdr allocation results 3 existing research on fdr allocation has used mathematical models to calculate the objective factors of the region though it has not the built in analysis of the rationality of the allocation plans that result therefore it has been difficult to determine the practicality of these fdr allocation plans toward solving these problems we constructed an indicator system for the allocation of fdr based on the combined principles of fairness efficiency sustainable development respect for flood management history and flood resilience strategies to demonstrate this approach we used the two stage fdr allocation method of initial allocation harmony diagnosis to study the allocation of fdr in various regions in a watershed finally we applied our allocation process to the southern jiangsu canal in china based on an extensive dataset spanning from 2009 to 2018 this served as a case study aimed at making up for the lack of planning of the fdr of various regions in the current flood management plan and showing a scientific reasonable and harmonious fdr allocation this research is intended to guide researchers and agencies toward improvements in the effectiveness practicality and community acceptance of flood management plans thereby alleviating flood drainage conflicts and reducing flood disaster losses in a watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the sunan canal is located in the economically developed yangtze river delta region of china and belongs to the taihu lake system in the yangtze river basin fig 1 with a total area of approximately 21 600 km2 it connects the taihu lake basin in the west the huangpu river in the east the yangtze river in the north and the taihu dike in the south the sunan canal is located mainly in jiangsu province but it also extends into shanghai zhejiang and anhui it is a crucial component of the taihu lake system its support for shipping water diversion irrigation and biodiversity gives it an extremely high ecological and economic value for the yangtze river delta socioeconomics the cities along the jiangsu section of the sunan canal are located in the yangtze river delta s core area they are numerous densely populated and economically developed fig 2 in 2018 the total population of the four cities in the jiangsu section of the sunan canal exceeded 25 million 1 8 of china s total population and the urbanization rate reached 73 94 statistical yearbook of china 2019 these four cities in southern jiangsu comprise one of the most economically developed regions in china with a gross domestic product gdp of 6 42688 105 billion u s dollars 1 u s dollar 6 5 yuan accounting for 4 6 of national gdp and a per capita gdp of about 2 41538 107 u s dollars i e 2 43 times the national per capita gdp climate the area along the sunan canal has a subtropical humid monsoon climate with four distinct seasons including a hot and rainy summer affected by the monsoon spring and autumn are short winter and summer are relatively longer the annual average temperature ranges between 13 6 16 1 the area has abundant precipitation with the annual precipitation of 1000 to 1250 mm which shows a clear seasonal distribution most precipitation occurs in summer as storms accounting for half of the annual precipitation precipitation in winter is the least affected by tropical storms and typhoons from may to august this area is prone to catastrophic weather events with heavy rains and wind gusts which bring in severe impacts to local environment and society the riparian area along the sunan canal has a complex water system and experiences frequent floods which could be more vulnerable to weather extremes under the changing climate fore example in the past six consecutive years 2015 2020 the flood level along the sunan canal and throughout the region was higher than the historical average 2 2 methods we adopted a two stage initial fdr allocation plan namely the initial allocation harmony diagnosis approach which is an interval multi objective distribution model based on projection once the initial allocation model was complete we evaluated the acceptability of the pre allocation plan and adjusted it using the harmony diagnosis method the detailed procedure of the method is shown in fig 3 2 2 1 principles of drainage rights distribution in the first step we refined the principles of fdr allocation to minimize economic losses while achieving sustainable social development by comprehensively considering the social and economic conditions ecological needs flood control capacity historical flood drainage needs and other factors of each flood drainage region we used the following principles in constructing our fdr allocation plans 1 fairness a fair allocation is of fundamental importance only a fair fdr allocation system can reduce the resistance and dissatisfaction of each region and increase the acceptability of the system each region has its own land area population environment and other characteristics rosegrant et al 1995 syme et al 1999 resulting in different demands for flood drainage to achieve fairness in the design of an fdr allocation plan factors such as land area population and natural environment of each region should be fully considered to meet the actual needs of each region to an equivalent extent and achieve fairness 2 high efficiency we sought to maximize the efficiency of our allocation plan by allocation fdr based on the flood drainage capacity and efficiency of each region which has been shown to reduce the loss generated by floods in the whole watershed bennett et al 2000 keller and keller 1995 we adjusted the flood drainage volume among regions based on regional safety and fairness in general fdr was inclined towards areas with high flood drainage efficiency so that the unit flood drainage could produce more significant social ecological and economic benefits 3 respect for historical context some regions have failed to carry out proper flood drainage planning in the past neglecting the whole watershed perspective resulting in harm to their neighbors while this has often been overlooked during fdr allocation we attempted to correct these existing unreasonable phenomena in a sensitive way since these corrections inevitably led to changes in the benefit patterns of fdr plans with small differences between their allocation results and the current situation will be more readily accepted and put into practice su et al 2001 accounting for the historical and current management of the region was necessary for our fdr allocation plan 4 sustainable development we emphasized the coordination between economic growth and environmental protection in order to promote the long term development of human society sophocleous 2005 in a watershed this entailed strengthening the defenses of the ecological environment reducing the occurrence of soil erosion and reducing water resources pollution 5 floods resilience strategy our plans adhered to a flood resilience strategy by accepting the inevitability of floods we eschewed the strategy of blindly heightening and strengthening water conservancy and flood control facilities inundating polders and green rivers in economically underdeveloped areas can be used to shift peaks reduce flood intensity and protect economically developed regions all while reinforcing ecosystems 2 2 2 the construction of the indicator system we selected indicators capable of reflecting our five principles including fairness efficiency sustainability historical respect and flood resilience table 1 they were selected based on their merits conceptual clarity clarity of their definition meaning reliability of the data mutual independence and ease of calculation han et al 2019 2 2 3 model construction 2 2 3 1 interval multi objective allocation model in the second step we selected the multi objective decision making model because of its solid foundation in the context of resource allocation where it allows an effective allocation of water resources and the maximization of economic benefits wang et al 2010 we incorporated interval programming into our multi objective allocation model to optimize uncertain parameters using the maximum and minimum values in a certain interval this method yields results that are closer to reality as it can eliminate one sided problems and the influence of data sampling errors given that no single year is representative of broader trends the use of maximum and minimum values of the interval are designed to solve the one sidedness problem and ensure a good allocation of fdr the initial flood drainage in a system was defined as t 1 t 2 t j t n t 0 where t j is the drainage allocated to region j which drains to a river and t 0 indicates the maximum flood volume that a given river can bear the pre allocation ratio for the fdr ratio was s j 0 s 1 0 s 2 0 s i 0 s m 0 where i is an indicator the five steps of the interval multi object allocation calculation are as follows 1 data standardization according to the indicator i i 1 2 n fdr allocation was performed in j regions the attribute range x ij of the indicator i corresponding to region j was expressed as 1 x ij x ij l x ij h where x ij l is the lower limit and x ij h is the upper limit as some indicators have both forward and reverse attributes it was necessary to standardize the indicator values the following equations were used to normalize positive indicators x 1 and negative indicators cheng et al 2017 x 2 2 positive indicator r ij l x ij l j 1 m x ij h 2 r ij h x ij h j 1 m x ij l 2 i x 1 3 negative indicator r ij l 1 x ij h j 1 m 1 x ij l 2 r ij h 1 x ij l j 1 m 1 x ij h 2 i x 2 where r ij l is the normalized value of x ij l and r ij h is the normalized value of x ij h 2 calculation of comprehensive weights the subjective weights of indicator i expressed as w i 1 were determined by the analytic hierarchy process ahp method ahp is the most widely used subjective assignment method and the specific calculations are described in saaty 1987 once the subjective weights were calculated the objective weight of indicator i expressed as w i 2 was determined by using the interval number deviation the attribute value of the interval number was designed to reflect the different levels of development across regions the concept of interval number deviation was used to determine the objective weight interval number deviation deals with the deviation of indicator value which in turn determines the weight of the indicator whose value is an interval number the idea of using interval number deviation to determine indicator weight is that it can distinguish among the development levels of different regions the main steps of the comprehensive weight calculation method were 4 d r ij r ik r ij l r ik l 2 r ij h r ik h 2 5 w i 2 i 1 n k 1 n d r ij r kj j 1 m i 1 n k 1 n d r ij r kj 6 w i w i 1 w i 2 2 where d r ij r kj is the distance between the normalized values of two indicators r ij and r kj and w i is the comprehensive weight of indicator i j and k refer to different regions 3 construction of weighted and normalized intervals the weighted and normalized intervals could then be derived as 7 z ij l w i r ij l 8 z ij h w i r ij h 9 z ij z ij l z ij h 10 z i z i l z i h maxz ij l maxz ij h where z ij l is the weighted value of the normalized value r ij l z ij h is the weighted value of the normalized value r ij h and z j is the ideal interval of indicator i 4 calculation of the projection value according to the ideal interval and projection definition we used eq 11 to calculate the projection value p z z j 11 p z z j i 1 n z ij l z i l z ij h z i h i 1 n z i l 2 z i h 2 5 determination of the pre allocation ratio in the third step the pre allocation ratio of the fdr in each region was calculated as 12 s j p z z j j 1 m p z z j where s j is the pre allocation ratio of the fdr in region j 2 2 3 2 harmonious diagnosis model in any resource allocation method the indicator weights will be affected by decision makers preferences affecting the fairness and practicability of the plan and causing conflicts between regions and industries ansink and weikard 2009 to account for this we used harmony diagnosis to measure the harmony across allocation rights it is intended to reduce the influence of decision maker preferences on the indicator weights and the dissatisfaction of various regions with the initial allocation plan we used this evaluation to examine the initial allocation results and then to guide our plan adjustments and improve its practical utility it was equipped to consider scientific harmonious evaluation indicators as guidelines with the idea of obtaining a harmonious configuration plan through corresponding backward tracking adjustment and circular discriminant adjustment we expected this method to ensure that the allocation plan is satisfactory to all parties so as to achieve regional harmony voluntary participation chen et al 2011 li et al 2020 wu et al 2010 our harmonious diagnosis included two processes directional diagnosis and degree diagnosis the purpose of the directional diagnosis was to determine whether the size relationships between regions within the allocation plan were reasonable as long as indicator values in regions with larger quotas were better than in regions with smaller quotas the allocation result was considered to have passed the directional diagnosis the degree diagnosis aimed to determine whether the size of fdr between regions is reasonable accordingly the regional differences in fdr should remain within a specific relatively narrow range the specific procedure and calculations for the diagnoses follow 1 selection of the harmonious diagnosis indicator in the fourth step the harmony diagnosis index should be determined before the last step of harmony diagnosis according to previous work experience li et al 2020 wu and wu 2011 the number of harmony indicators is generally 4 6 the determination of harmony indicators is usually determined by experts in the relevant research field or staff from relevant work with certain work experience and weight values are assigned to these indicators 2 directional diagnosis the diagnostic was set so that if it found that region a j obtained more fdr than region a k i e s j s k then the directional diagnosis searched for a certain proportion of a better indicator to compensate for the worse indicator in region a j relative to region a k wu and chen 2010 this was acchieved according to the following steps step 1 we invited watershed organization managers and experts in related fields to determine the weights of these six indicators based on their relative importance namely w 1 w 2 w 3 w 4 w 5 and w 6 i 1 6 w i 1 step 2 for research convenience the comparison between any two regions was a regional pair for the regional pair a j a k if region aj has more fdr than region ak i e s j s k and a certain proportion of indicator values in region aj are better than in region a k then that fdr allocation was considered reasonable if s j s k the indicator set needed to satisfy the conditions 13 s j s k i jk i i a j a k w i i i a j a k w i β i jk i i a j a k w i i i a j a k w i 1 where i a j a k indicates that the indicator value in region a j is better than that in region a k and is defined as i a j a k i 1 i 6 h ji h ki i a j a k indicates that the indicator value in region a j is equal to that in region a k and is defined as i a j a k i 1 i 6 h ji h ki i a j a k indicates that the indicator value in region a j is worse than that in region a k and is defines as i a j a k i 1 i 6 h ji h ki and β is the threshold of the directional diagnosis which was determined based on the characteristics of the watershed according to the results of research related to the harmonious diagnosis li et al 2020 wu and wu 2011 and the characteristics of the sunan canal basin such that β 0 5 0 8 3 degree diagnosis the harmonious diagnosis required that the differences in the fdr across different areas was within a certain acceptable range the following equations were used to determine the criteria for the degree diagnosis 14 δ a j a k i 1 6 w i h ji h ki η min δ a j a k s j s k η max δ a j a k where δ a j a k is the weighted comprehensive index coefficient and η min and η m ax represent the lower and upper limits of the matching coefficient respectively which were determined based on regional characteristics such that η min 0 1 and η max 1 4 determination of the upper and lower limits of the matching coefficient to satisfy eq 14 it was necessary to determine the upper and lower limits of the matching coefficient η min and η m ax can be understood as people s requirements for harmony that is when η min and η m ax were both close to 1 such that 1 η min and η m ax 1 were both close to 0 the matching degree between the fdr allocation ratio and the comprehensive index was the highest with a gradual increase of 1 η min and η m ax 1 the matching degree gradually decreases as in li et al 2020 at this time we can divide η min and η m ax into three levels 0 η min 0 35 l o w m a t c h i n g d e g r e e 0 35 η min 0 7 m e d i u m m a t c h i n g d e g r e e 0 7 η min 1 h i g h m a t c h i n g d e g r e e 2 2 3 3 harmonious adjustment of the pre allocation plan whenever the pre allocation plan of fdr was disharmonious we adjusted it we applied the evolutionary stability strategy to the harmonious evolution using the method of backward tracking to adjust the amount of fdr in a disharmonious area the adjustment steps were as follows 1 determination of disharmonious regions if the fdr pre allocation plan failed to pass the directional diagnosis phase some indicator weights were redistributed the method of ahp can be used to re redistribute the weights of the indicators to adjust the fdr allocation plan if the plan failed to pass the degree diagnosis then the plan was adjusted the number of the degree diagnosed between regions a j and a k was n 1 the amount of drainage rights that should be increased or decreased in region a j was calculated as 15 δ s j k 1 k j n δ s jk where δ s j is the increase or decrease of fdr in region a j and δ s jk indicates the amount of fdr that should be reduced or increased in region a j relative to region a k 2 reverse tracking of fdr if the pre allocation plan failed to pass the degree diagnosis based on the comprehensive indicators this was interpreted to indicate that the allocation ratio of fdr between some regional pair a j a k was not in the range of η min δ a j a k η max δ a j a k that is η min δ a j a k s j s k or η max δ a j a k s j s k thus in region a j relative to region a k the magnitude of the required fdr adjustment was defined as 16 v 1 min v 2 η max δ a 1 a 2 v 3 η max δ a 1 a 3 v 4 η max δ a 1 a 4 and 17 δ s jk s jk s j where s jk refers to the adjusted amount of fdr in region a j relative to region a k if η min δ a j a k s j s k then s jk η min δ a j a k and if η max δ a j a k s j s k then s jk η max δ a j a k the term δ s j is the adjusted amount of fdr in region a j the sum of the adjusted fdr in all regions is by definition zero j 1 n δ s j 0 2 2 4 data the data for the four cities in the jiangsu section of the sunan canal watershed were obtained from the jiangsu statistical yearbook bureau of statistics of jiangsu 2009 2018 the china urban statistical yearbook urban bureau of statistics of china 2009 2018 and the jiangsu water conservancy yearbook department of water resources of jiangsu province 2009 2018 these data all originate from the china statistical yearbooks which are published annually by the chinese government national bureau of statistics with data covering all provinces the data are publicly available in chinese and in english and are considered to be reliable 2 2 5 application of the model first we used the comprehensive weight method to process the collected data on the four cities in the jiangsu section of the sunan canal to obtain the weight of each indicator in the fdr indicator allocation system after that we used the interval multi objective decision making model based on projection to calculate the fdr of each city and to obtain a pre allocation plan for fdr between regions finally we used the harmonious diagnosis model to perform a harmonious diagnosis of the fdr pre allocation plan and to adjust it to obtain a harmonious allocation plan of fdr among the regions in the watershed when determining the indicators of the harmony diagnosis firstly the indicator with the largest weight in each principle was selected as part of the indicator for harmony diagnosis secondly according to the principle of the harmonious diagnosis method the harmonious diagnosis indicators are usually 4 6 the purpose of the chinese government in managing floods disaster is to reduce casualties as much as possible therefore according to the actual situation and discussion with experts population density f4 is selected as a harmonious diagnosis indicator therefore six indicators were chosen as harmony diagnosis indicators then according to regional characteristics and expert suggestions as well as the results of other studies the weights were determined for each harmony diagnosis indicator and the threshold was set as β 0 6 li et al 2020 wu and wu 2011 wu and chen 2010 finally the allocation results from our five principle model were compared with three other allocation results based on the following principle combinations fairness fairness and efficiency and fairness efficiency and sustainable development 3 results 3 1 indicator weights the comprehensive weight results for the fdr allocation indicator system are shown in table 2 in the indicator layer the three indicators with the largest weight values were the proportion of the watershed area in the region to the total watershed area 7 77 per capita income 7 46 and ability to cope with floods 7 36 the three indicators with the smallest weight values are average annual rainfall 1 24 engel coefficient 1 27 and forest cover rate 2 09 3 2 fdr pre allocation plan the results of the fdr pre allocation plan are preented in table 3 and fig 4 the pre allocation results reveal that suzhou has the largest fdr allocation 32 81 followed by wuxi 24 68 changzhou 22 69 and zhenjiang 19 83 3 3 results of the harmony diagnosis of the pre allocation plan the six indicators chosen for harmony diagnosis were proportion of watershed s area in the region to the total watershed s area f2 population density f4 per capita income e5 green area s2 number of people affected by floods r1 and the ability to cope with floods c2 the raw data values of the harmony diagnosis indicators are shown in table 4 3 3 1 directional diagnosis the results of the directional diagnosis are shown in table 5 the value of i jk for each of the six region pairs was greater than β 0 6 and in each case i jk 1 therefore the fdr pre allocation plan passed the directional diagnosis 3 3 2 degree diagnosis the weighted comprehensive index coefficient values δ a j a k of the six region pairs are shown in table 6 the ratio of fdr s j s k in the six regions pairs were obtained table 7 the values of η min and η max were obtained according to regional characteristics based on the characteristics of the jiangsu section of the sunan canal and according to the characteristics of eq 14 and meet the requirements of high harmony matching degree η min was set as 0 7 since η max 2 η min therefore η max 1 3 the degree diagnosis results based on this are shown in table 8 the region pairs 1 2 and 3 exceeded the value of η max δ a j a k this means that the fdr pre allocation plan failed to pass the degree diagnosis test and therefore had to be adjusted 1 in the first round of adjustment the adjusted values of fdr for suzhou were as follows 1 suzhou a1 zhenjiang a2 v 1 v 2 η max δ a 1 a 2 19 83 1 5007 29 76 2 suzhou a1 wuxi a3 v 1 v 3 η max δ a 1 a 3 24 68 1 1893 29 35 3 suzhou a1 changzhou a4 v 1 v 4 η max δ a 1 a 4 22 69 1 2862 29 18 the adjusted fdr of suzhou was v 1 29 18 because suzhou s fdr was reduced the excess fdr was allocated to other regions the reduction in fdr for suzhou was δ v v 1 v 1 3 63 if this reduction were re allocated to zhenjiang then the fdr of zhenjiang would be greater than that of changzhou which is inconsistent with the results of the directional diagnosis similarly the fdr could not be allocated to changzhou because its total would be greater than that of wuxi which is also inconsistent with the directional diagnosis results therefore the allocation of the reduced fdr in suzhou was best made to wuxi since it will not affect the results of the directional diagnosis the results of the first round of adjustment of the fdr allocation are shown in table 9 2 for the second round of adjustment a new degree diagnosis was obtained table 10 table 10 reveals that pair 4 had a value lower than η min δ a j a k after the first round of adjustment so it did not pass the degree diagnosis and a second round of adjustment was required after a second round the adjusted value of fdr in zhenjiang was found to be v 2 v 3 η min δ a 2 a 3 20 03 so its fdr increased by δ v v 2 v 2 0 2 at that point only pair 4 was not harmonious but the increased fdr in zhenjiang needed to be subtracted from that of wuxi therefore the fdr in wuxi was v 3 v 3 0 2 28 10 the final results of the second round of adjustment are shown in table 11 the new degree diagnosis indicated that the second round of adjustments resulted in an fdr allocation plan that can be approved table 12 from this we concluded that harmony had been achieved for this fdr allocation plan 3 3 3 harmonious allocation plan after the harmony diagnosis and two rounds of adjustments to the pre allocation plan a harmonious fdr allocation plan was obtained fig 5 is a presentation of the pre and post adjustment fdrs for the four cities in the jiangsu section of the sunan canal the changes were notable especially for suzhou and wuxi in the fdr pre allocation plan suzhou had the largest proportion of fdr reaching 32 81 while zhenjiang had the smallest one at only 19 83 as such the fdr of suzhou was 12 99 higher than that of zhenjiang while wuxi and changzhou ranked second and third respectively the fdr of suzhou was 8 13 higher than that of wuxi and 10 12 higher than that of changzhou after the harmonious adjustment the fdr values of suzhou wuxi changzhou and zhenjiang were 29 18 28 10 22 69 and 20 03 respectively by comparing the pre allocation plan with the plan after harmonious diagnosis we found that the fdr in suzhou decreased by 3 63 so it was 8 88 6 49 and 1 08 higher than in zhenjiang changzhou and wuxi respectively as such the fdr gap between regions was greatly narrowed while the proportion of fdr allocation in suzhou decreased it remained the highest of the four regions 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of the harmonious allocation plan the final allocation of fdr recommended by our analysis demonstrates the existence of a large gap in fdr between regions suppose the respective proportions of fdr allocation in suzhou and wuxi are too large in that case this will lead to insufficient values of fdr in other regions thus aggravating flood disaster losses and causing dissatisfaction in other regions and flood discharge conflicts therefore it is necessary to adjust the fdr of suzhou wuxi and zhenjiang without affecting their flood drainage benefits the results of the allocation plan can be explored based on the principles that guided the development of our method suzhou s results reflect its economic importance e g 1 from the perspective of fairness suzhou has the largest land area the proportion of watershed s area in the region to total watershed s area embankment length and built up area the plan reflected these indicators which reflect suzhou s need for more fdr than the other regions 2 from the efficiency perspective suzhou has the largest per capita gdp per capita income and urbanization rate but the lowest engel coefficient these four indicators represent the efficiency in the use of fdr since they favor more developed regional economies such areas have higher flood drainage efficiency justifying the use of more fdr 3 in terms of flood resilience suzhou has a strong ability to cope with floods thus while the fdr of suzhou was reduced by the harmony adjustments it can still meet the flood drainage demands of suzhou and promote the cooperation and safety of the entire basin zhenjiang s fdr increased from 19 83 to 20 03 during the adjustment with an increase of just 0 2 keeping it in its spot as the lowest among the studied cities the reasons for the small proportion of zhenjiang s fdr allocation are as follows 1 from the perspective of fairness zhenjiang has a small land area and a small population and the sunan canal only flows through a small part of this city thus it requires less fdr 2 from the perspective of efficiency zhenjiang s per capita gdp and per capita income are also the lowest of the region which means that zhenjiang s economy is relatively undeveloped and its flood discharge efficiency is very low 3 on the other hand the historical context reveals that zhenjiang has had the largest number of people affected by floods over the years which means that it is the most affected by floods and needs more fdr overall however zhenjiang s small size and infrastructure keep it at the low end of the fdr distribution the fdr in wuxi was reduced by 0 2 during the harmonious adjustment which increased the proportion of fdr in zhenjiang while not affecting the flood drainage benefit of wuxi however the fdr in changzhou remained unchanged at 22 69 4 2 comparison of harmonious allocation results based on different allocation principles the principles that underlie an allocation method are of great importance as they dramatically alter the results of fdr allocation the results of comparing our method s output with other combinations of principles are shown in fig 6 all of the allocation plans yielded the same order of fdr from the largest to smallest suzhou wuxi changzhou and zhenjiang this shows that the allocation results in this paper are in line with the actual development despite this common pattern the specific allocation results were different in important ways for example scenario 2 resulted in extensive gaps in fdr allocation between cities its fdr recommendation of suzhou was 45 37 while zhenjiang would receive less than a third of that only 14 30 such a scenario ignores the history of flood damage in zhenjiang and emphasizes size and wealth this would be likely to cause dissatisfaction and a lack of cooperation among regions the addition of the principle of efficiency in scenario 3 caused minor changes to its outcome but the basic situation is similar to scenario 2 the gap between regions in scenario 4 was narrowed after considering the factor of sustainable development which drove down the fdr in suzhou and increased that in zhenjiang scenario 1 produced the smallest gaps in fdr among the regions taking into account the floods resilience strategy and the respect for the regions history by comparing the four allocation plans we can see that the consideration of only one allocation principle will lead to a large gap in the proportion of fdr among regions in this way it is difficult to achieve the fairness and rationality of the fdr allocation results with the consideration of various allocation principles the gaps between regions in the allocation plan gradually narrows therefore our allocation plan based on the five distribution principles can better reflect the development status and the actual interests of each region a well balanced allocation plan is easier for all parties to accept and implement in each region thereby promoting a coordinated development across the regions in order to reduce flood disaster losses and alleviate the current situation of flood drainage conflicts between regions governments should actively implement fdr allocation systems that weigh the needs strengths and interests of its regions such a plan should be able to reduce the overall flood disaster losses and promote the sustainable development of the watershed we hope that this paper encourages governments and agencies to explore the approach demonstrated here and that it serves as a reference 5 conclusions the aim of this paper was to contribute towards solving the problem of flood drainage conflicts caused by the competition for fdr between regions during flood disasters which further aggravates flood disaster losses based on the five principles of fairness high efficiency sustainable development respect for historical context and flood resilience strategy an initial allocation harmony diagnosis approach to developing watershed fdr allocation plans was established our case study of the jiangsu section of the sunan canal in china led to the following conclusions 1 our model identified excessive gaps between certain regions in the fdr pre allocation plan as it failed to pass the harmony diagnosis this plan would be unappealing to some regions and warranted adjustment to ensure harmony 2 two rounds of harmonious adjustments were made to the pre allocation plan which successfully yielded a more harmonious fdr allocation plan the fdr gaps among regions were greatly reduced moreover while it did not affect the interests of various regions this plan is capable of promoting the harmonious development of the entire basin to be easily accepted by all regions and improving the practicality of the fdr allocation plan 3 the allocation results based on the five principles indicator system established in this paper were more harmonious and should be more easily accepted by regions less favored by simpler approaches in particular historical context and flood resilience is often ignored when allocating fdr but our results show that these principles should be considered as they improve allocation outcomes given limitations imposed by available data and current research based conceptual models we acknowledge that there may be other allocation principles and allocation indicators that could have an important impact on the allocation of fdr this paper focuses on the five principles of fairness efficiency sustainable development respect for historical context and flood resilience strategy in follow up research one could explore enriching the fdr allocation index system by enhancing the fdr allocation plan credit authorship contribution statement kaize zhang methodology software writing original draft juqin shen data curation

4298,groundwater solute transport models are critical for simulating subsurface contaminant processes guiding policy making for groundwater management and pollution remediation in this study we develop an improved groundwater solute transport model which uses arbitrary shaped polygons for spatial discretization this allows for the efficient simulation of solutes in complex boundary aquifer systems the governing equation is discretized in space using the finite volume method to ensure flux conservation both locally and globally the dispersion term is discretized by the multipoint flux approximation mpfa method which is a finite volume method that is suitable on arbitrary polygon grids a total variation diminishing tvd scheme is used to control numerical oscillation in the advection term the functionality and performance of the new model are demonstrated by comparing the simulated results between our model and mt3dms model in five case studies the comparisons show that the new model can well represent the solute transport processes in a real world watershed with complex shaped boundaries the new model outperforms the conventional groundwater solute transport model with smaller computed root mean square errors these modeling results suggest that our model can provide robust modeling solutions for simulating groundwater solute transport processes especially in aquifer systems with complex shaped boundaries furthermore our model can provide a more flexible discretization solution for coupling surface water models and groundwater solute transport models keywords groundwater solute transport model arbitrary polygon grids multipoint flux approximation advection dispersion equation mt3dms 1 introduction groundwater pollution is a global problem threatening human health and destroying the ecological environment ray and elango 2019 guo et al 2020 li et al 2020 the groundwater solute transport model can predict the process of contaminant migration and play an important role in groundwater contamination control and remediation zhu et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 developing computational tractable robust groundwater solute transport models is essential for understanding the contaminant transport processes to date various numerical groundwater solute transport models have been developed to simulate the contaminant transport process in groundwater such as mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 mike she ma et al 2016 3dfemwater lin et al 1997 feflow trefry and muffels 2010 and modflow usg panday 2017 the current groundwater solute transport models typically apply numerical methods for solving the transport governing equation the finite difference method fdm and finite element method fem and finite volume method fvm are among the most widely used numerical methods zhu et al 2012 fdm is not flexible for complex boundary geometries and may lose accuracy when predicting solute concentration in the vicinity of irregular boundaries spitz et al 2001 mehl and hill 2004 gao et al 2019 fem is mass imbalance locally di giammarco et al 1996 and is not applied to arbitrary polygon grids though fem has better flexibility for representing complex boundaries than fdm fvm is one of the best algorithms in the sense of easily fitting to irregular geometric boundaries while preserving well the mass balance erduran et al 2005 loudyi et al 2007 zhu et al 2012 groundwater solute transport models usually have complex boundaries especially in the study of watersheds thus it is vital to develop a groundwater numerical solute transport model that has a flexible mesh division in this study a groundwater solute transport model on arbitrary polygon grid cells is established using the multipoint flux approximations mpfa method which is based on the fvm mpfa was first used in reservoir simulations in the petroleum industry aavatsmark et al 1996 aavatsmark 2002 this method is locally conservative and can handle general irregular grids in anisotropic heterogeneous domains since the mpfa method was proposed a series of studies have been conducted on this method non orthogonal grids are common in reservoir simulations traditional reservoir simulators with mpfa method are designed to give a correct discretization of the flow equations for general nonorthogonal grids as well as for general orientation of the principal directions of the permeability tensor aavatsmark 2002 the mpfa method can be applied on triangular grids younes et al 2013 2014 quadrilateral grids aavatsmark et al 1996 1998a 1998b 2006 edwards and rogers 1998 aavatsmark 2002 and unstructured grids avaatsmark et al 1996 verma and aziz 1996 aavatsmark et al 1998a 1998b edwards 2002 the non linear mpfa scheme has been proved to be second order accurate droniou and potier 2011 generalizations to grids with faults and local refinements are discussed in the literature edwards 1996 aavatsmark et al 2001a 2001b convergence of mpfa method has been investigated numerically klausen and russell 2004 aavatsmark et al 2007 klausen et al 2008 monotonicity of mpfa formulation has been analyzed sheng and yuan 2012 younes et al 2013 and the accuracy of mpfa has been proved aavatsmark et al 2007 in addition mpfa was coupled with the mixed finite element method to develop the multipoint flux mixed finite element method mfmfe which is a new spatial approximation method wheeler and yotov 2006 wheeler et al 2012 chen et al 2020 he et al 2021 because of the advantages of mpfa the method has become the kernel program of the automatic differentiation general purpose research simulator ad gprs developed at stanford which is a powerful and flexible platform in reservoir models with fully unstructured grids zhou 2012 wong et al 2019 jin et al 2020 since the nature of reservoir simulation and groundwater flow simulation is fluid migration in geological media researchers have applied mpfa to groundwater flow simulation in recent years klausen et al 2008 younes et al 2013 dotlic et al 2018 younes and ackerer 2008 have used mpfa to simulate groundwater solute migration however their work has two limitations firstly the solute model is two dimensional secondly the model is used in triangular grids but no unstructured arbitrary polygon grids in general the studies of mpfa application to groundwater solute migration are rarely reported and further research is needed in this paper we construct an improved numerical scheme for solving the governing equation of groundwater solute transport using the cell centered mpfa method the scheme has only cell centered unknowns and can simulate groundwater solute transport calculations with arbitrary polygon grid cells the new model based on this scheme is verified in five case studies by comparing with concentrations calculated by mt3dms which is widely used software 2 governing equation the solute transport is described by the advection dispersion equation ade ignoring chemical reactions ade can be represented by 1 θ c t d c q c c s where θ is the effective porosity c is the concentration of a component species q is the darcy flux cs is the source sink term and d is dispersion tensor which can be represented by 2 d d xx d xy d xz d yx d yy d yz d zx d zy d zz where x y and z are spatial directions in this paper x and y direction are horizontal direction and z direction is the vertical direction the dispersion d in eq 2 is symmetric positive definite the method of calculating d is provided by burnett and frind 1987 which is also used in mt3dms according to burnett and frind 1987 the components of dispersion tensor can be calculated by 3 d xx α l v x 2 v α th v y 2 v α tv v z 2 v d d yy α l v y 2 v α th v x 2 v α tv v z 2 v d d zz α l v z 2 v α th v x 2

vertical transverse dispersivity d is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient and vx vy vz are the components of the pore water seepage velocity vector along the x y and z axes which can be calculated by darcy flux through the relationship 4 v x q x θ v y q y θ v z q z θ 3 methods this section presents the numerical scheme for the governing equation of solute transport in groundwater on arbitrary polygon grids section 3 1 introduces the flux expression derivation for dispersion and advection on arbitrary polygonal grids needed in the numerical scheme section 3 2 introduces the numerical scheme for the governing equation 3 1 flux expressions 3 1 1 dispersive flux expressions the key to calculating the dispersive flux expressions on arbitrary polygonal grids is to obtain the concentration gradient using fully 3d mpfa to calculate the concentration gradient is more complicated than 2d mpfa in addition it is challenging to build fully 3d mpfa on arbitrary polygon grids the aquifer is generally stratified in most cases the boundary of the aquifer in the horizontal direction is more complex than that in the vertical direction thus the horizontal gradient is calculated using 2d mpfa which is suitable for complex boundaries and the vertical gradient is calculated using the traditional two point method which is suitable for simple boundaries in this paper in the traditional model with regular shaped grids as shown in fig 1 a the concentration gradient is expressed by a two point flux stencil the vertical component of concentration gradient is expressed as 5 c v 12 c 1 c 2 z 1 z 2 where c v 12 is the vertical component of the concentration gradient between cells 1 and 2 c 1 and c 2 are the concentrations of specie at the cell centers of the adjacent cells 1 and 2 z 1 and z 2 are the cell centered coordinate values of the adjacent cells 1 and 2 in the z direction in this paper the horizontal concentration gradient components are approximated by a multipoint flux expression called mpfa which is suitable for arbitrary polygon grid cells the number of cell concentrations in the gradient expression is dependent on the grids in mpfa the expression includes the six cells shown in the mpfa example of fig 1b a notation introduced sheng and yuan 2012 is used to simplify the equations as fig 2 shown o1 o n are the cell centers t1 t n are the midpoints of cell edge and ap1 ap n are the edges through vertex a n is the number of cells around vertex a let c 1 c n c 1 c n be the cell centered unknowns cell edge unknowns at point o1 o n t1 t n let x 1 x n x 1 x n be the cell centered coordinate values cell edge coordinate values at point o1 o n t1 t n in this method a subcell is divided by the vertex a the center o k and the midpoint edges t k and t k 1 as shown fig 2b the concentration gradient of subcell a t k 1 o k t k in cell k can be expressed as follows sheng and yuan 2012 6 c h k 1 2 w k r x k 1 x k c k c k r x k x k c k 1 c k where w k is the area of the shaded part in fig 2b and r is the rotation matrix which is expressed as follows 7 r 0 1 1 0 the unknown variables in eq 6 include the concentration of grid center ck and the concentrations of edge c k c k 1 the concentrations on the edges need to be expressed by the concentration at the grid center based on flux conservation the flux through half edge at k and at k 1 f k 1 and f k 2 can be expressed as 8 f k 1 1 2 c h k d h n k 1 1 4 w k r x k 1 x k d h n k 1 c k c k r x k x k d h n k 1 c k 1 c k a 11 c k c k a 12 c k 1 c k 9 f k 2 1 2 c h k d h n k 2 1 4 w k r x k 1 x k d h n k 2 c k c k r x k 1 x k d h n k 2 c k c k a 21 c k c k a 22 c k 1 c k where n k 1 is the outer normal vector of edge at k and its magnitude is equal to the length of at k a 11 a 12 a 21 and a 22 are represented as 10 a 11 1 4 w k r x k 1 x k d h n k 1 a 12 1 4 w k r x k x k d h n k 1 a 21 1 4 w k r x k 1 x k d h n k 2 a 22 1 4 w k r x k x k d h n k 2 using the conservation of normal flux on at k 11 f k 1 f k 1 2 0 substituting eqs 8 and 9 into eq 11 we obtain 12 a 11 k c k c k a 12 k c k 1 c k a 21 k 1 c k c k a 22 k 1 c k 1 c k 0 eq 12 can be applied to all edges that pass vertex a so there is a total of n conservation equations these n conservation equations can be written in the following matrix form 13 m c u c where c c 1 c n t c c 1 c n t m m ij n n and u u ij n n the non zero elements in m and u are given as follows 14 m k k a 11 k a 22 k 1 m k k 1 a 12 k m k k 1 a 21 k 1 u k k a 11 k a 12 k u k k 1 a 21 k 1 a 22 k 1 then the concentration on the half edges can be represented by that at the center of the cell as follows 15 c m 1 u c the matrix m is assembled according to eq 14 the matrix m consists of n row vectors the k 1 th kth and k 1 th elements are a 21 k 1 a 11 k a 22 k 1 and a 12 k and the elements in other positions are all 0 in the kth row vector the non zero elements of m are calculated using eq 10 which are determined by the grid distribution if the matrix m is not invertible the grids at the corresponding positions will be adjusted to ensure that m is invertible substituting eq 15 into eq 6 the concentration gradient in the horizontal direction can be expressed 16 c h k 1 2 w k r x k 1 x k m 1 u c k c k r x k x k m 1 u c k 1 c k where m 1 u c is a column matrix m 1 u c k is the kth element in m 1 u c the concentration gradient in three directions can be obtained by eqs 5 and 16 17 c c h c v a control volume scheme for governing equation involves computing the dispersive flux fdi through a surface si with respect to the control volume referring to contreras et al 2019 the dispersive flux fdi is expressed as 18 f d i s i d c n d s s i c d n d s where si is one of the control volume surfaces and n is the normal vector of the surface si 3 1 2 advective flux expressions a control volume scheme for eq 1 involves computing the advective flux the term cnm the inter cell concentration between cells n and m fig 3 should be obtained in the process of calculating the advective flux according to panday 2017 a tvd expansion of this term is provided as 19 c mn c nm ups σ r nm 2 c nm dwn c nm ups where c nm ups is the concentration of the upstream grid block between cells n and m c nm dwn is the concentration of the downstream grid block between cells n and m σ r nm is the flux limiter and rnm is the smoothness sensor a flux limiter is given by van leer as forsyth et al 1998 20 σ r nm 0 if r nm 0 2 r nm 1 r nm if r nm 0 where the smoothness sensor rnm is defined as 21 r nm c nm ups c nm 2 u p l nm ups l nm 2 u p l n l m c nm dwn c nm ups where 2up is the second point upstream cell the upstream cell to grid block ups c nm 2 u p the concentration of cell 2up l n l m is the perpendicular distance between cells n and m and l nm ups l nm 2 u p is the perpendicular distance between cells ups and 2up the upstream cell to cell n is selected as the connecting cell with the highest inflow to node n similarly the second cell upstream cell is selected as the connecting cell with the highest inflow to cell ups an illustration of determination of the second upstream cell is shown in fig 3 the advective flux between cell m and n can be expressed as 22 f a i q mn c mn where f a i is advective flux one through the control volume edge i which is between cell m and n qmn is the hydraulic flux between cells n and m 3 2 numerical scheme for governing equation in this study a control volume scheme for eq 1 in the cell k can be expressed as 23 e k θ k d c k dt i 1 m f a i i 1 m f d i e k c s where ek is the volume of cell k m is the surface number of cell k a fully implicit scheme of eq 23 is used for time discretization 24 e k θ k c k n δ t i 1 m f a i n δ t i 1 m f d i n δ t e k c s e k θ k c k n 1 where δt is the time step and n is the time level substituting the dispersive flux eq 18 and advective flux eq 22 into the numerical scheme eq 24 the final numerical scheme which only contains one unknown variable concentration of cell center is formed concentration at the cell center can be solved with a numerical model based on this numerical scheme 4 case studies to assess the performance of the proposed groundwater solute transport model we apply the model to five case studies including four synthetic aquifer systems and one real world aquifer system first the model is applied to four synthetic cases including a one dimensional case section 4 1 a two dimensional case section 4 2 a three dimensional case section 4 3 and a two dimensional case in an aquifer with an anisotropic permeability tensor section 4 4 respectively then to evaluate the performance of the new model in the real world aquifer it is applied to the maozhou river basin in shenzhen china which has complex boundaries section 4 5 the simulated results of the proposed model are compared with the baseline model mt3dms for the five case studies 4 1 case study 1 one dimensional advection and dispersion the performance of our model is first demonstrated in a one dimensional field with a domain size of 200 m x 2 m y and 2 m z the domain is discretized into 100 columns using girds with a size of 2 2 2 m the darcy flux is 3 m d in this case the initial concentration of water in the domain is 0 mg l a prescribed concentration of 2 mg l is set at the upstream end of the domain for the duration of the simulation the transport parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d and the effective porosity θ are 5 m 0 m2 d and 0 2 respectively two transport models for the case study site are built using our proposed model and mt3dms respectively first order upwind fou and third order tvd scheme for advection term are used to simulated the transport process in the mt3dms model the solute transport with advection is first calculated transport simulation is performed for 10 days using 100 time steps with a fixed size of 0 1 day fig 4 shows the simulation results at 1 days 3 days 5 days and 7 days as can be seen from fig 4 the numerical dispersion of our model is greater than that of tvd scheme and samaller than that of fou scheme in mt3dms in general the concentration results of our model are consistent with those of mt3dms in addition the solute transport process with advection and dispersion is calculated the simulation is also performed for 10 days with fixed time step size of 0 1 days the simulated results by two models at 1 days 2 days 3 days 4 days and 5 days are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that concentrations simulated by our model are in excellent agreement with those simulated using mt3dms comparing fig 4 and fig 5 it can be seen that the numerical dispersion in the case of both advection and dispersion is smaller than that in the case of advection only at the same time such as at 1 days 3 days and 5 days 4 2 case study 2 two dimensional advection and dispersion this case is an aquifer with a domain size of 150 m length 100 m width and 5 m depth shown in fig 6 the components of the darcy flux along the x and y axes qx and qy are 1 and 0 m d in this case the initial concentration of water in the domain is 0 mg l a constant concentration of 5 mg l is set from y 40 to y 60 at the upstream end of the domain fig 6 the other boundaries are set as no flux the transport parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl the horizontal transverse dispersivity αth the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d and the effective porosity θ are 5 m 1 m 0 m2 d and 0 2 respectively in this case three transport models for the case study site are built the first model is built using our proposed model with arbitrary polygons to discretize the domain fig 6a the second model is built using our proposed model with a regular grid fig 6b the third model is set as the baseline model built using mt3dms with a regular grid which is the same as the grid of the second model fig 6b in mt3dms model first order upwind fou and third order tvd scheme are used for advection term to solve this case the number of arbitrary polygon cells in the first model is 3750 the number of polygon sides ranges from 3 to 11 the number of cells in the second and third models with a regular grid is also 3750 fig 6b each cell in the regular grids is 2 m 2 m in the horizontal direction table 1 summarizes the key parameters in the model grids we ran the three models for 10 days with a time step size of 0 1 day the concentration results simulated by three models at 8 days are shown in fig 7 the concentration contours of the proposed models the first and second models accord well with those from mt3dms the third model the shapes of the solute plumes simulated with the three models are almost the same indicating the proposed model has good accuracy fig 8 shows the comparison of concentration results simulated by the proposed model and mt3dms along a line at y 50 m at 2 days 4 days 6 days and 8 days the concentrations simulated by the proposed model and mt3dms are in general consistent with each other at the different times 4 3 case study 3 three dimensional advection and dispersion this case is an aquifer with a domain size of 150 m length 100 m width and 15 m depth the components of the darcy flux along the x y and z axes qx qy and qz are 0 6 0 and 0 05 m d respectively the sides 100 m of the aquifer x 0 m and x 150 m have a constant concentration of 0 mg l the other boundaries are set as no flux a solute source with a rate of 200 mg d is imposed at point 39 51 0 the initial concentration of water in the domain is 0 mg l the transport parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl the horizontal transverse dispersivity αth the vertical transverse dispersivity the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d and the effective porosity θ are 5 m 1 5 m 1 m 0 m2 d and 0 2 respectively the aquifer is discretized into 5 layers with z 3 m in the vertical direction in each layer two grid division systems an irregular grid fig 6a and a regular grid fig 6b are used for spatial discrete respectively in this case the irregular grid and the regular grid are the same as those of case 2 three transport models for the case study site are built like case 2 the first model is built using our proposed model with an irregular grid the second model is built using our proposed model with a regular grid the third model is set as the baseline model built using mt3dms with a regular grid which is the same as the grid of the second model in the mt3dms model first order upwind fou and third order tvd scheme are used for advection term to simulate this case the three models are run for 30 days with a fixed time step size of 0 2 day fig 9 shows the comparison of concentrations results on the plane z 1 5 m simulated by the three models at 20 days the concentration contours of the proposed models are in general in good agreement with those of mt3dms as shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows a comparison of simulated concentration results at a profile of y 51 m using the three models at 20 days although there is a deviation of concentrations between the proposed model and mt3dms the shapes of the solute plume are similar in order to compare the concentration results more clearly concentration distributions of lines on the plane z 1 5 m and the profile y 51 m are shown in figs 11 and 12 fig 11 shows a comparison of simulated concentrations at the line y 51 m z 1 5 m of the plane z 1 5 m using the three models at 20 days fig 12 shows a comparison of simulated concentrations at the line x 39 m y 51 m of the profile y 51 m using the three models at 20 days as shown in figs 11 and 12 the calculation results of the three models are generally consistent concentrations calculated by the second and third models with the same grids have a better consistency the deviation of simulated results between the proposed model with irregular grids the first model and mt3dms the third model is higher than that between the proposed model with regular grids the second model and mt3dms the third model which indicates different grids can cause some differences in calculation results the biggest difference between the proposed model with irregular grids and other models with regular grids is at point 39 51 1 5 m where solute source located which indicates source sink will increase the influence of girds in general the comparison results indicate the proposed model is suitable for the simulation of three dimensional advection and dispersion in order to analyze the influence of the grid distribution on the calculation results the perturbed quadrilateral grids with different degrees of distortion should be constructed according to luo et al 2017 node coordinates of perturbed grids are defined as 25 x ij 2 i β 2 r x 1 y ij 2 j β 2 r y 1 where i and j represent the number of node i is from 1 to 74 j is from 1 to 49 β is the degree of distortion with values located in 0 1 rx and ry are two normalized random variables with values located in 0 1 the perturbed quadrilateral grids with different degree of distortion β 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 are constructed as shown in fig 13 fig 13 shows that as β increases the distortion of the grids becomes larger four solute transport models are built using the proposed model on the perturbed quadrilateral grids with different degree of distortion the minimum and maximum concentrations cmin and cmax of all solute transport models at 20 days including these four models and the previous three models are given in table 2 as table 2 shown all the values of cmin and cmax are consistent the values of cmin are very close to 0 the cmax varies as β varies which indicates the grids can affect the calculating results 4 4 case study 4 advection and dispersion in an anisotropic aquifer this test problem discusses advective dispersive transport in an anisotropic aquifer with a domain size of 150 m length 100 m width and 5 m depth which is the same size as case 2 the bottom of the aquifer is a horizontal datum there is water leaking into the aquifer with a rate of 10 m3 d at x 39 m y 51 m the sides x 0 m and x 150 m have constant heads of 20 m and 5 m respectively the other boundaries are set as no flow the permeability of this aquifer is anisotropic the principal directions of the anisotropic permeability tensor are aligned with coordinate axes x axis and y axis the components of the permeability coefficient in principal directions kx and ky are 1 and 0 2 m d respectively the steady state groundwater flow can be calculated based on the above conditions the initial concentration of water in the domain is 0 mg l because the leaking water contains solute a solute source with a rate of 30 g d is imposed at point 39 51 m all boundaries are set as no flux the transport parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl the horizontal transverse dispersivity αth the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d and the effective porosity θ are 5 m 1 m 0 m2 d and 0 2 respectively in this case the aquifer is divided by two types of grids as in case 2 three transport models for the case study site are built like case 2 proposed model with an irregular grid proposed model with a regular grid and mt3dms with a regular grid in the mt3dms model fou and tvd scheme are used to solve this problem the irregular grid and the regular grid of this case are the same as those of case 2 the groundwater flow needs to be simulated first the groundwater tables are calculated by our groundwater flow model and moflow in this case our flow model is established by mpfa which can use arbitrary polygon grids to simulate groundwater flow problems just like the proposed solute transport model in this paper modflow is widely used in groundwater flow simulation which can be linked to mt3dms three groundwater flow models are established our flow model with an irregular grid our flow model with a regular grid and modflow with a regular grid which corresponds to three solute transport models the grids of groundwater flow models are the same as those of solute transport models the steady state groundwater flow fields are calculated using three flow models groundwater velocities in solute transport models are derived from the calculation results of the corresponding water flow models fig 14 shows the groundwater table distribution calculated using three flow models the distributions of groundwater tables in anisotropic aquifer calculated by different models are generally consistent the three solute transport models are run for 60 days with a fixed time step size of 0 2 day fig 15 shows the comparison of concentrations distribution simulated by the three models at 50 days the concentration contours of the proposed models the first and second models accord well with those from mt3dms the third model the solute plume shapes calculated by models using regular grids have a better consistency which also indicates grids can affect calculate results fig 16 shows the comparison of concentration results simulated by the proposed model and mt3dms along a line at y 51 m at 50 days the concentrations simulated by the proposed model and mt3dms are consistent with each other at 50 days in general the comparison of simulated results indicates that the proposed model is suitable for simulating advection and dispersion in the anisotropic aquifer 4 5 case study 5 advection and dispersion in a real world watershed finally we demonstrate our model performance in a case study site with real world geometries the maozhou river basin this basin is in the northwest of shenzhen guangdong province china the study area is 359 8 km2 the thickness of the aquifer is 30 m constant concentration boundary conditions are specified with 0 mg l in the western boundary of the basin the other boundaries are set as no flux a sketch of the model domain is shown in fig 17 in order to facilitate comparison we simplify the groundwater flow field and source and sink terms of the case model we assume that the velocity of the flow field is constant the components of the darcy flux qx and qy are 0 8 and 0 2 m d in this case as for the source and sink items only the area source is kept the solute area sources are distributed as shown in fig 18 the initial concentration is 0 mg l in this case the transport parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl the horizontal transverse dispersivity αth the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d and the effective porosity θ are 50 m 15 m 0 m2 d and 0 2 respectively three transport models are established with the proposed model and mt3dms the first model is established using the proposed with an irregular grid with polygonal cells a total of 263 polygonal cells shown in fig 17a the irregular grid corresponds with sub basins of the watershed as defined for the surface water model swat the number of polygon cell sides ranges from 3 to 10 the second model is established using mt3dms with 289 square grid cells in each layer shown in fig 17b the number of grid cells in the second model is similar to that in the first model to reduce the impact of the number of cells in the comparison process table 3 summarizes the key grid parameters of the first and second models the third model is as a reference model established using mt3dms with fine discretization which has 5374 cells in the mt3dms model the tvd scheme is chosen for the advection term the results of the third model are assumed to be the most accurate transport simulations with the three models were performed for 200 days with a time step size of 1 days fig 19 shows the comparison of concentration contours simulated by the three models at 100 days and 200 days the concentrations simulated by the proposed model are consistent with those simulated by mt3dms although the numbers of grid cells in the proposed model the first model and mt3dms the second model are less than the number of grids in the reference model the third model the concentration distributions calculated by the first model and second model are similar to the results calculated by the reference model the concentrations are higher in the north and south and lower in the middle which is consistent with the distribution of the area source rate fig 20 shows the comparison between concentrations of the reference model and those simulated by the proposed model and mt3dms at 50 days 100 days and 200 days the ordinate of a circle point represents the concentration simulated using the proposed model in the center of each polygonal mesh while the abscissa of the point is the concentration of the reference model in the corresponding position in fig 20 a b and c the ordinate of a star point is the concentration simulated using mt3dms in the center of a regular square grid while the abscissa of the point is the value of the reference model in the corresponding position in fig 20 d e and f as shown in fig 20 concentrations of the proposed model in each irregular grid and mt3dms in each regular grid are compared with concentrations of the reference model in the corresponding position most of the circle points are near the diagonal in fig 20 a b and c which indicates that the proposed model is accurate some star points are located at the abscissa axis in fig 20 d e and f because the grids represented by these points are on the constant head boundary in the mt3dms it can be seen that the circle points do not deviate as much as the star points in fig 20 a b and c thus the proposed model has a better performance than mt3dms in boundaries the mean errors me of concentrations between the proposed model and reference model are 9 42 10 5 mg l 2 15 10 5 mg l and 3 15 10 4 mg l and the root mean square errors rmse are 1 13 10 3 m 3 77 10 3 mg l and 1 28 10 2 mg l at 50 days 100 days and 200 days respectively the mes of mt3dms are 8 23 10 4 mg l 3 77 10 3 mg l and 4 68 10 3 mg l and rmses are 4 45 10 3 mg l 0 10 mg l and 2 81 10 2 mg l at 50 days 100 days and 200 days respectively all the absolute values of mes and rmses of the proposed model are smaller than those of mt3dms at the same time which indicates the proposed model is more accurate than mt3dms in this case this case comparison verifies that our model can be applied to the real word transport simulation 5 discussion in this study we built a groundwater solute transport model using the mpfa method with arbitrary polygon grids currently modflow usg can also use arbitrary polygon grids to simulate the solute transport process panday 2017 in modflow usg the edge flux is calculated only using two points of two adjacent cells shown in fig 1a while the edge flux is determined by multiple points in mpfa shown in fig 1b during the calculation of mpfa the gradient of a cell is divided into several subcells whose number is equal to that of grid vertexes while the gradient of a grid cell is not divided in the traditional model the concentration gradient of each subcell is determined by multiple cell concentrations in this method an edge flux is divided into two half edges to calculate using different concentration gradients which is equivalent to the refined grid thus the new model makes better use of grid information than the traditional method fig 21 takes a triangular grid as an example of the new method the concentration gradient of the triangular grid is divided into three subcells for calculation the edges of the cell ab ac and bc are divided into 6 half edges by edge midpoints e f and g in some traditional surface water groundwater flow models bailey et al 2017 and solute models cho et al 2010 ehtiat et al 2018 the groundwater models and surface water models are modeled independently in this kind of coupled model the subdivision units of the surface water model are irregular polygons while those of the groundwater grid are trigonal or quadrilateral polygons that cannot match the surface water grids the grid differences between the surface water model and the groundwater model increase modeling workload and application difficulty in the basin case the irregular grids are derived from sub basins of the swat surface water model and can match sub basins the flexibility of the discretization method embedded in our model makes it possible for a fully coupling calculation of surface water groundwater solute transport with sub basin as the numerical grid in a watershed thus our model has the potential to be applied to solute transport in groundwater surface water coupling systems the performance of the new model is demonstrated by comparing our model and mt3dms in five case studies the concentrations simulated by the proposed model are consistent with those simulated by mt3dms in all cases the comparison results show that our model can well represent solute transport processes thus the proposed model can be applied to simulate groundwater solute transport with arbitrary polygon grids 6 conclusions in this study we establish the finite volume scheme for the governing equation of solute transport in groundwater on arbitrary polygon grids which is flux conservative both locally and globally the dispersion term is discretized by the multipoint flux approximation mpfa method which is a finite volume method a total variation diminishing tvd scheme is used to control numerical oscillation in the advection term then we develop an improved numerical groundwater solute transport model based on the scheme which can use arbitrary shaped polygon grids to discretize aquifer systems the validity and performance of the new model are demonstrated with five study cases which include four synthetic cases a one dimensional case a two dimensional case a three dimensional case and a two dimensional case in an anisotropic aquifer and a real world case solutions calculated using the proposed model in all five cases have good agreement with those simulated by mt3dms in the case of an actual watershed the new model has smaller computed root mean square errors and has better performance in the boundaries than the traditional model when the grid number of our model is similar to that of the traditional model the comparison of the proposed model results and mt3dms results shows that our model can be successfully applied to groundwater solute transport simulation in the actual watershed case the irregular grid corresponds with the sub basins of the watershed as delineated in the surface water model of the watershed based on swat this model makes it possible for a fully coupled calculation of surface water groundwater solute transport processes with sub basins as grids in a watershed in the future the model could be improved by optimizing the solution algorithm with the use of parallel computing in addition to better contribute to the solute transport modeling community the model will be distributed as open source software in the future credit authorship contribution statement yulong gao conceptualization methodology writing original

4298,groundwater solute transport models are critical for simulating subsurface contaminant processes guiding policy making for groundwater management and pollution remediation in this study we develop an improved groundwater solute transport model which uses arbitrary shaped polygons for spatial discretization this allows for the efficient simulation of solutes in complex boundary aquifer systems the governing equation is discretized in space using the finite volume method to ensure flux conservation both locally and globally the dispersion term is discretized by the multipoint flux approximation mpfa method which is a finite volume method that is suitable on arbitrary polygon grids a total variation diminishing tvd scheme is used to control numerical oscillation in the advection term the functionality and performance of the new model are demonstrated by comparing the simulated results between our model and mt3dms model in five case studies the comparisons show that the new model can well represent the solute transport processes in a real world watershed with complex shaped boundaries the new model outperforms the conventional groundwater solute transport model with smaller computed root mean square errors these modeling results suggest that our model can provide robust modeling solutions for simulating groundwater solute transport processes especially in aquifer systems with complex shaped boundaries furthermore our model can provide a more flexible discretization solution for coupling surface water models and groundwater solute transport models keywords groundwater solute transport model arbitrary polygon grids multipoint flux approximation advection dispersion equation mt3dms 1 introduction groundwater pollution is a global problem threatening human health and destroying the ecological environment ray and elango 2019 guo et al 2020 li et al 2020 the groundwater solute transport model can predict the process of contaminant migration and play an important role in groundwater contamination control and remediation zhu et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 developing computational tractable robust groundwater solute transport models is essential for understanding the contaminant transport processes to date various numerical groundwater solute transport models have been developed to simulate the contaminant transport process in groundwater such as mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 mike she ma et al 2016 3dfemwater lin et al 1997 feflow trefry and muffels 2010 and modflow usg panday 2017 the current groundwater solute transport models typically apply numerical methods for solving the transport governing equation the finite difference method fdm and finite element method fem and finite volume method fvm are among the most widely used numerical methods zhu et al 2012 fdm is not flexible for complex boundary geometries and may lose accuracy when predicting solute concentration in the vicinity of irregular boundaries spitz et al 2001 mehl and hill 2004 gao et al 2019 fem is mass imbalance locally di giammarco et al 1996 and is not applied to arbitrary polygon grids though fem has better flexibility for representing complex boundaries than fdm fvm is one of the best algorithms in the sense of easily fitting to irregular geometric boundaries while preserving well the mass balance erduran et al 2005 loudyi et al 2007 zhu et al 2012 groundwater solute transport models usually have complex boundaries especially in the study of watersheds thus it is vital to develop a groundwater numerical solute transport model that has a flexible mesh division in this study a groundwater solute transport model on arbitrary polygon grid cells is established using the multipoint flux approximations mpfa method which is based on the fvm mpfa was first used in reservoir simulations in the petroleum industry aavatsmark et al 1996 aavatsmark 2002 this method is locally conservative and can handle general irregular grids in anisotropic heterogeneous domains since the mpfa method was proposed a series of studies have been conducted on this method non orthogonal grids are common in reservoir simulations traditional reservoir simulators with mpfa method are designed to give a correct discretization of the flow equations for general nonorthogonal grids as well as for general orientation of the principal directions of the permeability tensor aavatsmark 2002 the mpfa method can be applied on triangular grids younes et al 2013 2014 quadrilateral grids aavatsmark et al 1996 1998a 1998b 2006 edwards and rogers 1998 aavatsmark 2002 and unstructured grids avaatsmark et al 1996 verma and aziz 1996 aavatsmark et al 1998a 1998b edwards 2002 the non linear mpfa scheme has been proved to be second order accurate droniou and potier 2011 generalizations to grids with faults and local refinements are discussed in the literature edwards 1996 aavatsmark et al 2001a 2001b convergence of mpfa method has been investigated numerically klausen and russell 2004 aavatsmark et al 2007 klausen et al 2008 monotonicity of mpfa formulation has been analyzed sheng and yuan 2012 younes et al 2013 and the accuracy of mpfa has been proved aavatsmark et al 2007 in addition mpfa was coupled with the mixed finite element method to develop the multipoint flux mixed finite element method mfmfe which is a new spatial approximation method wheeler and yotov 2006 wheeler et al 2012 chen et al 2020 he et al 2021 because of the advantages of mpfa the method has become the kernel program of the automatic differentiation general purpose research simulator ad gprs developed at stanford which is a powerful and flexible platform in reservoir models with fully unstructured grids zhou 2012 wong et al 2019 jin et al 2020 since the nature of reservoir simulation and groundwater flow simulation is fluid migration in geological media researchers have applied mpfa to groundwater flow simulation in recent years klausen et al 2008 younes et al 2013 dotlic et al 2018 younes and ackerer 2008 have used mpfa to simulate groundwater solute migration however their work has two limitations firstly the solute model is two dimensional secondly the model is used in triangular grids but no unstructured arbitrary polygon grids in general the studies of mpfa application to groundwater solute migration are rarely reported and further research is needed in this paper we construct an improved numerical scheme for solving the governing equation of groundwater solute transport using the cell centered mpfa method the scheme has only cell centered unknowns and can simulate groundwater solute transport calculations with arbitrary polygon grid cells the new model based on this scheme is verified in five case studies by comparing with concentrations calculated by mt3dms which is widely used software 2 governing equation the solute transport is described by the advection dispersion equation ade ignoring chemical reactions ade can be represented by 1 θ c t d c q c c s where θ is the effective porosity c is the concentration of a component species q is the darcy flux cs is the source sink term and d is dispersion tensor which can be represented by 2 d d xx d xy d xz d yx d yy d yz d zx d zy d zz where x y and z are spatial directions in this paper x and y direction are horizontal direction and z direction is the vertical direction the dispersion d in eq 2 is symmetric positive definite the method of calculating d is provided by burnett and frind 1987 which is also used in mt3dms according to burnett and frind 1987 the components of dispersion tensor can be calculated by 3 d xx α l v x 2 v α th v y 2 v α tv v z 2 v d d yy α l v y 2 v α th v x 2 v α tv v z 2 v d d zz α l v z 2 v α th v x 2

vertical transverse dispersivity d is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient and vx vy vz are the components of the pore water seepage velocity vector along the x y and z axes which can be calculated by darcy flux through the relationship 4 v x q x θ v y q y θ v z q z θ 3 methods this section presents the numerical scheme for the governing equation of solute transport in groundwater on arbitrary polygon grids section 3 1 introduces the flux expression derivation for dispersion and advection on arbitrary polygonal grids needed in the numerical scheme section 3 2 introduces the numerical scheme for the governing equation 3 1 flux expressions 3 1 1 dispersive flux expressions the key to calculating the dispersive flux expressions on arbitrary polygonal grids is to obtain the concentration gradient using fully 3d mpfa to calculate the concentration gradient is more complicated than 2d mpfa in addition it is challenging to build fully 3d mpfa on arbitrary polygon grids the aquifer is generally stratified in most cases the boundary of the aquifer in the horizontal direction is more complex than that in the vertical direction thus the horizontal gradient is calculated using 2d mpfa which is suitable for complex boundaries and the vertical gradient is calculated using the traditional two point method which is suitable for simple boundaries in this paper in the traditional model with regular shaped grids as shown in fig 1 a the concentration gradient is expressed by a two point flux stencil the vertical component of concentration gradient is expressed as 5 c v 12 c 1 c 2 z 1 z 2 where c v 12 is the vertical component of the concentration gradient between cells 1 and 2 c 1 and c 2 are the concentrations of specie at the cell centers of the adjacent cells 1 and 2 z 1 and z 2 are the cell centered coordinate values of the adjacent cells 1 and 2 in the z direction in this paper the horizontal concentration gradient components are approximated by a multipoint flux expression called mpfa which is suitable for arbitrary polygon grid cells the number of cell concentrations in the gradient expression is dependent on the grids in mpfa the expression includes the six cells shown in the mpfa example of fig 1b a notation introduced sheng and yuan 2012 is used to simplify the equations as fig 2 shown o1 o n are the cell centers t1 t n are the

the concentrations of edge c k c k 1 the concentrations on the edges need to be expressed by the concentration at the grid center based on flux conservation the flux through half edge at k and at k 1

vector of the surface si 3 1 2 advective flux expressions a control volume scheme for eq 1 involves computing the advective flux the term cnm the inter cell concentration between cells n and m fig 3 should be obtained in the process of calculating the advective flux according to panday 2017 a tvd expansion of this term is provided as 19 c mn c nm ups σ r nm 2 c nm dwn c nm ups where c nm ups is the concentration of the upstream grid block between cells n and m c nm dwn is the concentration of the downstream grid block between cells n and m σ r nm is the flux limiter and rnm is the smoothness

where δt is the time step and n is the time level substituting the dispersive flux eq 18 and advective flux eq 22 into the numerical scheme eq 24 the final numerical scheme which only contains one unknown variable concentration of cell center is formed concentration at the cell center can be solved with a numerical model based on this numerical scheme 4 case studies to assess the performance of the proposed groundwater solute transport model we apply the model to five case studies including four synthetic aquifer systems and one real world aquifer system first the model is applied to four synthetic cases including a one dimensional case section 4 1 a two dimensional case section 4 2 a three dimensional case section 4 3 and a two dimensional case in an aquifer with an anisotropic permeability tensor section 4 4 respectively then to evaluate the performance of the new model in the real world aquifer it is applied to the maozhou river basin in shenzhen china which has complex boundaries section 4 5 the simulated results of the proposed model are compared with the baseline model mt3dms for the five case studies 4 1 case study 1 one dimensional advection and dispersion the performance of our model is first demonstrated in a one dimensional field with a domain size of 200 m x 2 m y and 2 m z the domain is discretized into 100 columns using girds with a size of 2 2 2 m the darcy flux is 3 m d in this case the initial concentration of water in the domain is 0 mg l a prescribed concentration of 2 mg l is set at the upstream end of the domain for the duration of the simulation the transport parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d and the effective porosity θ are 5 m 0 m2 d and 0 2 respectively two transport models for the case study site are built using our proposed model and mt3dms respectively first order upwind fou and third order tvd scheme for advection term are used to simulated the transport process in the mt3dms model the solute transport with advection is first calculated transport simulation is performed for 10 days using 100 time steps with a fixed size of 0 1 day fig 4 shows the simulation results at 1 days 3 days 5 days and 7 days as can be seen from fig 4 the numerical dispersion of our model is greater than that of tvd scheme and samaller than that of fou scheme in mt3dms in general the concentration results of our model are consistent with those of mt3dms in addition the solute transport process with advection and dispersion is calculated the simulation is also performed for 10 days with fixed time step size of 0 1 days the simulated results by two models at 1 days 2 days 3 days 4 days and 5 days are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that concentrations simulated by our model are in excellent agreement with those simulated using mt3dms comparing fig 4 and fig 5 it can be seen that the numerical dispersion in the case of both advection and dispersion is smaller than that in the case of advection only at the same time such as at 1 days 3 days and 5 days 4 2 case study 2 two dimensional advection and dispersion this case is an aquifer with a domain size of 150 m length 100 m width and 5 m depth shown in fig 6 the components of the darcy flux along the x and y axes qx and qy are 1 and 0 m d in this case the initial concentration of water in the domain is 0 mg l a constant concentration of 5 mg l is set from y 40 to y 60 at the upstream end of the domain fig 6 the other boundaries are set as no flux the transport parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl the horizontal transverse dispersivity αth the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d and the effective porosity θ are 5 m 1 m 0 m2 d and 0 2 respectively in this case three transport models for the case study site are built the first model is built using our proposed model with arbitrary polygons to discretize the domain fig 6a the second model is built using our proposed model with a regular grid fig 6b the third model is set as the baseline model built using mt3dms with a regular grid which is the same as the grid of the second model fig 6b in mt3dms model first order upwind fou and third order tvd scheme are used for advection term to solve this case the number of arbitrary polygon cells in the first model is 3750 the number of polygon sides ranges from 3 to 11 the number of cells in the second and third models with a regular grid is also 3750 fig 6b each cell in the regular grids is 2 m 2 m in the horizontal direction table 1 summarizes the key parameters in the model grids we ran the three models for 10 days with a time step size of 0 1 day the concentration results simulated by three models at 8 days are shown in fig 7 the concentration contours of the proposed models the first and second models accord well with those from mt3dms the third model the shapes of the solute plumes simulated with the three models are almost the same indicating the proposed model has good accuracy fig 8 shows the comparison of concentration results simulated by the proposed model and mt3dms along a line at y 50 m at 2 days 4 days 6 days and 8 days the concentrations simulated by the proposed model and mt3dms are in general consistent with each other at the different times 4 3 case study 3 three dimensional advection and dispersion this case is an aquifer with a domain size of 150 m length 100 m width and 15 m depth the components of the darcy flux along the x y and z axes qx qy and qz are 0 6 0 and 0 05 m d respectively the sides 100 m of the aquifer x 0 m and x 150 m have a constant concentration of 0 mg l the other boundaries are set as no flux a solute source with a rate of 200 mg d is imposed at point 39 51 0 the initial concentration of water in the domain is 0 mg l the transport parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl the horizontal transverse dispersivity αth the vertical transverse dispersivity the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d and the effective porosity θ are 5 m 1 5 m 1 m 0 m2 d and 0 2 respectively the aquifer is discretized into 5 layers with z 3 m in the vertical direction in each layer two grid division systems an irregular grid fig 6a and a regular grid fig 6b are used for spatial discrete respectively in this case the irregular grid and the regular grid are the same as those of case 2 three transport models for the case study site are built like case 2 the first model is built using our proposed model with an irregular grid the second model is built using our proposed model with a regular grid the third model is set as the baseline model built using mt3dms with a regular grid which is the same as the grid of the second model in the mt3dms model first order upwind fou and third order tvd scheme are used for advection term to simulate this case the three models are run for 30 days with a fixed time step size of 0 2 day fig 9 shows the comparison of concentrations results on the plane z 1 5 m simulated by the three models at 20 days the concentration contours of the proposed models are in general in good agreement with those of mt3dms as shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows a comparison of simulated concentration results at a profile of y 51 m using the three models at 20 days although there is a deviation of concentrations between the proposed model and mt3dms the shapes of the solute plume are similar in order to compare the concentration results more clearly concentration distributions of lines on the plane z 1 5 m and the profile y 51 m are shown in figs 11 and 12 fig 11 shows a comparison of simulated concentrations at the line y 51 m z 1 5 m of the plane z 1 5 m using the three models at 20 days fig 12 shows a comparison of simulated concentrations at the line x 39 m y 51 m of the profile y 51 m using the three models at 20 days as shown in figs 11 and 12 the calculation results of the three models are generally consistent concentrations calculated by the second and third models with the same grids have a better consistency the deviation of simulated results between the proposed model with irregular grids the first model and mt3dms the third model is higher than that between the proposed model with regular grids the second model and mt3dms the third model which indicates different grids can cause some differences in calculation results the biggest difference between the proposed model with irregular grids and other models with regular grids is at point 39 51 1 5 m where solute source located which indicates source sink will increase the influence of girds in general the comparison results indicate the proposed model is suitable for the simulation of three dimensional advection and dispersion in order to analyze the influence of the grid distribution on the calculation results the perturbed quadrilateral grids with different degrees of distortion should be constructed according to luo et al 2017 node coordinates of perturbed grids are defined as 25 x ij 2 i β 2 r x 1 y ij 2 j β 2 r y 1 where i and j represent the number of node i is from 1 to 74 j is from 1 to 49 β is the degree of distortion with values located in 0 1 rx and ry are two normalized random variables with values located in 0 1 the perturbed quadrilateral grids with different degree of distortion β 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 are constructed as shown in fig 13 fig 13 shows that as β increases the distortion of the grids becomes larger four solute transport models are built using the proposed model on the perturbed quadrilateral grids with different degree of distortion the minimum and maximum concentrations cmin and cmax of all solute transport models at 20 days including these four models and the previous three models are given in table 2 as table 2 shown all the values of cmin and cmax are consistent the values of cmin are very close to 0 the cmax varies as β varies which indicates the grids can affect the calculating results 4 4 case study 4 advection and dispersion in an anisotropic aquifer this test problem discusses advective dispersive transport in an anisotropic aquifer with a domain size of 150 m length 100 m width and 5 m depth which is the same size as case 2 the bottom of the aquifer is a horizontal datum there is water leaking into the aquifer with a rate of 10 m3 d at x 39 m y 51 m the sides x 0 m and x 150 m have constant heads of 20 m and 5 m respectively the other boundaries are set as no flow the permeability of this aquifer is anisotropic the principal directions of the anisotropic permeability tensor are aligned with coordinate axes x axis and y axis the components of the permeability coefficient in principal directions kx and ky are 1 and 0 2 m d respectively the steady state groundwater flow can be calculated based on the above conditions the initial concentration of water in the domain is 0 mg l because the leaking water contains solute a solute source with a rate of 30 g d is imposed at point 39 51 m all boundaries are set as no flux the transport parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl the horizontal transverse dispersivity αth the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d and the effective porosity θ are 5 m 1 m 0 m2 d and 0 2 respectively in this case the aquifer is divided by two types of grids as in case 2 three transport models for the case study site are built like case 2 proposed model with an irregular grid proposed model with a regular grid and mt3dms with a regular grid in the mt3dms model fou and tvd scheme are used to solve this problem the irregular grid and the regular grid of this case are the same as those of case 2 the groundwater flow needs to be simulated first the groundwater tables are calculated by our groundwater flow model and moflow in this case our flow model is established by mpfa which can use arbitrary polygon grids to simulate groundwater flow problems just like the proposed solute transport model in this paper modflow is widely used in groundwater flow simulation which can be linked to mt3dms three groundwater flow models are established our flow model with an irregular grid our flow model with a regular grid and modflow with a regular grid which corresponds to three solute transport models the grids of groundwater flow models are the same as those of solute transport models the steady state groundwater flow fields are calculated using three flow models groundwater velocities in solute transport models are derived from the calculation results of the corresponding water flow models fig 14 shows the groundwater table distribution calculated using three flow models the distributions of groundwater tables in anisotropic aquifer calculated by different models are generally consistent the three solute transport models are run for 60 days with a fixed time step size of 0 2 day fig 15 shows the comparison of concentrations distribution simulated by the three models at 50 days the concentration contours of the proposed models the first and second models accord well with those from mt3dms the third model the solute plume shapes calculated by models using regular grids have a better consistency which also indicates grids can affect calculate results fig 16 shows the comparison of concentration results simulated by the proposed model and mt3dms along a line at y 51 m at 50 days the concentrations simulated by the proposed model and mt3dms are consistent with each other at 50 days in general the comparison of simulated results indicates that the proposed model is suitable for simulating advection and dispersion in the anisotropic aquifer 4 5 case study 5 advection and dispersion in a real world watershed finally we demonstrate our model performance in a case study site with real world geometries the maozhou river basin this basin is in the northwest of shenzhen guangdong province china the study area is 359 8 km2 the thickness of the aquifer is 30 m constant concentration boundary conditions are specified with 0 mg l in the western boundary of the basin the other boundaries are set as no flux a sketch of the model domain is shown in fig 17 in order to facilitate comparison we simplify the groundwater flow field and source and sink terms of the case model we assume that the velocity of the flow field is constant the components of the darcy flux qx and qy are 0 8 and 0 2 m d in this case as for the source and sink items only the area source is kept the solute area sources are distributed as shown in fig 18 the initial concentration is 0 mg l in this case the transport parameters the longitudinal dispersivity αl the horizontal transverse dispersivity αth the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d and the effective porosity θ are 50 m 15 m 0 m2 d and 0 2 respectively three transport models are established with the proposed model and mt3dms the first model is established using the proposed with an irregular grid with polygonal cells a total of 263 polygonal cells shown in fig 17a the irregular grid corresponds with sub basins of the watershed as defined for the surface water model swat the number of polygon cell sides ranges from 3 to 10 the second model is established using mt3dms with 289 square grid cells in each layer shown in fig 17b the number of grid cells in the second model is similar to that in the first model to reduce the impact of the number of cells in the comparison process table 3 summarizes the key grid parameters of the first and second models the third model is as a reference model established using mt3dms with fine discretization which has 5374 cells in the mt3dms model the tvd scheme is chosen for the advection term the results of the third model are assumed to be the most accurate transport simulations with the three models were performed for 200 days with a time step size of 1 days fig 19 shows the comparison of concentration contours simulated by the three models at 100 days and 200 days the concentrations simulated by the proposed model are consistent with those simulated by mt3dms although the numbers of grid cells in the proposed model the first model and mt3dms the second model are less than the number of grids in the reference model the third model the concentration distributions calculated by the first model and second model are similar to the results calculated by the reference model the concentrations are higher in the north and south and lower in the middle which is consistent with the distribution of the area source rate fig 20 shows the comparison between concentrations of the reference model and those simulated by the proposed model and mt3dms at 50 days 100 days and 200 days the ordinate of a circle point represents the concentration simulated using the proposed model in the center of each polygonal mesh while the abscissa of the point is the concentration of the reference model in the corresponding position in fig 20 a b and c the ordinate of a star point is the concentration simulated using mt3dms in the center of a regular square grid while the abscissa of the point is the value of the reference model in the corresponding position in fig 20 d e and f as shown in fig 20 concentrations of the proposed model in each irregular grid and mt3dms in each regular grid are compared with concentrations of the reference model in the corresponding position most of the circle points are near the diagonal in fig 20 a b and c which indicates that the proposed model is accurate some star points are located at the abscissa axis in fig 20 d e and f because the grids represented by these points are on the constant head boundary in the mt3dms it can be seen that the circle points do not deviate as much as the star points in fig 20 a b and c thus the proposed model has a better performance than mt3dms in boundaries the mean errors me of concentrations between the proposed model and reference model are 9 42 10 5 mg l 2 15 10 5 mg l and 3 15 10 4 mg l and the root mean square errors rmse are 1 13 10 3 m 3 77 10 3 mg l and 1 28 10 2 mg l at 50 days 100 days and 200 days respectively the mes of mt3dms are 8 23 10 4 mg l 3 77 10 3 mg l and 4 68 10 3 mg l and rmses are 4 45 10 3 mg l 0 10 mg l and 2 81 10 2 mg l at 50 days 100 days and 200 days respectively all the absolute values of mes and rmses of the proposed model are smaller than those of mt3dms at the same time which indicates the proposed model is more accurate than mt3dms in this case this case comparison verifies that our model can be applied to the real word transport simulation 5 discussion in this study we built a groundwater solute transport model using the mpfa method with arbitrary polygon grids currently modflow usg can also use arbitrary polygon grids to simulate the solute transport process panday 2017 in modflow usg the edge flux is calculated only using two points of two adjacent cells shown in fig 1a while the edge flux is determined by multiple points in mpfa shown in fig 1b during the calculation of mpfa the gradient of a cell is divided into several subcells whose number is equal to that of grid vertexes while the gradient of a grid cell is not divided in the traditional model the concentration gradient of each subcell is determined by multiple cell concentrations in this method an edge flux is divided into two half edges to calculate using different concentration gradients which is equivalent to the refined grid thus the new model makes better use of grid information than the traditional method fig 21 takes a triangular grid as an example of the new method the concentration gradient of the triangular grid is divided into three subcells for calculation the edges of the cell ab ac and bc are divided into 6 half edges by edge midpoints e f and g in some traditional surface water groundwater flow models bailey et al 2017 and solute models cho et al 2010 ehtiat et al 2018 the groundwater models and surface water models are modeled independently in this kind of coupled model the subdivision units of the surface water model are irregular polygons while those of the groundwater grid are trigonal or quadrilateral polygons that cannot match the surface water grids the grid differences between the surface water model and the groundwater model increase modeling workload and application difficulty in the basin case the irregular grids are derived from sub basins of the swat surface water model and can match sub basins the flexibility of the discretization method embedded in our model makes it possible for a fully coupling calculation of surface water groundwater solute transport with sub basin as the numerical grid in a watershed thus our model has the potential to be applied to solute transport in groundwater surface water coupling systems the performance of the new model is demonstrated by comparing our model and mt3dms in five case studies the concentrations simulated by the proposed model are consistent with those simulated by mt3dms in all cases the comparison results show that our model can well represent solute transport processes thus the proposed model can be applied to simulate groundwater solute transport with arbitrary polygon grids 6 conclusions in this study we establish the finite volume scheme for the governing equation of solute transport in groundwater on arbitrary polygon grids which is flux conservative both locally and globally the dispersion term is discretized by the multipoint flux approximation mpfa method which is a finite volume method a total variation diminishing tvd scheme is used to control numerical oscillation in the advection term then we develop an improved numerical groundwater solute transport model based on the scheme which can use arbitrary shaped polygon grids to discretize aquifer systems the validity and performance of the new model are demonstrated with five study cases which include four synthetic cases a one dimensional case a two dimensional case a three dimensional case and a two dimensional case in an anisotropic aquifer and a real world case solutions calculated using the proposed model in all five cases have good agreement with those simulated by mt3dms in the case of an actual watershed the new model has smaller computed root mean square errors and has better performance in the boundaries than the traditional model when the grid number of our model is similar to that of the traditional model the comparison of the proposed model results and mt3dms results shows that our model can be successfully applied to groundwater solute transport simulation in the actual watershed case the irregular grid corresponds with the sub basins of the watershed as delineated in the surface water model of the watershed based on swat this model makes it possible for a fully coupled calculation of surface water groundwater solute transport processes with sub basins as grids in a watershed in the future the model could be improved by optimizing the solution algorithm with the use of parallel computing in addition to better contribute to the solute transport modeling community the model will be distributed as open source software in the future credit authorship contribution statement yulong gao conceptualization methodology writing original

4299,understanding the timing location and rates of recharge is important for sustainable groundwater management and effective management of groundwater dependent ecosystems this paper explores the spatiotemporal distributions of large and small recharge events in a composite watershed in the great lakes region and examines the impacts of climate land use land cover soils and topography on simulated recharge novel aspects of the work include recharge estimation using an integrated hydrologic model and constraining the model using field observations of baseflows in both perennial and intermittent streams in the region as well as the united states geological survey usgs streamflows groundwater heads and satellite based evapotranspiration et products simulated high low recharge values were associated with high low elevations and regions of low high et the temporal dynamics of recharge are dominated by interannual climate variations but are also affected by land cover types and soil types recharge occurred year round in agricultural lands but intermittently in forested lands with both recharge and discharge occurring at different times within the same grid cell major recharge pulses were associated with spring snowmelt and also occurred in summer and fall and sometimes in late fall but there was considerable variability from year to year depending on the dominant land use and climate our approach based on the use of an integrated hydrologic model combined with multi source data can be used in larger areas and is suitable for studying climate change impacts on groundwater resources keywords groundwater recharge distributed hydrologic model streamflow measurement 1 introduction groundwater resources worldwide are under increasing pressure due to rapid population growth agricultural activities industrial demands inefficient water management and climate change dalin et al 2017 gleeson et al 2012 hoogesteger and wester 2015 kløve et al 2014 wada et al 2012 zaveri et al 2016 ensuring reliable groundwater supply and minimizing groundwater contamination are critical and urgent challenges for groundwater management comte et al 2016 gorelick and zheng 2015 as water levels decline in groundwater systems globally quantifying the spatiotemporal variability of natural recharge has become key to protecting and managing both the quality and quantity of groundwater scanlon et al 2006 simmers 2013 further due to the transient nature of recharge quantifying the seasonal and interannual variations in recharge is critical for effective management of water resources and to evaluating contaminant transport in aquifer management and protection in a warming climate glenn et al 2016 jasechko et al 2014 niazi et al 2017 scanlon and cook 2002 healy and scanlon 2010 however estimating the temporal and spatial variability of recharge is challenging de vries and simmers 2002 because the occurrence and spatiotemporal variations are driven by climatic factors topography the nature of land use land cover lulc and the hydraulic properties of the underlying soils arnold et al 1998 chinnasamy et al 2015 crosbie et al 2013 freeze and cherry 1979 hunt et al 2008 jyrkama et al 2002 kendy 2003 mcmahon and böhlke 2006 memon 1995 turkeltaub et al 2014 understanding the impact of these climatic and physical factors on recharge can provide a basis for improving groundwater flow analysis and for promoting recharge estimation in large scale water balance studies groundwater models and climate models more generally bresloff et al 2013 kim and jackson 2012 because of the landscape variability in vegetation and soils estimates of spatial and temporal variability of recharge entail a high level of uncertainty especially when land surface and subsurface conditions are heterogeneous glenn et al 2016 niazi et al 2017 although previous studies used single domain that is groundwater only models to estimate recharge feinstein et al 2010 these estimates come with a high degree of uncertainty as groundwater models treat recharge as model input rather than output computed as part of an integrated solution of the equations governing coupled surface and subsurface processes an additional challenge in estimating recharge using groundwater only models is associated with the problem of optimization parameter estimation in which the parameter should be estimated at every grid cell and for every time step in an unsteady three dimensional groundwater model a formidable task with a high degree of uncertainty on the other hand fully integrated hydrologic models can compute recharge maples et al 2020 sulis et al 2011 as part of the coupled solution without these challenges associated with estimating a complex variable with spatiotemporal variability process based integrated surface subsurface hydrologic models which quantify all relevant hydrologic processes contributing to recharge are therefore useful tools for estimating the spatial and temporal patterns of recharge dakhlalla et al 2016 jyrkama et al 2002 scanlon and cook 2002 awan and ismaeel 2014 examples of such models include inhm vanderkwaak and loague 2001 cathy camporese et al 2010 paniconi and wood 1993 paniconi et al 2003 parflow ashby and falgout 1996 kollet and maxwell 2006 paws niu et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2020 shen et al 2013 shen and phanikumar 2010 mike she dhi 2004 and hgs therrien and sudicky 1996 to name only a few the factors that influence recharge such as the depth to groundwater precipitation vegetation and soil texture can be examined in detail using these models process based hydrologic models have been successfully used in the great lakes basin in the past xu et al 2021 niu et al 2014 shen et al 2013 for example previous studies in various watersheds in michigan niu et al 2014 qiu et al 2020 shen et al 2013 have demonstrated that the paws model performs well in terms of simulating the major components of the water budget for large and small watersheds few previous studies quantified the high resolution spatiotemporal dynamics of recharge in the great lakes region using integrated hydrologic models watershed models are generally calibrated to streamflows at gauging stations typically representing large rivers however surface water gauge density is a primary constraint on being able to characterize exchange fluxes the landscape variability in recharge is reflected by groundwater contribution to a large number of small streams some perennial and some intermittent and direct measurements of baseflows in these streams can be expected to provide valuable data to constrain surface water groundwater exchange fluxes and thus estimates of recharge the main objective of the paper was to estimate recharge in a snow dominated great lakes watershed to address questions related to the sustainability of groundwater resources in the region a novel aspect of the work is the use of a fully integrated hydrologic model to estimate recharge as previous efforts in the region used groundwater models in which recharge is an input parameter to be calibrated rather than model output another important aspect of our work is the use of measured baseflows in streams to constrain model estimates over space and time while measured long term average streamflows have been used to test integrated hydrologic models li et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge baseflow information as a function of time and space has not been used to constrain fully integrated hydrologic models in the context of recharge estimation in the region discharge data from low flow and intermittent streams across the watershed may be more relevant from the point of capturing the spatial dynamics of recharge than data from a few large rivers since streamflow in the summer i e dry season can be considered baseflow given that it approximately equals recharge arnold et al 2000 cherkauer and ansari 2005 gebert et al 2007 zomlot et al 2015 in addition to baseflow measurements multiple datasets were used to constrain the model including streamflows from usgs gauges groundwater heads from the mdeq wellogic database michigan department of environmental quality and modis et products from umt ntsg university of montana numerical terradynamic simulation group a third novel aspect of the work involves recharge estimation in a snow dominated area where winter hydrological processes contribute a significant fraction of recharge this is a topic of current interest as approaches based on the residual water balance method of estimating recharge lead to large uncertainties associated with estimating evapotranspiration and the storage and release of water from the snowpack in snow dominated regions e g see schilling et al 2021 our approach to quantify high resolution recharge dynamics in a heterogeneous watershed based on an integrated hydrologic model with explicit representation of winter hydrological processes constrained using baseflow measurements and multi source data has the potential for applications to larger watersheds and to other regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description our study area ottawa county michigan is located in the west central part of lower michigan fig 1 ottawa county relies heavily on its groundwater for drinking water and for agricultural and industrial uses declining static water levels in the glacial aquifer especially in the south central part of the county and increasing chloride concentrations in the deeper aquifer were reported curtis et al 2019 many small groundwater dependent streams in the region were found to have dried up during our fieldwork in the summer of 2015 understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of recharge therefore is of utmost importance for effective groundwater resource management in ottawa county although some estimates of recharge based on isotope and water balance methods are available for a nearby watershed delcore and larson 1987 and references therein detailed estimates of recharge based on process based models are not available the primary river in the county is the grand river which drains westward into lake michigan streams in the southeast region of the county drain into the rabbit river a tributary of the kalamazoo river which is to the south of ottawa county the area on the southwest side of the county is drained by the macatawa watershed the ottawa county modeling domain marked by a dark blue line in fig 1 represents a composite watershed and comprises parts of the lower grand river watershed the macatawa river watershed and the rabbit river watershed as shown in fig 1 the modeling domain is approximately 1900 km2 in size and the elevation within its boundary ranges from 175 m to 325 m lake michigan has a strong influence on the climate of ottawa county during winter time the massive lake effect leads to an average of 1800 mm of snowfall in ottawa county each year the county s average annual rainfall is around 900 mm www miottawa org the lake effect climate is essential to the county given that agricultural land accounts for about 50 of the county s total land mass and provides opportunities for diversified agricultural practices including fruit and horticultural crops census of agriculture 2017 before the development of the lumber industry in michigan the county was almost entirely covered by forests today large areas of forests can only be found along the lake michigan shoreline and along rivers and as scattered patches within farmland most wetlands in the county are located along the edges of the grand river and its tributaries and along the macatawa and pigeon rivers fig 2 presents the land use and land cover lulc for the entire modeling domain the geology in the study area includes a shallow aquifer of unconsolidated glacial deposits and a deeper aquifer consisting of fractured bedrock the glacial geology is strongly heterogeneous consisting of lacustrine coarse and fine deposits primarily of sand and gravel materials concentrated in the western and central portions of the study area glacial till poorly sorted material including boulders gravel and sand occurs throughout the study area but only visible at the surface in the southern and eastern portions of the study area glacial outwash sand occurs in the eastern portion of the study domain and sand dunes occur along the lake michigan shoreline farrand 1982 the primary bedrock units under the glacial deposits include the coldwater shale marshall formation and michigan formation westjohn and weaver 1998 mdnr 1999 the coldwater shale is a master confining unit within the michigan basin consisting of shale carbonate siltstone and sandstone the thickness of the coldwater shale in the study area is about 150 m stratigraphically the marshall formation with a thickness ranging approximately from 25 m to 50 m overlies the coldwater shale and is overlain by the michigan formation westjohn and weaver 1998 the michigan formation with a thickness ranging approximately from less than 50 m to more than 100 m is an interbedded sequence of shale limestone dolomite gypsum or anhydrite siltstone and sandstone in some places the michigan formation is a marginal aquifer but generally serves as a partially confining layer westjohn and weaver 1998 figs s1 and s2 in supplementary material present the geology maps of the study area geology of the michigan peninsula is reported in a number of earlier studies soller et al 2012 feinstein et al 2010 neff et al 2005 neff et al 2006 filtered geo tagged and extensively processed raw well data from the continously growing network of wells upwards of 500 000 in the michigan wellogic database mdeq 2014 provide quantitative information on aquifer materials and heterogeneity static water levels at the time of well installation and depth of wells this information was successfully used in a number of previous groundwater modeling studies in the region liao et al 2020 curtis et al 2018 2019 niu et al 2014 shen et al 2013 shen and phanikumar 2010 as well as in the present work additional details of the data sources used to represent subsurface features in the groundwater module are described in a later section 2 2 streamflow measurements two types of streamflow measurements were made in multiple shallow segments of the four major rivers grand river macatawa river pigeon river and rabbit river and 44 of their tributaries in 2015 1 one time synoptic streamflow sampling over a ten day period in late july and 2 time series sampling over six months from june to november 2015 a sontek riversurveyor m9 system www sontek com and the ott mf pro current flow meter ott hydromet usa www ott com were used to measure streamflows in many of the smaller streams in ottawa county fig s3 in supplementary material shows typical streams in the study area the riversurveyor m9 an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp was used to collect discharge data in streams with a depth of more than 20 cm the ott mf pro an electromagnetic current meter with a sensor head ideal for use in low flow environments was primarily used to collect the streamflow data in streams with a depth of less than 20 cm but a width of at least 1 5 m the one time streamflow sampling between july 22 and july 31 provided a snapshot of the spatial variations in streamflows of the 48 one time streamflow measurements 22 were collected with the adcp nine were collected with the current flow meter and 17 streams had a streamflow rate of zero sampling locations are available in table 2 the time series sampling data for the small streams were collected to provide 1 a validation dataset in the form of discharge as a function of time and 2 a basis for examining the model s performance for small streams in particular the ability to quantify exchange fluxes between groundwater and surface water domains time series streamflow data were collected at 14 locations in either monthly or biweekly intervals including 13 measurements collected with the adcp and one measurement collected with the current flow meter 2 3 the model the paws model incorporates overland flow channel flow soil water flow and groundwater flow that collectively cover the various flow paths after a rainfall event shen and phanikumar 2010 in addition paws clm provides detailed process based descriptions of vegetation dynamics niu et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2020 thornton and zimmermann 2007 and accounts for canopy interception snowpack biomass depression storage and evapotranspiration lawrence et al 2011 shen et al 2013 snowpack temperatures are updated by solving a heat conduction equation in the snicar snow ice and aerosol radiative model module of the ncar community land model clm linked to paws soil temperature is also governed by a heat conduction equation and soil freezing is calculated by a freezing point depression formulation the soil hydraulic conductivities are scaled down by an impermeability factor that depends on the fraction of ice in the soil within clm depending on the climate conditions snowpack calculation may take place and is quantified by the snow water equivalent swe and snow cover fraction snowmelt is added to the ponding layer with rainfall after taking out the canopy interception interception parameterizations in clm use the same parameters for all plant functional types pfts and are a source of uncertainty the details of the model conceptualization and coupling schemes can be found in shen and phanikumar 2010 and shen et al 2013 although recharge observations are rarely available recharge can be constrained based on an overall water budget through the surface water vadose zone and groundwater system while precipitation and et are the critical factors controlling recharge cao et al 2016 kendy et al 2003 tan et al 2014 recharge estimates are most reliable when the primary processes determining the water budget i e discharge and et are simulated accurately the water budget equation that guides the recharge evaluation is given by eq 1 1 r p e t q δ s where r l t is recharge p l t is precipitation which is the model input q l t is runoff et l t is evapotranspiration and δ s l t is the change in soil water storage the paws model directly computes r q et and δ s model performance on q and et is evaluated in section 3 based on field observations and remote sensing products respectively compared with the values of et and q the values of δ s are relatively small and some studies coelho et al 2017 mo et al 2009 chose not to use δ s in recharge and et estimations which means the recharge estimation is indirectly evaluated based only on the estimation of q and et in addition to using the storage term in the water balance equation we also assess the performance of the subsurface flow modules based on observed groundwater heads the ability of the model to simulate transient groundwater levels and storage changes is important from the point of recharge estimation although lack of information on water extracted from the aquifers due to agricultural municipal domestic and industrial water uses tend to make comparisons with transient groundwater levels challenging shen and phanikumar 2010 demonstrated the model s ability to simulate transient water level fluctuations by comparing model results with the experimental data of vauclin et al 1979 for a water table recharge problem niu 2013 and niu et al 2014 applied the paws model to the grand river watershed in michigan and provided evidence that the model can simulate soil moisture and temperature as well as transient groundwater levels and storage changes in the watershed after examining the sensitivity of model results kang 2018 to various grid sizes and the number of vertical layers we have applied the model at a 300 m 300 m spatial resolution across the entire study area with an hourly time step for weather vegetation evapotranspiration and groundwater simulations a time step of 2 min for channel flow and overland flow and adaptive time steps ranging from 2 min to 1 h for the vadose zone we aggregated the results to daily monthly and yearly time steps for further analysis twenty vertical layers were used to discretize the vadose zone with additional layers defined for the saturated groundwater domain additional details including details of how vertical exchange between aquifers is modeled are described in shen and phanikumar 2010 2 4 data sources a layer of relatively permeable glacial deposits overlies the bedrock within the study area this information was used to divide the groundwater model domain into two layers the upper glacial deposit layer is taken as the unconfined aquifer and the lower bedrock layer represents the confined aquifer with a layer of aquitard between the layers quantitative and qualitative information used with the groundwater model including static water levels well depths the aquifer type as well as a description of the aquifer material were extracted from the mdeq wellogic database the local hydraulic conductivities and thicknesses of the glacial drift layer are all spatially variable and were estimated using the wellogic database records for example borehole records in the wellogic database contain lithologic information and these data were combined with a stochastic approach transition probability geostatistics weissmann et al 1999 to characterize the heterogeneity of the glacial aquifer as described in liao et al 2020 the boundaries of the study area were constructed using small 12 digit watershed boundaries from usgs nhd and were assigned as no flow boundaries based on the assumption that groundwater flow across topographic divides is negligible as this may not represent the actual conditions model calibration against static water levels from wells far away from the boundaries was done honoring geology but allowing small variations of conductivity within the range of accepted values for the aquifer material to minimize the influence of the no groundwater flow assumption across topographic divides computed heads in the glacial aquifer were relatively insensitive to details of the bedrock aquifer therefore a deterministic approach was used to assign conductivity values in the bedrock aquifer based on the wellogic database described in liao et al 2020 and these values are consistent with estimates from earlier studies e g feinstein et al 2010 fig s4 in supplementary material presents the distribution of calibrated hydraulic conductivities in the glacial aquifer and additional details including maps of hydraulic conductivity in the glacial and bedrock aquifer are available in liao et al 2020 the western boundary condition was based on the long term water level of lake michigan on the eastern boundary we have used a boundary condition to capture the effects of upstream regional flow into the domain as described later the meteorological forcing data required for the model were daily rainfall snowfall maximum and minimum air temperature wind speed and relative humidity the values for each of these were obtained from observations collected at 29 global historical climatology network ghcn stations and provided by the national center for environmental information ncei formerly known as national climatic data center ncdc https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web as well as from three stations provided by the michigan automated weather station network mawn https enviroweather msu edu over the study period locations of the weather stations in fig 1 the 30 m resolution national elevation dataset ned from the usgs http nationalmap gov elevation html was processed to generate average cell elevation and lowland storage bottom elevation in the computational grid and also used to calculate the slope and surface runoff routing of the watersheds the national hydrography dataset nhd from the usgs http nhd usgs gov data html provided the channel flow network and stream properties fig 1 soils data were obtained from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo from the u s department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs the soils data were processed using the rosetta program to provide soil water retention and unsaturated conductivity information for the model schaap et al 2001 fig s5 in supplementary material shows the calibrated saturated hydraulic conductivity the lulc data used in the model are taken from the integrated forest monitoring assessment and prescription ifmap dataset fig 2 from the michigan department of natural resources mdnr ifmap was derived from the classification of landsat thematic mapper tm imagery for the period of 1997 to 2001 and has a 30 m spatial resolution the land use data were reclassified into several model classes called plant functional types pfts thornton and zimmermann 2007 based on the land use classification percentile values reported in previous studies jia et al 2001 lu and weng 2006 niu et al 2014 because the model cell size 300 300 m is coarser than the ifmap spatial resolution 30 m a model cell possesses a mixture of land use land cover types as a result three dominant pfts were recorded and used in the model cells the streamflow data for calibrating and validating the model were obtained from the usgs national water information system usgs nwis http waterdata usgs gov nwis rt and from the streamflow data collected during fieldwork to better constrain model parameters fig 1 there are four usgs gauging stations for the simulation period in the study domain table 1 of which three were used to calibrate and validate the model usgs04119400 usgs04108800 and usgs04108600 the other station usgs04119000 which is on the grand river and close to the eastern boundary of the modeling domain provided upstream inflow data for the model this boundary condition was required because the study area ottawa county represents a political boundary rather than a watershed boundary moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis global et mod16 products were compared both spatially and temporally with the et simulated by the paws model the mod16 global et datasets offer 1 km spatial resolution land surface et data for global vegetated land areas at 8 day monthly and annual intervals for the 2000 2014 period it should be noted that these datasets do not account for et from either open water or urban areas mod16 data were obtained from http www ntsg umt edu project modis mod16 php 2 5 simulation details daily streamflows for the period of 08 01 2009 12 31 2010 from the usgs gauges 041190400 04108800 and 04 108 600 were used to calibrate the paws model the parameters used are listed in table s1 supplementary material parameter optimization using the differential evolution de algorithm price et al 2005 was performed using computer resources at the high performance computing center hpcc at michigan state university we used the streamflows at these three usgs gauges from 01 01 2011 to 11 22 2015 to validate the model further the measured streamflows were used to validate model performance in small streams modis et products were used to validate simulated et in both space and time the comparison between the simulated and observed wellogic groundwater heads was further used to verify model performance for subsurface flow processes winter hydrologic processes including evapotranspiration stream and soil temperatures during winter as well as the storage and release of water in the snowpack are simulated by the model and detailed comparisons for winter months are included in earlier papers niu et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2020 therefore no additional comparisons are shown to further test the winter hydrology modules in the present paper krause et al 2005 recommend a combination of efficiency criteria for evaluating model performance accordingly the following metrics were selected for model assessments the coefficient of determination r 2 eq 2 the square root transformed nash metric rnash eq 3 shen and phanikumar 2010 the root mean square error rmse eq 4 and the percent bias eq 5 moriasi et al 2007 2 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 3 rnash 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o i 2 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 5 pbias i 1 n o i s i 100 i 1 n o i where o i is the i th observed value o is the mean of the observed data s i is the i th simulated value s is the mean simulated value and n is the total number of observations rmse is used to estimate the difference between the measured and simulated values r 2 is defined as the squared value of the pearson s product moment correlation legates and mccabe 1999 representing the percentage of the data closest to the line of best fit typically values of r 2 greater than 0 5 are considered acceptable moriasi et al 2007 pbias values tend to show more variability with values summarized in moriasi et al 2007 falling in the range 155 6 47 18 for daily streamflows for the validation period positive values of pbias indicate underprediction bias zero being the optimal value the square root transformed nash rnash was employed as a second criterion because the nash coefficient tends to give too much importance to the peak flows while the rnash metric is designed to emphasize the baseflow shen and phanikumar 2010 in this study baseflow simulation is more important than capturing the peak flows because baseflow is the groundwater contribution to streams and is therefore associated with recharge 3 results and discussions 3 1 streamflow we compared the observed and simulated daily streamflows over a five year period at three usgs gauging stations fig 3 the coefficients of determination for all three stations were higher than 0 5 which are acceptable values the rnash values ranged from 0 4 to 0 98 the lowest rnash was observed at usgs 04108600 which might be related to the proximity of this station to the watershed boundary the rmse values were small compared to the streamflow values at these usgs gauges the comparison for usgs 04119400 grand river eastmanville shows better streamflow simulation at this station probably due to the proximity to usgs 04119000 which provided upstream inflow at the intersection of grand river and the watershed boundary all the statistics indicate that the model simulated streamflows reasonably well especially during the low flow periods of 2011 2015 a close up view in fig 3 b presents the comparisons during low flow periods the mismatches in the hydrograph are primarily due to the underestimation of streamflow peaks in the spring an examination of the weather records shows that the precipitation values are low for the underestimated peak periods indicating that precipitation is not the direct cause of high streamflows further it is also important to consider that the study area is affected by heavy lake effect snow during the winter so these mismatches may be correlated with the effects of melting snow and errors and uncertainties associated with measurement as well as model descriptions of snow processes a close inspection of fig 3 a b shows that the simulated streamflow at usgs 04108800 macatawa river zeeland and usgs 04108600 rabbit river at hopkins underestimated the peaks almost every spring during the simulation period because the lake effect snow was severe at this location which is close to lake michigan there are two possible reasons for the uncertainties during snowmelt periods 1 the uncertainty of the measured snowfall depth induced by the measurement methods at the weather stations and 2 the deficiency of the snow energy balance routine of the current clm model niu et al 2014 the snowmelt events are primarily responsible for reducing the model performance metrics relatively low r2 rnash values and large pbias values at these stations the time series comparisons between the simulated and field measured streamflows were analyzed and the comparisons at six sampling locations scattered throughout the watershed are presented in fig 4 the gps coordinates of the sampling locations are presented in table 2 as the discharge values in these small streams were small 0 10 m3 s the data were plotted on a logarithmic scale to examine the streamflows closely a value of 0 1 m3 s was added to both simulated and measured data at locations m22 and m38 to facilitate plotting in logarithmic scale due to the zero or near zero values for some simulation periods fig s6 in supplementary material shows the comparison on a linear scale overall the simulated streamflows were in good agreement with the measured streamflows at these sampling locations a one time synoptic sampling was performed in july 2015 to quantify the spatial variations in baseflows as the et values were high in the summer the measured and simulated streamflow values are summarized in table 3 the simulated streamflow values in table 3 closely agree with measured data r2 0 81 rmse 0 031 pbias 17 9 note that pbias does not improve when zero streamflow values are correctly simulated the results of the time series streamflow sampling data and the one time spatial streamflow data summarized in table 3 indicate that the model 1 captures baseflow and 2 accurately simulates recharge because baseflow can be considered a proxy for recharge arnold et al 2000 risser et al 2005 zomlot et al 2015 3 2 evapotranspiration to validate the simulated et temporally and spatially we used the monthly and yearly modis et products over the four year period of 2011 2014 the comparison between the 4 year average annual modis and the simulated et of the modeling domain is presented in fig 5 the simulated et has a spatial resolution of 300 m and resolves finer details than the modis et with a cell size of 1 km for the simulated et the highest values occurred along the major rivers and in the wetlands while the lowest values were found in urban areas the lower spatial variability in the modis et values compared with those of the simulated et can be attributed to several sources including the smoothing effects of 1 the coarser spatial resolution of the modis data and 2 the temporal compositing of the modis et products moreover modis et products do not include et from open water where et values are the highest in our model nor is et from urban areas included where our model estimates the lowest values mu et al 2013 the white areas in the modis et map in fig 5 represent the urban areas nevertheless the overall spatial pattern of the simulated average annual et is similar to that of the average annual modis et but both the range and the spatial variability of the simulated values are greater in the study area two regions showed significant differences in their average annual et values first the northeast part of the modeling domain showed higher average annual simulated et relative to modis et values are high due to the high soil moisture associated with saturation excess in the lowland foothill region ivanov et al 2004 the riparian forest associated with rogue river and other contiguous forest cover in the northeast region lead to high et values the other region that showed significant difference in its average annual et values from the modis et is in central ottawa county where the values of precipitation were higher than the values in the surrounding areas and both overhead irrigation of field crops and trickle irrigation of horticultural crops are common while the simulated et values are high in most cells in this area the modis et has high values only in some cells with a time series et constraint the uncertainty of the recharge estimation decreases compared to when a constraint of this nature is not included in the model xie et al 2018 thus a comparison between the simulated and modis monthly et was examined in this study we aggregated the time series of the daily simulated et output into average monthly simulated et in order to compare with the monthly modis et products fig 6 the simulated monthly et values match the modis monthly et values reasonably well the r2 value for the 4 year comparison is 0 79 as expected the highest value for both the simulated and the modis monthly et occurred during the summer months and the lowest values accrued during the winter months the low et values shown for the summer of 2012 are due to the drought that year one primary reason for the differences between the simulated et and the modis et may be due to the different et algorithms used in paws clm and modis et paws clm uses a resistance approach to simulate et based on the two big leaf model dai et al 2004 whereas modis et is is based on a revised penman monteith formulation mu et al 2011 in paws clm snowmelt is added to rainfall after canopy interception is taken out but snowpack is not considered in the modis et calculation the snowpack hydrological processes in paws may have contributed to the larger et during spring in this heavy lake effect snow region a second reason mentioned earlier is that the modis et products do not account for et from either open water or urban areas and these are simulated by paws 3 3 groundwater heads we derived the observed groundwater head data from the logs of over 400 water wells installed in the unconfined aquifer within ottawa county the estimated groundwater heads were extracted for the computational cells where the wells were located fig 7 presents the comparison between the estimated and the observed groundwater heads in distinct colors for different years against the reference 1 1 line the overall r2 value is 0 88 indicating a good match both in space and time given the close match between the simulated and the wellogic head data the paws model provides good estimates of the groundwater heads for this study based on the comparisons of streamflow evapotranspiration and groundwater heads between our model results and data from various sources we conclude that the paws model performed well at a finer resolution of 300 m and daily temporal resolution needed to capture the temporal dynamics of various hydrologic processes as is common elsewhere there are no observed recharge data covering the modeling domain at sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to allow a direct comparison with model results since available data from different sources have different resolutions the model can serve as a tool to constrain key processes by integrating data across scales and to provide recharge estimates within the uncertainties of the data and the modeling in the following sections we present the simulated recharge results to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics 3 4 spatial variation in recharge fig 8 shows the spatial patterns of the annual recharge over the four year period of 2011 2014 recharge values vary from year to year primarily responding to climatic factors the recharge values in the drought year of 2012 are generally low the spatial distributions of the simulated recharge followed the general hydrogeological pattern whereby high and low recharge values occurred at high and low elevations respectively the opposite relationship was found between the spatial patterns of et and recharge except for urban areas where both et and recharge values are low the primary recharge areas for the glacial aquifer occurred in the northeastern and southeastern parts of the county where the primary land use is agriculture and elevations are high the central area of the county showed low recharge values possibly for two main reasons first high et values were found in this area second the elevation in this area is relatively low the groundwater replenished by recharge in the northeastern region of the county discharged to the grand river while recharge in the southeastern area of the county mainly discharged to the rabbit river as a result these primary recharge areas did not contribute much groundwater into the central part of the county which has experienced increased but unsustainable groundwater use the unexpected high values of recharge along the northeastern boundary of the computational domain are attributed to boundary issues since the modeling domain is composed of surface watersheds that in this area might not match well with the groundwatersheds such conditions would allow groundwater flow from outside of the model domain without reflecting this in the model parameters 3 5 temporal dynamics of recharge recharge is a function of precipitation land use types soil types topography and the spatiotemporal co occurrence of these factors the non linear relationships between recharge and these climatic and physical factors are complex fig 9 presents the monthly dynamics of recharge with different types of land uses such that each panel in the figure represents the recharge dynamics in a grid cell with one dominant land use e g the panel for agricultural land has recharge results coming from a grid cell with more than 90 of the cell covering agricultural land use although a few other land uses may be present the daily time series data that formed the basis for the monthly data in fig 9 are available in the supplementary material as fig s6 in this study each cell in the lulc map consists of three dominant lulc types expressed as a percentage soybean corn broadleaf forest and needleleaf forest are the dominant land types in the selected cells for fig 9 three major soil types sand clay loam and loam were mapped throughout the area nrcs usda the soils beneath the soybean land and broadleaf forest land for the selected cells were mostly sandy whereas the corn and needleleaf forest cells were underlain mainly by clay loam in agricultural lands soybean and corn figs 9a and b and s6a and b the simulated monthly recharge generally had a delayed response to the monthly precipitation and increased after intense precipitation events during the simulation period except for the drought year of 2012 fig 9a and b precipitation for the year 2012 was well below average which had a significant impact on reducing the recharge in the soybean land with sandy soil than in the corn land with clay loam soil indicating that recharge in sandy soil was more responsive to precipitation also high et values are more often observed in sandy soils the fluctuation of the monthly recharge values was greater in the forested land than in agricultural land further the monthly recharge values in the forested land were low especially in 2012 due to a period of drought that took place from late spring to fall the temporal fluctuation of recharge in forested land may be partially due to the fluctuations in et which consumed a large portion of the precipitation about 60 in this study area in the agricultural land the temporal pattern of et is primarily affected by precipitation and the length of the growing season et in the forested land is more dependent on precipitation given that forests especially broadleaf deciduous forests do not have a controlled growing season as farmlands do therefore we argue that the temporal fluctuation of et is correlated to the temporal fluctuation of recharge in the forested land and is also affected by the within cell proportion of land covers the daily time series results presented in fig s7 with units of mm day show that recharge was continuous in agricultural lands while it was intermittent in forested lands with both recharge and discharge occurring at different times within the same grid cell since discharge is essentially negative recharge these events show up as gaps in a semi log plot of recharge versus time fig s7 supplementary material these gaps in recharge are one reason why forested lands have lower recharge on average compared to agricultural lands although the magnitudes of individual recharge events in forested lands tend to be higher major recharge pulses occurred in spring due to snowmelt in summer and fall and sometimes in late fall but there is considerable variability from year to year depending on the dominant land use and climate the daily recharge values for soybean and corn cells range from 0 to 5 mm day values in forested cells are characterized by more fluctuations probably due to larger biomass but primarily fall in the range from 0 to 5 mm day except for some days when the values are as high as 20 mm day fig 10 presents the time series of the average monthly recharge for the period of september 2011 september 2015 the cycle of the monthly recharge dynamics is responsive to the cycle of a hydrological year however the temporal distribution of the average monthly recharge for each hydrological year was different for example extremely high precipitation values occurred in april 2013 which contributed to the peak values of recharge peak values of recharge occurred in the winters of 2012 and 2015 but were spread across the fall of 2013 and the winter spring of 2014 3 6 recharge dynamics for various lulc during wet and drought years boxplots of the annual recharge for four major land use types were created for the drought year of 2012 and the wet year of 2014 to examine the impact of lulc on recharge during these years fig 11 as noted earlier three dominant pfts were modeled in each cell 300 m 300 m in this study for example one cell might be composed of 70 of soybean 20 of corn and 10 of the broadleaf forest in the boxplots the x axis represents the percentage of one dominant lulc type in a cell taking soybean as an example 10 on the x axis means that the cells that contributed to the box plot contain between 0 and 10 of soybean and 20 means that soybean fraction was between 10 and 20 of the cell and so on in each box the central horizontal line represents the median and the bottom and top of the vertical bars indicate the first and third quartile metrics respectively the outliers are plotted individually using a symbol it is evident from fig 11 that the median values of recharge increased when the percentage of the soybean and corn land types in the cells increased for both the drought year of 2012 and the wet year of 2014 conversely the median values of recharge decreased when the cover percentages of the broadleaf and impervious land types in the cells increased for both years the recharge values are lower in the cells with a larger proportion of forested land types because the deep root system in the forested land leads to a high et value and canopy interception would reduce the amount of water reaching the ground especially for forests at full canopy in the summer changes in the median recharge values at different landcover percentages are similar in both dry and wet years for all four landcover types but the recharge values for 2014 are higher than those for 2012 4 conclusions in this paper we explored the dynamics of recharge at a fine spatiotemporal resolution 300 m resolution daily interval in a composite area encompassing multiple watersheds in the great lakes region using a process based hydrologic model we used streamflow data from three usgs gauges and from a number of small streams to test model performance over time and space we also used observed groundwater head data and modis et products to test model performance our results show that model estimates are in good agreement with observations of the major hydrologic components including streamflow groundwater and et model outputs of daily recharge for the ottawa county were aggregated to monthly average values for further analysis the spatial variation of recharge shows that the primary recharge areas to the glacial aquifer do not contribute much groundwater to the central part of the county which has experienced significant increase in groundwater use the temporal dynamics of the monthly recharge show that recharge rates are dependent on the year to year climatic variations high resolution recharge estimates from this study are expected to aid groundwater modeling studies to address questions of aquifer sustainability while this study was conducted in the ottawa county michigan the model is capable of simulating surface hydrological fluxes accurately and thus can be applied to other regions and over larger areas for recharge estimation the modeling approach can also be used in future climate change

4299,understanding the timing location and rates of recharge is important for sustainable groundwater management and effective management of groundwater dependent ecosystems this paper explores the spatiotemporal distributions of large and small recharge events in a composite watershed in the great lakes region and examines the impacts of climate land use land cover soils and topography on simulated recharge novel aspects of the work include recharge estimation using an integrated hydrologic model and constraining the model using field observations of baseflows in both perennial and intermittent streams in the region as well as the united states geological survey usgs streamflows groundwater heads and satellite based evapotranspiration et products simulated high low recharge values were associated with high low elevations and regions of low high et the temporal dynamics of recharge are dominated by interannual climate variations but are also affected by land cover types and soil types recharge occurred year round in agricultural lands but intermittently in forested lands with both recharge and discharge occurring at different times within the same grid cell major recharge pulses were associated with spring snowmelt and also occurred in summer and fall and sometimes in late fall but there was considerable variability from year to year depending on the dominant land use and climate our approach based on the use of an integrated hydrologic model combined with multi source data can be used in larger areas and is suitable for studying climate change impacts on groundwater resources keywords groundwater recharge distributed hydrologic model streamflow measurement 1 introduction groundwater resources worldwide are under increasing pressure due to rapid population growth agricultural activities industrial demands inefficient water management and climate change dalin et al 2017 gleeson et al 2012 hoogesteger and wester 2015 kløve et al 2014 wada et al 2012 zaveri et al 2016 ensuring reliable groundwater supply and minimizing groundwater contamination are critical and urgent challenges for groundwater management comte et al 2016 gorelick and zheng 2015 as water levels decline in groundwater systems globally quantifying the spatiotemporal variability of natural recharge has become key to protecting and managing both the quality and quantity of groundwater scanlon et al 2006 simmers 2013 further due to the transient nature of recharge quantifying the seasonal and interannual variations in recharge is critical for effective management of water resources and to evaluating contaminant transport in aquifer management and protection in a warming climate glenn et al 2016 jasechko et al 2014 niazi et al 2017 scanlon and cook 2002 healy and scanlon 2010 however estimating the temporal and spatial variability of recharge is challenging de vries and simmers 2002 because the occurrence and spatiotemporal variations are driven by climatic factors topography the nature of land use land cover lulc and the hydraulic properties of the underlying soils arnold et al 1998 chinnasamy et al 2015 crosbie et al 2013 freeze and cherry 1979 hunt et al 2008 jyrkama et al 2002 kendy 2003 mcmahon and böhlke 2006 memon 1995 turkeltaub et al 2014 understanding the impact of these climatic and physical factors on recharge can provide a basis for improving groundwater flow analysis and for promoting recharge estimation in large scale water balance studies groundwater models and climate models more generally bresloff et al 2013 kim and jackson 2012 because of the landscape variability in vegetation and soils estimates of spatial and temporal variability of recharge entail a high level of uncertainty especially when land surface and subsurface conditions are heterogeneous glenn et al 2016 niazi et al 2017 although previous studies used single domain that is groundwater only models to estimate recharge feinstein et al 2010 these estimates come with a high degree of uncertainty as groundwater models treat recharge as model input rather than output computed as part of an integrated solution of the equations governing coupled surface and subsurface processes an additional challenge in estimating recharge using groundwater only models is associated with the problem of optimization parameter estimation in which the parameter should be estimated at every grid cell and for every time step in an unsteady three dimensional groundwater model a formidable task with a high degree of uncertainty on the other hand fully integrated hydrologic models can compute recharge maples et al 2020 sulis et al 2011 as part of the coupled solution without these challenges associated with estimating a complex variable with spatiotemporal variability process based integrated surface subsurface hydrologic models which quantify all relevant hydrologic processes contributing to recharge are therefore useful tools for estimating the spatial and temporal patterns of recharge dakhlalla et al 2016 jyrkama et al 2002 scanlon and cook 2002 awan and ismaeel 2014 examples of such models include inhm vanderkwaak and loague 2001 cathy camporese et al 2010 paniconi and wood 1993 paniconi et al 2003 parflow ashby and falgout 1996 kollet and maxwell 2006 paws niu et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2020 shen et al 2013 shen and phanikumar 2010 mike she dhi 2004 and hgs therrien and sudicky 1996 to name only a few the factors that influence recharge such as the depth to groundwater precipitation vegetation and soil texture can be examined in detail using these models process based hydrologic models have been successfully used in the great lakes basin in the past xu et al 2021 niu et al 2014 shen et al 2013 for example previous studies in various watersheds in michigan niu et al 2014 qiu et al 2020 shen et al 2013 have demonstrated that the paws model performs well in terms of simulating the major components of the water budget for large and small watersheds few previous studies quantified the high resolution spatiotemporal dynamics of recharge in the great lakes region using integrated hydrologic models watershed models are generally calibrated to streamflows at gauging stations typically representing large rivers however surface water gauge density is a primary constraint on being able to characterize exchange fluxes the landscape variability in recharge is reflected by groundwater contribution to a large number of small streams some perennial and some intermittent and direct measurements of baseflows in these streams can be expected to provide valuable data to constrain surface water groundwater exchange fluxes and thus estimates of recharge the main objective of the paper was to estimate recharge in a snow dominated great lakes watershed to address questions related to the sustainability of groundwater resources in the region a novel aspect of the work is the use of a fully integrated hydrologic model to estimate recharge as previous efforts in the region used groundwater models in which recharge is an input parameter to be calibrated rather than model output another important aspect of our work is the use of measured baseflows in streams to constrain model estimates over space and time while measured long term average streamflows have been used to test integrated hydrologic models li et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge baseflow information as a function of time and space has not been used to constrain fully integrated hydrologic models in the context of recharge estimation in the region discharge data from low flow and intermittent streams across the watershed may be more relevant from the point of capturing the spatial dynamics of recharge than data from a few large rivers since streamflow in the summer i e dry season can be considered baseflow given that it approximately equals recharge arnold et al 2000 cherkauer and ansari 2005 gebert et al 2007 zomlot et al 2015 in addition to baseflow measurements multiple datasets were used to constrain the model including streamflows from usgs gauges groundwater heads from the mdeq wellogic database michigan department of environmental quality and modis et products from umt ntsg university of montana numerical terradynamic simulation group a third novel aspect of the work involves recharge estimation in a snow dominated area where winter hydrological processes contribute a significant fraction of recharge this is a topic of current interest as approaches based on the residual water balance method of estimating recharge lead to large uncertainties associated with estimating evapotranspiration and the storage and release of water from the snowpack in snow dominated regions e g see schilling et al 2021 our approach to quantify high resolution recharge dynamics in a heterogeneous watershed based on an integrated hydrologic model with explicit representation of winter hydrological processes constrained using baseflow measurements and multi source data has the potential for applications to larger watersheds and to other regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description our study area ottawa county michigan is located in the west central part of lower michigan fig 1 ottawa county relies heavily on its groundwater for drinking water and for agricultural and industrial uses declining static water levels in the glacial aquifer especially in the south central part of the county and increasing chloride concentrations in the deeper aquifer were reported curtis et al 2019 many small groundwater dependent streams in the region were found to have dried up during our fieldwork in the summer of 2015 understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of recharge therefore is of utmost importance for effective groundwater resource management in ottawa county although some estimates of recharge based on isotope and water balance methods are available for a nearby watershed delcore and larson 1987 and references therein detailed estimates of recharge based on process based models are not available the primary river in the county is the grand river which drains westward into lake michigan streams in the southeast region of the county drain into the rabbit river a tributary of the kalamazoo river which is to the south of ottawa county the area on the southwest side of the county is drained by the macatawa watershed the ottawa county modeling domain marked by a dark blue line in fig 1 represents a composite watershed and comprises parts of the lower grand river watershed the macatawa river watershed and the rabbit river watershed as shown in fig 1 the modeling domain is approximately 1900 km2 in size and the elevation within its boundary ranges from 175 m to 325 m lake michigan has a strong influence on the climate of ottawa county during winter time the massive lake effect leads to an average of 1800 mm of snowfall in ottawa county each year the county s average annual rainfall is around 900 mm www miottawa org the lake effect climate is essential to the county given that agricultural land accounts for about 50 of the county s total land mass and provides opportunities for diversified agricultural practices including fruit and horticultural crops census of agriculture 2017 before the development of the lumber industry in michigan the county was almost entirely covered by forests today large areas of forests can only be found along the lake michigan shoreline and along rivers and as scattered patches within farmland most wetlands in the county are located along the edges of the grand river and its tributaries and along the macatawa and pigeon rivers fig 2 presents the land use and land cover lulc for the entire modeling domain the geology in the study area includes a shallow aquifer of unconsolidated glacial deposits and a deeper aquifer consisting of fractured bedrock the glacial geology is strongly heterogeneous consisting of lacustrine coarse and fine deposits primarily of sand and gravel materials concentrated in the western and central portions of the study area glacial till poorly sorted material including boulders gravel and sand occurs throughout the study area but only visible at the surface in the southern and eastern portions of the study area glacial outwash sand occurs in the eastern portion of the study domain and sand dunes occur along the lake michigan shoreline farrand 1982 the primary bedrock units under the glacial deposits include the coldwater shale marshall formation and michigan formation westjohn and weaver 1998 mdnr 1999 the coldwater shale is a master confining unit within the michigan basin consisting of shale carbonate siltstone and sandstone the thickness of the coldwater shale in the study area is about 150 m stratigraphically the marshall formation with a thickness ranging approximately from 25 m to 50 m overlies the coldwater shale and is overlain by the michigan formation westjohn and weaver 1998 the michigan formation with a thickness ranging approximately from less than 50 m to more than 100 m is an interbedded sequence of shale limestone dolomite gypsum or anhydrite siltstone and sandstone in some places the michigan formation is a marginal aquifer but generally serves as a partially confining layer westjohn and weaver 1998 figs s1 and s2 in supplementary material present the geology maps of the study area geology of the michigan peninsula is reported in a number of earlier studies soller et al 2012 feinstein et al 2010 neff et al 2005 neff et al 2006 filtered geo tagged and extensively processed raw well data from the continously growing network of wells upwards of 500 000 in the michigan wellogic database mdeq 2014 provide quantitative information on aquifer materials and heterogeneity static water levels at the time of well installation and depth of wells this information was successfully used in a number of previous groundwater modeling studies in the region liao et al 2020 curtis et al 2018 2019 niu et al 2014 shen et al 2013 shen and phanikumar 2010 as well as in the present work additional details of the data sources used to represent subsurface features in the groundwater module are described in a later section 2 2 streamflow measurements two types of streamflow measurements were made in multiple shallow segments of the four major rivers grand river macatawa river pigeon river and rabbit river and 44 of their tributaries in 2015 1 one time synoptic streamflow sampling over a ten day period in late july and 2 time series sampling over six months from june to november 2015 a sontek riversurveyor m9 system www sontek com and the ott mf pro current flow meter ott hydromet usa www ott com were used to measure streamflows in many of the smaller streams in ottawa county fig s3 in supplementary material shows typical streams in the study area the riversurveyor m9 an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp was used to collect discharge data in streams with a depth of more than 20 cm the ott mf pro an electromagnetic current meter with a sensor head ideal for use in low flow environments was primarily used to collect the streamflow data in streams with a depth of less than 20 cm but a width of at least 1 5 m the one time streamflow sampling between july 22 and july 31 provided a snapshot of the spatial variations in streamflows of the 48 one time streamflow measurements 22 were collected with the adcp nine were collected with the current flow meter and 17 streams had a streamflow rate of zero sampling locations are available in table 2 the time series sampling data for the small streams were collected to provide 1 a validation dataset in the form of discharge as a function of time and 2 a basis for examining the model s performance for small streams in particular the ability to quantify exchange fluxes between groundwater and surface water domains time series streamflow data were collected at 14 locations in either monthly or biweekly intervals including 13 measurements collected with the adcp and one measurement collected with the current flow meter 2 3 the model the paws model incorporates overland flow channel flow soil water flow and groundwater flow that collectively cover the various flow paths after a rainfall event shen and phanikumar 2010 in addition paws clm provides detailed process based descriptions of vegetation dynamics niu et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2020 thornton and zimmermann 2007 and accounts for canopy interception snowpack biomass depression storage and evapotranspiration lawrence et al 2011 shen et al 2013 snowpack temperatures are updated by solving a heat conduction equation in the snicar snow ice and aerosol radiative model module of the ncar community land model clm linked to paws soil temperature is also governed by a heat conduction equation and soil freezing is calculated by a freezing point depression formulation the soil hydraulic conductivities are scaled down by an impermeability factor that depends on the fraction of ice in the soil within clm depending on the climate conditions snowpack calculation may take place and is quantified by the snow water equivalent swe and snow cover fraction snowmelt is added to the ponding layer with rainfall after taking out the canopy interception interception parameterizations in clm use the same parameters for all plant functional types pfts and are a source of uncertainty the details of the model conceptualization and coupling schemes can be found in shen and phanikumar 2010 and shen et al 2013 although recharge observations are rarely available recharge can be constrained based on an overall water budget through the surface water vadose zone and groundwater system while precipitation and et are the critical factors controlling recharge cao et al 2016 kendy et al 2003 tan et al 2014 recharge estimates are most reliable when the primary processes determining the water budget i e discharge and et are simulated accurately the water budget equation that guides the recharge evaluation is given by eq 1 1 r p e t q δ s where r l t is recharge p l t is precipitation which is the model input q l t is runoff et l t is evapotranspiration and δ s l t is the change in soil water storage the paws model directly computes r q et and δ s model performance on q and et is evaluated in section 3 based on field observations and remote sensing products respectively compared with the values of et and q the values of δ s are relatively small and some studies coelho et al 2017 mo et al 2009 chose not to use δ s in recharge and et estimations which means the recharge estimation is indirectly evaluated based only on the estimation of q and et in addition to using the storage term in the water balance equation we also assess the performance of the subsurface flow modules based on observed groundwater heads the ability of the model to simulate transient groundwater levels and storage changes is important from the point of recharge estimation although lack of information on water extracted from the aquifers due to agricultural municipal domestic and industrial water uses tend to make comparisons with transient groundwater levels challenging shen and phanikumar 2010 demonstrated the model s ability to simulate transient water level fluctuations by comparing model results with the experimental data of vauclin et al 1979 for a water table recharge problem niu 2013 and niu et al 2014 applied the paws model to the grand river watershed in michigan and provided evidence that the model can simulate soil moisture and temperature as well as transient groundwater levels and storage changes in the watershed after examining the sensitivity of model results kang 2018 to various grid sizes and the number of vertical layers we have applied the model at a 300 m 300 m spatial resolution across the entire study area with an hourly time step for weather vegetation evapotranspiration and groundwater simulations a time step of 2 min for channel flow and overland flow and adaptive time steps ranging from 2 min to 1 h for the vadose zone we aggregated the results to daily monthly and yearly time steps for further analysis twenty vertical layers were used to discretize the vadose zone with additional layers defined for the saturated groundwater domain additional details including details of how vertical exchange between aquifers is modeled are described in shen and phanikumar 2010 2 4 data sources a layer of relatively permeable glacial deposits overlies the bedrock within the study area this information was used to divide the groundwater model domain into two layers the upper glacial deposit layer is taken as the unconfined aquifer and the lower bedrock layer represents the confined aquifer with a layer of aquitard between the layers quantitative and qualitative information used with the groundwater model including static water levels well depths the aquifer type as well as a description of the aquifer material were extracted from the mdeq wellogic database the local hydraulic conductivities and thicknesses of the glacial drift layer are all spatially variable and were estimated using the wellogic database records for example borehole records in the wellogic database contain lithologic information and these data were combined with a stochastic approach transition probability geostatistics weissmann et al 1999 to characterize the heterogeneity of the glacial aquifer as described in liao et al 2020 the boundaries of the study area were constructed using small 12 digit watershed boundaries from usgs nhd and were assigned as no flow boundaries based on the assumption that groundwater flow across topographic divides is negligible as this may not represent the actual conditions model calibration against static water levels from wells far away from the boundaries was done honoring geology but allowing small variations of conductivity within the range of accepted values for the aquifer material to minimize the influence of the no groundwater flow assumption across topographic divides computed heads in the glacial aquifer were relatively insensitive to details of the bedrock aquifer therefore a deterministic approach was used to assign conductivity values in the bedrock aquifer based on the wellogic database described in liao et al 2020 and these values are consistent with estimates from earlier studies e g feinstein et al 2010 fig s4 in supplementary material presents the distribution of calibrated hydraulic conductivities in the glacial aquifer and additional details including maps of hydraulic conductivity in the glacial and bedrock aquifer are available in liao et al 2020 the western boundary condition was based on the long term water level of lake michigan on the eastern boundary we have used a boundary condition to capture the effects of upstream regional flow into the domain as described later the meteorological forcing data required for the model were daily rainfall snowfall maximum and minimum air temperature wind speed and relative humidity the values for each of these were obtained from observations collected at 29 global historical climatology network ghcn stations and provided by the national center for environmental information ncei formerly known as national climatic data center ncdc https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web as well as from three stations provided by the michigan automated weather station network mawn https enviroweather msu edu over the study period locations of the weather stations in fig 1 the 30 m resolution national elevation dataset ned from the usgs http nationalmap gov elevation html was processed to generate average cell elevation and lowland storage bottom elevation in the computational grid and also used to calculate the slope and surface runoff routing of the watersheds the national hydrography dataset nhd from the usgs http nhd usgs gov data html provided the channel flow network and stream properties fig 1 soils data were obtained from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo from the u s department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs the soils data were processed using the rosetta program to provide soil water retention and unsaturated conductivity information for the model schaap et al 2001 fig s5 in supplementary material shows the calibrated saturated hydraulic conductivity the lulc data used in the model are taken from the integrated forest monitoring assessment and prescription ifmap dataset fig 2 from the michigan department of natural resources mdnr ifmap was derived from the classification of landsat thematic mapper tm imagery for the period of 1997 to 2001 and has a 30 m spatial resolution the land use data were reclassified into several model classes called plant functional types pfts thornton and zimmermann 2007 based on the land use classification percentile values reported in previous studies jia et al 2001 lu and weng 2006 niu et al 2014 because the model cell size 300 300 m is coarser than the ifmap spatial resolution 30 m a model cell possesses a mixture of land use land cover types as a result three dominant pfts were recorded and used in the model cells the streamflow data for calibrating and validating the model were obtained from the usgs national water information system usgs nwis http waterdata usgs gov nwis rt and from the streamflow data collected during fieldwork to better constrain model parameters fig 1 there are four usgs gauging stations for the simulation period in the study domain table 1 of which three were used to calibrate and validate the model usgs04119400 usgs04108800 and usgs04108600 the other station usgs04119000 which is on the grand river and close to the eastern boundary of the modeling domain provided upstream inflow data for the model this boundary condition was required because the study area ottawa county represents a political boundary rather than a watershed boundary moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis global et mod16 products were compared both spatially and temporally with the et simulated by the paws model the mod16 global et datasets offer 1 km spatial resolution land surface et data for global vegetated land areas at 8 day monthly and annual intervals for the 2000 2014 period it should be noted that these datasets do not account for et from either open water or urban areas mod16 data were obtained from http www ntsg umt edu project modis mod16 php 2 5 simulation details daily streamflows for the period of 08 01 2009 12 31 2010 from the usgs gauges 041190400 04108800 and 04 108 600 were used to calibrate the paws model the parameters used are listed in table s1 supplementary material parameter optimization using the differential evolution de algorithm price et al 2005 was performed using computer resources at the high performance computing center hpcc at michigan state university we used the streamflows at these three usgs gauges from 01 01 2011 to 11 22 2015 to validate the model further the measured streamflows were used to validate model performance in small streams modis et products were used to validate simulated et in both space and time the comparison between the simulated and observed wellogic groundwater heads was further used to verify model performance for subsurface flow processes winter hydrologic processes including evapotranspiration stream and soil temperatures during winter as well as the storage and release of water in the snowpack are simulated by the model and detailed comparisons for winter months are included in earlier papers niu et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2020 therefore no additional comparisons are shown to further test the winter hydrology modules in the present paper krause et al 2005 recommend a combination of efficiency criteria for evaluating model performance accordingly the following metrics were selected for model assessments the coefficient of determination r 2 eq 2 the square root transformed nash metric rnash eq 3 shen and phanikumar 2010 the root mean square error rmse eq 4 and the percent bias eq 5 moriasi et al 2007 2 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 3 rnash 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o

value and n is the total number of observations rmse is used to estimate the difference between the measured and simulated values r 2 is defined as the squared value of the pearson s product moment correlation legates and mccabe 1999 representing the percentage of the data closest to the line of best fit typically values of r 2 greater than 0 5 are considered acceptable moriasi et al 2007 pbias values tend to show more variability with values summarized in moriasi et al 2007 falling in the range 155 6 47 18 for daily streamflows for the validation period positive values of pbias indicate underprediction bias zero being the optimal value the square root transformed nash rnash was employed as a second criterion because the nash coefficient tends to give too much importance to the peak flows while the rnash metric is designed to emphasize the baseflow shen and phanikumar 2010 in this study baseflow simulation is more important than capturing the peak flows because baseflow is the groundwater contribution to streams and is therefore associated with recharge 3 results and discussions 3 1 streamflow we compared the observed and simulated daily streamflows over a five year period at three usgs gauging stations fig 3 the coefficients of determination for all three stations were higher than 0 5 which are acceptable values the rnash values ranged from 0 4 to 0 98 the lowest rnash was observed at usgs 04108600 which might be related to the proximity of this station to the watershed boundary the rmse values were small compared to the streamflow values at these usgs gauges the comparison for usgs 04119400 grand river eastmanville shows better streamflow simulation at this station probably due to the proximity to usgs 04119000 which provided upstream inflow at the intersection of grand river and the watershed boundary all the statistics indicate that the model simulated streamflows reasonably well especially during the low flow periods of 2011 2015 a close up view in fig 3 b presents the comparisons during low flow periods the mismatches in the hydrograph are primarily due to the underestimation of streamflow peaks in the spring an examination of the weather records shows that the precipitation values are low for the underestimated peak periods indicating that precipitation is not the direct cause of high streamflows further it is also important to consider that the study area is affected by heavy lake effect snow during the winter so these mismatches may be correlated with the effects of melting snow and errors and uncertainties associated with measurement as well as model descriptions of snow processes a close inspection of fig 3 a b shows that the simulated streamflow at usgs 04108800 macatawa river zeeland and usgs 04108600 rabbit river at hopkins underestimated the peaks almost every spring during the simulation period because the lake effect snow was severe at this location which is close to lake michigan there are two possible reasons for the uncertainties during snowmelt periods 1 the uncertainty of the measured snowfall depth induced by the measurement methods at the weather stations and 2 the deficiency of the snow energy balance routine of the current clm model niu et al 2014 the snowmelt events are primarily responsible for reducing the model performance metrics relatively low r2 rnash values and large pbias values at these stations the time series comparisons between the simulated and field measured streamflows were analyzed and the comparisons at six sampling locations scattered throughout the watershed are presented in fig 4 the gps coordinates of the sampling locations are presented in table 2 as the discharge values in these small streams were small 0 10 m3 s the data were plotted on a logarithmic scale to examine the streamflows closely a value of 0 1 m3 s was added to both simulated and measured data at locations m22 and m38 to facilitate plotting in logarithmic scale due to the zero or near zero values for some simulation periods fig s6 in supplementary material shows the comparison on a linear scale overall the simulated streamflows were in good agreement with the measured streamflows at these sampling locations a one time synoptic sampling was performed in july 2015 to quantify the spatial variations in baseflows as the et values were high in the summer the measured and simulated streamflow values are summarized in table 3 the simulated streamflow values in table 3 closely agree with measured data r2 0 81 rmse 0 031 pbias 17 9 note that pbias does not improve when zero streamflow values are correctly simulated the results of the time series streamflow sampling data and the one time spatial streamflow data summarized in table 3 indicate that the model 1 captures baseflow and 2 accurately simulates recharge because baseflow can be considered a proxy for recharge arnold et al 2000 risser et al 2005 zomlot et al 2015 3 2 evapotranspiration to validate the simulated et temporally and spatially we used the monthly and yearly modis et products over the four year period of 2011 2014 the comparison between the 4 year average annual modis and the simulated et of the modeling domain is presented in fig 5 the simulated et has a spatial resolution of 300 m and resolves finer details than the modis et with a cell size of 1 km for the simulated et the highest values occurred along the major rivers and in the wetlands while the lowest values were found in urban areas the lower spatial variability in the modis et values compared with those of the simulated et can be attributed to several sources including the smoothing effects of 1 the coarser spatial resolution of the modis data and 2 the temporal compositing of the modis et products moreover modis et products do not include et from open water where et values are the highest in our model nor is et from urban areas included where our model estimates the lowest values mu et al 2013 the white areas in the modis et map in fig 5 represent the urban areas nevertheless the overall spatial pattern of the simulated average annual et is similar to that of the average annual modis et but both the range and the spatial variability of the simulated values are greater in the study area two regions showed significant differences in their average annual et values first the northeast part of the modeling domain showed higher average annual simulated et relative to modis et values are high due to the high soil moisture associated with saturation excess in the lowland foothill region ivanov et al 2004 the riparian forest associated with rogue river and other contiguous forest cover in the northeast region lead to high et values the other region that showed significant difference in its average annual et values from the modis et is in central ottawa county where the values of precipitation were higher than the values in the surrounding areas and both overhead irrigation of field crops and trickle irrigation of horticultural crops are common while the simulated et values are high in most cells in this area the modis et has high values only in some cells with a time series et constraint the uncertainty of the recharge estimation decreases compared to when a constraint of this nature is not included in the model xie et al 2018 thus a comparison between the simulated and modis monthly et was examined in this study we aggregated the time series of the daily simulated et output into average monthly simulated et in order to compare with the monthly modis et products fig 6 the simulated monthly et values match the modis monthly et values reasonably well the r2 value for the 4 year comparison is 0 79 as expected the highest value for both the simulated and the modis monthly et occurred during the summer months and the lowest values accrued during the winter months the low et values shown for the summer of 2012 are due to the drought that year one primary reason for the differences between the simulated et and the modis et may be due to the different et algorithms used in paws clm and modis et paws clm uses a resistance approach to simulate et based on the two big leaf model dai et al 2004 whereas modis et is is based on a revised penman monteith formulation mu et al 2011 in paws clm snowmelt is added to rainfall after canopy interception is taken out but snowpack is not considered in the modis et calculation the snowpack hydrological processes in paws may have contributed to the larger et during spring in this heavy lake effect snow region a second reason mentioned earlier is that the modis et products do not account for et from either open water or urban areas and these are simulated by paws 3 3 groundwater heads we derived the observed groundwater head data from the logs of over 400 water wells installed in the unconfined aquifer within ottawa county the estimated groundwater heads were extracted for the computational cells where the wells were located fig 7 presents the comparison between the estimated and the observed groundwater heads in distinct colors for different years against the reference 1 1 line the overall r2 value is 0 88 indicating a good match both in space and time given the close match between the simulated and the wellogic head data the paws model provides good estimates of the groundwater heads for this study based on the comparisons of streamflow evapotranspiration and groundwater heads between our model results and data from various sources we conclude that the paws model performed well at a finer resolution of 300 m and daily temporal resolution needed to capture the temporal dynamics of various hydrologic processes as is common elsewhere there are no observed recharge data covering the modeling domain at sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to allow a direct comparison with model results since available data from different sources have different resolutions the model can serve as a tool to constrain key processes by integrating data across scales and to provide recharge estimates within the uncertainties of the data and the modeling in the following sections we present the simulated recharge results to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics 3 4 spatial variation in recharge fig 8 shows the spatial patterns of the annual recharge over the four year period of 2011 2014 recharge values vary from year to year primarily responding to climatic factors the recharge values in the drought year of 2012 are generally low the spatial distributions of the simulated recharge followed the general hydrogeological pattern whereby high and low recharge values occurred at high and low elevations respectively the opposite relationship was found between the spatial patterns of et and recharge except for urban areas where both et and recharge values are low the primary recharge areas for the glacial aquifer occurred in the northeastern and southeastern parts of the county where the primary land use is agriculture and elevations are high the central area of the county showed low recharge values possibly for two main reasons first high et values were found in this area second the elevation in this area is relatively low the groundwater replenished by recharge in the northeastern region of the county discharged to the grand river while recharge in the southeastern area of the county mainly discharged to the rabbit river as a result these primary recharge areas did not contribute much groundwater into the central part of the county which has experienced increased but unsustainable groundwater use the unexpected high values of recharge along the northeastern boundary of the computational domain are attributed to boundary issues since the modeling domain is composed of surface watersheds that in this area might not match well with the groundwatersheds such conditions would allow groundwater flow from outside of the model domain without reflecting this in the model parameters 3 5 temporal dynamics of recharge recharge is a function of precipitation land use types soil types topography and the spatiotemporal co occurrence of these factors the non linear relationships between recharge and these climatic and physical factors are complex fig 9 presents the monthly dynamics of recharge with different types of land uses such that each panel in the figure represents the recharge dynamics in a grid cell with one dominant land use e g the panel for agricultural land has recharge results coming from a grid cell with more than 90 of the cell covering agricultural land use although a few other land uses may be present the daily time series data that formed the basis for the monthly data in fig 9 are available in the supplementary material as fig s6 in this study each cell in the lulc map consists of three dominant lulc types expressed as a percentage soybean corn broadleaf forest and needleleaf forest are the dominant land types in the selected cells for fig 9 three major soil types sand clay loam and loam were mapped throughout the area nrcs usda the soils beneath the soybean land and broadleaf forest land for the selected cells were mostly sandy whereas the corn and needleleaf forest cells were underlain mainly by clay loam in agricultural lands soybean and corn figs 9a and b and s6a and b the simulated monthly recharge generally had a delayed response to the monthly precipitation and increased after intense precipitation events during the simulation period except for the drought year of 2012 fig 9a and b precipitation for the year 2012 was well below average which had a significant impact on reducing the recharge in the soybean land with sandy soil than in the corn land with clay loam soil indicating that recharge in sandy soil was more responsive to precipitation also high et values are more often observed in sandy soils the fluctuation of the monthly recharge values was greater in the forested land than in agricultural land further the monthly recharge values in the forested land were low especially in 2012 due to a period of drought that took place from late spring to fall the temporal fluctuation of recharge in forested land may be partially due to the fluctuations in et which consumed a large portion of the precipitation about 60 in this study area in the agricultural land the temporal pattern of et is primarily affected by precipitation and the length of the growing season et in the forested land is more dependent on precipitation given that forests especially broadleaf deciduous forests do not have a controlled growing season as farmlands do therefore we argue that the temporal fluctuation of et is correlated to the temporal fluctuation of recharge in the forested land and is also affected by the within cell proportion of land covers the daily time series results presented in fig s7 with units of mm day show that recharge was continuous in agricultural lands while it was intermittent in forested lands with both recharge and discharge occurring at different times within the same grid cell since discharge is essentially negative recharge these events show up as gaps in a semi log plot of recharge versus time fig s7 supplementary material these gaps in recharge are one reason why forested lands have lower recharge on average compared to agricultural lands although the magnitudes of individual recharge events in forested lands tend to be higher major recharge pulses occurred in spring due to snowmelt in summer and fall and sometimes in late fall but there is considerable variability from year to year depending on the dominant land use and climate the daily recharge values for soybean and corn cells range from 0 to 5 mm day values in forested cells are characterized by more fluctuations probably due to larger biomass but primarily fall in the range from 0 to 5 mm day except for some days when the values are as high as 20 mm day fig 10 presents the time series of the average monthly recharge for the period of september 2011 september 2015 the cycle of the monthly recharge dynamics is responsive to the cycle of a hydrological year however the temporal distribution of the average monthly recharge for each hydrological year was different for example extremely high precipitation values occurred in april 2013 which contributed to the peak values of recharge peak values of recharge occurred in the winters of 2012 and 2015 but were spread across the fall of 2013 and the winter spring of 2014 3 6 recharge dynamics for various lulc during wet and drought years boxplots of the annual recharge for four major land use types were created for the drought year of 2012 and the wet year of 2014 to examine the impact of lulc on recharge during these years fig 11 as noted earlier three dominant pfts were modeled in each cell 300 m 300 m in this study for example one cell might be composed of 70 of soybean 20 of corn and 10 of the broadleaf forest in the boxplots the x axis represents the percentage of one dominant lulc type in a cell taking soybean as an example 10 on the x axis means that the cells that contributed to the box plot contain between 0 and 10 of soybean and 20 means that soybean fraction was between 10 and 20 of the cell and so on in each box the central horizontal line represents the median and the bottom and top of the vertical bars indicate the first and third quartile metrics respectively the outliers are plotted individually using a symbol it is evident from fig 11 that the median values of recharge increased when the percentage of the soybean and corn land types in the cells increased for both the drought year of 2012 and the wet year of 2014 conversely the median values of recharge decreased when the cover percentages of the broadleaf and impervious land types in the cells increased for both years the recharge values are lower in the cells with a larger proportion of forested land types because the deep root system in the forested land leads to a high et value and canopy interception would reduce the amount of water reaching the ground especially for forests at full canopy in the summer changes in the median recharge values at different landcover percentages are similar in both dry and wet years for all four landcover types but the recharge values for 2014 are higher than those for 2012 4 conclusions in this paper we explored the dynamics of recharge at a fine spatiotemporal resolution 300 m resolution daily interval in a composite area encompassing multiple watersheds in the great lakes region using a process based hydrologic model we used streamflow data from three usgs gauges and from a number of small streams to test model performance over time and space we also used observed groundwater head data and modis et products to test model performance our results show that model estimates are in good agreement with observations of the major hydrologic components including streamflow groundwater and et model outputs of daily recharge for the ottawa county were aggregated to monthly average values for further analysis the spatial variation of recharge shows that the primary recharge areas to the glacial aquifer do not contribute much groundwater to the central part of the county which has experienced significant increase in groundwater use the temporal dynamics of the monthly recharge show that recharge rates are dependent on the year to year climatic variations high resolution recharge estimates from this study are expected to aid groundwater modeling studies to address questions of aquifer sustainability while this study was conducted in the ottawa county michigan the model is capable of simulating surface hydrological fluxes accurately and thus can be applied to other regions and over larger areas for recharge estimation the modeling approach can also be used in future climate change
