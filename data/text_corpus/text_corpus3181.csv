15905,chlorine uv254 and ozone are three typical processes commonly used for wastewater disinfection which could change the photoreactivity of dissolved organic matter dom in effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps the photoinduced reactive species rs from dom primarily including the excited triplet state of dom 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical oh play important roles in the attenuation of contaminants however the effect of disinfection processes on the photosensitized degradation of contaminants is poorly understood this paper presents the first evidence that 3dom 1o2 and oh interaction with three typical contaminants diphenhydramine cimetidine and n n diethyl m toluamide deet was largely impacted by dom after disinfection the results of electron spin resonance esr spectrometry and laser flash photolysis lfp experiments demonstrated that the chlorination increased the formation rate of 3dom and 1o2 while uv254 irradiation and ozonation decreased the formation rate of these rs all these three disinfection processes promoted the photoproduction of oh and increased the photodegradation rate constants k obs of deet by 26 361 the k obs of diphenhydramine cimetidine and deet correlated positively with the formation rate of 3dom 1o2 and oh respectively the bimolecular reaction rate constant of 3dom with diphenhydramine increased by 41 after chlorination these findings suggest that disinfection processes altered the photogeneration of rs from dom which significantly impacts the fate of trace pollutants in aquatic environments graphical abstract image

wwtps disinfection is an indispensable process for inactivating harmful pathogens and protecting public health before the effluents are discharged into receiving waters shannon et al 2008 sodium hypochlorite ultraviolet uv254 irradiation and ozone disinfection are three typical processes commonly used for wastewater disinfection chlorine and ozone are the most widely used disinfectants in water treatment since the 19th century and are still used in over 80 of public water utilities saboe et al 2021 uv254 disinfection has recently been recommended as a substitute for chemical additives e g chlorine and ozone due to minimal production of disinfection by products dbps and chemical residues and has been used for water disinfection in more than 7000 wwtps in the world song et al 2016 therefore it is of great significance to investigate the effect of disinfection on the environmental behavior of wastewater effluent and receiving waters with the continued growth of the population the processing capacity of wwtps significantly increases and a huge amount of wastewater effluent is discharged into natural waters which introduces effluent organic matter efom a main component of dissolved organic matter dom of effluent receiving waters it is well known that dom is photochemically excited to the singlet state 1dom upon solar irradiation which undergoes radiative decay fluorescence or intersystem crossings to the triplet excited state 3dom and further transfers energy to dissolved oxygen to generate singlet oxygen 1o2 mcneill and canonica 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 the excited states of dom can also participate in electron transfer reactions to form hydroxyl radical oh sharpless and blough 2014 these reactive species play major roles in the degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater effluents and receiving waters wenk et al 2021 it has been reported that 3dom has a high one electron reduction potential 1 4 1 9 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she mcneill and canonica 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 as a result 3dom primarily acts as a potent oxidant of organic contaminants with electron donating functional groups such as amines and phenols chen et al 2009 pan et al 2020 pozdnyakov et al 2020 for the organic contaminants which are difficultly oxidized by 3dom the 1o2 and oh can selectively and non selectively attack target compounds to remove them in aquatic environments in the process of disinfection dom is a significant sink for chemical oxidants e g chlorine and ozone and susceptible to light e g uv254 irradiation due to the great content of chromophores the phenolic and hydroquinone moieties prefer to react with chlorine and ozone via electrophilic substitution and electrophilic addition respectively to form quinone like moieties or ring cleavage products leresche et al 2019 wan et al 2021a wenk et al 2013a the uv254 irradiation also leads to an increase of oxygenated functional groups e g carboxylic and phenolic groups by photo oxidants such as 1o2 and oh generated upon irradiation lester et al 2013 wu et al 2020 the transformation of functional groups in dom changes the photoreactivity of dom for example chlorination enhanced the oxidation capacity of 3dom wan et al 2021a which is expected to promote the triplet induced oxidation of contaminants via single electron transfer processes in aquatic environments owing to the formation of quinone like moieties upon chlorination and ozonation an increase in quantum yields of both 1o2 and oh were observed leresche et al 2021 2019 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 wan et al 2021a besides the uv254 disinfection caused a reduction of 3dom and 1o2 whereas oh generation was promoted due to the increase of functional groups e g carboxylate substituted phenols favorable for oh formation sun et al 2015 wan et al 2020a thus the disinfection processes and the residual disinfectants will change the photoproduction of reactive species from dom of wastewater effluent and effluent receiving waters which consequently impact the photochemical fate of organic contaminants to our best knowledge the variation of contaminants photodegradation and the related mechanism in wastewater effluent after different disinfection processes are not well understood the main purposes of this work include i investigating the photogeneration of 3dom 1o2 and oh from efom as well as humic substances hs before and after disinfection using electron spin resonance esr spectrometry ii revealing the relationship of reactive species formation to the optical property changes of dom iii evaluating the effect of dom disinfection on the photodegradation of organic contaminants typically including cimetidine diphenhydramine and n n diethyl m toluamide deet iv determining the second order reaction rate constants of contaminants with 3dom before and after disinfection using laser flash photolysis lfp and elucidating the underlying mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials diphenhydramine 99 was purchased from acros cimetidine 99 deet 98 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp 98 furfuryl alcohol ffa 98 terephthalate tpa 99 potassium sorbate 99 isopropanol 99 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp 98 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 97 were purchased from sigma aldrich usa and used as received the wastewater ww effluent was obtained from a municipal sewage plant located in hubei province china which treat domestic sewage of wuhan city using an anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o system collected samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membranes stored in the dark and kept at 4 c before the experiments efom was isolated by a solid phase extraction process using ppl cartridges agilent technologies wan et al 2020a 2019 humic substances hs typically including fulvic acid fa and humic acid ha were purchased from changsheng corporation henan china and sigma aldrich respectively they were purified according to the method widely accepted by the international humic substances society ihss the elemental composition and concentration of ions in the dom samples are shown in table s1 all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm from a millipore milli q system 2 2 disinfection process the chlorination experiments were initiated by adding naclo 5 free available chlorine sigma aldrich stock solution to the dom solutions 5 0 mgc l 1 ph 8 0 under magnetic stirring the residual chlorine was measured using the dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine hach usa colorimetric method rice et al 2017 the uv254 disinfection experiments were performed using a custom made lightbox equipped with a 23 w low pressure hg lamp gph 436t5l 4 philips netherlands to generate quasi parallel uv at the wavelength 254 nm the ozonation experiments were performed in a polymethyl methacrylate reactor using an ozone generator cf 3 g 005g qingdao guolin industry corporation china to produce ozone from oxygen the detailed procedures of disinfection experiments are presented in text s1 the dose of chlorine uv254 and ozone was 5 0 mg l 1 1 5 j cm 2 and 5 0 mg l 1 respectively the residual chlorine 0 05 mg l 1 and ozone 0 05 mg l 1 after disinfection were negligible it should be noted that the uv254 disinfection was static in our experiments which was different from the continuous process in wwtps thus the nominal uv254 dose used here was higher than that in practical disinfection besides previous studies indicated that uv doses typically applied for disinfection 30 200 mj cm 2 are not sufficient and an increase in uv dose was suggested to be applied in wwtps bu et al 2018 paredes et al 2018 therefore we used a relatively higher uv254 dose to have a better understanding of the variation of photophysical and photochemical properties of dom 2 3 photochemical experiments the photogeneration of 3dom 1o2 and oh was quantified using isolated dom solutions and whole wastewater effluent before and after disinfection under simulated sunlight irradiation in a 40 ml capped cylindrical pyrex vessel 20 mm inner diameter containing 20 ml of solution the light source was a 150 w xenon lamp with a 300 nm cutoff filter as spectral irradiance shown in fig s1 which has been widely used to simulate sunlight ma et al 2020 wan et al 2019 the total photon irradiance in the range of 290 400 nm e 0 p tot 3 71 10 8 einstein cm 2 s 1 was estimated by a p nitroanisole pyridine pna pyr actinometer see details in text s2 and fig s2 which was widely used in determining the light intensity of similar system berg et al 2019 ma et al 2020 recent works indicated that 290 600 nm is more appropriate for the calculation of quantum yields o connor et al 2019 ossola et al 2021 however in our system light wavelength above 400 nm contributed little to the formation of reactive species text s2 which was consistent with previous studies and likely attributed to the low photoreactivity of high molecular weight dom that preferentially absorbed longer wavelengths marchisio et al 2015 mopper and zhou 1990 thus we use a range of 290 400 nm for light absorbance which yielded an estimate of the rate of light absorption of the dom samples and thus allowed the estimation of quantum yields laszakovits et al 2017 the temperature of the experimental solutions was maintained at 22 1 c by a temperature control unit the dissolved oxygen was measured using an orion star a113 do meter thermo scientific and remained constant 251 10 μm during the irradiation tmp ffa and tpa were used to measure the formation rate and apparent quantum yield φ of 3dom 1o2 and oh respectively since these probes have been widely employed in dom photochemical reactivity studies page et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 more experimental details are provided in text s3 photodegradation rate constants of cimetidine diphenhydramine and deet were quantified in the dom samples solutions 10 0 μm of each compound were prepared in each dom sample from 5 0 mm stock aqueous solutions quenching experiments were performed with the addition of sorbate 3 0 mm ffa 5 0 mm and isopropanol 10 0 mm to examine the roles of high energy 3dom 200 kj mol 1 1o2 and oh in contaminant degradation respectively berg et al 2019 moor et al 2019 additional experiments were also conducted in a nitrogen purged solution dissolved oxygen 15 μm to evaluate the influence of o2 on photodegradation the bimolecular reaction rate constants of each contaminant with 1o2 and oh were determined by competition kinetics using ffa and acetophenone as reference compounds respectively see detailed procedures in text s4 three replicates were included for all photochemical experiments 2 4 instrumental analyses the uv vis absorption spectra were obtained by an evolution 201 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific total organic carbon toc was measured using a multi n c 2100 toc analyzer analytik jena germany the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy of the samples was performed using a hitachi f 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer japan the concentrations of chemical probes tmp and ffa and contaminants were measured using high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a uv absorbance detector and an apollo c18 column 5 μm 250 mm 4 6 mm the hplc parameters are given in table s2 the detection of 1o2 and oh was also performed by electron spin resonance esr spectrometry bruker emxnano germany using temp and dmpo as spin trapping agents respectively esr spectrometer was set as follows center field 3416 45 g sweep width 100 00 g modulation amplitude 1 000 g microwave power 20 mw sweep time 30 s number of scans 3 the lfp experiments were carried out using the third harmonic 355 nm of an nd yag laser sli 10 continuum electro optics inc usa as an excitation source as described in previous studies makunina et al 2015 yurkova et al 2013 a 150 w xenon lamp was adopted as the probe light 3 results and discussion 3 1 photophysical properties of dom as shown in table s3 there was no significant decrease in the toc concentrations of dom after chlorination 3 uv254 irradiation 9 and ozonation 4 indicating these three disinfection processes caused little mineralization of dom fig s3 illustrates the uv vis absorption spectra and variation of the uv vis absorbance absuntreated abstreated after disinfection of dom samples the disinfection caused a decrease in the absorbance of all the tested dom samples the absolute decrease in absorption occurred mainly in the uv region which was likely ascribed to the destruction of aromatic structures the variation of optical properties i e e2 e3 ratios suva254 and spectral slope see calculation details in text s5 of the dom after disinfection was characterized based on uv vis spectra fig s3 as shown in table s3 for all the tested dom samples disinfection caused a decrease of suva254 decreased by 4 44 and an increase in both e2 e3 ratios increased by 3 50 and spectral slopes s increased by 3 36 indicating a decrease in aromaticity and molecular weight of the treated dom samples which is consistent with previous studies on the chlorination uv254 irradiation and ozonation of dom remucal et al 2020 wenk et al 2013a wu et al 2020 the fluorescence spectra of dom showed typical eem signatures as fulvic like ex 275 nm em 525 nm humic like ex 270 nm em 445 nm and protein like ex 280 nm em 340 nm components for fa ha and efom respectively fig s4 after disinfection the eem peak position had little change whereas the fluorescence intensity was reduced for all the dom samples fig s4 the specific fluorescence sf decreased by 10 31 33 60 and 30 60 for dom samples after chlorination uv254 irradiation and ozonation respectively table s3 besides after disinfection the fluorescence index fi value for fa and ha samples increased by 7 29 while a decrease in fi value decreased by 7 was observed for efom table s3 indicating the relative contribution of microbial sources to the efom decreased 3 2 photogeneration of reactive species the transformation of probe molecules tmp ffa and tpa in the dom solutions was shown in figs s5 s7 the measured formation rate and apparent quantum yield of 3dom 1o2 and oh for isolated dom samples and whole wastewater effluent before and after disinfection was presented in table 1 furthermore the formation of 1o2 and oh was captured by temp and dmpo using esr spin trap experiments with triplet peaks of equal intensity and quartet peaks of intensity ratio 1 2 2 1 of the esr spectra respectively fig 1 the esr signals of 1o2 and oh matched well with their formation rates detected by ffa and tpa respectively table 1 the formation rate of 3dom and 1o2 increased after chlorination while decreasing after uv254 irradiation and ozonation for all the tested dom samples since 3dom is a precursor for 1o2 the measured φ1o2 1 5 10 2 follows the same trends as φ3dom 1 7 12 8 for all the dom samples before and after disinfection r2 0 95 fig 2 a since o2 can react with almost total 3dom pool 94 kj mol 1 via energy transfer to generate 1o2 while tmp is oxidized only by 3dom with one electron reduction potentials higher than 1 22 v vs she via electron transfer tmp samples a smaller fraction of 3dom than ground state o2 which is corresponding to the x intercept of the fitting line in fig 2a the apparent triplet quantum yield was increased by 31 130 after chlorination for all the tested dom samples which is consistent with our previous study wan et al 2021a as for dom samples after uv254 irradiation and ozonation the values of φ3dom showed different trends between hs and efom table 1 both uv254 irradiation and ozonation caused a decrease in the quantum yields of 3dom and 1o2 for fa and ha in contrast φ3dom and φ1o2 increased for efom it is well known that quinones and aromatic ketones are two typical sources of 3dom mcneill and canonica 2016 zhou et al 2017 the enhanced formation of 3dom after chlorination was likely attributed to the oxidation of phenolic and hydroquinone moieties to quinone like moieties by chlorine wenk et al 2013a nevertheless as an oxidant o3 was more likely to react with dom via electrophilic addition of one or two oxygen atoms to aromatic moieties followed by ring cleavage and thus inhibited the formation of 3dom maizel et al 2017 remucal et al 2020 wenk et al 2013a besides the uv254 irradiation would increase the relative contents of carboxylic and phenolic groups of dom also leading to a lower formation rate of 3dom wu et al 2020 thus the apparent triplet quantum yield was decreased by 7 38 after uv254 irradiation and ozonation for fa and ha table 1 the increase of φ3dom for efom was ascribed to the complex components of efom previous studies have demonstrated that the high protein like fraction mainly proteins and peptides of efom caused the self quenching of 3efom bodhipaksha et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 as mentioned above the protein like components of efom were destroyed after uv254 irradiation and ozonation which reduced its self quenching effect therefore despite the loss of 3dom sources e g quinones and aromatic ketones after uv254 irradiation and ozonation the apparent triplet quantum yield increased for efom it should be noted that the values of φ3dom and φ1o2 observed for the whole wastewater effluent were higher than that of the isolated efom table 1 likely due to the incomplete extraction of dom from wastewater effluent via solid phase extraction process with ppl cartridges besides the presence of inorganic salts in the effluent table s1 could also bring together secondary radicals such as cl and so4 fang et al 2013 parker and mitch 2016 under irradiation leading to the further decomposition of the probes zhou et al 2017 unlike 3dom and 1o2 the measured formation rate and quantum yield of oh increased after disinfection in all cases table 1 which is in agreement with previous studies leresche et al 2021 wan et al 2021a 2020a it is known that the sources of oh in sunlit natural waters include nitrate nitrite photolysis fenton fenton like reactions and photoreactions of dom mopper and zhou 1990 vione et al 2014 2006 for the isolated dom samples the concentrations of iron and nitrite were negligible see table s1 and our previous studies which excluded their roles as sources of oh wan et al 2021a 2020a thus the dom is responsible for the observed oh as shown in fig 2b φ oh does not correlate significantly with φ3dom for the tested dom samples r2 0 57 indicating that the 3dom is not a major precursor for oh formation other potential precursors include 1dom charge transfer states dom or one electron oxidizing intermediates dom could also lead to oh formation dalrymple et al 2010 mckay et al 2016 in terms of the molecular composition of dom disinfection transformed dom into more oxygenated formulas remucal et al 2020 wenk et al 2013a wu et al 2020 which were reported to have high efficiency at forming oh berg et al 2019 besides for the whole wastewater effluent there was a high level of nitrate 31 25 mg l 1 which contributed to a significant photoproduction of oh 3 10 7 m oh mno3 1 s 1 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 vione et al 2006 as a result the φ oh for the whole wastewater effluent was about 10 times as much as efom table 1 the e2 e3 ratio is a well established predictor of reactive species yields from dom bodhipaksha et al 2015 maizel et al 2017 mckay et al 2017 it has been reported that the e2 e3 ratio is typically positively correlated with φ1o2 chen et al 2020 mckay et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 however in this study although the directions of the trends in φ1o2 with e2 e3 agree with previous documents their relationship was not significant r2 0 58 fig 2c for the tested dom samples before and after disinfection this suggests that disinfection significantly altered the optical properties of dom and weakened the established correlations in the case of φ oh a significant positive correlation between φ oh and e2 e3 was observed within our data r2 0 88 fig 2d since e2 e3 is an inverse proxy for molecular weight as discussed above chen et al 2020 mccabe and arnold 2017 the result suggested that disinfection led dom to yield low apparent molecular weight products which was concluded to have more efficient oh formation ability lee et al 2013 mckay et al 2017 2016 wan et al 2020a 3 3 photodegradation of organic contaminants the disinfection processes altered the photoinduced generation of reactive species from dom which was expected to significantly impact the fate of trace pollutants in wastewater effluent and natural waters three target contaminants namely cimetidine diphenhydramine and deet see chemical properties in table s4 primarily undergo indirect photolysis in the isolated dom solutions and whole wastewater effluent under simulated sunlight fig s8 the photodegradation rate constants k obs of these contaminants vary among the untreated dom samples with 0 17 3 22 h 1 0 026 0 075 h 1 and 0 002 0 018 h 1 for cimetidine diphenhydramine and deet respectively fig 3 a c the disinfection processes significantly changed the k obs of the three contaminants for cimetidine and diphenhydramine the values of k obs were increased by 15 84 for all the tested dom samples after chlorination while decreased by 16 70 and 15 68 after uv254 irradiation and ozonation respectively except for the photodegradation of diphenhydramine in the whole wastewater effluent the uv254 irradiation and ozonation of the whole wastewater effluent increased the k obs of diphenhydramine by 91 and 15 respectively fig 3b for deet the three disinfection processes increased the values of k obs by 26 361 for all the tested dom samples fig 3c in order to examine the mechanism of the indirect photodegradation of contaminants the roles of 3dom 1o2 and oh were examined by adding their quenchers sorbate ffa and isopropanol respectively figs s9 s11 for cimetidine the addition of ffa and sorbate lowered the k obs by approximately 91 and 38 respectively while the addition of isopropanol had no effect on all the tested samples fig s9 since 1o2 is produced via energy transfer from 3dom to dissolved oxygen the decreased photodegradation rate of cimetidine in both the presence of ffa and sorbate indicated that cimetidine belongs to a 1o2 dominated degradation compound which is consistent with previous findings bodhipaksha et al 2017 latch et al 2003 the involvement of 1o2 was further confirmed by the n2 purged experiments where the k obs decreased by more than 90 in the absence of dissolved oxygen fig s12a besides the 1o2 reaction rate constant for cimetidine was determined to be 2 7 108 m 1 s 1 table 2 which is consistent with the previous report 2 5 3 3 108 m 1 s 1 and higher than that for ffa 1 0 108 m 1 s 1 appiani et al 2017 latch et al 2003 thus cimetidine was primarily degraded by reaction with 1o2 in all the dom samples as shown in fig 3d a positive correlation between the k obs of cimetidine and r 1o2 was observed for all the tested samples r2 0 98 therefore the disinfection of dom influenced the generation of 1o2 and further impacted the photodegradation of cimetidine for diphenhydramine the addition of ffa showed a negligible effect on its photodegradation fig s10 which is corresponding to the insignificant rate constant between diphenhydramine and 1o2 table 2 the addition of the triplet quencher sorbate significantly suppressed the diphenhydramine photodegradation by 82 and the n2 sparging deoxygenation led to a pronounced increase of the k obs by 17 times on average in all cases fig s10 indicating that 3dom played a major role in the photodegradation of diphenhydramine chen et al 2009 besides the addition of isopropanol did not suppress the depletion of diphenhydramine in the isolated dom solutions whereas quenched about 36 of the diphenhydramine degradation in whole wastewater effluent fig s10 suggesting oh also participated in the diphenhydramine degradation considering the higher r oh in whole wastewater effluent 1 3 2 2 10 9 m s 1 table 1 and the high reaction rate constant between diphenhydramine and oh 6 92 109 m 1 s 1 table 2 the enhanced photodegradation of diphenhydramine in whole wastewater effluent after uv254 irradiation and ozonation fig 3b was mainly attributed to the stronger oh production table 1 except for the data in whole wastewater effluent k obs of diphenhydramine correlated positively with r 3dom r2 0 93 fig 3e indicating that the photogeneration of 3dom was changed in the isolated dom solutions after disinfection and thus affected the photodegradation of diphenhydramine for deet its photodegradation rate constant decreased by approximately 89 33 and 62 on average with the addition of isopropanol ffa and sorbate respectively fig s11 the significant decrease of k obs in the presence of isopropanol indicated that oh plays a vital role in the photodegradation of deet owing to the insignificant rate constant between deet and 1o2 table 2 the inhibition of ffa on the photodegradation of deet was likely due to the quenching effect of oh by ffa since the values of r 1o2 10 7 m s 1 were much higher than r oh 10 10 m s 1 table 1 the ffa mainly acted as a 1o2 quencher in our system the reduction of deet degradation after the addition of sorbate suggested that 3dom might be involved in the reaction however in contrast to diphenhydramine fig s10 the values of k obs for deet decreased by 40 under anoxic conditions fig s12b suggesting that 3dom has little effect on the photodegradation of deet despite the lifetime of triplets was much longer in the absence of o2 erickson et al 2018 moor et al 2019 besides we have calculated the one electron oxidation potential e ppcp ppcp of deet 1 86 v vs she table s4 which is generally higher than the one electron reduction potential of 3dom 1 4 1 9 v vs she mcneill and canonica 2016 thus unlike diphenhydramine which has an e ppcp ppcp value of 0 61 v vs she table s4 deet was hard to react with 3dom via electron transfer the decrease of k obs under anoxic conditions was likely attributed to the loss of 3dom dependent formation of oh as 3dom may act as part precursors for oh vione et al 2014 therefore deet was mainly reacted with oh in our systems which is in accord with a previous study berg et al 2019 the k obs for deet correlates positively with r oh r2 0 88 fig 3f within all the tested samples overall the generation of oh was promoted after disinfection of dom further enhancing the photodegradation of deet 3 4 laser flash photolysis and kinetic investigation as mentioned above 3dom was responsible for the photodegradation of diphenhydramine in isolated dom solutions fig s10 the interaction between diphenhydramine and 3efom was further studied by lfp experiments in the previous study we detected the transient absorption spectra of efom solution after excitation by a 355 nm laser pulse and observed a broad absorption band 400 500 nm wan et al 2020b similar results can be also found for some dom samples and triplet sensitizers e g 2 acetonaphthone fischer and kliger 1985 niu et al 2018 schmitt et al 2017 wenk et al 2013b owing to the complexity of the dom structure and transient signals the absorption band may consist of a superposition of spectra from 3efom or efom radicals produced upon laser excitation fig 4 a d shows the kinetic curves of transient decay at 440 nm in isolated efom solutions before and after disinfection which was significantly quenched in the presence of dissolved oxygen these kinetic curves were fitted well with a two exponential decay function eq 1 r2 0 93 the residuals of the fits are shown in fig s13 16 1 δ a t δ a 1 e x p x τ 1 δ a 2 e x p x τ 2 where τ 1 and τ 2 are the lifetimes of transients since the quenching rate constant of triplet states with o2 109 m 1 s 1 is much higher than that of most radical reductants e g phenoxyl radicals 107 m 1 s 1 erickson et al 2018 neta and grodkowski 2005 the short lived species with lifetime 2 1 2 7 μs was more likely due to the generation of 3efom the long lived species 50 90 μs was attributed most probably to the efom radicals formed by photoionization which is similar to hs pozdnyakov et al 2020 thus we assumed that the short lived species was mainly assigned to 3efom and the nature of this signal was further investigated in quenching experiments with diphenhydramine accordingly the triplet lifetime in air saturated solutions was determined as approximately 2 39 μs for untreated efom and 2 71 2 11 and 2 48 μs for efom after chlorination uv254 irradiation and ozonation respectively the decay of the 3efom was further monitored in the presence of different concentrations of diphenhydramine p which led to the acceleration of 3efom decay fig 4a d and table s5 the triplet decay rate constants k t can be expressed as follows 2 k t k 0 k q p where k 0 is the decay rate constants of 3efom in the absence of diphenhydramine k q m 1 s 1 is the second order reaction rate constant for the reaction between 3efom and diphenhydramine according to the slope of the curve fitted by eq 2 fig 4e the reaction rate constants between diphenhydramine and 3efom were calculated to be 3 24 0 23 108 m 1 s 1 for untreated efom and 3 73 0 38 1 33 0 24 and 1 90 0 29 108 m 1 s 1 for efom after chlorination uv254 irradiation and ozonation respectively the photosensitized degradation kinetics model of diphenhydramine in the dom solutions was established based on the electron transfer mechanism see detailed derivation in text s6 chen et al 2012 2009 wan et al 2021b assuming that the formation rate of 3dom was constant in the irradiated dom solutions the indirect photodegradation rate of diphenhydramine initiated by 3dom r p can be described by eq 3 3 1 r p k d k o 2 o 2 f k q 1 p 1 f where o2 is the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the dom solutions k d is the oxygen independent decay of 3dom k o2 is the quenching rate constant for 3dom by o2 f is a constant according to the previous studies we use average values of k o2 9 108 m 1 s 1 and k d 9 104 s 1 erickson et al 2018 the values of k d k o2 o2 were then estimated to be 3 105 s 1 for the calculation the photodegradation rate of diphenhydramine at different concentrations in the efom solutions in the presence of 10 0 mm isopropanol was shown in table s6 accordingly the fitting of eq 3 to the experimental data is shown in fig 4f the solid lines r2 0 98 p 0 05 and the k q was calculated to be 3 46 0 15 109 m 1 s 1 for untreated efom and 5 80 0 48 2 61 0 08 and 3 12 0 16 109 m 1 s 1 for efom after chlorination uv254 irradiation and ozonation respectively from the ratios of the y intercept to the slope of the fitted lines fig 4f these values were higher than the 3efom quenching rate constants for diphenhydramine determined by lfp table 2 which was likely attributed to the higher formation rate of triplets when using simulated sunlight 300 nm as a light source compared to the laser radiation 355 nm nevertheless the variation trend of the values of k q after disinfection was the same for these two methods the bimolecular quenching rate constant of 3efom by diphenhydramine increased by 41 after chlorination which was due to the formation of quinone groups with stronger oxidation capacity by chlorine oxidation the uv254 irradiation and ozonation decreased the values of k q by 42 and 26 respectively which was attributed to the formation of carboxylic and phenolic groups and ring cleavage products upon uv254 irradiation or ozonation thereby inhibiting the interaction between 3efom and diphenhydramine 4 conclusion the disinfection treatment of wastewater is critical in wwtps our results indicated that commonly used disinfection processes changed the photoproduction of 3dom 1o2 and oh from dom under simulated sunlight which significantly impacts the photosensitized degradation of trace pollutants in waters chlorine disinfection promoted the photoreactivity of the tested dom samples in all cases the photosensitization degradation of organic contaminants by 3dom 1o2 or oh was noticeably enhanced in the chlorinated effluents under sunlight uv254 and ozone disinfection inhibited the photogeneration of 3dom and 1o2 by dom whereas enhancing the photoproduction of oh thus the pollutants that belong to oh dominated degradation compounds such as deet meprobamate and caffeine bodhipaksha et al 2017 dong et al 2015 are likely to have a higher photodegradation rate in the uv254 irradiated or ozonated effluents under sunlight it should also be noted that the uv254 dose applied here is far above what would be used during wastewater disinfection thus results from this study probably overestimate the impact of uv254 disinfection on the optical and photochemical properties of efom overall this study provides an efficient prediction of the fate of organic contaminants in disinfected wastewater besides noted that there was a much higher increase of oh formation in the whole wastewater effluent e g increased by 63 than that in isolated efom solutions e g increased by 9 after uv254 irradiation table 1 this result might be attributed to the photolysis of inorganic salts e g cl no3 and so4 2 which further reacted with dom lei et al 2021 and needs further investigation furthermore our results also provide a potential application of the combination of disinfection and sunlight for the efficient photosensitization degradation of organic contaminants in wwtps and effluent receiving waters declaration of competing interest the authors

15905,chlorine uv254 and ozone are three typical processes commonly used for wastewater disinfection which could change the photoreactivity of dissolved organic matter dom in effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps the photoinduced reactive species rs from dom primarily including the excited triplet state of dom 3dom singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical oh play important roles in the attenuation of contaminants however the effect of disinfection processes on the photosensitized degradation of contaminants is poorly understood this paper presents the first evidence that 3dom 1o2 and oh interaction with three typical contaminants diphenhydramine cimetidine and n n diethyl m toluamide deet was largely impacted by dom after disinfection the results of electron spin resonance esr spectrometry and laser flash photolysis lfp experiments demonstrated that the chlorination increased the formation rate of 3dom and 1o2 while uv254 irradiation and ozonation decreased the formation rate of these rs all these three disinfection processes promoted the photoproduction of oh and increased the photodegradation rate constants k obs of deet by 26 361 the k obs of diphenhydramine cimetidine and deet correlated positively with the formation rate of 3dom 1o2 and oh respectively the bimolecular reaction rate constant of 3dom with diphenhydramine increased by 41 after chlorination these findings suggest that disinfection processes altered the photogeneration of rs from dom which significantly impacts the fate of trace pollutants in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter laser flash photolysis reactive species chlorine disinfection uv254 disinfection ozone disinfection 1 introduction in wastewater treatment plants wwtps disinfection is an indispensable process for inactivating harmful pathogens and protecting public health before the effluents are discharged into receiving waters shannon et al 2008 sodium hypochlorite ultraviolet uv254 irradiation and ozone disinfection are three typical processes commonly used for wastewater disinfection chlorine and ozone are the most widely used disinfectants in water treatment since the 19th century and are still used in over 80 of public water utilities saboe et al 2021 uv254 disinfection has recently been recommended as a substitute for chemical additives e g chlorine and ozone due to minimal production of disinfection by products dbps and chemical residues and has been used for water disinfection in more than 7000 wwtps in the world song et al 2016 therefore it is of great significance to investigate the effect of disinfection on the environmental behavior of wastewater effluent and receiving waters with the continued growth of the population the processing capacity of wwtps significantly increases and a huge amount of wastewater effluent is discharged into natural waters which introduces effluent organic matter efom a main component of dissolved organic matter dom of effluent receiving waters it is well known that dom is photochemically excited to the singlet state 1dom upon solar irradiation which undergoes radiative decay fluorescence or intersystem crossings to the triplet excited state 3dom and further transfers energy to dissolved oxygen to generate singlet oxygen 1o2 mcneill and canonica 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 the excited states of dom can also participate in electron transfer reactions to form hydroxyl radical oh sharpless and blough 2014 these reactive species play major roles in the degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater effluents and receiving waters wenk et al 2021 it has been reported that 3dom has a high one electron reduction potential 1 4 1 9 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she mcneill and canonica 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 as a result 3dom primarily acts as a potent oxidant of organic contaminants with electron donating functional groups such as amines and phenols chen et al 2009 pan et al 2020 pozdnyakov et al 2020 for the organic contaminants which are difficultly oxidized by 3dom the 1o2 and oh can selectively and non selectively attack target compounds to remove them in aquatic environments in the process of disinfection dom is a significant sink for chemical oxidants e g chlorine and ozone and susceptible to light e g uv254 irradiation due to the great content of chromophores the phenolic and hydroquinone moieties prefer to react with chlorine and ozone via electrophilic substitution and electrophilic addition respectively to form quinone like moieties or ring cleavage products leresche et al 2019 wan et al 2021a wenk et al 2013a the uv254 irradiation also leads to an increase of oxygenated functional groups e g carboxylic and phenolic groups by photo oxidants such as 1o2 and oh generated upon irradiation lester et al 2013 wu et al 2020 the transformation of functional groups in dom changes the photoreactivity of dom for example chlorination enhanced the oxidation capacity of 3dom wan et al 2021a which is expected to promote the triplet induced oxidation of contaminants via single electron transfer processes in aquatic environments owing to the formation of quinone like moieties upon chlorination and ozonation an increase in quantum yields of both 1o2 and oh were observed leresche et al 2021 2019 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 wan et al 2021a besides the uv254 disinfection caused a reduction of 3dom and 1o2 whereas oh generation was promoted due to the increase of functional groups e g carboxylate substituted phenols favorable for oh formation sun et al 2015 wan et al 2020a thus the disinfection processes and the residual disinfectants will change the photoproduction of reactive species from dom of wastewater effluent and effluent receiving waters which consequently impact the photochemical fate of organic contaminants to our best knowledge the variation of contaminants photodegradation and the related mechanism in wastewater effluent after different disinfection processes are not well understood the main purposes of this work include i investigating the photogeneration of 3dom 1o2 and oh from efom as well as humic substances hs before and after disinfection using electron spin resonance esr spectrometry ii revealing the relationship of reactive species formation to the optical property changes of dom iii evaluating the effect of dom disinfection on the photodegradation of organic contaminants typically including cimetidine diphenhydramine and n n diethyl m toluamide deet iv determining the second order reaction rate constants of contaminants with 3dom before and after disinfection using laser flash photolysis lfp and elucidating the underlying mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials diphenhydramine 99 was purchased from acros cimetidine 99 deet 98 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp 98 furfuryl alcohol ffa 98 terephthalate tpa 99 potassium sorbate 99 isopropanol 99 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp 98 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 97 were purchased from sigma aldrich usa and used as received the wastewater ww effluent was obtained from a municipal sewage plant located in hubei province china which treat domestic sewage of wuhan city using an anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o system collected samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membranes stored in the dark and kept at 4 c before the experiments efom was isolated by a solid phase extraction process using ppl cartridges agilent technologies wan et al 2020a 2019 humic substances hs typically including fulvic acid fa and humic acid ha were purchased from changsheng corporation henan china and sigma aldrich respectively they were purified according to the method widely accepted by the international humic substances society ihss the elemental composition and concentration of ions in the dom samples are shown in table s1 all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm from a millipore milli q system 2 2 disinfection process the chlorination experiments were initiated by adding naclo 5 free available chlorine sigma aldrich stock solution to the dom solutions 5 0 mgc l 1 ph 8 0 under magnetic stirring the residual chlorine was measured using the dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine hach usa colorimetric method rice et al 2017 the uv254 disinfection experiments were performed using a custom made lightbox equipped with a 23 w low pressure hg lamp gph 436t5l 4 philips netherlands to generate quasi parallel uv at the wavelength 254 nm the ozonation experiments were performed in a polymethyl methacrylate reactor using an ozone generator cf 3 g 005g qingdao guolin industry corporation china to produce ozone from oxygen the detailed procedures of disinfection experiments are presented in text s1 the dose of chlorine uv254 and ozone was 5 0 mg l 1 1 5 j cm 2 and 5 0 mg l 1 respectively the residual chlorine 0 05 mg l 1 and ozone 0 05 mg l 1 after disinfection were negligible it should be noted that the uv254 disinfection was static in our experiments which was different from the continuous process in wwtps thus the nominal uv254 dose used here was higher than that in practical disinfection besides previous studies indicated that uv doses typically applied for disinfection 30 200 mj cm 2 are not sufficient and an increase in uv dose was suggested to be applied in wwtps bu et al 2018 paredes et al 2018 therefore we used a relatively higher uv254 dose to have a better understanding of the variation of photophysical and photochemical properties of dom 2 3 photochemical experiments the photogeneration of 3dom 1o2 and oh was quantified using isolated dom solutions and whole wastewater effluent before and after disinfection under simulated sunlight irradiation in a 40 ml capped cylindrical pyrex vessel 20 mm inner diameter containing 20 ml of solution the light source was a 150 w xenon lamp with a 300 nm cutoff filter as spectral irradiance shown in fig s1 which has been widely used to simulate sunlight ma et al 2020 wan et al 2019 the total photon irradiance in the range of 290 400 nm e 0 p tot 3 71 10 8 einstein cm 2 s 1 was estimated by a p nitroanisole pyridine pna pyr actinometer see details in text s2 and fig s2 which was widely used in determining the light intensity of similar system berg et al 2019 ma et al 2020 recent works indicated that 290 600 nm is more appropriate for the calculation of quantum yields o connor et al 2019 ossola et al 2021 however in our system light wavelength above 400 nm contributed little to the formation of reactive species text s2 which was consistent with previous studies and likely attributed to the low photoreactivity of high molecular weight dom that preferentially absorbed longer wavelengths marchisio et al 2015 mopper and zhou 1990 thus we use a range of 290 400 nm for light absorbance which yielded an estimate of the rate of light absorption of the dom samples and thus allowed the estimation of quantum yields laszakovits et al 2017 the temperature of the experimental solutions was maintained at 22 1 c by a temperature control unit the dissolved oxygen was measured using an orion star a113 do meter thermo scientific and remained constant 251 10 μm during the irradiation tmp ffa and tpa were used to measure the formation rate and apparent quantum yield φ of 3dom 1o2 and oh respectively since these probes have been widely employed in dom photochemical reactivity studies page et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 more experimental details are provided in text s3 photodegradation rate constants of cimetidine diphenhydramine and deet were quantified in the dom samples solutions 10 0 μm of each compound were prepared in each dom sample from 5 0 mm stock aqueous solutions quenching experiments were performed with the addition of sorbate 3 0 mm ffa 5 0 mm and isopropanol 10 0 mm to examine the roles of high energy 3dom 200 kj mol 1 1o2 and oh in contaminant degradation respectively berg et al 2019 moor et al 2019 additional experiments were also conducted in a nitrogen purged solution dissolved oxygen 15 μm to evaluate the influence of o2 on photodegradation the bimolecular reaction rate constants of each contaminant with 1o2 and oh were determined by competition kinetics using ffa and acetophenone as reference compounds respectively see detailed procedures in text s4 three replicates were included for all photochemical experiments 2 4 instrumental analyses the uv vis absorption spectra were obtained by an evolution 201 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific total organic carbon toc was measured using a multi n c 2100 toc analyzer analytik jena germany the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy of the samples was performed using a hitachi f 4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer japan the concentrations of chemical probes tmp and ffa and contaminants were measured using high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a uv absorbance detector and an apollo c18 column 5 μm 250 mm 4 6 mm the hplc parameters are given in table s2 the detection of 1o2 and oh was also performed by electron spin resonance esr spectrometry bruker emxnano germany using temp and dmpo as spin trapping agents respectively esr spectrometer was set as follows center field 3416 45 g sweep width 100 00 g modulation amplitude 1 000 g microwave power 20 mw sweep time 30 s number of scans 3 the lfp experiments were carried out using the third harmonic 355 nm of an nd yag laser sli 10 continuum electro optics inc usa as an excitation source as described in previous studies makunina et al 2015 yurkova et al 2013 a 150 w xenon lamp was adopted as the probe light 3 results and discussion 3 1 photophysical properties of dom as shown in table s3 there was no significant decrease in the toc concentrations of dom after chlorination 3 uv254 irradiation 9 and ozonation 4 indicating these three disinfection processes caused little mineralization of dom fig s3 illustrates the uv vis absorption spectra and variation of the uv vis absorbance absuntreated abstreated after disinfection of dom samples the disinfection caused a decrease in the absorbance of all the tested dom samples the absolute decrease in absorption occurred mainly in the uv region which was likely ascribed to the destruction of aromatic structures the variation of optical properties i e e2 e3 ratios suva254 and spectral slope see calculation details in text s5 of the dom after disinfection was characterized based on uv vis spectra fig s3 as shown in table s3 for all the tested dom samples disinfection caused a decrease of suva254 decreased by 4 44 and an increase in both e2 e3 ratios increased by 3 50 and spectral slopes s increased by 3 36 indicating a decrease in aromaticity and molecular weight of the treated dom samples which is consistent with previous studies on the chlorination uv254 irradiation and ozonation of dom remucal et al 2020 wenk et al 2013a wu et al 2020 the fluorescence spectra of dom showed typical eem signatures as fulvic like ex 275 nm em 525 nm humic like ex 270 nm em 445 nm and protein like ex 280 nm em 340 nm components for fa ha and efom respectively fig s4 after disinfection the eem peak position had little change whereas the fluorescence intensity was reduced for all the dom samples fig s4 the specific fluorescence sf decreased by 10 31 33 60 and 30 60 for dom samples after chlorination uv254 irradiation and ozonation respectively table s3 besides after disinfection the fluorescence index fi value for fa and ha samples increased by 7 29 while a decrease in fi value decreased by 7 was observed for efom table s3 indicating the relative contribution of microbial sources to the efom decreased 3 2 photogeneration of reactive species the transformation of probe molecules tmp ffa and tpa in the dom solutions was shown in figs s5 s7 the measured formation rate and apparent quantum yield of 3dom 1o2 and oh for isolated dom samples and whole wastewater effluent before and after disinfection was presented in table 1 furthermore the formation of 1o2 and oh was captured by temp and dmpo using esr spin trap experiments with triplet peaks of equal intensity and quartet peaks of intensity ratio 1 2 2 1 of the esr spectra respectively fig 1 the esr signals of 1o2 and oh matched well with their formation rates detected by ffa and tpa respectively table 1 the formation rate of 3dom and 1o2 increased after chlorination while decreasing after uv254 irradiation and ozonation for all the tested dom samples since 3dom is a precursor for 1o2 the measured φ1o2 1 5 10 2 follows the same trends as φ3dom 1 7 12 8 for all the dom samples before and after disinfection r2 0 95 fig 2 a since o2 can react with almost total 3dom pool 94 kj mol 1 via energy transfer to generate 1o2 while tmp is oxidized only by 3dom with one electron reduction potentials higher than 1 22 v vs she via electron transfer tmp samples a smaller fraction of 3dom than ground state o2 which is corresponding to the x intercept of the fitting line in fig 2a the apparent triplet quantum yield was increased by 31 130 after chlorination for all the tested dom samples which is consistent with our previous study wan et al 2021a as for dom samples after uv254 irradiation and ozonation the values of φ3dom showed different trends between hs and efom table 1 both uv254 irradiation and ozonation caused a decrease in the quantum yields of 3dom and 1o2 for fa and ha in contrast φ3dom and φ1o2 increased for efom it is well known that quinones and aromatic ketones are two typical sources of 3dom mcneill and canonica 2016 zhou et al 2017 the enhanced formation of 3dom after chlorination was likely attributed to the oxidation of phenolic and hydroquinone moieties to quinone like moieties by chlorine wenk et al 2013a nevertheless as an oxidant o3 was more likely to react with dom via electrophilic addition of one or two oxygen atoms to aromatic moieties followed by ring cleavage and thus inhibited the formation of 3dom maizel et al 2017 remucal et al 2020 wenk et al 2013a besides the uv254 irradiation would increase the relative contents of carboxylic and phenolic groups of dom also leading to a lower formation rate of 3dom wu et al 2020 thus the apparent triplet quantum yield was decreased by 7 38 after uv254 irradiation and ozonation for fa and ha table 1 the increase of φ3dom for efom was ascribed to the complex components of efom previous studies have demonstrated that the high protein like fraction mainly proteins and peptides of efom caused the self quenching of 3efom bodhipaksha et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 as mentioned above the protein like components of efom were destroyed after uv254 irradiation and ozonation which reduced its self quenching effect therefore despite the loss of 3dom sources e g quinones and aromatic ketones after uv254 irradiation and ozonation the apparent triplet quantum yield increased for efom it should be noted that the values of φ3dom and φ1o2 observed for the whole wastewater effluent were higher than that of the isolated efom table 1 likely due to the incomplete extraction of dom from wastewater effluent via solid phase extraction process with ppl cartridges besides the presence of inorganic salts in the effluent table s1 could also bring together secondary radicals such as cl and so4 fang et al 2013 parker and mitch 2016 under irradiation leading to the further decomposition of the probes zhou et al 2017 unlike 3dom and 1o2 the measured formation rate and quantum yield of oh increased after disinfection in all cases table 1 which is in agreement with previous studies leresche et al 2021 wan et al 2021a 2020a it is known that the sources of oh in sunlit natural waters include nitrate nitrite photolysis fenton fenton like reactions and photoreactions of dom mopper and zhou 1990 vione et al 2014 2006 for the isolated dom samples the concentrations of iron and nitrite were negligible see table s1 and our previous studies which excluded their roles as sources of oh wan et al 2021a 2020a thus the dom is responsible for the observed oh as shown in fig 2b φ oh does not correlate significantly with φ3dom for the tested dom samples r2 0 57 indicating that the 3dom is not a major precursor for oh formation other potential precursors include 1dom charge transfer states dom or one electron oxidizing intermediates dom could also lead to oh formation dalrymple et al 2010 mckay et al 2016 in terms of the molecular composition of dom disinfection transformed dom into more oxygenated formulas remucal et al 2020 wenk et al 2013a wu et al 2020 which were reported to have high efficiency at forming oh berg et al 2019 besides for the whole wastewater effluent there was a high level of nitrate 31 25 mg l 1 which contributed to a significant photoproduction of oh 3 10 7 m oh mno3 1 s 1 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 vione et al 2006 as a result the φ oh for the whole wastewater effluent was about 10 times as much as efom table 1 the e2 e3 ratio is a well established predictor of reactive species yields from dom bodhipaksha et al 2015 maizel et al 2017 mckay et al 2017 it has been reported that the e2 e3 ratio is typically positively correlated with φ1o2 chen et al 2020 mckay et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 however in this study although the directions of the trends in φ1o2 with e2 e3 agree with previous documents their relationship was not significant r2 0 58 fig 2c for the tested dom samples before and after disinfection this suggests that disinfection significantly altered the optical properties of dom and weakened the established correlations in the case of φ oh a significant positive correlation between φ oh and e2 e3 was observed within our data r2 0 88 fig 2d since e2 e3 is an inverse proxy for molecular weight as discussed above chen et al 2020 mccabe and arnold 2017 the result suggested that disinfection led dom to yield low apparent molecular weight products which was concluded to have more efficient oh formation ability lee et al 2013 mckay et al 2017 2016 wan et al 2020a 3 3 photodegradation of organic contaminants the disinfection processes altered the photoinduced generation of reactive species from dom which was expected to significantly impact the fate of trace pollutants in wastewater effluent and natural waters three target contaminants namely cimetidine diphenhydramine and deet see chemical properties in table s4 primarily undergo indirect photolysis in the isolated dom solutions and whole wastewater effluent under simulated sunlight fig s8 the photodegradation rate constants k obs of these contaminants vary among the untreated dom samples with 0 17 3 22 h 1 0 026 0 075 h 1 and 0 002 0 018 h 1 for cimetidine diphenhydramine and deet respectively fig 3 a c the disinfection processes significantly changed the k obs of the three contaminants for cimetidine and diphenhydramine the values of k obs were increased by 15 84 for all the tested dom samples after chlorination while decreased by 16 70 and 15 68 after uv254 irradiation and ozonation respectively except for the photodegradation of diphenhydramine in the whole wastewater effluent the uv254 irradiation and ozonation of the whole wastewater effluent increased the k obs of diphenhydramine by 91 and 15 respectively fig 3b for deet the three disinfection processes increased the values of k obs by 26 361 for all the tested dom samples fig 3c in order to examine the mechanism of the indirect photodegradation of contaminants the roles of 3dom 1o2 and oh were examined by adding their quenchers sorbate ffa and isopropanol respectively figs s9 s11 for cimetidine the addition of ffa and sorbate lowered the k obs by approximately 91 and 38 respectively while the addition of isopropanol had no effect on all the tested samples fig s9 since 1o2 is produced via energy transfer from 3dom to dissolved oxygen the decreased photodegradation rate of cimetidine in both the presence of ffa and sorbate indicated that cimetidine belongs to a 1o2 dominated degradation compound which is consistent with previous findings bodhipaksha et al 2017 latch et al 2003 the involvement of 1o2 was further confirmed by the n2 purged experiments where the k obs decreased by more than 90 in the absence of dissolved oxygen fig s12a besides the 1o2 reaction rate constant for cimetidine was determined to be 2 7 108 m 1 s 1 table 2 which is consistent with the previous report 2 5 3 3 108 m 1 s 1 and higher than that for ffa 1 0 108 m 1 s 1 appiani et al 2017 latch et al 2003 thus cimetidine was primarily degraded by reaction with 1o2 in all the dom samples as shown in fig 3d a positive correlation between the k obs of cimetidine and r 1o2 was observed for all the tested samples r2 0 98 therefore the disinfection of dom influenced the generation of 1o2 and further impacted the photodegradation of cimetidine for diphenhydramine the addition of ffa showed a negligible effect on its photodegradation fig s10 which is corresponding to the insignificant rate constant between diphenhydramine and 1o2 table 2 the addition of the triplet quencher sorbate significantly suppressed the diphenhydramine photodegradation by 82 and the n2 sparging deoxygenation led to a pronounced increase of the k obs by 17 times on average in all cases fig s10 indicating that 3dom played a major role in the photodegradation of diphenhydramine chen et al 2009 besides the addition of isopropanol did not suppress the depletion of diphenhydramine in the isolated dom solutions whereas quenched about 36 of the diphenhydramine degradation in whole wastewater effluent fig s10 suggesting oh also participated in the diphenhydramine degradation considering the higher r oh in whole wastewater effluent 1 3 2 2 10 9 m s 1 table 1 and the high reaction rate constant between diphenhydramine and oh 6 92 109 m 1 s 1 table 2 the enhanced photodegradation of diphenhydramine in whole wastewater effluent after uv254 irradiation and ozonation fig 3b was mainly attributed to the stronger oh production table 1 except for the data in whole wastewater effluent k obs of diphenhydramine correlated positively with r 3dom r2 0 93 fig 3e indicating that the photogeneration of 3dom was changed in the isolated dom solutions after disinfection and thus affected the photodegradation of diphenhydramine for deet its photodegradation rate constant decreased by approximately 89 33 and 62 on average with the addition of isopropanol ffa and sorbate respectively fig s11 the significant decrease of k obs in the presence of isopropanol indicated that oh plays a vital role in the photodegradation of deet owing to the insignificant rate constant between deet and 1o2 table 2 the inhibition of ffa on the photodegradation of deet was likely due to the quenching effect of oh by ffa since the values of r 1o2 10 7 m s 1 were much higher than r oh 10 10 m s 1 table 1 the ffa mainly acted as a 1o2 quencher in our system the reduction of deet degradation after the addition of sorbate suggested that 3dom might be involved in the reaction however in contrast to diphenhydramine fig s10 the values of k obs for deet decreased by 40 under anoxic conditions fig s12b suggesting that 3dom has little effect on the photodegradation of deet despite the lifetime of triplets was much longer in the absence of o2 erickson et al 2018 moor et al 2019 besides we have calculated the one electron oxidation potential e ppcp ppcp of deet 1 86 v vs she table s4 which is generally higher than the one electron reduction potential of 3dom 1 4 1 9 v vs she mcneill and canonica 2016 thus unlike diphenhydramine which has an e ppcp ppcp value of 0 61 v vs she table s4 deet was hard to react with 3dom via electron transfer the decrease of k obs under anoxic conditions was likely attributed to the loss of 3dom dependent formation of oh as 3dom may act as part precursors for oh vione et al 2014 therefore deet was mainly reacted with oh in our systems which is in accord with a previous study berg et al 2019 the k obs for deet correlates positively with r oh r2 0 88 fig 3f within all the tested samples overall the generation of oh was promoted after disinfection of dom further enhancing the photodegradation of deet 3 4 laser flash photolysis and kinetic investigation as mentioned above 3dom was responsible for the photodegradation of diphenhydramine in isolated dom solutions fig s10 the interaction between diphenhydramine and 3efom was further studied by lfp experiments in the previous study we detected the transient absorption spectra of efom solution after excitation by a 355 nm laser pulse and observed a broad absorption band 400 500 nm wan et al 2020b similar results can be also found for some dom samples and triplet sensitizers e g 2 acetonaphthone fischer and kliger 1985 niu et al 2018 schmitt et al 2017 wenk et al 2013b owing to the complexity of the dom structure and transient signals the absorption band may consist of a superposition of spectra from 3efom or efom radicals produced upon laser excitation fig 4 a d shows the kinetic curves of transient decay at 440 nm in isolated efom solutions before and after disinfection which was significantly quenched in the presence of dissolved oxygen these kinetic curves were fitted well with a two exponential decay function eq 1 r2 0 93 the residuals of the fits are shown in fig s13 16 1 δ a t δ a 1 e x p x τ 1 δ a 2 e x p x τ 2 where τ 1 and τ 2 are the lifetimes of transients since the quenching rate constant of triplet states with o2 109 m 1 s 1 is much higher than that of most radical reductants e g phenoxyl radicals 107 m 1 s 1 erickson et al 2018 neta and grodkowski 2005 the short lived species with lifetime 2 1 2 7 μs was more likely due to the generation of 3efom the long lived species 50 90 μs was attributed most probably to the efom radicals formed by photoionization which is similar to hs pozdnyakov et al 2020 thus we assumed that the short lived species was mainly assigned to 3efom and the nature of this signal was further investigated in quenching experiments with diphenhydramine accordingly the triplet lifetime in air saturated solutions was determined as approximately 2 39 μs for untreated efom and 2 71 2 11 and 2 48 μs for efom after chlorination uv254 irradiation and ozonation respectively the decay of the 3efom was further monitored in the presence of different concentrations of diphenhydramine p which led to the acceleration of 3efom decay fig 4a d and table s5 the triplet decay rate constants k t can be expressed as follows 2 k t k 0 k q p where k 0 is the decay rate constants of 3efom in the absence of diphenhydramine k q m 1 s 1 is the second order reaction rate constant for the reaction between 3efom and diphenhydramine according to the slope of the curve fitted by eq 2 fig 4e the reaction rate constants between diphenhydramine and 3efom were calculated to be 3 24 0 23 108 m 1 s 1 for untreated efom and 3 73 0 38 1 33 0 24 and 1 90 0 29 108 m 1 s 1 for efom after chlorination uv254 irradiation and ozonation respectively the photosensitized degradation kinetics model of diphenhydramine in the dom solutions was established based on the electron transfer mechanism see detailed derivation in text s6 chen et al 2012 2009 wan et al 2021b assuming that the formation rate of 3dom was constant in the irradiated dom solutions the indirect photodegradation rate of diphenhydramine initiated by 3dom r p can be described by eq 3 3 1 r p k d k o 2 o 2 f k q 1 p 1 f where o2 is the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the dom solutions k d is the oxygen independent decay of 3dom k o2 is the quenching rate constant for 3dom by o2 f is a constant according to the previous studies we use average values of k o2 9 108 m 1 s 1 and k d 9 104 s 1 erickson et al 2018 the values of k d k o2 o2 were then estimated to be 3 105 s 1 for the calculation the photodegradation rate of diphenhydramine at different concentrations in the efom solutions in the presence of 10 0 mm isopropanol was shown in table s6 accordingly the fitting of eq 3 to the experimental data is shown in fig 4f the solid lines r2 0 98 p 0 05 and the k q was calculated to be 3 46 0 15 109 m 1 s 1 for untreated efom and 5 80 0 48 2 61 0 08 and 3 12 0 16 109 m 1 s 1 for efom after chlorination uv254 irradiation and ozonation respectively from the ratios of the y intercept to the slope of the fitted lines fig 4f these values were higher than the 3efom quenching rate constants for diphenhydramine determined by lfp table 2 which was likely attributed to the higher formation rate of triplets when using simulated sunlight 300 nm as a light source compared to the laser radiation 355 nm nevertheless the variation trend of the values of k q after disinfection was the same for these two methods the bimolecular quenching rate constant of 3efom by diphenhydramine increased by 41 after chlorination which was due to the formation of quinone groups with stronger oxidation capacity by chlorine oxidation the uv254 irradiation and ozonation decreased the values of k q by 42 and 26 respectively which was attributed to the formation of carboxylic and phenolic groups and ring cleavage products upon uv254 irradiation or ozonation thereby inhibiting the interaction between 3efom and diphenhydramine 4 conclusion the disinfection treatment of wastewater is critical in wwtps our results indicated that commonly used disinfection processes changed the photoproduction of 3dom 1o2 and oh from dom under simulated sunlight which significantly impacts the photosensitized degradation of trace pollutants in waters chlorine disinfection promoted the photoreactivity of the tested dom samples in all cases the photosensitization degradation of organic contaminants by 3dom 1o2 or oh was noticeably enhanced in the chlorinated effluents under sunlight uv254 and ozone disinfection inhibited the photogeneration of 3dom and 1o2 by dom whereas enhancing the photoproduction of oh thus the pollutants that belong to oh dominated degradation compounds such as deet meprobamate and caffeine bodhipaksha et al 2017 dong et al 2015 are likely to have a higher photodegradation rate in the uv254 irradiated or ozonated effluents under sunlight it should also be noted that the uv254 dose applied here is far above what would be used during wastewater disinfection thus results from this study probably overestimate the impact of uv254 disinfection on the optical and photochemical properties of efom overall this study provides an efficient prediction of the fate of organic contaminants in disinfected wastewater besides noted that there was a much higher increase of oh formation in the whole wastewater effluent e g increased by 63 than that in isolated efom solutions e g increased by 9 after uv254 irradiation table 1 this result might be attributed to the photolysis of inorganic salts e g cl no3 and so4 2 which further reacted with dom lei et al 2021 and needs further investigation furthermore our results also provide a potential application of the combination of disinfection and sunlight for the efficient photosensitization degradation of organic contaminants in wwtps and effluent receiving waters declaration of competing interest the authors

15906,methane ch4 emissions from freshwaters to the atmosphere have a profound impact on global atmospheric greenhouse gas ghg concentrations anthropogenic footprints such as dam construction and reservoir operation significantly changed the fate and transport of ch4 in freshwaters the source of particulate organic carbon poc in reservoirs is a critical factor controlling ch4 production and emissions however little is known of how reservoir operation mediates the transport of poc and regulates ch4 accumulation in cascade hydroelectric reservoirs here spatial and temporal variations in poc and ch4 were explored in the xiluodu xld and xiangjiaba xjb reservoirs which are deep valley cascade reservoirs located in the main channel of the upper yangtze river based on the δ13c poc and n c mole ratio of particulate organic matter the results of multi endmember stable isotope mixing models by a bayesian model showed that terrigenous poc and autochthonous poc accounted for approximately 55 18 and 43 19 sd n 179 of poc respectively together with other hydrological and environmental parameters we found that the input of terrigenous poc was dominantly influenced by water level variations and flow regulation due to reservoir operation the cumulative effect of poc caused by cascade dams was not apparent terrigenous poc were more likely to drive ch4 accumulation in our study evident low level of ch4 in both reservoirs were likely affected by low sedimentation of poc and microbial ch4 oxidation we hope our study could provide a conceptual framework for further modeling of ch4 dynamics in cascade reservoirs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane dynamics terrigenous poc carbon footprint cascade reservoirs hydropower production 1 introduction methane ch4 is widely recognized as the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide co2 saunois et al 2020 the latest data showed that global atmospheric ch4 was 1900 5 ppb in september 2021 dlugokencky 2021 nearly triple pre industrial levels the growth of global ch4 emissions began a rapid and mysterious uptick since 2007 tollefson 2022 the annual increase in global atmospheric ch4 between 2007 and 2020 fell within a range of 7 84 ppb yr 1 to 15 74 ppb yr 1 dlugokencky 2021 such spiking dangerously fast growth in atmospheric ch4 is believed to create a feedback mechanism that will cause ever more ch4 to be released making it even harder to rein in rising temperatures tollefson 2022 however not all the sources of global ch4 emissions are well explained although half of the global ch4 emissions originate from the aquatic ecosystems rosentreter et al 2021 a large proportion of the uncertainties in the global ch4 budget arise from freshwater systems the production and emissions of ch4 in lakes and reservoirs are important processes in the global ch4 cycle this is partly because freshwater systems are closely linked to and manipulated by anthropogenic activities e g hydrological process regulation land use change bulk inputs of organic carbon oc and nutrients from surrounding communities stanley et al 2016 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2017 anthropogenic footprints significantly change the fate and transport of ch4 in freshwaters dam construction and reservoir impoundments are widely accepted as important anthropogenic activities that significantly change the sink and sources of ch4 in the freshwater systems beaulieu et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 according to the most recent estimates the ch4 emissions by rivers and reservoirs is about 26 8 tg yr 1 and 17 73 tg yr 1 respectively the total of both accounts for about 28 of the ch4 emissions by the global freshwaters ipcc 2021 in general the net increase in ch4 emissions due to reservoir formation primarily originates from the decomposition of organic matter om i e soil oc and vegetation cover reservoir ch4 emissions may reach the highest levels immediately after impoundment and exponentially decline with aging abril et al 2005 however sediment loads and reservoir productivity influenced by nutrient enrichments were regarded as stronger driving factors that regulate ch4 production and emissions than reservoir age in navigable river impoundments deemer et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2019 shi et al 2017 discussed that the largest share of ch4 emissions may be due to oc retention and mineralization in cascade reservoirs our recent findings explained that imbalanced stoichiometric sedimentation supported ch4 accumulation in the mid part of china s three gorges reservoir li et al 2020b growing evidences have highlighted the importance of reservoir hydrology and sediment or oc dynamics contributing to ch4 accumulation and emissions for example a large inputs of allochthonous oc contribute to ch4 emissions in amazonian reservoir petit saut colas et al 2020 these findings suggested that reservoir operation strategy significantly impacts oc further driving ch4 accumulation input of oc to reservoir in forms as suspended sediments is a complex mixture of autochthonous particulate organic carbon poc and allochthonous poc mainly terrigenous autochthonous poc derived from in situ primary production such as algae and aquatic microorganisms chen et al 2021 it exists in forms with almost no support tissues and is generally composed of protein and aliphatic compounds kendall et al 2001 bianchi and canuel 2011 terrigenous poc derived from river basin sources such as c3 and c4 plants and coastal soil which are primarily composed of cellulose and structural compounds kendall et al 2001 bianchi and canuel 2011 autochthonous poc is more labile and has been found to have a high bioavailability yet terrigenous poc was already partly degraded and less available for microorganisms guillemette et al 2013 autochthonous poc can be the main factor that fuels ch4 production in freshwaters such as lake fuxian and lake diamond in the usa li et al 2020a west et al 2012 nevertheless because terrigenous poc accounts for large proportions in sediment input it can also have a potential promotion effect on supporting long term ch4 accumulation and emissions such as the william h harsha reservoir in the usa berberich et al 2020 amazonian reservoir petit saut colas et al 2020 and the congo river upstill goddard et al 2017 moreover the reduced flow velocity and increased hydraulic retention time hrt from river to reservoir collect terrigenous oc from the upstream watershed to the bottom of reservoir contributing to the development of anoxic habitats at the reservoir bottom for intensive methanogenesis and carbon burial li et al 2020b this evidence supports a general view that reservoirs consistently emit ch4 which exceeds those of upstream of the same river and on average from natural lakes stanley et al 2016 understanding how reservoir operation mediates source and transport of poc and finally impacts ch4 dynamics from river valley cascade reservoirs can provide a framework to assess or predict reservoir ch4 emissions moreover if reservoir operation could have an evident link with poc variation and ch4 dynamics there would be best practices for the hydropower industry to reduce excessive ch4 emissions for example if ch4 accumulation is mainly affected by terrigenous poc reducing watershed inputs of oc could be the focus such as reducing agricultural activities and river bank stabilization if ch4 accumulation is primarily influenced by autochthonous poc reducing inputs of nutrients should be played more attention berberich et al 2020 these are meaningful to reduce carbon footprints of hydroelectricity from the life cycle perspective however little is known about the response of ch4 emissions to autochthonous and terrigenous poc dynamics in river valley cascade reservoirs the present study was extended from a single reservoir mostly reported to a cascade system in the upper yangtze river to explore dissolved ch4 accumulation and dynamics under reservoir operation the research objectives are 1 to characterize the input and sedimentation of poc in cascade reservoirs and 2 to explain how the different sources of poc regulate the dissolved ch4 dynamics in deep river valley reservoirs we hope our efforts in this study would provide a theoretical basis to elucidate mechanisms of ch4 dynamics under cascade reservoirs scheduling operation 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling campaign the xiluodu xld reservoir and xiangjiaba xjb reservoir are two deep river valley cascade reservoirs located along the main channel of the upper yangtze river which is frequently referred to the jinsha river fig 1 both sides of the xld and xjb reservoirs are mainly composed of bedrock fig s1 the xld and xjb hydro projects serve as hydroelectricity production facilities and also for flood control they perform significant seasonal water level adjustments i e high water level operation for hydroelectricity and low water level preparing enough reservoir capacity for holding floods fig 2 the initial impoundment of both reservoirs started in july 2013 xjb finished its impoundment in september 2013 while xld finished its full impoundment one year later the general description of the xld and xjb reservoirs is shown in table s1 the monthly hydroelectric production from the xld and xjb reservoir was provided by the china three gorges corporation www ctg com cn sampling campaign was conducted every two months between january 2018 and january 2019 flood season was from july to september the other months were considered as dry season in our study fifteen sampling sites were located along the main channel of both reservoirs i e l3 to l1 in the xld reservoir b10 to b1 in the xjb reservoir and x2 to x1 at the downstream of the xjb dam fig 1 fig s1 due to the difficulty in local transportation in the region our sampling work was limited at the reach 40 km upstream of the xld dam approximate 10 l water samples from surface and bottom layers were collected at 0 5 m below the water surface and approximately 2 m above the sediment at most sampling sites in the xld and xjb reservoirs fig 1b samples were collected only once at different sampling sites for the sampling sites located in river reach downstream of the both dams i e b10 to b9 and x2 to x1 fast running water and well mixed

22 73 c in the xld and xjb reservoirs respectively water temperature was higher in the flood season figs s4 s5 the thermal stratification patterns of both reservoirs were apparently different in the two reservoirs in the xld temperature in the surface water was higher than that in the bottom water identifiable thermal stratification developed in the xld in spring i e march and persisted throughout the whole summer with the increase in water level in autumn together with the decrease in air temperature thermal stratification gradually disappeared in november fig s4 because the upstream of xld increased its discharge to prepare abundant reservoir capacity before the flood season the sampling sites from the b10 to b7 in the xjb was fully mixed in flood season however weak thermal stratification was initiated in march from the b6 to b1 at the dam site supporting its spring algal blooms and disappeared in september fig s5 the do in the xld and xjb reservoirs varied from 7 8 mg l to 14 76 mg l figs s6 s7 the do in surface water was significantly higher than that at the bottom layer in the xld and xjb in march due to strong photosynthesis during algal blooms because the chl a displayed the highest concentration in this month fig s9a the do in the xld showed significant stratification and increased with increasing water depth in may july and september the theoretical o2 solubility and sdo is more sensitive with water temperature compared with hydrostatic pressure in the xld vertical profile in the may and july section s1 2 fig s8 the higher do concentration in bottom water in the xld reservoir may be mainly influenced by thermal stratification the chl a concentration in surface water varied from 0 01 mg m3 to 35 02 mg m3 the maximum chl a concentration during the study was in march in the xjb diatom bloom initiated in late february and continued to april in the xjb the chl a concentration in the xld was below 15 mg m3 throughout the year fig s9a the doc varied from 0 26 mg l to 6 13 mg l with an average value of 2 38 1 23 mg l in the cascade system n 174 the maximum doc was found between may and july with a mean value of 3 94 0

sampling sites the dtn and dtp in the surface and bottom water were 138 13 65 33 μmol l n 182 and 1 39 0 5 μmol l n 181 respectively the mole ratio of dtn dtp fell in a range between 72 81 1st quartile and 130 26 3rd quartile indicating heavily p limitation for primary producers in both reservoirs 3 2 particulate organic matter and stable isotopic signatures the tpm in all sampling sites of both reservoirs varied from 1 1 mg l to 38 8 mg l with a mean of 5 74 5 03 mg l n 182 and the maximum average tpm was found in july and september with a value of 10 78 4 34 mg l for both months n 52 the tpm at the bottom of water column displayed higher values in the january 2018 fig 3 the poc contents poc in the surface and bottom water varied from 1 3 to 53 07 with a mean of 8 68 10 12 n 180

with average values of 26 32 13 72 and 0 077 0 052 respectively n 24 meanwhile the maximum poc and pon in the surface and bottom water were found before the dams and the n c mole ratio from upstream was lower than those from downstream in march fig 3a 3b the δ 13c poc values in all samples ranged between 13 0 and 35 3 26 1 1 8 n 179 δ 13c poc in march showed apparently higher than the other months 24 4 3 4 n 24 fig 4a moreover based on the stable isotope mixing models poc in the xld l3 l1 and xjb b10 x1 reservoirs may have been primarily from plankton 47 19 41 18 and secondarily from c3

ch4 the annual ch4 and co2 concentrations in the surface and bottom water from the two cascade reservoirs varied from 0 01 μmol l to 0 13 μmol l 0 04 0 02 μmol l n 182 and 0 02 mmol l to 0 26 mmol l 0 05 0 03 mmol l n 182 respectively the 50 quantiles of dissolved ch4 and co2 concentrations in all samples were 0 03 umol l and 0 04 mmol l in the xld and xjb in xld l3 l1 annual ch4 fell in a range between 0 01 μmol l and 0 05 μmol l 0 03 0 01 μmol l n 42 fig 5 annual co2 concentration in xld fell in a range between 0 03 mmol l and 0 09 mmol l 0 05 0 02 mmol l n 42 fig 5 in xjb b10 b1 annual ch4

mmol l and 0 08 mmol l 0 04 0 01 mmol l n 14 the longitudinal gradient of ch4 concentration from upstream of the xld to downstream of the xjb was evident and the mid part of the xjb b6 b4 exhibited a relatively high level of ch4 concentration among all samples comparatively the longitudinal gradient of co2 concentration along the cascade reservoir was not evident fig 5 the mole ratio between ch4 and co2 was among the highest in the middle of the xjb for temporal variation the highest ch4 concentration at the dam site of the xld was shown in the flood season moreover the peak values of ch4 concentrations at both the surface and bottom water of the xjb reservoir were observed during the flood season from b7 to b5 the difference of ch4 concentration between surface water and bottom water samples were not significant yet ch4 concentration at b6 in the september showed slightly higher values in the surface water than that at the bottom the lowest co2 concentration was found before the xjb dam in march due to algal bloom and the co2 concentration in surface water was significantly lower than that in bottom water fig 5 δ 13c ch4 in the surface and bottom water of both reservoirs ranged from 8 3 to 54 0 with a mean of 32 7 9 0 n 156 fig 5 δ 13c ch4 in all water samples showed apparent temporal and spatial variations and maximum values were found before the two dams lower δ 13c ch4 values were observed in march july and september from b7 to b6 where the peak value of ch4 concentration was found however most δ 13c ch4 in both surface and bottom water from the two reservoirs displayed similar variation except for that in march from the xjb reservoir fig 5a 5b 4 discussion 4 1 cascade damming effect on source and transport of poc the fate and transport of poc in a river can be significantly influenced by damming damming increased losses of river connectivity and reduced river flow which possibly decreased the transport of poc due to the prolonged hrt inducing bulk sedimentation and burial of poc in reservoirs almeida et al 2019 li et al 2020b in addition dam construction promotes primary production and the intensive water level fluctuations to cause landslides and debris flows and indirectly influence land use types which may increase the autochthonous and terrigenous poc in the reservoir yi et al 2021 iqbal et al 2018 luo et al 2016 wang et al 2020 zorzal almeida et al 2018 in this study the poc exhibited a positive relationship with the contribution of terrigenous poc implying that terrigenous poc was a major source for poc in the xld and xjb reservoirs fig s11 the autochthonous poc also accounted for proportion of poc with about 43 both terrigenous and autochthonous poc played key roles in transport of poc in both reservoirs the fluxes of terrigenous and autochthonous poc exhibited higher values in the march july and september fig 6 as exogenous variables in the sem the hydropower production water temperature and river flow showed positive relationships and the water level displayed a positive relationship with the hydropower production in the xld and xjb reservoirs fig 7 the river flow exhibited significantly positive effects on the fluxes of terrigenous and autochthonous poc in the xld and xjb reservoirs the hydropower production depended on river flow and water level may indirectly influence the fluxes of terrigenous and autochthonous poc in both reservoirs fig 7 due to the low clay content of surface soil in the river basin the particulate matter derived from soil erosion may have a low oc content wu et al 2020 yu et al 2011 the input of large inorganic particulate matter resulted that the contents of terrigenous and autochthonous poc in tpm during the flood season were lower than that in the dry season in the cascade reservoirs fig s10 however the higher fluxes of terrigenous and autochthonous poc in the july and september indicates large inputs of poc during this period fig 6 the abundant terrigenous poc was carried by higher runoff into river or resuspended by river flow during the flood season the water level showed a slightly positive effect on the autochthonous poc flux fig 7 in addition the spring algal blooms contributed to the elevation of autochthonous poc flux in the may which can be resuspended to result in a large input of autochthonous poc in the flood season although the water level displayed no significant effect on the flux of terrigenous poc in the sem fig 7 the high water level in january was drawdown gradually to march by reservoir scheduling operation fig 2c 2d which may lead to an increase in the flux of terrigenous poc in march fig 6 therefore the river flow and water level caused by reservoir scheduling operation were primary factors for the input of poc in the xld and xjb reservoirs the sedimentation of poc from upstream and riverbanks were primarily reflected by the mass balance calculation of poc fig 8 a according to the mass balance results of poc the output flux of poc was lower than the input flux of poc in the march november 2018 and january 2019 the sedimentation of poc was mainly reflected in these months especially in the march fig 8a although the input of poc was large during the flood season the sedimentation of poc was low in july and september however if the input from river bank and small tributaries or resuspended sediment are considered in the july and september there is still likely more large sedimentation of poc during the flood season fig 6 the doc poc ratio with a range of 0 08 to 8 7 in typical rivers of the world displayed an exponentially negative correlation with sediment yield ran et al 2013 in this study the average doc poc ratio in all months 11 4 6 27 n 172 fig 8b was higher than the global average doc poc ratio of 1 to 1 2 ran et al 2013 this indicates sediment yield in the xld and xjb reservoirs was lower than that in major world rivers although the doc poc ratio with an average value of 12 23 3 22 sd n 52 in flood season was higher than the major world rivers it was still lower than the other months 13 18 6 33 n 96 in the two reservoirs except for that in march fig 8b this indicates that sedimentation of poc during the flood season was more significant compared with other months moreover the doc poc ratio in the march 2 48 2 4 n 24 was close to the long chuan river in the jinsha river basin lu et al 2012 and the sedimentation of poc in march was also significant therefore the extremely high doc poc ratio in the xld and xjb reservoirs represents the lowest sedimentation of poc among major world rivers moreover the hrt was short in the both reservoirs indicating that the sedimentation of poc may be limited thus we believed that the cumulative effect of poc was not significant in the xld and xjb reservoirs 4 2 ch4 accumulation influenced by terrigenous poc in deep valley cascade reservoirs rivers affected by dams have more complicated hydrological characteristics than those in lakes and rivers which changes ch4 dynamics in reservoirs young reservoirs are frequently believed to be significant ch4 emitters due to the decomposition of flooded oc prairie et al 2018 in this study dissolved ch4 displayed a significant positive relationship with terrigenous poc in the xld and xjb reservoirs in addition water level influenced by river flow here in the cascade systems indirectly but evidently affected dissolved ch4 concentration fig 7 although the input flux of terrigenous poc in the march was high production of ch4 by the terrigenous poc seemed plausible to be delayed as the higher level of dissolved ch4 was presented in may and july moreover the highest input flux of terrigenous poc in flood season also resulted an elevated ch4 concentration in water column from september to november due to the possible time delay however the explanation of dissolved ch4 r2 0 29 in the sem in such temporal dimension is not strong thus relationships among dissolved ch4 concentration and autochthonous and terrigenous poc in the spatial dimension need to be considered in further study damming hindered the water velocity resulting in increased hrt wang et al 2020 the relationships among hrt ch4 concentration fluxes of autochthonous and terrigenous poc are discussed below previous investigations have shown that autochthonous poc in lake with depths greater than 100 m was completely mineralized before carbon burial steinsberger et al 2020 additionally surface layer of sediments often do not have good stability and an anaerobic environment which results in autochthonous poc being more likely to be converted to co2 but not ch4 isidorova et al 2019 thus autochthonous poc flux displayed no significant relationship with dissolved ch4 in this study possibly because of the water depth of xld and xjb reservoirs more than 100 m yet autochthonous poc flux displayed a positive relationship with hrt fig 9 which may be explained by an increase in phytoplankton photosynthesis crawford et al 2016 the terrigenous poc flux and ch4 concentration in the xld and xjb reservoirs showed an evident positive correlation fig 9a the results of sem also highlight that the ch4 concentrations in the two reservoirs were positively influenced by terrigenous poc fig 9b these results suggested that terrigenous poc was the key factor for dissolved ch4 accumulation in the xld and xjb reservoirs furthermore we divided the study area into three sections along the longitudinal gradients l3 l1 b4 b1 as lacustrine regions before the dams with prolonged hrt b10 b8 x2 x1 as river regions right after the dams lotic system and b7 b5 as the transitional regions previous studies reported that transitional regions were a hotspot for potential burial and ch4 accumulation in water column delsontro et al 2011 yi et al 2021 although the sedimentation of poc was low the highest input flux of terrigenous poc between sampling sites b7 and b5 which promoted hotspots of dissolved ch4 appeared in the transitional regions especially at b6 4 3 low level of ch4 in deep valley cascade reservoirs in this study the annual average dissolved ch4 concentration 0 04 0 02 μmol l n 182 in the xld and xjb reservoirs was significantly lower than those in global rivers and streams 1 55 8 32 μmol l sd n 1316 obviously lower than average ch4 concentration with 0 92 μmol l in tropical amazonian reservoir petit saut and in about 15 quantile of ch4 concentration in global rivers and streams colas et al 2020 stanley et al 2016 dissolved ch4 was mainly fueled by terrigenous poc but the low sedimentation of poc may limit terrigenous poc inputs to produce ch4 in the xld and xjb reservoirs moreover a large fraction of ch4 in the aquatic food network exists as a carbon source which was microbially oxidized before being released into the overlying water whiticar and faber 1986 this may change ch4 dynamics in water column the aerobic ch4 consumption is caused by methane oxidizing bacteria mob which can survive at anoxic oxic interfaces in freshwater systems bagnoud et al 2020 bai et al 2021 reis et al 2020 the δ 13c value of biogenic methane during methanogenesis is less than 50 such as methanogenesis by acetate fermentation in freshwaters the δ 13c ch4 is then gradually elevated by microbial ch4 oxidation causing 13c enrichment in residual ch4 lima 2005 whiticar and faber 1986 the fractionation factor α of carbon isotope caused by microbial ch4 oxidation shows a large range of 1 003 to 1 039 templeton et al 2006 in this study there was no apparent anoxic water column in the both reservoirs the oxic surface layer of sediment and large water depth could have mitigated the release of ch4 bubbles potentially produced in the deep sediment layer this is a possible reason of the low dissolved ch4 concentration in water column at the dam site the most δ 13c ch4 in the water column were above 50 of methanogenesis by acetate fermentation fig s12a this indicates that ch4 was dominantly oxidized in the two reservoirs especially δ 13c ch4 in the lacustrine region had higher values and was significantly different from riverine reaches and transitional regions fig s12a moreover the dissolved ch4 concentration in most months decreased with increase of δ 13c ch4 fig s12b there is high level of confidence that dissolved ch4 distributions in the water column were actually influenced by biological processes the optimal do concentration for microbial oxidation of ch4 is reported to be from 0 5 mg l to 4 mg l ren et al 1997 thottathil et al 2019 microbial activity of ch4 oxidation can be strongly inhibited under high do concentration here in xld and xjb reservoirs the lowest do concentration in the surface and bottom water was 7 8 mg l it can be inferred that microbial activity of ch4 oxidation is weak in the surface and bottom water in our study most proportion of the produced ch4 must have been oxidized within the bottom sediment layer by mob frenzel et al 1990 the δ 13c ch4 in surface and bottom water also showed no significant differences only the δ 13c ch4 in bottom water from the xjb reservoir was significantly lower than that in surface water in march yet there was no significant difference in ch4 concentration fig 5 therefore dissolved ch4 in the surface and bottom water had been oxidized which may result in similar and lower ch4 concentrations in surface and bottom water in xld and xjb reservoirs although ch4 oxidation in water column may be not so evident the degree of ch4 oxidation in different water depths was apparently different fig s12a significantly the most ch4 oxidation process from b6 the hotspot of ch4 to b1 before dam in the xjb reservoir can be presented by rayleigh fractionation for example ch4 concentrations and δ 13c ch4 in the march july september 2018 and january 2019 satisfied the fractionation caused by microbial ch4 oxidation the fractionation factor α ranged from 1 01 to 1 035 fig 10 in summary microbial ch4 oxidation is likely the critical factor for lowing dissolved ch4 which may reduce consistent ch4 emissions in deep valley cascade reservoirs although the transport of ch4 may be also consumed in water profile there are some researches reporting that plankton in the presence of oxygen in the surface water and methane enriched water from shallow water zones can produce and increase the ch4 concentration in the surface water bogard et al 2014 fernández et al 2016 this may also result in similar dissolved ch4 concentrations in surface and bottom water however there are numerous factors influence ch4 accumulation in damming rivers yet more work needs to be done more modeling factors for different source poc on dissolved ch4 and ch4 oxidation in the reservoir profiles need to be considered 5 conclusions for multi purpose the xld and xjb perform apparent water level adjustments and river flow regulation shaping the transport of poc and ch4 dynamics in such cascade system yet the cumulative effect of poc due to cascade damming was not evident terrigenous poc accounted about 55 in poc displayed more persistent contributions to dissolved ch4 accumulation however the nature of low sedimentation of poc and microbial ch4 oxidation was believed to mitigate ch4 production in such deep valley cascade reservoirs than that in global rivers and streams this study provides a scientific basis for revealing the major reason and mechanisms of ch4 dynamics in high energy density reservoirs under reservoir scheduling operation and helps to further understanding of

15906,methane ch4 emissions from freshwaters to the atmosphere have a profound impact on global atmospheric greenhouse gas ghg concentrations anthropogenic footprints such as dam construction and reservoir operation significantly changed the fate and transport of ch4 in freshwaters the source of particulate organic carbon poc in reservoirs is a critical factor controlling ch4 production and emissions however little is known of how reservoir operation mediates the transport of poc and regulates ch4 accumulation in cascade hydroelectric reservoirs here spatial and temporal variations in poc and ch4 were explored in the xiluodu xld and xiangjiaba xjb reservoirs which are deep valley cascade reservoirs located in the main channel of the upper yangtze river based on the δ13c poc and n c mole ratio of particulate organic matter the results of multi endmember stable isotope mixing models by a bayesian model showed that terrigenous poc and autochthonous poc accounted for approximately 55 18 and 43 19 sd n 179 of poc respectively together with other hydrological and environmental parameters we found that the input of terrigenous poc was dominantly influenced by water level variations and flow regulation due to reservoir operation the cumulative effect of poc caused by cascade dams was not apparent terrigenous poc were more likely to drive ch4 accumulation in our study evident low level of ch4 in both reservoirs were likely affected by low sedimentation of poc and microbial ch4 oxidation we hope our study could provide a conceptual framework for further modeling of ch4 dynamics in cascade reservoirs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane dynamics terrigenous poc carbon footprint cascade reservoirs hydropower production 1 introduction methane ch4 is widely recognized as the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide co2 saunois et al 2020 the latest data showed that global atmospheric ch4 was 1900 5 ppb in september 2021 dlugokencky 2021 nearly triple pre industrial levels the growth of global ch4 emissions began a rapid and mysterious uptick since 2007 tollefson 2022 the annual increase in global atmospheric ch4 between 2007 and 2020 fell within a range of 7 84 ppb yr 1 to 15 74 ppb yr 1 dlugokencky 2021 such spiking dangerously fast growth in atmospheric ch4 is believed to create a feedback mechanism that will cause ever more ch4 to be released making it even harder to rein in rising temperatures tollefson 2022 however not all the sources of global ch4 emissions are well explained although half of the global ch4 emissions originate from the aquatic ecosystems rosentreter et al 2021 a large proportion of the uncertainties in the global ch4 budget arise from freshwater systems the production and emissions of ch4 in lakes and reservoirs are important processes in the global ch4 cycle this is partly because freshwater systems are closely linked to and manipulated by anthropogenic activities e g hydrological process regulation land use change bulk inputs of organic carbon oc and nutrients from surrounding communities stanley et al 2016 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2017 anthropogenic footprints significantly change the fate and transport of ch4 in freshwaters dam construction and reservoir impoundments are widely accepted as important anthropogenic activities that significantly change the sink and sources of ch4 in the freshwater systems beaulieu et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 according to the most recent estimates the ch4 emissions by rivers and reservoirs is about 26 8 tg yr 1 and 17 73 tg yr 1 respectively the total of both accounts for about 28 of the ch4 emissions by the global freshwaters ipcc 2021 in general the net increase in ch4 emissions due to reservoir formation primarily originates from the decomposition of organic matter om i e soil oc and vegetation cover reservoir ch4 emissions may reach the highest levels immediately after impoundment and exponentially decline with aging abril et al 2005 however sediment loads and reservoir productivity influenced by nutrient enrichments were regarded as stronger driving factors that regulate ch4 production and emissions than reservoir age in navigable river impoundments deemer et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2019 shi et al 2017 discussed that the largest share of ch4 emissions may be due to oc retention and mineralization in cascade reservoirs our recent findings explained that imbalanced stoichiometric sedimentation supported ch4 accumulation in the mid part of china s three gorges reservoir li et al 2020b growing evidences have highlighted the importance of reservoir hydrology and sediment or oc dynamics contributing to ch4 accumulation and emissions for example a large inputs of allochthonous oc contribute to ch4 emissions in amazonian reservoir petit saut colas et al 2020 these findings suggested that reservoir operation strategy significantly impacts oc further driving ch4 accumulation input of oc to reservoir in forms as suspended sediments is a complex mixture of autochthonous particulate organic carbon poc and allochthonous poc mainly terrigenous autochthonous poc derived from in situ primary production such as algae and aquatic microorganisms chen et al 2021 it exists in forms with almost no support tissues and is generally composed of protein and aliphatic compounds kendall et al 2001 bianchi and canuel 2011 terrigenous poc derived from river basin sources such as c3 and c4 plants and coastal soil which are primarily composed of cellulose and structural compounds kendall et al 2001 bianchi and canuel 2011 autochthonous poc is more labile and has been found to have a high bioavailability yet terrigenous poc was already partly degraded and less available for microorganisms guillemette et al 2013 autochthonous poc can be the main factor that fuels ch4 production in freshwaters such as lake fuxian and lake diamond in the usa li et al 2020a west et al 2012 nevertheless because terrigenous poc accounts for large proportions in sediment input it can also have a potential promotion effect on supporting long term ch4 accumulation and emissions such as the william h harsha reservoir in the usa berberich et al 2020 amazonian reservoir petit saut colas et al 2020 and the congo river upstill goddard et al 2017 moreover the reduced flow velocity and increased hydraulic retention time hrt from river to reservoir collect terrigenous oc from the upstream watershed to the bottom of reservoir contributing to the development of anoxic habitats at the reservoir bottom for intensive methanogenesis and carbon burial li et al 2020b this evidence supports a general view that reservoirs consistently emit ch4 which exceeds those of upstream of the same river and on average from natural lakes stanley et al 2016 understanding how reservoir operation mediates source and transport of poc and finally impacts ch4 dynamics from river valley cascade reservoirs can provide a framework to assess or predict reservoir ch4 emissions moreover if reservoir operation could have an evident link with poc variation and ch4 dynamics there would be best practices for the hydropower industry to reduce excessive ch4 emissions for example if ch4 accumulation is mainly affected by terrigenous poc reducing watershed inputs of oc could be the focus such as reducing agricultural activities and river bank stabilization if ch4 accumulation is primarily influenced by autochthonous poc reducing inputs of nutrients should be played more attention berberich et al 2020 these are meaningful to reduce carbon footprints of hydroelectricity from the life cycle perspective however little is known about the response of ch4 emissions to autochthonous and terrigenous poc dynamics in river valley cascade reservoirs the present study was extended from a single reservoir mostly reported to a cascade system in the upper yangtze river to explore dissolved ch4 accumulation and dynamics under reservoir operation the research objectives are 1 to characterize the input and sedimentation of poc in cascade reservoirs and 2 to explain how the different sources of poc regulate the dissolved ch4 dynamics in deep river valley reservoirs we hope our efforts in this study would provide a theoretical basis to elucidate mechanisms of ch4 dynamics under cascade reservoirs scheduling operation 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling campaign the xiluodu xld reservoir and xiangjiaba xjb reservoir are two deep river valley cascade reservoirs located along the main channel of the upper yangtze river which is frequently referred to the jinsha river fig 1 both sides of the xld and xjb reservoirs are mainly composed of bedrock fig s1 the xld and xjb hydro projects serve as hydroelectricity production facilities and also for flood control they perform significant seasonal water level adjustments i e high water level operation for hydroelectricity and low water level preparing enough reservoir capacity for holding floods fig 2 the initial impoundment of both reservoirs started in july 2013 xjb finished its impoundment in september 2013 while xld finished its full impoundment one year later the general description of the xld and xjb reservoirs is shown in table s1 the monthly hydroelectric production from the xld and xjb reservoir was provided by the china three gorges corporation www ctg com cn sampling campaign was conducted every two months between january 2018 and january 2019 flood season was from july to september the other months were considered as dry season in our study fifteen sampling sites were located along the main channel of both reservoirs i e l3 to l1 in the xld reservoir b10 to b1 in the xjb reservoir and x2 to x1 at the downstream of the xjb dam fig 1 fig s1 due to the difficulty in local transportation in the region our sampling work was limited at the reach 40 km upstream of the xld dam approximate 10 l water samples from surface and bottom layers were collected at 0 5 m below the water surface and approximately 2 m above the sediment at most sampling sites in the xld and xjb reservoirs fig 1b samples were collected only once at different sampling sites for the sampling sites located in river reach downstream of the both dams i e b10 to b9 and x2 to x1 fast running water and well mixed water column could not support vertical profile sampling thus surface water samples from these sampling sites were treated as representative of the water column about 1 l water was immediately

microscope soil samples n 18 were collected at the river bank of corresponding sampling sites along the both reservoirs in august and october 2020 dissolved ch4 and co2 was analyzed based on headspace approach li et al 2020b in brief water samples were collected by a 300 ml polypropylene syringe barrel and sealed underwater by its matching piston surplus water and possible air were ejected out

22 73 c in the xld and xjb reservoirs respectively water temperature was higher in the flood season figs s4 s5 the thermal stratification patterns of both reservoirs were apparently different in the two reservoirs in the xld temperature in the surface water was higher than that in the bottom water identifiable thermal stratification developed in the xld in spring i e march and persisted throughout the whole summer with the increase in water level in autumn together with the decrease in air temperature thermal stratification gradually disappeared in november fig s4 because the upstream of xld increased its discharge to prepare abundant reservoir capacity before the flood season the sampling sites from the b10 to b7 in the xjb was fully mixed in flood season however weak thermal stratification was initiated in march from the b6 to b1 at the dam site supporting its spring algal blooms and disappeared in september fig s5 the do in the xld and xjb reservoirs varied from 7 8 mg l to 14 76 mg l figs s6 s7 the do in surface water was significantly higher than that at the bottom layer in the xld and xjb in march due to strong photosynthesis during algal blooms because the chl a displayed the highest concentration in this month fig s9a the do in the xld showed significant stratification and increased with increasing water depth in may july and september the theoretical o2 solubility and sdo is more sensitive with water temperature compared with hydrostatic pressure in the xld vertical profile in the may and july section s1 2 fig s8 the higher do concentration in bottom water in the xld reservoir may be mainly influenced by thermal stratification the chl a concentration in surface water varied from 0 01 mg m3 to 35 02 mg m3 the maximum chl a

both reservoirs varied from 1 1 mg l to 38 8 mg l with a mean of 5 74 5 03 mg l n 182 and the maximum average tpm was found in july and september with a value of 10 78 4 34 mg l for both months n 52 the tpm at the bottom of water column displayed higher values in the january 2018 fig 3 the poc contents poc in the surface and bottom water varied from 1 3 to 53 07 with a mean of 8 68 10 12 n 180

with average values of 26 32 13 72 and 0 077 0 052 respectively n 24 meanwhile the maximum poc and pon in the surface and bottom water were found before the dams and the n c mole ratio from upstream was lower than those from downstream in march fig 3a 3b the δ 13c poc values in all samples ranged between 13 0 and 35 3 26 1 1 8 n 179 δ 13c poc in march showed apparently higher than the other months 24 4 3 4 n 24 fig 4a moreover based on the stable isotope mixing models poc in the xld l3 l1 and xjb b10 x1 reservoirs may have been primarily from plankton 47 19 41 18 and secondarily from c3

relatively high level of ch4 concentration among all samples comparatively the longitudinal gradient of co2 concentration along the cascade reservoir was not evident fig 5 the mole ratio between ch4 and co2 was among the highest in the middle of the xjb for temporal variation the highest ch4 concentration at the dam site of the xld was shown in the flood season moreover the peak values of ch4 concentrations at both the surface and bottom water of the xjb reservoir were observed during the flood season from b7 to b5 the difference of ch4 concentration between surface water and bottom water samples were not significant yet ch4 concentration at b6 in the september showed slightly higher values in the surface water than that at the bottom the lowest co2 concentration was found before the xjb dam in march due to algal bloom and the co2 concentration in surface water was significantly lower than that in bottom water fig 5 δ 13c ch4 in the surface and bottom water of both reservoirs ranged from 8 3 to 54 0 with a mean of 32 7 9 0 n 156 fig 5 δ 13c ch4 in all water samples showed apparent temporal and spatial variations and maximum values were found before the two dams lower δ 13c ch4 values were observed in march july and september from b7 to b6 where the peak value of ch4 concentration was found however most δ 13c ch4 in both surface and bottom water from the two reservoirs displayed similar variation except for that in march from the xjb reservoir fig 5a 5b 4 discussion 4 1 cascade damming effect on source and transport of poc the fate and transport of poc in a river can be significantly influenced by damming damming increased losses of river connectivity and reduced river flow which possibly decreased the transport of poc due to the prolonged hrt inducing bulk sedimentation and burial of poc in reservoirs almeida et al 2019 li et al 2020b in addition dam construction promotes primary production and the intensive water level fluctuations to cause landslides and debris flows and indirectly influence land use types which may increase the autochthonous and terrigenous poc in the reservoir yi et al 2021 iqbal et al 2018 luo et al 2016 wang et al 2020 zorzal almeida et al 2018 in this study the poc exhibited a positive relationship with the contribution of terrigenous poc implying that terrigenous poc was a major source for poc in the xld and xjb reservoirs fig s11 the autochthonous poc also accounted for proportion of poc with about 43 both terrigenous and autochthonous poc played key roles in transport of poc in both reservoirs the fluxes of terrigenous and autochthonous poc exhibited higher values in the march july and september fig 6 as exogenous variables in the sem the hydropower production water temperature and river flow showed positive relationships and the water level displayed a positive relationship with the hydropower production in the xld and xjb reservoirs fig 7 the river flow exhibited significantly positive effects on the fluxes of terrigenous and autochthonous poc in the xld and xjb reservoirs the hydropower production depended on river flow and water level may indirectly influence the fluxes of terrigenous and autochthonous poc in both reservoirs fig 7 due to the low clay content of surface soil in the river basin the particulate matter derived from soil erosion may have a low oc content wu et al 2020 yu et al 2011 the input of large inorganic particulate matter resulted that the contents of terrigenous and autochthonous poc in tpm during the flood season were lower than that in the dry season in the cascade reservoirs fig s10 however the higher fluxes of terrigenous and autochthonous poc in the july and september indicates large inputs of poc during this period fig 6 the abundant terrigenous poc was carried by higher runoff into river or resuspended by river flow during the flood season the water level showed a slightly positive effect on the autochthonous poc flux fig 7 in addition the spring algal blooms contributed to the elevation of autochthonous poc flux in the may which can be resuspended to result in a large input of autochthonous poc in the flood season although the water level displayed no significant effect on the flux of terrigenous poc in the sem fig 7 the high water level in january was drawdown gradually to march by reservoir scheduling operation fig 2c 2d which may lead to an increase in the flux of terrigenous poc in march fig 6 therefore the river flow and water level caused by reservoir scheduling operation were primary factors for the input of poc in the xld and xjb reservoirs the sedimentation of poc from upstream and riverbanks were primarily reflected by the mass balance calculation of poc fig 8 a according to the mass balance results of poc the output flux of poc was lower than the input flux of poc in the march november 2018 and january 2019 the sedimentation of poc was mainly reflected in these months especially in the march fig 8a although the input of poc was large during the flood season the sedimentation of poc was low in july and september however if the input from river bank and small tributaries or resuspended sediment are considered in the july and september there is still likely more large sedimentation of poc during the flood season fig 6 the doc poc ratio with a range of 0 08 to 8 7 in typical rivers of the world displayed an exponentially negative correlation with sediment yield ran et al 2013 in this study the average doc poc ratio in all months 11 4 6 27 n 172 fig 8b was higher than the global average doc poc ratio of 1 to 1 2 ran et al 2013 this indicates sediment yield in the xld and xjb reservoirs was lower than that in major world rivers although the doc poc ratio with an average value of 12 23 3 22 sd n 52 in flood season was higher than the major world rivers it was still lower than the other months 13 18 6 33 n 96 in the two reservoirs except for that in march fig 8b this indicates that sedimentation of poc during the flood season was more significant compared with other months moreover the doc poc ratio in the march 2 48 2 4 n 24 was close to the long chuan river in the jinsha river basin lu et al 2012 and the sedimentation of poc in march was also significant therefore the extremely high doc poc ratio in the xld and xjb reservoirs represents the lowest sedimentation of poc among major world rivers moreover the hrt was short in the both reservoirs indicating that the sedimentation of poc may be limited thus we believed that the cumulative effect of poc was not significant in the xld and xjb reservoirs 4 2 ch4 accumulation influenced by terrigenous poc in deep valley cascade reservoirs rivers affected by dams have more complicated hydrological characteristics than those in lakes and rivers which changes ch4 dynamics in reservoirs young reservoirs are frequently believed to be significant ch4 emitters due to the decomposition of flooded oc prairie et al 2018 in this study dissolved ch4 displayed a significant positive relationship with terrigenous poc in the xld and xjb reservoirs in addition water level influenced by river flow here in the cascade systems indirectly but evidently affected dissolved ch4 concentration fig 7 although the input flux of terrigenous poc in the march was high production of ch4 by the terrigenous poc seemed plausible to be delayed as the higher level of dissolved ch4 was presented in may and july moreover the highest input flux of terrigenous poc in flood season also resulted an elevated ch4 concentration in water column from september to november due to the possible time delay however the explanation of dissolved ch4 r2 0 29 in the sem in such temporal dimension is not strong thus relationships among dissolved ch4 concentration and autochthonous and terrigenous poc in the spatial dimension need to be considered in further study damming hindered the water velocity resulting in increased hrt wang et al 2020 the relationships among hrt ch4 concentration fluxes of autochthonous and terrigenous poc are discussed below previous investigations have shown that autochthonous poc in lake with depths greater than 100 m was completely mineralized before carbon burial steinsberger et al 2020 additionally surface layer of sediments often do not have good stability and an anaerobic environment which results in autochthonous poc being more likely to be converted to co2 but not ch4 isidorova et al 2019 thus autochthonous poc flux displayed no significant relationship with dissolved ch4 in this study possibly because of the water depth of xld and xjb reservoirs more than 100 m yet autochthonous poc flux displayed a positive relationship with hrt fig 9 which may be explained by an increase in phytoplankton photosynthesis crawford et al 2016 the terrigenous poc flux and ch4 concentration in the xld and xjb reservoirs showed an evident positive correlation fig 9a the results of sem also highlight that the ch4 concentrations in the two reservoirs were positively influenced by terrigenous poc fig 9b these results suggested that terrigenous poc was the key factor for dissolved ch4 accumulation in the xld and xjb reservoirs furthermore we divided the study area into three sections along the longitudinal gradients l3 l1 b4 b1 as lacustrine regions before the dams with prolonged hrt b10 b8 x2 x1 as river regions right after the dams lotic system and b7 b5 as the transitional regions previous studies reported that transitional regions were a hotspot for potential burial and ch4 accumulation in water column delsontro et al 2011 yi et al 2021 although the sedimentation of poc was low the highest input flux of terrigenous poc between sampling sites b7 and b5 which promoted hotspots of dissolved ch4 appeared in the transitional regions especially at b6 4 3 low level of ch4 in deep valley cascade reservoirs in this study the annual average dissolved ch4 concentration 0 04 0 02 μmol l n 182 in the xld and xjb reservoirs was significantly lower than those in global rivers and streams 1 55 8 32 μmol l sd n 1316 obviously lower than average ch4 concentration with 0 92 μmol l in tropical amazonian reservoir petit saut and in about 15 quantile of ch4 concentration in global rivers and streams colas et al 2020 stanley et al 2016 dissolved ch4 was mainly fueled by terrigenous poc but the low sedimentation of poc may limit terrigenous poc inputs to produce ch4 in the xld and xjb reservoirs moreover a large fraction of ch4 in the aquatic food network exists as a carbon source which was microbially oxidized before being released into the overlying water whiticar and faber 1986 this may change ch4 dynamics in water column the aerobic ch4 consumption is caused by methane oxidizing bacteria mob which can survive at anoxic oxic interfaces in freshwater systems bagnoud et al 2020 bai et al 2021 reis et al 2020 the δ 13c value of biogenic methane during methanogenesis is less than 50 such as methanogenesis by acetate fermentation in freshwaters the δ 13c ch4 is then gradually elevated by microbial ch4 oxidation causing 13c enrichment in residual ch4 lima 2005 whiticar and faber 1986 the fractionation factor α of carbon isotope caused by microbial ch4 oxidation shows a large range of 1 003 to 1 039 templeton et al 2006 in this study there was no apparent anoxic water column in the both reservoirs the oxic surface layer of sediment and large water depth could have mitigated the release of ch4 bubbles potentially produced in the deep sediment layer this is a possible reason of the low dissolved ch4 concentration in water column at the dam site the most δ 13c ch4 in the water column were above 50 of methanogenesis by acetate fermentation fig s12a this indicates that ch4 was dominantly oxidized in the two reservoirs especially δ 13c ch4 in the lacustrine region had higher values and was significantly different from riverine reaches and transitional regions fig s12a moreover the dissolved ch4 concentration in most months decreased with increase of δ 13c ch4 fig s12b there is high level of confidence that dissolved ch4 distributions in the water column were actually influenced by biological processes the optimal do concentration for microbial oxidation of ch4 is reported to be from 0 5 mg l to 4 mg l ren et al 1997 thottathil et al 2019 microbial activity of ch4 oxidation can be strongly inhibited under high do concentration here in xld and xjb reservoirs the lowest do concentration in the surface and bottom water was 7 8 mg l it can be inferred that microbial activity of ch4 oxidation is weak in the surface and bottom water in our study most proportion of the produced ch4 must have been oxidized within the bottom sediment layer by mob frenzel et al 1990 the δ 13c ch4 in surface and bottom water also showed no significant differences only the δ 13c ch4 in bottom water from the xjb reservoir was significantly lower than that in surface water in march yet there was no significant difference in ch4 concentration fig 5 therefore dissolved ch4 in the surface and bottom water had been oxidized which may result in similar and lower ch4 concentrations in surface and bottom water in xld and xjb reservoirs although ch4 oxidation in water column may be not so evident the degree of ch4 oxidation in different water depths was apparently different fig s12a significantly the most ch4 oxidation process from b6 the hotspot of ch4 to b1 before dam in the xjb reservoir can be presented by rayleigh fractionation for example ch4 concentrations and δ 13c ch4 in the march july september 2018 and january 2019 satisfied the fractionation caused by microbial ch4 oxidation the fractionation factor α ranged from 1 01 to 1 035 fig 10 in summary microbial ch4 oxidation is likely the critical factor for lowing dissolved ch4 which may reduce consistent ch4 emissions in deep valley cascade reservoirs although the transport of ch4 may be also consumed in water profile there are some researches reporting that plankton in the presence of oxygen in the surface water and methane enriched water from shallow water zones can produce and increase the ch4 concentration in the surface water bogard et al 2014 fernández et al 2016 this may also result in similar dissolved ch4 concentrations in surface and bottom water however there are numerous factors influence ch4 accumulation in damming rivers yet more work needs to be done more modeling factors for different source poc on dissolved ch4 and ch4 oxidation in the reservoir profiles need to be considered 5 conclusions for multi purpose the xld and xjb perform apparent water level adjustments and river flow regulation shaping the transport of poc and ch4 dynamics in such cascade system yet the cumulative effect of poc due to cascade damming was not evident terrigenous poc accounted about 55 in poc displayed more persistent contributions to dissolved ch4 accumulation however the nature of low sedimentation of poc and microbial ch4 oxidation was believed to mitigate ch4 production in such deep valley cascade reservoirs than that in global rivers and streams this study provides a scientific basis for revealing the major reason and mechanisms of ch4 dynamics in high energy density reservoirs under reservoir scheduling operation and helps to further understanding of

15907,sedimentation in waste water is a heavily studied topic but mainly focused on hindered and compression settling in secondary sludge a largely monodispersed solids where bulk sedimentation velocity is effectively described by functions such as double vesilind takacs however many waste water solids including primary sludge and anaerobic digester effluent are polydispersed for which application of velocity functions is not well understood these systems are also subject to large concentration gradients and poor availability of settling velocity functions has limited design and computational fluid dynamic cfd analysis of these units in this work we assess the use of various sedimentation functions in single and multi dimensional domains comparing model results against multiple batch settling tests at a range of high and low concentrations both solids concentration and sludge bed height interface over time are measured and compared the method incorporates uncertainty analysis using monte carlo regression direct dividing rectangles and newton optimisation it was identified that a double vesilind takacs model was most effective in the dilute regime 1 v v but could not effectively fit high solids concentrations 1 v v without a substantial 50 decrease in effective maximum sedimentation velocity v 0 other parameters r h r p did not change a power law velocity model diehl was significantly less predictive at low concentrations and not significantly better at higher concentrations the optimised model with reduction in v 0 was tested vs a standard optimised double vesilind velocity model in a simple primary sedimentation unit and resulted in deviation from 12 to 18 in solids capture prediction from underload to overload washout conditions indicating that the effect is important in cfd based analysis of these systems keywords polydisperse sludge sedimentation computational fluid dynamics monte carlo openfoam dakota python 1 introduction sedimentation of particulate species is a critical process in the waste water treatment industries especially in the context of secondary settling in these processes hindered settling occurs where the suspension sedimentation velocity is less than the free settling velocity of an isolated particle due to particle particle hydrodynamic interactions and upflow of the suspending fluid when the suspension particles are relatively uniform in size e g activated sludge secondary sludges this results in a clear zone supernatant a hindered settling zone type 3 and a compression zone type 4 tchobanoglous et al 2014 a sharp interface can often be observed between the hindered settling zone and the supernatant although particle velocity fluctuations can potentially generate dispersion around this interface in practice these fluctuations are mitigated by local hindered settling that maintains a well defined interface guazzelli and hinch 2011 tee et al 2002 generating a characteristic mean sedimentation velocity this sedimentation velocity depends on the local solids concentration and is independent of container shape or size batchelor 1972 hinch 1977 in batch settling tests the suspension supernatant interface height can be tracked over time to generate flux concentration curves diehl 2007 lester et al 2005 or extract parameters for velocity concentration models cole 1968 kynch 1952 richardson 1954 takacs et al 1991 vesilind 1968 either of which can be subsequently be used for prediction and design of sedimentation processes therefore determining the sedimentation characteristics of activated and secondary sludges from batch settling tests is a robust and straightforward process conversely suspensions with significantly non uniform particle size shape and density distributions such as anaerobic sewage treatment effluent and primary settling tanks sludges are much more challenging to characterise first the sedimentation velocity of each species is a function of the local solids concentration of all other species instead of a sharp visible interface between the clear and hindered zone there is usually a solids concentration gradient due to the continuous range of settling velocities of the isolated particles that comprise these polydisperse systems the sedimentation dynamics of such strongly polydisperse suspensions can be very complex as they can exhibit strong particle segregation and stratification bürger et al 2002 complex flow structures during sedimentation nguyen and ladd 2005 and increased velocity fluctuations and dispersion near interfaces guazzelli and hinch 2011 nguyen and ladd 2005 polydisperse suspensions can also exhibit fundamentally different sedimentation dynamics batchelor 1982 batchelor and van rensburg 1986 bürger et al 2002 that range from stable where particles in each class are homogeneously distributed horizontally to unstable where different particles classes form vertical columnar structures that give rise to a localised boycott effect regardless of sedimentation stability macroscopic models of polydisperse sedimentation are typically couched in terms of a characteristic mean sedimentation velocity for each particle class i e size shape density which may be represented as discrete classes bürger et al 2002 or a continuous spectrum bürger et al 2008 these sedimentation velocities depend upon the solids concentration of the relevant particle class and the total local solids concentration batchelor 1982 lockett and bassoon 1979 masliyah 1979 in either case the determination of the sedimentation velocity of each particle class from experimental observations even for simple model systems such as bidisperse suspensions is currently an open problem conversely waste water treatment applications require accurate and straightforward methods to characterise the sedimentation velocity of primary sludges and effluents to facilitate quantification design and optimisation of industrial sedimentation processes thus the challenge is to develop practical robust and accurate tools and techniques to characterise the sedimentation velocity of these complex suspensions from dilute to highly concentrated solids concentrations for these reasons empirical relationships are typically used for design tchobanoglous et al 2014 which do not require concentration velocity functions and do not rely on the dimensional analysis or application of a mono disperse assumption with limited ability to measure parameters this results in a more limited design approach and means that computational fluid dynamics cannot be adequately used for design and analysis even post hoc since velocity concentration models are fundamental to this analysis samstag et al 2016 furthermore there is limited understanding of whether a monodispersed assumption is appropriate for these types of suspensions as the rheology and mechanical properties of waste water sludges vary enormously non linearly with solids concentration eshtiaghi et al 2013 stickland 2015 then minor errors in the characterisation of sedimentation velocity and thus predicted solids concentration distribution can lead to significant errors in modelling and prediction of waste water treatment processes these issues currently hinder model based design and analysis of industrial processes including primary settlers anaerobic lagoons and sewage systems hindered settling models commonly used for secondary sludges are characterised in terms of the empirical functional forms used to describe solids settling velocity as a function of concentration the first model type uses an exponential function of solids concentration vesilind 1968 which was subsequently extended by takacs et al 1991 to incorporate a second exponential term to improve prediction at low concentrations double vesilind this is the most widely used model for the simulation of sedimentation in secondary and primary sludge applications brennan 2001 gernaey et al 2001 lakehal et al 1999 ramin et al 2014 although the takacs model is designed for polydisperse suspensions it does not resolve the higher solids concentration behaviour as it focuses on dilute and hindered zones the combined htc model hindered transient and compression proposed by ramin et al 2014 utilises vesilind exponential settling functions coupled with a simple model for compression once the sludge forms a continuous solids matrix gel point this model was used to simulate sedimentation and consolidation of a secondary sludge material to an acceptable degree of accuracy over the entire expressed solids concentration range model parameters are estimated by tracking the evolution of the suspension supernatant interface over time and so is limited to secondary and activated sludge the second model type utilises a power law for the velocity concentration relationship cole 1968 such as the richardson zaki law richardson 1954 which corresponds to analytic expressions for sedimentation of colloidal spheres in the dilute limit batchelor 1977 hinch 1977 as such power law functions have been used extensively in applications of the theory of sedimentation and consolidation of colloidal suspensions bürger 2000 buscall and white 1987 and more recently these functional forms have been used to characterise the sedimentation of activated sludge de clercq et al 2008 plósz et al 2007 torfs et al 2017 when combined with an appropriately characterised model for sludge compression the power law sedimentation velocity function is particularly effective in describing compression zone settling in secondary settling tanks bürger et al 2011 stickland 2015 the vast majority of waste water sedimentation characterisation methods have focused on secondary waste water sludges which have been used to model the total solids concentrations in secondary settlers and clarifiers conversely accurate sedimentation characterisation methods for primary waste water sludges are an outstanding challenge brennan 2001 dahl 1995 griborio et al 2014 liu and garcía 2011 in many cases models developed for secondary sludges are applied to primary sludges without any testing or further modification most commonly using takacs et al 1991 without adding a compression component brennan 2001 liu and garcía 2011 only limited studies to date ramin et al 2014 have focused on characterising sedimentation that could be used in the dilute and concentrated regimes but these have not been validated in the full range of solids concentration particularly in dilute regions hence robust and accurate characterisation methods are required to facilitate accurate prediction design and optimisation of high solids gradient sludge process units the challenge associated with such types of sludges is that they are highly polydisperse leading to complex sedimentation behaviours and an absence of a well defined sediment supernatant interface that is often used as a key data source for characterisation diehl 2007 kynch 1952 lester et al 2005 furthermore it is also clear that conventional polydisperse sedimentation models are too complex to facilitate robust characterisation hence an important research question is whether simplified characterisation methods based upon e g a monodisperse paradigm or variations thereof are appropriate for high solids concentration range sludges sedimentation velocity is generally characterised in batch sedimentation tests tchobanoglous et al 2014 and parameters are generally identified using a 1d model takacs et al 1991 tchobanoglous et al 2014 clarifier process models are almost always 1d normally using a takacs model while cfd is most commonly done in 2d with 3d being increasingly used griborio et al 2022 as sedimentation is an inherently unstable process due to strong gravity currents even in the monodisperse case it remains unclear whether a 3d sedimentation model that resolves these currents can result in a different characteristic settling velocity than the 1d 2d case the majority of sedimentation studies do not assess simplification to 1d or 2d in either batch sedimentation or lab or full scale process applications finally only a small number of conventional sedimentation characterisation methods have been validated or have incorporated uncertainty analysis limiting the development of model based design tools in this study we attempt to address the above challenges by developing and testing a robust and accurate method for characterisation of the sedimentation velocity of primary sludges and effluents method development is based upon cfd modelling and batch sedimentation tests performed upon a polydisperse sludge sampled from an anaerobic lagoon of a major waste water treatment facility this sludge is representative of polydispersed solids including primary sludge in that it does not exhibit a clear interface during batch sedimentation and the solids concentration range expressed in these tests is broader than that of primary settlers starting with conventional sedimentation and compression models for monodisperse suspensions exponential and power law models with and without compression are optimised and parameter uncertainty estimated in both high and low solids using an algebraic slip i e drift flux cfd approach the models are then tested in a continuous flow pilot clarifier system at under load normal and overload washout conditions to identify the sensitivity of actual systems to the models identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sludge samples were collected from an anaerobic lagoon treating municipal sewage located in melbourne victoria australia the sludge had total solids content of 6 7 wt with a volatile solids fraction or total solids of 61 the total solids content of the sample was determined according to apha 2540b 105 c for 24 h apha 2005 volatile solids content of the sample was measured according to apha 2540e 550 c for 2 h apha 2005 the total dissolved solids content was 0 108 wt and the solids density was 1829 k g m 3 dissolved solids was measured by filtration through a 0 22 μ m cellulose acetate membrane followed by oven drying at 105 c for 24 h the solids density of the sample was calculated from the measured values of density and solids concentration of the suspension and density and total dissolved solids content high concentration sludge was obtained from the centrifugation of sample at 3500 rpm for 2 h in a beckman coulter allegra x 12 centrifuge suspension density was measured using a calibrated density cup whereas the liquor density was measured using a calibrated pycnometer 2 2 methods 2 2 1 novel characterization approach to identify the capability of models to effectively describe polydisperse sedimentation behaviour across a broad solids range we developed tests at both low and high solids concentrations the tests conducted measured change in 1 d solids concentrations at different heights over time in the low concentration range and sludge bed height over time in the high concentration range these were then simulated using open source cfd software openfoam the dilute tests are assessed initially with all three candidate models diehl 2015 takacs et al 1991 vesilind 1968 optimised and assessed on this system 3 tests with 3 different initial conditions which includes parameter uncertainty quantification these models are then tested on the high concentration tests incorporating compression and the optimal model parameters and confidence regions assessed ideally confidence regions for dilute and concentrated ranges should overlap which would indicate the model is valid across the whole range as noted in the results this was not the case but effectively only one parameter was impacted by the change in concentration 2 2 2 dilute settling test dilute settling experiments were conducted in a 2 m high cylindrical column with an outer diameter of 100 mm shown in fig 1 the cylindrical column had sampling ports on one side 15 mm diameter valves the first sampling port was 250 mm from the base and there were 10 more sampling ports spaced evenly 150 mm apart the top sampling port was 250 mm from the top of the column there was a valve at the base of the column to facilitate drainage and cleaning feed samples for the experiment were prepared by diluting the concentrated sludge samples using liquor free of any suspended solids to the three initial conditions of 3 86 g l 4 75 g l and 5 76 g l at the beginning of the dilute settling experiment 15 k g of diluted sludge sample was poured into the cylindrical pipe from the top a timer was started as soon as the sample loading was completed and samples were drawn from each port except the top two ports at five minutes intervals for the first thirty minutes and at ten minutes intervals for the next thirty minutes after ten minutes no samples were drawn from the top two ports the total suspended solids and weight of each sample were measured the volume loss from drawing samples were recorded for each sample with time stamp to include in the 3d model and evaluate the impact of sampling on sedimentation behaviour 2 2 3 concentrated batch settling test concentrated settling tests were conducted at lower concentrations than as received sludge by diluting the samples with their own liquor down to 0 7 0 85 vol 1 258 1 543 wt the lower limit of 1 258 wt was the minimum high solids concentration for that material to have an optically observable defined solids liquid interface at concentrations higher than 1 543 wt sedimentation was excessively slow which resulted in autogenic gas production which disrupted the test the liquor was obtained from the centrifugation of sample at 3500 rpm for 2 h in a beckman coulter allegra x 12 centrifuge the solids volume fraction was calculated from the suspended solids content and the solids and liquor densities the samples were poured into a 500 ml measuring cylinder and the solid liquid interfacial height was recorded over time using a video camera visual observations of interface height during the test and video recordings were used to develop a solid liquid interface height profile over time 2 3 modelling approach 2 3 1 fluid dynamics and physics openfoam was used as a cfd simulation platform specifically a multi phase based numerical solver utilising algebraic slip drift flux between the phases the drift flux approach models different phases as a variable density heterogeneous mixture and solves for both the mixture velocity and solids concentration where the drift flux of the solids phase relative to the mixture velocity is given by the concentration dependent sedimentation velocity functions as provided below the mixture has a continuous phase water in this case and one or more dispersed phases which are subject to sedimentation velocity in addition to continuous phase convection the sedimentation velocity function combined with the mixture approach incorporates momentum transfer between the phases implicitly the alternative approach euler euler would require simulation of multiple separate phases and an explicit sedimentation function with momentum transfer considered separately which increases the complexity of the solver and required computational cost and makes the use of empirical sedimentation functions more difficult the default turbulence model used is a modified k ϵ with buoyancy term described in brennan 2001 and lakehal et al 1999 the model takes mixture viscosity as input then adds the turbulence contribution the buoyancy term is based on the density gradient generated from the mixture composition based on test cases in fig 3 it was determined that the effect of turbulence is negligible due to the extremely slow velocity in the experimental cases however a similar modification as in brennan 2001 was done to a standard k ω sst and les large eddy simulation smagorinsky 1963 models which proved to be more numerically stable than the original modified k ϵ model those models were utilized in some of the 3d simulations the default rheology model in the open foam drift flux model is a bingham plastic mixture viscosity model from brennan 2001 and dahl 1995 model parameters are a function of solids concentration dahl 1995 identifies that this should be improved for large scale predictions however several test cases were optimised and fitted using the default model and a specifically fitted model for the material using a herschel bulkley model differences were marginal due to the low velocity profiles overall 2 3 2 sludge sedimentation models in this section we consider conventional models for sludge sedimentation some of which are extended to account for non settling fractions the first model under consideration is the classical vesilind model vesilind 1968 which uses a single exponential function for the sedimentation velocity v s 1 v s c v 0 e r h c here c g l represents the suspended solids concentration v 0 m s is the maximum sedimentation velocity c 0 and r h l g is a parameter that characterises hindering of sedimentation velocity with increasing solids concentration this model was implicitly developed for monodisperse suspensions as the functional form eq 1 quantifies hindered settling in terms of a single unique sedimentation velocity that only depends upon the total solids concentration the vesilind model was extended by takacs et al 1991 to account for the presence of different particle fractions in polydisperse suspensions it was considered that the suspension consists of three broad classes of particles a non setting fraction c min of small particles a range of poor settling particles and a range of rapidly settling particles this leads to a sedimentation velocity model of the form 2 v s c 0 c c min v 0 e r h c c min e r p c c min c c min where c min represents the concentration of non settling particles and the additional parameter r p l g with r p r h characterises sedimentation in the low solids concentration range this implicitly polydisperse sedimentation model is markedly different to the vesilind model in eq 1 in that a non settling fraction c min is accounted for and the sedimentation velocity is non monotonic increasing from zero at c c min to a maximum value at intermediate solids concentrations before decaying exponentially at large c we also consider the power law sedimentation model proposed by diehl 2015 in eq 3 3 v s c v 0 1 c x q where the fitting parameters x g l and q govern the changes in magnitude of hindered settling with increasing solids concentration it is instructive to compare the takacs model with the explicit polydisperse sedimentation model of masliyah 1979 derived from first principles by bürger et al 2008 which characterises the sedimentation velocity v s i of each particle class i 1 n as 4 v s i c c i α i c ρ i ρ c g for i 1 n here c c 1 c n is the vector of n solids concentrations c i for each particle class i 1 n ρ i is the density of the i th particle class ρ c is the volume averaged suspension density i e ρ c i 1 n c i ρ i 1 i 1 n c i ρ f where ρ f is the fluid density g is gravitational acceleration and α i c quantifies viscous drag between the i th particle class and the fluid velocity in practice this drag term is very difficult to characterise for each particle class as it must be determined throughout the n dimensional space c of all concentration combinations of all particle classes to overcome this difficulty lockett and bassoon 1979 propose the richardson zaki richardson 1954 functional form for the viscous drag coefficients as 5 α i c d i 2 18 μ f c i 1 c n c 2 for i 1 n were c i 1 n c i is the total solids fraction d i is the diameter of particle class i μ f is the viscosity of the suspending fluid and the index n is a weak function of c under the assumption n n c and uniform solids density ρ s across all particle classes a reasonable assumption for waste water sludges the settling velocity of each particle class simplifies to be solely a function of the total solids concentration c as 6 v s i c d i 2 g ρ s ρ f 18 μ f 1 c n 1 for i 1 n in a 1d batch settling model the solids concentration field c i for each species is then described by the continuity equation 7 c i t x c i v s i c 0 for i 1 n summing over all solids classes also yields a conservation equation for the total solids fraction 8 c t x i 1 n c i v s i c 0 the takacs model is similar to this polydisperse sedimentation model in that the sedimentation velocity of each particle class is solely a function of the total solids concentration c the major difference is that the takacs model does not resolve sedimentation of each particle class i but rather lumps them all together into a single solids flux model 9 c t x c v s c 0 v s c 1 c i 1 n c i v s i c although the contribution of the non settling fraction to this approximation is exact as v s 1 0 for the other fraction the total settling velocity v s c is non unique in that different distributions of particle fractions c i can yield the same total solids concentration c however if consideration is limited to sedimentation processes in a quiescent suspension such as 1d batch sedimentation it may be assumed that the distribution of c i can only vary to a limited degree for a given solids concentration this is a reasonable approximation in regions where the local total solids concentration c is less than or equal to the initial concentration c 0 as the fastest sedimenting particles settle out first and so the solids distribution evolves in a unique manner conversely c is not uniquely determined by c in regions where c c 0 as different particle classes i can contribute to this increase in total solids as sedimentation proceeds due to e g segregation at the interface of the supernatant and hindered zone however depending upon the particle size distribution this variation may be limited in some systems furthermore differential sedimentation ceases in the compression zone due to the formation of a contiguous solids matrix thus the polydisperse nature of the suspension explains the non monotone form of the sedimentation velocity profile in eq 2 in the dilute range sedimentation velocity increases with solids concentration as more rapidly settling particles are present whereas at higher solids concentrations this effect becomes less pronounced and hindered settling eventually takes over reducing the sedimentation rate it is important to note that the exponential functional form of the takacs model does not necessarily mean that the sedimentation velocity profile v s i c of each individual particle class is exponential indeed it may follow eq 5 but rather this exponential form arises from the convolution of the sludge particle size distribution with v s i c hence while the takacs model involves a number of assumptions and approximations that have not been extensively tested it is closely related to ab initio models of polydisperse sedimentation and it does appear to capture the fundamental dynamics of these systems its continuous and smooth functional form eq 2 indicates that it applies to polydisperse suspensions with a continuous particle size distributions the success of this model is that it can capture these complex dynamics in a simple model that only has a small number of fitting parameters several of which have direct physical meaning the major drawback of this model is that as the underlying approximations have not been extensively tested it is difficult to determine limits of applicability of this model to impart some of the advantages on the takacs model to the vesilind and diehl models we apply the concept of a non settling fraction c min in the takacs model to these models such that the solids concentrations values c in eq 1 and eq 3 is replaced by c c min where settling velocity for any concentration below c min is zero that modification will make both diehl and vesilind describe the settling velocity in a bidisperse manner to provide compatibility with the cfd model the solids concentrations c values in all equations were converted to dimensionless solids volume fractions using the measured densities of both solids and liquor from the samples used all models were modified to have an explicit solids volume fraction limit of 12 vol to provide numerical stability at extremely high concentrations this limit was determined based on operational observation in the lagoon to represent the highest practical concentration observed over years of operations 2 3 3 compression model the compression model developed by buscall and white 1987 and bürger et al 2005 amongst many similar models in the literature can be expressed in terms of the total solids volume fraction α d as 10 α d t α d v m α d ρ c ρ m v h s d c o m p α d γ α d where α d is the solids volume fraction α c r is critical volume fraction gel point at which the solids phase forms a continuous network that can withstand and transmit stress ρ c is the density of the continuous liquid phase ρ d is the density of the dispersed solids phase ρ α α ρ s 1 α ρ f is the density of the solids and liquid mixture v h s is the hindered settling velocity and σ e is derivative of the effective solid stress as expressed in de clercq et al 2008 the compression term is 11 d c o m p 0 when 0 α α c r ρ d g ρ d ρ c v h s α σ e α when α α c r after converting all

ρ d and α d represents the value of solids volume fraction dispersed phase for the full details on the development of the equations related to the compression model implemented see valle medina and laurent 2020 2 3 4 geometry and meshing the dilute and concentrated batch settling columns were cylindrical as described earlier the dilute settling column had cylindrical ports at the side used to take samples out at specific heights in each case a 3d mesh was built using structured methodology ansys icem advanced meshing where all cylindrical shapes followed an o grid topology to reduce maximum non orthogonality below 45 cell count for dilute and concentrated respectively was 263 749 and 242 688 hexahedral cells which are the counts that achieved mesh independence additional 1d and 2d structured meshes were built for the same geometries to compare to the 3d simulations the 1d mesh was a single column of 2000 hexahedral cells across the middle of the cylinder the 2d mesh was a rectangular slice across the middle of each cylinder with 36 369 and 48 951 hexahedral orthogonal cells for dilute and concentrated respectively both the 1d and 2d meshes were independent at the mentioned cell count 2 3 5 boundary and initial conditions all wall boundary conditions were set to no slip for velocity fixed flux pressure and zero gradient solids in the experimental set for the dilute settling column samples were drawn out of the system over time this induced flow fields in the system and affected solids mass inside the column the effect of sampling was considered in the 3d validation against experimental results with one simplification that the top of the column in the 3d model displaces the removed volume with water at low inlet velocity to maintain the incompressible mass balance and avoid the need to include an air gap on the top boundary the outlet ports were all included and the measured volume withdrawn for samples was modelled as flow out of the settling column surface velocities at the top boundary were negligible and had no impact but the volume lost had an impact that was evaluated and discussed in section 3 1 in the 1d and 2d simulations the boundaries were exactly the same but replacing the removed spacial dimension with an empty boundary the volume loss due to samples drawn out of the dilute settling column was not included in 1d 2d for comparison purpose 2 3 6 parameter optimisation and uncertainty quantification a parameter sensitivity and optimisation process as identified in section 2 2 1 was used analysing firstly dilute tests using the three novel settling models concentrated tests using the same models coupled with compression then assessing two combined models capable of simulating both dilute and concentrated ranges parameters values and correlated confidence regions were compared across all tests in general parameters were sampled broadly using monte carlo techniques and then at a high frequency around the optimum gradient and non gradient search techniques were used to find actual optima and the true confidence region was identified as noted below the uncertainty quantification studies were performed using a coupled process of three open source platforms openfoam dakota and python where openfoam is the cfd simulation platform dakota provides the seeding sampling collection algorithm wrapping the cfd simulation python provides the numerical adjustment from openfoam output to dakota algorithm the output from cfd simulation in case of the dilute batch settling is solids volume fraction at specific heights over time which is edited and shaped by python scripts to calculate rss residual sum of squares and then forwarded to collection algorithm to compile dakota in case of the concentrated settling the cfd simulation output is solids volume fraction over vertical line in the middle of the geometry at each time step simulated python scripts process the output files determine potential solids liquid interfaces from the vertical concentration derivative and outputs the spatial interface from the maximum derivative this results in a calculated sbh sludge bed height at each time which is compared to experimental results to calculate rss this value is forwarded to the collection algorithm to compile as in dilute case the selection and seeding algorithm used is lhs latin hyper cube which is a randomised walk monte carlo procedure the compiled output is an objective function of rss with regards to parameters sets the studies in both cases were ran in series of 1000 2000 simulations blocks in general a coarse range of input parameter values was used in initial simulations to determine approximate optima followed by a fine set of simulations to determine actual optima and confidence limits the global minimum value of rss is j o p t and the value of j c r i t were determined by an f distribution dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 test as in eq 13 13 j c r i t j o p t 1 p n d a t a p f α p n d a t a p where j o p t is the minimum value found for the objective function residual sum of squares and f α p n d a t a p is the value of f distribution with p and n d a t a p degrees of freedom and a confidence level α 95 for final optimization j o p t from the uncertainty study was checked using a derivative free direct method dividing rectangles to find global optima with wide bounds this was followed by a newton optimisation to confirm convergence to the local optima the results were compared to confirm the uncertainty study findings or correct j o p t if found to be different 2 3 7 pilot continuous simulations the pilot shown in fig 8 is 2 m long 0 5 m wide 0 3 m high at the inlet side 0 4 m high at outlet side bottom is sloped at 1 10 inlet pipe diameter is 0 1 m and underflow is a centralised square outlet with edge length of 0 1 m following a typical primary settling tank design the flow rate of the underflow is 1 20 to the inlet flow rate the pilot was simulated at three set of inlet flow rates 5 9 l min 29 4 l min and 58 8 l min with the underflow adjusted accordingly the simulation time for the mentioned flow rates was 48 12 and 6 h respectively which is 24 48 times the hrt hydraulic retention time in each case pilot total volume is 0 3525 m 3 and hrt value at the lowest flow rate is 1 h the mesh built for the geometry is structured fully hexahedral with a cell count of 850 976 based on the mesh independence test for the boundary and initial conditions the inlet and underflow were set to flow rate controlled and the outlet over flow weir was set to free flow out the starting sludge bed height was 10 of the total height with uniform solids volume fraction of 3 5 and the inlet solids volume fraction was 0 1 the equivalent of 1 g l 3 results and discussion 3 1 dilute settling column sampling effect samples drawn during the dilute settling column did reduce the mass of solids inside the domain this resulted in a 10 mm sludge bed height difference between the two 3d simulations with and without samples fig 2 as well as minor differences at the top of the column however differences in solid phase velocities and hence concentration profiles between 3d with sampling 3d without sampling and 1 2d were negligible fig 3 this was mainly because of the low initial concentrations and the overall low velocity profiles the 3d vs 1 2d as shown in fig 3 also indicates negligible impacts of turbulence and boundary effects this shows approximately 5 deviation for 1d and almost identical 2d and 3d results since the sludge bed height is not the focus of this test the 1d 2d models without sampling may be used used for optimization and uncertainty analysis 3 2 dilute settling column simulations as noted in methods the three initial conditions assumed to be uniform were 3 86 g l 4 75 g l and 5 76 g l each of the initial conditions was optimised separately using each model to check these values the total residual sum of squares and optimised parameters for the three models are combined and detailed in table 1 notably the takacs sum of residuals is one order of magnitude less than both diehl and vesilind representing a significantly better model therefore only uncertainty analysis for the takacs model is presented here in terms of simulations required direct optimization required 150 200 iterations newton optimization required 20 iterations and additional parameter sampling to identify confidence regions was 6000 simulations the effect of non uniform initial concentrations in the experiment could be observed from fig 3a and b at 300 and 600 sec leading to deviation the downward deviation could be a results of the same non uniform initial condition or alternatively due to polydispersed behaviour not captured by the optimised model the relatively large size of the column added to non uniform initial conditions however unless a non intrusive accurate method of measuring the solids concentration is used a larger volume is necessary to draw sufficient samples without having a significant impact on the sedimentation behaviour additionally the simulation outlet boundary condition needs to take into account the hydrostatic pressure difference between the higher and lower ports which will lead to more solids drawn out from lower ports such measure could not be captured accurately in cfd unless an air phase is introduced to the model where the water column inside the simulation will decrease with time and take into account that effect the 95 confidence regions for parameters from the dilute tests are shown in fig 4 for each concentration together with correlated ellipses also shown is the region identified from the concentrated batch settling uncertainty studies for two concentrations between 12 16 g l section 3 3 as can be seen the three regions overlap with moderate uncertainty ranges 20 v 0 had the highest sensitivity followed by r h while r p had the lowest sensitivity from fig 4b a positive correlation is present between v 0 and r h and a weak negative correlation between v 0 and r p in fig 4c overlap of the three dilute tests indicate that the solids behave consistently in this range 4 6 g l as noted v 0 decreased significantly in the concentrated batch settling tests while the r h and r p ranges overlapped indicating that the material is behaving consistently at 12 16 g l but with a decreased velocity it is interesting that both r h and r p can be identified and are consistent across the fairly broad range of concentrations the 12 16 g l confidence region results from the same uncertainty study based on the concentrated batch settling also shown in fig 4 the plotted region is the result of combining takacs with compression model tc and optimizing all parameters for both components against the concentrated batch settling experimental tests that means that range is the optimum 95 confidence region of the concentrated settling behaviour for the same sludge if the regions did overlap between dilute and concentrated the behaviour could be modelled with a high degree of accuracy using one settling function and compression model however that non overlap means optimizing the concentrated solids range will lead to increased errors in dilute solids range and vice versa 3 3 concentrated batch settling simulations 3 3 1 continuous function models the two higher concentration tests in lab scale cylinders were numerically simulated for 4 h each measuring solids interface over time using the same methodology all three models vesilind takacs diehl were optimised for all parameters sedimentation and compression when coupled with the compression model from values in table 2 the rss is similar for all three models the sludge bed height over time plots were almost identical and demonstrate they are functionally the same v 0 consistently dropped with all three models which suggests that a further decrease in v 0 is required in addition to the compression to describe the increase in hindered behaviour as solids concentration increases towards the compression zone the uncertainty quantification studies were performed over 6000 simulations for tc takacs and compression model and 4000 simulations for each of vc and dc vesilind diehl and compression model the optimisation using direct and newton methodology required 200 250 iterations combined for each model to visualise the difference due to the significant drop in v 0 compared to dilute optimum parameters the takacs model dilute 95 ci range was plotted against the takacs compression 95 ci range in fig 4 the clear separation in confidence regions in fig 4a shows that if the dilute parameters 3 6 g l are fixed to optimum while only compression parameters in eq 12 are optimised to fit the experimental data the rss in concentrated range rises by one order of magnitude table 2 and the visual fit is poor fig 6 to further assess whether the apparent difference in v 0 was due to compression or hindering takacs parameters were set to the optimum from table 1 and only compression parameters modified the optimum values shown in table 2 tc dilute opt identify the compression model attempting to address deviations by raising the value of α c r to reduce the settling velocity however the optimal rss is an order of magnitude compared to tc conc opt when done in reverse and focused on concentrated only the rss in dilute increased by two orders of magnitude these results indicate a simple global takacs model is not suitable for wide solids concentration ranges even when coupled with compression model while it is necessary to maintain a simple practical model it is also necessary to maintain an acceptable level of accuracy the practical implications of this are further discussed below 3 3 2 combined function models this section assesses combination of two settling models with compression following the same concept in ramin et al 2014 the first combined model is referred to as tdc takacs diehl and compression model which utilises takacs for dilute diehl above the switch value and compression that is eq 2 applies at concentrations lower than the switch and eq 3 above the switch incorporating compression the second combined model is tvc takacs vesilind and compression with eq 2 at concentrations below the switch and eq 1 above the switch as shown in fig 5 the value of c s w i t c h has been optimized to be 0 7 vol solids volume fraction the takacs model in both cases has the three optimal parameters taken from dilute settling tests in section 3 2 the tdc has an additional 6 parameters to describe the concentrated range v 2 x q α c r β λ while the tvc model has an additional 5 parameters v 2 r v α c r β λ these additional parameters were optimised using the concentrated tests 12 71 and 15 58 g l the optimised rss for the tdc function was 2 944 x 10 3 whereas for the tvc function it was 9 575 x 10 4 tdc optimised parameters are shown in table 3 while tvc optimised parameters are shown in table 4 as shown in fig 6 the two models are not functionally different and similar in 1 3d while diehl tdc can adequately represent both concentrations it has one additional parameter compared to vesilind and overall a higher rss poorer fit indicating a poorer model overall optimising compression parameters only for takacs does not allow an acceptable fit while we used a switch as well as an explicit vesilind function for the concentrated regime it is noted that at high concentration vesilind and takacs models are functionally identical and it would be possible to further simplify the model by utilising takacs across the whole concentration domain and only switching v 0 to its lower optimum of 0 0021 above the switch concentration this would eliminate r v since it is effectively replaced by r h note that the confidence intervals for r h and r v overlap and adjusting r v would change v 2 to the above value fig 7 e this reduces the concentrated range number of parameters to 4 v 0 as well as the three compression parameters confidence regions for both concentrations are shown in fig 7 this indicates generally a low degree of correlation particularly between compression parameters indicating they are identifiable and independent and only substantial correlation between the hindered settling parameters v 2 and r v which is discussed above the total count of 2d simulations performed in both uncertainty quantification studies for the two mentioned combined models is 24 000 simulations following the same methodology mentioned in section 2 2 1 and section 2 3 6 3 4 transient 3d simulations to display the differences between the compared models combination and the optimization calibration process effects on practical industrial application we created a test primary pilot settling tank geometry shown in fig 8 the turbulence model used was les smagorinsky 1963 the rheology model was fitted for the sludge as solids volume fraction dependent combined power law and herschel bulkley all models and conditions were fixed through all simulations except for the settling models used the settling models simulated and compared are tc conc opt tc dilute opt and tvc with their respective optimized parameters the model comparison is based on the key performance metrics of solids capture average solids out and the sludge bed profile at the end of each simulation solids capture was calculated by averaging solids from the underflow divided by the solids in during the last hour of each simulation which was consistently close to quasi steady state convergence calculated solids capture is shown in table 5 for each simulation with the respective model used using the tvc model as a benchmark the errors in each case is highlighted in red when the comparison model is low compared to reference model and blue when it is high the results are consistent with the analysis performed showing that optimization with bias toward either low or high concentration range is inaccurate compared to the reference model furthermore depending on the dynamic condition of the simulation process the errors are magnified with an oscillation range between 12 39 underestimation to 17 97 overestimation when the same case was simulated using takacs model alone it became numerically unstable after few hours the reason for this is as there is no compression model attached solids settled too fast accumulating at the bottom of the pilot until reaching the packing limit because the rheology model is solids concentration dependent the sludge bed of 12 vol has a very high viscosity and does not move that either leads to a simulation that does not represent reasonable physical behaviour or numerical instability due to high gradients furthermore when contours from the side view are visualised through a slice across the middle of the pilot fig 9 the differences between the three models are marginal but with observable differences in sludge profile however the resulting top view sludge bed profiles over time in all 3 cases were noticeably different as shown in fig 10 specifically the scoured sludge bed portion being substantially different for the dilute tc at higher flow rates the tc dilute opt model usually resulted in more and faster washout compared to the other two models videos of simulation contours development and 3d volume rendering of velocity magnitude solids volume fraction over time for all three models is provided in the data repository associated with this paper abood 2022b this includes underload simulation results 5 88 l min normal load simulation results 29 38 l min and overload simulation results 58 74 l min the full raw data for computational work involved could be found in the following data repository abood 2022a 3 5 analysis 1d 2d and 3d simulations for experimental tests were effectively the same with minor differences the same applies for samples withdrawn from the dilute batch settling having marginal influence polydisperse sludge with relatively high solids concentration range sedimentation could be effectively modelled with empirical functions but require additional considerations and either modification from single function models to multiple models across different ranges or change in the key parameter of maximum sedimentation velocity as seen in this paper the change can be relatively minor i e change in a single parameter the requirement to incorporate differential behaviour at high low range is particularly important if concentration dependant rheology models are used which will result in not an only poor prediction but also numerical instability at high concentrations resulting from over sedimentation this was observed in the continuous flow example assessed here single function models can be effectively fit to a single test but tests in multiple ranges and with different measurement methods expose the differential behaviour the inclusion of uncertainty analysis is critical and relatively low cost computationally if applied in 1d or 2d model simulations the differences between such combined approach and simpler forms evaluated here were magnified in a dynamic environment and larger scale especially when increasing flow rates or under washout failure conditions such as wet weather events or overloading in industrial applications that implies an even higher effect on larger industrial systems and provides some indication of why it has been classically difficult to model polydispersed material in primary settling tanks and anaerobic lagoons simulations in the limited literature cases brennan 2001 dahl 1995 liu and garcía 2011 samstag et al 2016 on the experimental side testing improvements are clearly needed a wider range of solids concentration should be included in the testing and optimization minimizing interference is also a priority or preferably a non intrusive measurement method that could work accurately in both low and high solids concentrations repeatable experimental tests are also necessary to establish error analysis for experimental measurements and provide higher certainty though these tests are labor intensive particularly dilute settling tests in general it is better to replicate tests rather than collect more samples in a given test the results also indicated that for simple tests multi dimensional analysis is not required we used hpc resources high performance computing but this is not necessary for 1d uncertainty analysis 1d 3d had consistent results but computational costs varied substantially the grid considered 2000 cells for 1d 49 000 cells for 2d and 260 000 cells for 3d considering an hpc service unit su is 1 core x 1 h the 1d case required 0 1 su simulation 2d required 3 su simulation and 3d required 26 su simulation therefore while 2d and 3d cases can be modelled on workstations uncertainty analysis can only be done in 1d to perform uncertainty analysis in 2d and 3d hpc solution is required note that the estimated computational cost calculations are based on the approximate cost of a0 07 su which might vary between different hpc solutions providers the total computational cost of all uncertainty analysis included in this work performed in 2d cost approximately a6448 which is 87 less than the estimated cost of conducting the same simulations in 3d approximately a51880 we recommend that uncertainty analysis on parameters also be applied to continuous flow systems which are best analysed in 2 3d and this obligately requires hpc resources but 2d results is an order of magnitude cost reduction vs 3d analysis for reference simulation for one of the 3d continuous flow examples used here under the lowest flow rate condition required 5 ksu 4 conclusion analysis of polydispersed batch sedimentation at both low 3 6 g l and high 12 16 g l initial concentrations indicated that the takacs model was the most effective at low concentration range while at high concentration ranges all models performed similarly when coupled with a compression model comparing individual parameter sets across both domains identified no changes to hindered parameters r h r p but that the effective v 0 decreased by approximately 50 from low to high concentrations even with a compression model coupled this could be included via a switch function which enabled change to a different model or reduction of v0 at elevated concentrations analysis in a continuous flow through primary sedimentation indicated that use of dilute parameters caused deviation under normal and underload conditions while use of concentrated parameters caused deviation under overload conditions while this study validates the general use of the takacs model for polydispersed materials such as primary sludge and digestate compression implementation is critical and wide

15907,sedimentation in waste water is a heavily studied topic but mainly focused on hindered and compression settling in secondary sludge a largely monodispersed solids where bulk sedimentation velocity is effectively described by functions such as double vesilind takacs however many waste water solids including primary sludge and anaerobic digester effluent are polydispersed for which application of velocity functions is not well understood these systems are also subject to large concentration gradients and poor availability of settling velocity functions has limited design and computational fluid dynamic cfd analysis of these units in this work we assess the use of various sedimentation functions in single and multi dimensional domains comparing model results against multiple batch settling tests at a range of high and low concentrations both solids concentration and sludge bed height interface over time are measured and compared the method incorporates uncertainty analysis using monte carlo regression direct dividing rectangles and newton optimisation it was identified that a double vesilind takacs model was most effective in the dilute regime 1 v v but could not effectively fit high solids concentrations 1 v v without a substantial 50 decrease in effective maximum sedimentation velocity v 0 other parameters r h r p did not change a power law velocity model diehl was significantly less predictive at low concentrations and not significantly better at higher concentrations the optimised model with reduction in v 0 was tested vs a standard optimised double vesilind velocity model in a simple primary sedimentation unit and resulted in deviation from 12 to 18 in solids capture prediction from underload to overload washout conditions indicating that the effect is important in cfd based analysis of these systems keywords polydisperse sludge sedimentation computational fluid dynamics monte carlo openfoam dakota python 1 introduction sedimentation of particulate species is a critical process in the waste water treatment industries especially in the context of secondary settling in these processes hindered settling occurs where the suspension sedimentation velocity is less than the free settling velocity of an isolated particle due to particle particle hydrodynamic interactions and upflow of the suspending fluid when the suspension particles are relatively uniform in size e g activated sludge secondary sludges this results in a clear zone supernatant a hindered settling zone type 3 and a compression zone type 4 tchobanoglous et al 2014 a sharp interface can often be observed between the hindered settling zone and the supernatant although particle velocity fluctuations can potentially generate dispersion around this interface in practice these fluctuations are mitigated by local hindered settling that maintains a well defined interface guazzelli and hinch 2011 tee et al 2002 generating a characteristic mean sedimentation velocity this sedimentation velocity depends on the local solids concentration and is independent of container shape or size batchelor 1972 hinch 1977 in batch settling tests the suspension supernatant interface height can be tracked over time to generate flux concentration curves diehl 2007 lester et al 2005 or extract parameters for velocity concentration models cole 1968 kynch 1952 richardson 1954 takacs et al 1991 vesilind 1968 either of which can be subsequently be used for prediction and design of sedimentation processes therefore determining the sedimentation characteristics of activated and secondary sludges from batch settling tests is a robust and straightforward process conversely suspensions with significantly non uniform particle size shape and density distributions such as anaerobic sewage treatment effluent and primary settling tanks sludges are much more challenging to characterise first the sedimentation velocity of each species is a function of the local solids concentration of all other species instead of a sharp visible interface between the clear and hindered zone there is usually a solids concentration gradient due to the continuous range of settling velocities of the isolated particles that comprise these polydisperse systems the sedimentation dynamics of such strongly polydisperse suspensions can be very complex as they can exhibit strong particle segregation and stratification bürger et al 2002 complex flow structures during sedimentation nguyen and ladd 2005 and increased velocity fluctuations and dispersion near interfaces guazzelli and hinch 2011 nguyen and ladd 2005 polydisperse suspensions can also exhibit fundamentally different sedimentation dynamics batchelor 1982 batchelor and van rensburg 1986 bürger et al 2002 that range from stable where particles in each class are homogeneously distributed horizontally to unstable where different particles classes form vertical columnar structures that give rise to a localised boycott effect regardless of sedimentation stability macroscopic models of polydisperse sedimentation are typically couched in terms of a characteristic mean sedimentation velocity for each particle class i e size shape density which may be represented as discrete classes bürger et al 2002 or a continuous spectrum bürger et al 2008 these sedimentation velocities depend upon the solids concentration of the relevant particle class and the total local solids concentration batchelor 1982 lockett and bassoon 1979 masliyah 1979 in either case the determination of the sedimentation velocity of each particle class from experimental observations even for simple model systems such as bidisperse suspensions is currently an open problem conversely waste water treatment applications require accurate and straightforward methods to characterise the sedimentation velocity of primary sludges and effluents to facilitate quantification design and optimisation of industrial sedimentation processes thus the challenge is to develop practical robust and accurate tools and techniques to characterise the sedimentation velocity of these complex suspensions from dilute to highly concentrated solids concentrations for these reasons empirical relationships are typically used for design tchobanoglous et al 2014 which do not require concentration velocity functions and do not rely on the dimensional analysis or application of a mono disperse assumption with limited ability to measure parameters this results in a more limited design approach and means that computational fluid dynamics cannot be adequately used for design and analysis even post hoc since velocity concentration models are fundamental to this analysis samstag et al 2016 furthermore there is limited understanding of whether a monodispersed assumption is appropriate for these types of suspensions as the rheology and mechanical properties of waste water sludges vary enormously non linearly with solids concentration eshtiaghi et al 2013 stickland 2015 then minor errors in the characterisation of sedimentation velocity and thus predicted solids concentration distribution can lead to significant errors in modelling and prediction of waste water treatment processes these issues currently hinder model based design and analysis of industrial processes including primary settlers anaerobic lagoons and sewage systems hindered settling models commonly used for secondary sludges are characterised in terms of the empirical functional forms used to describe solids settling velocity as a function of concentration the first model type uses an exponential function of solids concentration vesilind 1968 which was subsequently extended by takacs et al 1991 to incorporate a second exponential term to improve prediction at low concentrations double vesilind this is the most widely used model for the simulation of sedimentation in secondary and primary sludge applications brennan 2001 gernaey et al 2001 lakehal et al 1999 ramin et al 2014 although the takacs model is designed for polydisperse suspensions it does not resolve the higher solids concentration behaviour as it focuses on dilute and hindered zones the combined htc model hindered transient and compression proposed by ramin et al 2014 utilises vesilind exponential settling functions coupled with a simple model for compression once the sludge forms a continuous solids matrix gel point this model was used to simulate sedimentation and consolidation of a secondary sludge material to an acceptable degree of accuracy over the entire expressed solids concentration range model parameters are estimated by tracking the evolution of the suspension supernatant interface over time and so is limited to secondary and activated sludge the second model type utilises a power law for the velocity concentration relationship cole 1968 such as the richardson zaki law richardson 1954 which corresponds to analytic expressions for sedimentation of colloidal spheres in the dilute limit batchelor 1977 hinch 1977 as such power law functions have been used extensively in applications of the theory of sedimentation and consolidation of colloidal suspensions bürger 2000 buscall and white 1987 and more recently these functional forms have been used to characterise the sedimentation of activated sludge de clercq et al 2008 plósz et al 2007 torfs et al 2017 when combined with an appropriately characterised model for sludge compression the power law sedimentation velocity function is particularly effective in describing compression zone settling in secondary settling tanks bürger et al 2011 stickland 2015 the vast majority of waste water sedimentation characterisation methods have focused on secondary waste water sludges which have been used to model the total solids concentrations in secondary settlers and clarifiers conversely accurate sedimentation characterisation methods for primary waste water sludges are an outstanding challenge brennan 2001 dahl 1995 griborio et al 2014 liu and garcía 2011 in many cases models developed for secondary sludges are applied to primary sludges without any testing or further modification most commonly using takacs et al 1991 without adding a compression component brennan 2001 liu and garcía 2011 only limited studies to date ramin et al 2014 have focused on characterising sedimentation that could be used in the dilute and concentrated regimes but these have not been validated in the full range of solids concentration particularly in dilute regions hence robust and accurate characterisation methods are required to facilitate accurate prediction design and optimisation of high solids gradient sludge process units the challenge associated with such types of sludges is that they are highly polydisperse leading to complex sedimentation behaviours and an absence of a well defined sediment supernatant interface that is often used as a key data source for characterisation diehl 2007 kynch 1952 lester et al 2005 furthermore it is also clear that conventional polydisperse sedimentation models are too complex to facilitate robust characterisation hence an important research question is whether simplified characterisation methods based upon e g a monodisperse paradigm or variations thereof are appropriate for high solids concentration range sludges sedimentation velocity is generally characterised in batch sedimentation tests tchobanoglous et al 2014 and parameters are generally identified using a 1d model takacs et al 1991 tchobanoglous et al 2014 clarifier process models are almost always 1d normally using a takacs model while cfd is most commonly done in 2d with 3d being increasingly used griborio et al 2022 as sedimentation is an inherently unstable process due to strong gravity currents even in the monodisperse case it remains unclear whether a 3d sedimentation model that resolves these currents can result in a different characteristic settling velocity than the 1d 2d case the majority of sedimentation studies do not assess simplification to 1d or 2d in either batch sedimentation or lab or full scale process applications finally only a small number of conventional sedimentation characterisation methods have been validated or have incorporated uncertainty analysis limiting the development of model based design tools in this study we attempt to address the above challenges by developing and testing a robust and accurate method for characterisation of the sedimentation velocity of primary sludges and effluents method development is based upon cfd modelling and batch sedimentation tests performed upon a polydisperse sludge sampled from an anaerobic lagoon of a major waste water treatment facility this sludge is representative of polydispersed solids including primary sludge in that it does not exhibit a clear interface during batch sedimentation and the solids concentration range expressed in these tests is broader than that of primary settlers starting with conventional sedimentation and compression models for monodisperse suspensions exponential and power law models with and without compression are optimised and parameter uncertainty estimated in both high and low solids using an algebraic slip i e drift flux cfd approach the models are then tested in a continuous flow pilot clarifier system at under load normal and overload washout conditions to identify the sensitivity of actual systems to the models identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sludge samples were collected from an anaerobic lagoon treating municipal sewage located in melbourne victoria australia the sludge had total solids content of 6 7 wt with a volatile solids fraction or total solids of 61 the total solids content of the sample was determined according to apha 2540b 105 c for 24 h apha 2005 volatile solids content of the sample was measured according to apha 2540e 550 c for 2 h apha 2005 the total dissolved solids content was 0 108 wt and the solids density was 1829 k g m 3 dissolved solids was measured by filtration through a 0 22 μ m cellulose acetate membrane followed by oven drying at 105 c for 24 h the solids density of the sample was calculated from the measured values of density and solids concentration of the suspension and density and total dissolved solids content high concentration sludge was obtained from the centrifugation of sample at 3500 rpm for 2 h in a beckman coulter allegra x 12 centrifuge suspension density was measured using a calibrated density cup whereas the liquor density was measured using a calibrated pycnometer 2 2 methods 2 2 1 novel characterization approach to identify the capability of models to effectively describe polydisperse sedimentation behaviour across a broad solids range we developed tests at both low and high solids concentrations the tests conducted measured change in 1 d solids concentrations at different heights over time in the low concentration range and sludge bed height over time in the high concentration range these were then simulated using open source cfd software openfoam the dilute tests are assessed initially with all three candidate models diehl 2015 takacs et al 1991 vesilind 1968 optimised and assessed on this system 3 tests with 3 different initial conditions which includes parameter uncertainty quantification these models are then tested on the high concentration tests incorporating compression and the optimal model parameters and confidence regions assessed ideally confidence regions for dilute and concentrated ranges should overlap which would indicate the model is valid across the whole range as noted in the results this was not the case but effectively only one parameter was impacted by the change in concentration 2 2 2 dilute settling test dilute settling experiments were conducted in a 2 m high cylindrical column with an outer diameter of 100 mm shown in fig 1 the cylindrical column had sampling ports on one side 15 mm diameter valves the first sampling port was 250 mm from the base and there were 10 more sampling ports spaced evenly 150 mm apart the top sampling port was 250 mm from the top of the column there was a valve at the base of the column to facilitate drainage and cleaning feed samples for the experiment were prepared by diluting the concentrated sludge samples using liquor free of any suspended solids to the three initial conditions of 3 86 g l 4 75 g l and 5 76 g l at the beginning of the dilute settling experiment 15 k g of diluted sludge sample was poured into the cylindrical pipe from the top a timer was started as soon as the sample loading was completed and samples were drawn from each port except the top two ports at five minutes intervals for the first thirty minutes and at ten minutes intervals for the next thirty minutes after ten minutes no samples were drawn from the top two ports the total suspended solids and weight of each sample were measured the volume loss from drawing samples were recorded for each sample with time stamp to include in the 3d model and evaluate the impact of sampling on sedimentation behaviour 2 2 3 concentrated batch settling test concentrated settling tests were conducted at lower concentrations than as received sludge by diluting the samples with their own liquor down to 0 7 0 85 vol 1 258 1 543 wt the lower limit of 1 258 wt was the minimum high solids concentration for that material to have an optically observable defined solids liquid interface at concentrations higher than 1 543 wt sedimentation was excessively slow which resulted in autogenic gas production which disrupted the test the liquor was obtained from the centrifugation of sample at 3500 rpm for 2 h in a beckman coulter allegra x 12 centrifuge the solids volume fraction was calculated from the suspended solids content and the solids and liquor densities the samples were poured into a 500 ml measuring cylinder and the solid liquid interfacial height was recorded over time using a video camera visual observations of interface height during the test and video recordings were used to develop a solid liquid interface height profile over time 2 3 modelling approach 2 3 1 fluid dynamics and physics openfoam was used as a cfd simulation platform specifically a multi phase based numerical solver utilising algebraic slip drift flux between the phases the drift flux approach models different phases as a variable density heterogeneous mixture and solves for both the mixture velocity and solids concentration where the drift flux of the solids phase relative to the mixture velocity is given by the concentration dependent sedimentation velocity functions as provided below the mixture has a continuous phase water in this case and one or more dispersed phases which are subject to sedimentation velocity in addition to continuous phase convection the sedimentation velocity function combined with the mixture approach incorporates momentum transfer between the phases implicitly the alternative approach euler euler would require simulation of multiple separate phases and an explicit sedimentation function with momentum transfer considered separately which increases the complexity of the solver and required computational cost and makes the use of empirical sedimentation functions more difficult the default turbulence model used is a modified k ϵ with buoyancy term described in brennan 2001 and lakehal et al 1999 the model takes mixture viscosity as input then adds the turbulence contribution the buoyancy term is based on the density gradient generated from the mixture composition based on test cases in fig 3 it was determined that the effect of turbulence is negligible due to the extremely slow velocity in the experimental cases however a similar modification as in brennan 2001 was done to a standard k ω sst and les large eddy simulation smagorinsky 1963 models which proved to be more numerically stable than the original modified k ϵ model those models were utilized in some of the 3d simulations the default rheology model in the open foam drift flux model is a bingham plastic mixture viscosity model from brennan 2001 and dahl 1995 model parameters are a function of solids concentration dahl 1995 identifies that this should be improved for large scale predictions however several test cases were optimised and fitted using the default model and a specifically fitted model for the material using a herschel bulkley model differences were marginal due to the low velocity profiles overall 2 3 2 sludge sedimentation models in this section we consider conventional models for sludge sedimentation some of which are extended to account for non settling fractions the first model under consideration is the classical vesilind model vesilind 1968 which uses a single exponential function for the sedimentation velocity v s 1 v s c v 0 e r h c here c g l represents the suspended solids concentration v 0 m s is the maximum sedimentation velocity c 0 and r h l g is a parameter that characterises hindering of sedimentation velocity with increasing solids concentration this model was implicitly developed for monodisperse suspensions as the functional form eq 1 quantifies hindered settling in terms of a single unique sedimentation velocity that only depends upon the total solids concentration the vesilind model was extended by takacs et al 1991 to account for the presence of different particle fractions in polydisperse suspensions it was considered that the suspension consists of three broad classes of particles a non setting fraction c min of small particles a range of poor settling particles and a range of rapidly settling particles this leads to a sedimentation velocity model of the form 2 v s c 0 c c min v 0 e r h c c min e r p c c min c c min where c min represents the concentration of non settling particles and the additional parameter r p l g with r p r h characterises sedimentation in the low solids concentration range this implicitly polydisperse sedimentation model is markedly different to the vesilind model in eq 1 in that a non settling fraction c min is accounted for and the sedimentation velocity is non monotonic increasing from zero at c c min to a maximum value at intermediate solids concentrations before decaying exponentially at large c we also consider the power law sedimentation model proposed by diehl 2015 in eq 3 3 v s c v 0 1 c x q where the fitting parameters x g l and q govern the changes in magnitude of hindered settling with increasing solids concentration it is instructive to compare the takacs model with the explicit polydisperse sedimentation model of masliyah 1979 derived from first principles by bürger et al 2008 which characterises the sedimentation velocity v s i of each particle class i 1 n as 4 v s i c c i α i c ρ i ρ c g for i 1 n here c c 1 c n is the vector of n solids concentrations c i for each particle class i 1 n ρ i is the density of the i th particle class ρ c is the volume averaged suspension density i e ρ c i 1 n c i ρ i 1 i 1 n c i ρ f where ρ f is the fluid density g is gravitational acceleration and α i c quantifies viscous drag between the i th particle class and the fluid velocity in practice this drag term is very difficult to characterise for each particle class as it must be determined throughout the n dimensional space c of all concentration combinations of all particle classes to overcome this difficulty lockett and bassoon 1979 propose the richardson zaki richardson 1954 functional form for the viscous drag coefficients as 5 α i c d i 2 18 μ f c i 1 c n c 2 for i 1 n were c i 1 n c i is the total solids fraction d i is the diameter of particle class i μ f is the viscosity of the suspending fluid and the index n is a weak function of c under the assumption n n c and uniform solids density ρ s across all particle classes a reasonable assumption for waste water sludges the settling velocity of each particle class simplifies to be solely a function of the total solids concentration c as 6 v s i c d i 2 g ρ s ρ f 18 μ f 1 c n 1 for i 1 n in a 1d batch settling model the solids concentration field c i for each species is then described by the continuity equation 7 c i t x c i v s i c 0 for i 1 n summing over all solids classes also yields a conservation equation for the total solids fraction 8 c t x i 1 n c i v s i c 0 the takacs model is similar to this polydisperse sedimentation model in that the sedimentation velocity of each particle class is solely a function of the total solids concentration c the major difference is that the takacs model does not resolve sedimentation of each particle class i but rather lumps them all together into a single solids flux model 9 c t x c v s c 0 v s c 1 c i 1 n c i v s i c although the contribution of the non settling fraction to this approximation is exact as v s 1 0 for the other fraction the total settling velocity v s c is non unique in that different distributions of particle fractions c i can yield the same total solids concentration c however if consideration is limited to sedimentation processes in a quiescent suspension such as 1d batch sedimentation it may be assumed that the distribution of c i can only vary to a limited degree for a given solids concentration this is a reasonable approximation in regions where the local total solids concentration c is less than or equal to the initial concentration c 0 as the fastest sedimenting particles settle out first and so the solids distribution evolves in a unique manner conversely c is not uniquely determined by c in regions where c c 0 as different particle classes i can contribute to this increase in total solids as sedimentation proceeds due to e g segregation at the interface of the supernatant and hindered zone however depending upon the particle size distribution this variation may be limited in some systems furthermore differential sedimentation ceases in the compression zone due to the formation of a contiguous solids matrix thus the polydisperse nature of the suspension explains the non monotone form of the sedimentation velocity profile in eq 2 in the dilute range sedimentation velocity increases with solids concentration as more rapidly settling particles are present whereas at higher solids concentrations this effect becomes less pronounced and hindered settling eventually takes over reducing the sedimentation rate it is important to note that the exponential functional form of the takacs model does not necessarily mean that the sedimentation velocity profile v s i c of each individual particle class is exponential indeed it may follow eq 5 but rather this exponential form arises from the convolution of the sludge particle size distribution with v s i c hence while the takacs model involves a number of assumptions and approximations that have not been extensively tested it is closely related to ab initio models of polydisperse sedimentation and it does appear to capture the fundamental dynamics of these systems its continuous and smooth functional form eq 2 indicates that it applies to polydisperse suspensions with a continuous particle size distributions the success of this model is that it can capture these complex dynamics in a simple model that only has a small number of fitting parameters several of which have direct physical meaning the major drawback of this model is that as the underlying approximations have not been extensively tested it is difficult to determine limits of applicability of this model to impart some of the advantages on the takacs model to the vesilind and diehl models we apply the concept of a non settling fraction c min in the takacs model to these models such that the solids concentrations values c in eq 1 and eq 3 is replaced by c c min where settling velocity for any concentration below c min is zero that modification will make both diehl and vesilind describe the settling velocity in a bidisperse manner to provide compatibility with the cfd model the solids concentrations c values in all equations were converted to dimensionless solids volume fractions using the measured densities of both solids and liquor from the samples used all models were modified to have an explicit solids volume fraction limit of 12 vol to provide numerical stability at extremely high concentrations this limit was determined based on operational observation in the lagoon to represent the highest practical concentration observed over years of operations 2 3 3 compression model the compression model developed by buscall and white 1987 and bürger et al 2005 amongst many similar models in the literature can be expressed in terms of the total solids volume fraction α d as 10 α d t α d v m α d ρ c ρ m v h s d c o m p α d γ α d where α d is the solids volume fraction α c r is critical volume fraction gel point at which the solids phase forms a continuous network that can withstand and transmit stress ρ c is the density of the continuous liquid phase ρ d is the density of the dispersed solids phase ρ α α ρ s 1 α ρ f is the density of the solids and liquid mixture v h s is the hindered settling velocity and σ e is derivative of the effective solid stress as expressed in de clercq et al 2008 the compression term is 11 d c o m p 0 when 0 α α c r ρ d g ρ d ρ c v h s α σ e α when α α c r after converting all concentrations to dimensionless volume fraction the effective solid stress could be expressed as 12 σ e 0 when 0 α α c r λ β α d α c r ρ d when α α c r where units for λ kgm 1 s 2 β kgm 3 α c r c c r ρ d and α d represents the value of solids volume fraction dispersed phase for the full details on the development of the equations related to the compression model implemented see valle medina and laurent 2020 2 3 4 geometry and meshing the dilute and concentrated batch settling columns were cylindrical as described earlier the dilute settling column had cylindrical ports at the side used to take samples out at specific heights in each case a 3d mesh was built using structured methodology ansys icem advanced meshing where all cylindrical shapes followed an o grid topology to reduce maximum non orthogonality below 45 cell count for dilute and concentrated respectively was 263 749 and 242 688 hexahedral cells which are the counts that achieved mesh independence additional 1d and 2d structured meshes were built for the same geometries to compare to the 3d simulations the 1d mesh was a single column of 2000 hexahedral cells across the middle of the cylinder the 2d mesh was a rectangular slice across the middle of each cylinder with 36 369 and 48 951 hexahedral orthogonal cells for dilute and concentrated respectively both the 1d and 2d meshes were independent at the mentioned cell count 2 3 5 boundary and initial conditions all wall boundary conditions were set to no slip for velocity fixed flux pressure and zero gradient solids in the experimental set for the dilute settling column samples were drawn out of the system over time this induced flow fields in the system and affected solids mass inside the column the effect of sampling was considered in the 3d validation against experimental results with one simplification that the top of the column in the 3d model displaces the removed volume with water at low inlet velocity to maintain the incompressible mass balance and avoid the need to include an air gap on the top boundary the outlet ports were all included and the measured volume withdrawn for samples was modelled as flow out of the settling column surface velocities at the top boundary were negligible and had no impact but the volume lost had an impact that was evaluated and discussed in section 3 1 in the 1d and 2d simulations the boundaries were exactly the same but replacing the removed spacial dimension with an empty boundary the volume loss due to samples drawn out of the dilute settling column was not included in 1d 2d for comparison purpose 2 3 6 parameter optimisation and uncertainty quantification a parameter sensitivity and optimisation process as identified in section 2 2 1 was used analysing firstly dilute tests using the three novel settling models concentrated tests using the same models coupled with compression then assessing two combined models capable of simulating both dilute and concentrated ranges parameters values and correlated confidence regions were compared across all tests in general parameters were sampled broadly using monte carlo techniques and then at a high frequency around the optimum gradient and non gradient search techniques were used to find actual optima and the true confidence region was identified as noted below the uncertainty quantification studies were performed using a coupled process of three open source platforms openfoam dakota and python where openfoam is the cfd simulation platform dakota provides the seeding sampling collection algorithm wrapping the cfd simulation python provides the numerical adjustment from openfoam output to dakota algorithm the output from cfd simulation in case of the dilute batch settling is solids volume fraction at specific heights over time which is edited and shaped by python scripts to calculate rss residual sum of squares and then forwarded to collection algorithm to compile dakota in case of the concentrated settling the cfd simulation output is solids volume fraction over vertical line in the middle of the geometry at each time step simulated python scripts process the output files determine potential solids liquid interfaces from the vertical concentration derivative and outputs the spatial interface from the maximum derivative this results in a calculated sbh sludge bed height at each time which is compared to experimental results to calculate rss this value is forwarded to the collection algorithm to compile as in dilute case the selection and seeding algorithm used is lhs latin hyper cube which is a randomised walk monte carlo procedure the compiled output is an objective function of rss with regards to parameters sets the studies in both cases were ran in series of 1000 2000 simulations blocks in general a coarse range of input parameter values was used in initial simulations to determine approximate optima followed by a fine set of simulations to determine actual optima and confidence limits the global minimum value of rss is j o p t and the value of j c r i t were determined by an f distribution dochain and vanrolleghem 2001 test as in eq 13 13 j c r i t j o p t 1 p n d a t a p f α p n d a t a p where j o p t is the minimum value found for the objective function residual sum of squares and f α p n d a t a p is the value of f distribution with p and n d a t a p degrees of freedom and a confidence level α 95 for final optimization j o p t from the uncertainty study was checked using a derivative free direct method dividing rectangles to find global optima with wide bounds this was followed by a newton optimisation to confirm convergence to the local optima the results were compared to confirm the uncertainty study findings or correct j o p t if found to be different 2 3 7 pilot continuous simulations the pilot shown in fig 8 is 2 m long 0 5 m wide 0 3 m high at the inlet side 0 4 m high at outlet side bottom is sloped at 1 10 inlet pipe diameter is 0 1 m and underflow is a centralised square outlet with edge length of 0 1 m following a typical primary settling tank design the flow rate of the underflow is 1 20 to the inlet flow rate the pilot was simulated at three set of inlet flow rates 5 9 l min 29 4 l min and 58 8 l min with the underflow adjusted accordingly the simulation time for the mentioned flow rates was 48 12 and 6 h respectively which is 24 48 times the hrt hydraulic retention time in each case pilot total volume is 0 3525 m 3 and hrt value at the lowest flow rate is 1 h the mesh built for the geometry is structured fully hexahedral with a cell count of 850 976 based on the mesh independence test for the boundary and initial conditions the inlet and underflow were set to flow rate controlled and the outlet over flow weir was set to free flow out the starting sludge bed height was 10 of the total height with uniform solids volume fraction of 3 5 and the inlet solids volume fraction was 0 1 the equivalent of 1 g l 3 results and discussion 3 1 dilute settling column sampling effect samples drawn during the dilute settling column did reduce the mass of solids inside the domain this resulted in a 10 mm sludge bed height difference between the two 3d simulations with and without samples fig 2 as well as minor differences at the top of the column however differences in solid phase velocities and hence concentration profiles between 3d with sampling 3d without sampling and 1 2d were negligible fig 3 this was mainly because of the low initial concentrations and the overall low velocity profiles the 3d vs 1 2d as shown in fig 3 also indicates negligible impacts of turbulence and boundary effects this shows approximately 5 deviation for 1d and almost identical 2d and 3d results since the sludge bed height is not the focus of this test the 1d 2d models without sampling may be used used for optimization and uncertainty analysis 3 2 dilute settling column simulations as noted in methods the three initial conditions assumed to be uniform were 3 86 g l 4 75 g l and 5 76 g l each of the initial conditions was optimised separately using each model to check these values the total residual sum of squares and optimised parameters for the three models are combined and detailed in table 1 notably the takacs sum of residuals is one order of magnitude less than both diehl and vesilind representing a significantly better model therefore only uncertainty analysis for the takacs model is presented here in terms of simulations required direct optimization required 150 200 iterations newton optimization required 20 iterations and additional parameter sampling to identify confidence regions was 6000 simulations the effect of non uniform initial concentrations in the experiment could be observed from fig 3a and b at 300 and 600 sec leading to deviation the downward deviation could be a results of the same non uniform initial condition or alternatively due to polydispersed behaviour not captured by the optimised model the relatively large size of the column added to non uniform initial conditions however unless a non intrusive accurate method of measuring the solids concentration is used a larger volume is necessary to draw sufficient samples without having a significant impact on the sedimentation behaviour additionally the simulation outlet boundary condition needs to take into account the hydrostatic pressure difference between the higher and lower ports which will lead to more solids drawn out from lower ports such measure could not be captured accurately in cfd unless an air phase is introduced to the model where the water column inside the simulation will decrease with time and take into account that effect the 95 confidence regions for parameters from the dilute tests are shown in fig 4 for each concentration together with correlated ellipses also shown is the region identified from the concentrated batch settling uncertainty studies for two concentrations between 12 16 g l section 3 3 as can be seen the three regions overlap with moderate uncertainty ranges 20 v 0 had the highest sensitivity followed by r h while r p had the lowest sensitivity from fig 4b a positive correlation is present between v 0 and r h and a weak negative correlation between v 0 and r p in fig 4c overlap of the three dilute tests indicate that the solids behave consistently in this range 4 6 g l as noted v 0 decreased significantly in the concentrated batch settling tests while the r h and r p ranges overlapped indicating that the material is behaving consistently at 12 16 g l but with a decreased velocity it is interesting that both r h and r p can be identified and are consistent across the fairly broad range of concentrations the 12 16 g l confidence region results from the same uncertainty study based on the concentrated batch settling also shown in fig 4 the plotted region is the result of combining takacs with compression model tc and optimizing all parameters for both components against the concentrated batch settling experimental tests that means that range is the optimum 95 confidence region of the concentrated settling behaviour for the same sludge if the regions did overlap between dilute and concentrated the behaviour could be modelled with a high degree of accuracy using one settling function and compression model however that non overlap means optimizing the concentrated solids range will lead to increased errors in dilute solids range and vice versa 3 3 concentrated batch settling simulations 3 3 1 continuous function models the two higher concentration tests in lab scale cylinders were numerically simulated for 4 h each measuring solids interface over time using the same methodology all three models vesilind takacs diehl were optimised for all parameters sedimentation and compression when coupled with the compression model from values in table 2 the rss is similar for all three models the sludge bed height over time plots were almost identical and demonstrate they are functionally the same v 0 consistently dropped with all three models which suggests that a further decrease in v 0 is required in addition to the compression to describe the increase in hindered behaviour as solids concentration increases towards the compression zone the uncertainty quantification studies were performed over 6000 simulations for tc takacs and compression model and 4000 simulations for each of vc and dc vesilind diehl and compression model the optimisation using direct and newton methodology required 200 250 iterations combined for each model to visualise the difference due to the significant drop in v 0 compared to dilute optimum parameters the takacs model dilute 95 ci range was plotted against the takacs compression 95 ci range in fig 4 the clear separation in confidence regions in fig 4a shows that if the dilute parameters 3 6 g l are fixed to optimum while only compression parameters in eq 12 are optimised to fit the experimental data the rss in concentrated range rises by one order of magnitude table 2 and the visual fit is poor fig 6 to further assess whether the apparent difference in v 0 was due to compression or hindering takacs parameters were set to the optimum from table 1 and only compression parameters modified the optimum values shown in table 2 tc dilute opt identify the compression model attempting to address deviations by raising the value of α c r to reduce the settling velocity however the optimal rss is an order of magnitude compared to tc conc opt when done in reverse and focused on concentrated only the rss in dilute increased by two orders of magnitude these results indicate a simple global takacs model is not suitable for wide solids concentration ranges even when coupled with compression model while it is necessary to maintain a simple practical model it is also necessary to maintain an acceptable level of accuracy the practical implications of this are further discussed below 3 3 2 combined function models this section assesses combination of two settling models with compression following the same concept in ramin et al 2014 the first combined model is referred to as tdc takacs diehl and compression model which utilises takacs for dilute diehl above the switch value and compression that is eq 2 applies at concentrations lower than the switch and eq 3 above the switch incorporating compression the second combined model is tvc takacs vesilind and compression with eq 2 at concentrations below the switch and eq 1 above the switch as shown in fig 5 the value of c s w i t c h has been optimized to be 0 7 vol solids volume fraction the takacs model in both cases has the three optimal parameters taken from dilute settling tests in section 3 2 the tdc has an additional 6 parameters to describe the concentrated range v 2 x q α c r β λ while the tvc model has an additional 5 parameters v 2 r v α c r β λ these additional parameters were optimised using the concentrated tests 12 71 and 15 58 g l the optimised rss for the tdc function was 2 944 x 10 3 whereas for the tvc function it was 9 575 x 10 4 tdc optimised parameters are shown in table 3 while tvc optimised parameters are shown in table 4 as shown in fig 6 the two models are not functionally different and similar in 1 3d while diehl tdc can adequately represent both concentrations it has one additional parameter compared to vesilind and overall a higher rss poorer fit indicating a poorer model overall optimising compression parameters only for takacs does not allow an acceptable fit while we used a switch as well as an explicit vesilind function for the concentrated regime it is noted that at high concentration vesilind and takacs models are functionally identical and it would be possible to further simplify the model by utilising takacs across the whole concentration domain and only switching v 0 to its lower optimum of 0 0021 above the switch concentration this would eliminate r v since it is effectively replaced by r h note that the confidence intervals for r h and r v overlap and adjusting r v would change v 2 to the above value fig 7 e this reduces the concentrated range number of parameters to 4 v 0 as well as the three compression parameters confidence regions for both concentrations are shown in fig 7 this indicates generally a low degree of correlation particularly between compression parameters indicating they are identifiable and independent and only substantial correlation between the hindered settling parameters v 2 and r v which is discussed above the total count of 2d simulations performed in both uncertainty quantification studies for the two mentioned combined models is 24 000 simulations following the same methodology mentioned in section 2 2 1 and section 2 3 6 3 4 transient 3d simulations to display the differences between the compared models combination and the optimization calibration process effects on practical industrial application we created a test primary pilot settling tank geometry shown in fig 8 the turbulence model used was les smagorinsky 1963 the rheology model was fitted for the sludge as solids volume fraction dependent combined power law and herschel bulkley all models and conditions were fixed through all simulations except for the settling models used the settling models simulated and compared are tc conc opt tc dilute opt and tvc with their respective optimized parameters the model comparison is based on the key performance metrics of solids capture average solids out and the sludge bed profile at the end of each simulation solids capture was calculated by averaging solids from the underflow divided by the solids in during the last hour of each simulation which was consistently close to quasi steady state convergence calculated solids capture is shown in table 5 for each simulation with the respective model used using the tvc model as a benchmark the errors in each case is highlighted in red when the comparison model is low compared to reference model and blue when it is high the results are consistent with the analysis performed showing that optimization with bias toward either low or high concentration range is inaccurate compared to the reference model furthermore depending on the dynamic condition of the simulation process the errors are magnified with an oscillation range between 12 39 underestimation to 17 97 overestimation when the same case was simulated using takacs model alone it became numerically unstable after few hours the reason for this is as there is no compression model attached solids settled too fast accumulating at the bottom of the pilot until reaching the packing limit because the rheology model is solids concentration dependent the sludge bed of 12 vol has a very high viscosity and does not move that either leads to a simulation that does not represent reasonable physical behaviour or numerical instability due to high gradients furthermore when contours from the side view are visualised through a slice across the middle of the pilot fig 9 the differences between the three models are marginal but with observable differences in sludge profile however the resulting top view sludge bed profiles over time in all 3 cases were noticeably different as shown in fig 10 specifically the scoured sludge bed portion being substantially different for the dilute tc at higher flow rates the tc dilute opt model usually resulted in more and faster washout compared to the other two models videos of simulation contours development and 3d volume rendering of velocity magnitude solids volume fraction over time for all three models is provided in the data repository associated with this paper abood 2022b this includes underload simulation results 5 88 l min normal load simulation results 29 38 l min and overload simulation results 58 74 l min the full raw data for computational work involved could be found in the following data repository abood 2022a 3 5 analysis 1d 2d and 3d simulations for experimental tests were effectively the same with minor differences the same applies for samples withdrawn from the dilute batch settling having marginal influence polydisperse sludge with relatively high solids concentration range sedimentation could be effectively modelled with empirical functions but require additional considerations and either modification from single function models to multiple models across different ranges or change in the key parameter of maximum sedimentation velocity as seen in this paper the change can be relatively minor i e change in a single parameter the requirement to incorporate differential behaviour at high low range is particularly important if concentration dependant rheology models are used which will result in not an only poor prediction but also numerical instability at high concentrations resulting from over sedimentation this was observed in the continuous flow example assessed here single function models can be effectively fit to a single test but tests in multiple ranges and with different measurement methods expose the differential behaviour the inclusion of uncertainty analysis is critical and relatively low cost computationally if applied in 1d or 2d model simulations the differences between such combined approach and simpler forms evaluated here were magnified in a dynamic environment and larger scale especially when increasing flow rates or under washout failure conditions such as wet weather events or overloading in industrial applications that implies an even higher effect on larger industrial systems and provides some indication of why it has been classically difficult to model polydispersed material in primary settling tanks and anaerobic lagoons simulations in the limited literature cases brennan 2001 dahl 1995 liu and garcía 2011 samstag et al 2016 on the experimental side testing improvements are clearly needed a wider range of solids concentration should be included in the testing and optimization minimizing interference is also a priority or preferably a non intrusive measurement method that could work accurately in both low and high solids concentrations repeatable experimental tests are also necessary to establish error analysis for experimental measurements and provide higher certainty though these tests are labor intensive particularly dilute settling tests in general it is better to replicate tests rather than collect more samples in a given test the results also indicated that for simple tests multi dimensional analysis is not required we used hpc resources high performance computing but this is not necessary for 1d uncertainty analysis 1d 3d had consistent results but computational costs varied substantially the grid considered 2000 cells for 1d 49 000 cells for 2d and 260 000 cells for 3d considering an hpc service unit su is 1 core x 1 h the 1d case required 0 1 su simulation 2d required 3 su simulation and 3d required 26 su simulation therefore while 2d and 3d cases can be modelled on workstations uncertainty analysis can only be done in 1d to perform uncertainty analysis in 2d and 3d hpc solution is required note that the estimated computational cost calculations are based on the approximate cost of a0 07 su which might vary between different hpc solutions providers the total computational cost of all uncertainty analysis included in this work performed in 2d cost approximately a6448 which is 87 less than the estimated cost of conducting the same simulations in 3d approximately a51880 we recommend that uncertainty analysis on parameters also be applied to continuous flow systems which are best analysed in 2 3d and this obligately requires hpc resources but 2d results is an order of magnitude cost reduction vs 3d analysis for reference simulation for one of the 3d continuous flow examples used here under the lowest flow rate condition required 5 ksu 4 conclusion analysis of polydispersed batch sedimentation at both low 3 6 g l and high 12 16 g l initial concentrations indicated that the takacs model was the most effective at low concentration range while at high concentration ranges all models performed similarly when coupled with a compression model comparing individual parameter sets across both domains identified no changes to hindered parameters r h r p but that the effective v 0 decreased by approximately 50 from low to high concentrations even with a compression model coupled this could be included via a switch function which enabled change to a different model or reduction of v0 at elevated concentrations analysis in a continuous flow through primary sedimentation indicated that use of dilute parameters caused deviation under normal and underload conditions while use of concentrated parameters caused deviation under overload conditions while this study validates the general use of the takacs model for polydispersed materials such as primary sludge and digestate compression implementation is critical and wide concentration range experimental testing coupled with uncertainty quantification is required to adopt such a combined model approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15908,halogenated aromatic disinfection byproducts dbps exhibited similar total organic halogen levels in chlorinated drinking water samples as compared with aliphatic ones and they predominantly accounted for the overall toxicity of the samples among the reported halogenated aromatic dbps halonitrophenols hnps have received particular attention in recent years due to the relatively high risk in drinking water in this study a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps were detected and then proposed to be halohydroxybenzonitriles hhbns by employing the ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometers thereafter the specific hhbn species in drinking water were theoretically speculated and then thoroughly identified with standard compounds their occurrence in drinking water was investigated their cytotoxicity was evaluated and their stability in the presence of chlorine was assessed seven newly identified hhbns including 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile showed 100 detection frequency in the collected drinking water samples with concentrations up to 36 ng l hhbns exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity in chinese hamster ovary cells than regulated dbps e g trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids which might be contributed by their cellular uptake efficiency and nucleophilicity the seven hhbns were proved to undergo transformation during chlorination following pseudo first order decay with half lives in the range of 9 63 h more importantly in comparison to hnps which showed relatively high toxicity and strong stability among the halogenated aromatic dbps hhbns presented comparable concentration cytotoxicity contribution 50 and slightly weaker stability 43 suggesting that hhbns should be a new group of dbps of concern in drinking water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts chlorination lc ms ms occurrence toxicity stability 1 introduction as an outstanding public health achievement disinfection has been an essential process in drinking water treatment plants with the aim of preventing waterborne diseases richardson et al 2007 li and mitch 2018 kali et al 2021 however the reactions between disinfectants e g chlorine and natural organic matter nom can give rise to the formation of undesired disinfection byproducts dbps gallard and von gunten 2002 deborde and von gunten 2008 hu et al 2020 richardson and kimura 2020 in previous epidemiological studies drinking water dbps have been verified their association to some health concerns such as bladder cancer and spontaneous abortion nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 villanueva et al 2007 yang et al 2019b thus they have received considerable attention over the past several decades over 700 halogenated dbp species have been identified to this day richardson et al 2007 shah and mitch 2012 dong et al 2019 yang et al 2019a liu et al 2020 but they accounted for only 30 50 of the total organic halogen tox in chlorinated drinking water krasner et al 2006 hua and reckhow 2007 and the dbps responsible for chlorination related health risks remain veiled to a large extent hence pinpointing new drinking water dbps especially toxicity drivers is deemed an important research topic for safeguarding drinking water in recent years the development and application of ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry uplc esi tqms enabled the detection and identification of numerous halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water zhai and zhang 2011 pan and zhang 2013 yang and zhang 2016 li et al 2022 notably halogenated aromatic dbps have been revealed to exhibit comparable tox levels in chlorinated drinking water samples as compared with aliphatic ones and the overall toxicity of the samples was assessed to be predominantly contributed by aromatic fractions han et al 2021 thus attracting extensive attention at present the reported halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water mainly include halonitrophenols hnps halophenols hps halohydroxybenzoic acids hhbas halohydroxybenzaldehydes hhbds and so on zhai and zhang 2011 pan and zhang 2013 yang and zhang 2016 hu et al 2018a yang et al 2019a liu et al 2020 han et al 2021 li et al 2021 li et al 2022 among which pressing concern was accentuated on hnps in recent years due to the following reasons 1 as a group of nitrogenous dbps hnps presented relatively high developmental toxicity to platynereis dumerilii yang and zhang 2013 comparatively high cytotoxicity hu et al 2018b zhang et al 2020 as well as relatively high binding affinity with human transthyretin yang et al 2019b 2 by using the tic tox approach combination of quantitative analysis and toxicity data hnps were determined to present almost twice higher concentration cytotoxicity contribution than the sum of hps hhbas and hhbds zhang et al 2020 3 hnps were also significantly more stable than hps hhbas and hhbds in the presence of disinfectants hu et al 2018b in view of the considerable structural diversity of aromatic halogenated dbps caused by the various functional groups and different halogen species it is reasonable to speculate that there is still a mass of unknown halogenated aromatic dbps awaiting to be discovered in drinking water thus the exploration of unknown halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water especially those with comparable risk to hnps is of great urgency more recently the successful detection of nonhalogenated phenolic nitriles such as 4 hydroxybenzeneacetonitrile during chlorination of tyrosine a known dbp precursor ubiquitously existing in source water caught our attention lu et al 2021 in a previous study the potential of nonhalogenated phenolic dbps to act as intermediates between nom and halogenated phenolic dbps during chlorination was verified e g nom 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid jiang et al 2020 which prompted the research hypothesis that such newly detected nonhalogenated phenolic nitriles may also be the probable precursors of halogenated phenolic nitriles therefore we suspected the presence of halogenated phenolic nitriles including halohydroxybenzonitriles hhbns and halohydroxybenzeneacetonitriles hhbans as a group of dbps in drinking water notably by calculation using quantitative structure activity relationship models both hhbns and hhbans were predicted to be of higher developmental toxicity in marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii than hnps e g 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzeneacetonitrile ec50 33 μm 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol ec50 112 μm fig s1 yang and zhang 2013 in addition in light of the strong electron withdrawing property of the nitrile group e g cn these potential halogenated phenolic nitriles were speculated to be relatively stable in the distribution system of drinking water as compared with the reported halogenated aromatic dbps hu et al 2018b in this regard halogenated phenolic nitriles are likely to be a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps that are of comparable risk to hnps in drinking water the ultra high resolution mass spectrometry has been a commonly used tool for probing unknown dbps in drinking water andersson et al 2019 2020 2021 hu et al 2022 in our initial experiments halogenated phenolic nitriles i e hhbns and hhbans in drinking water were tentatively explored using a high resolution uplc electrospray ionization hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer esi qtof ms and hhbns were successfully detected as a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps to confirm our speculation that these new hhbns are a substantial concern in drinking water this study mainly includes 1 the identification of hhbn species followed by the investigation of their occurrence levels and frequencies in drinking water 2 the determination of the cytotoxicity of hhbns in chinese hamster ovary cho k1 cells 3 the assessment of the stability of hhbns in the presence of chlorine and 4 the comparison on occurrence cytotoxicity and stability between new hhbns and well known hnps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents 3 5 dichloro 2

simulated drinking water samples a total of eighteen drinking water samples 1 l including six samples from hangzhou labeled a f six samples from shanghai labeled g l and six samples from nanjing labeled m r were collected in june or july 2021 using amber glass bottles without headspace the active chlorine in the samples was instantly measured with a portable photometer hach pocket colorimetertm ii based on which the required amount of ascorbic acid molar ratio 1 1 as quenching agent was added into the samples to prevent further formation or transformation of dbps during the holding time between sample collection and analysis according to previous methods kristiana et al 2014 gong et al 2016 the applicability of ascorbic acid for the analysis of hhbns was evaluated in this study and hhbns showed no significant degradation in the presence of ascorbic acid within 24 h supporting information si text s1 three source water samples were collected from hangzhou in june 2021 using amber glass bottles without headspace the collected samples were transported to our laboratory and then stored in the refrigerator at 4 c to minimize changes in constituents all the twenty

poly tetra fluoroethylene membrane 0 45 μm pall corporation usa 2 4 instrumental analysis the full scan in a high resolution uplc waters acquity esi qtof ms ab sciex 5600 was adopted to explore halogenated phenolic nitriles in drinking water and relevant instrumental parameters are described in si text s2 once the suspected ion clusters were detected a uplc waters acquity i class coupled with an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole ion trap tandem mass spectrometer esi qtrap ms ab sciex 5500 was further utilized to fully determine their structures the multiple reaction monitoring mrm scan was adopted to acquire the rts which served as the reference to pinpoint whether this dbp belongs to aromatic group han et al 2021 and the product ion scan was employed to obtain the fragment information after identifying the structures of unknown hhbns the uplc esi qtrap ms mrm scan was also utilized for the quantitative analysis of hhbns and hnps the reference compounds in water samples in this study the sample injection volume was 5 μl and the chromatographic separation was achieved using an acquity uplc hss t3 column 100 2 1 mm 1 8 μm particle size waters the mobile phases

selected to evaluate the cytotoxicity of hhbns and hnps due to the existing large database and the method for cytotoxicity tests was based on a published review with a few modifications wagner and plewa 2017 briefly a total of 200 μl of a test solution containing 3 103 cells one dbp of known concentration and ham s f12 k medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum 1 antibiotics and 1 glutamine was added into each of the inner 60 wells of 96 well flat bottomed microplates 0 5 dmso was also added into each test solution in order to improve the solubility of these analytes for each analyte eight or nine different concentrations were set and ham s f12 k medium containing 0 5 dmso was adopted as the concurrent negative control the 96 well microplates were placed in a humidified atmosphere with 5 co2 at 37 c after an exposure for 72 h the medium in each inner well was aspirated and then 100 μl of fresh medium and 10 μl of cck 8 solution were added to the wells the cells were incubated for 1 h prior to the determination of the relative absorbance at 450 nm for each well using a microplate reader tecan infinite m200 pro when cell metabolism is normal the reagent component wst 8 in cck 8 could be reduced with intracellular dehydrogenase to form highly water soluble orange formazan products and the concentration of formazan was proportional to the number of viable cells xu et al 2021 four replicates were set for each concentration and the experiment was repeated three times more detailed information concerning the cytotoxicity tests is shown in si text s3 2 6 stability tests batch experiments were conducted to examine the stability of hhbns and hnps in the presence of chlorine chlorination of each hhbn or hnp was performed under the conditions of ph 7 0 0 1 and 20 0 0 5 c with different contact times 0 7 12 24 36 48 and 72 h the initial concentrations of hhbn or hnp and chlorine in the sample 200 ml were 300 nm and 2 mg l as cl2 28 2 μm respectively after a given contact time the chlorine residual in each sample was quenched with the requisite stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid duplicate samples were prepared in this study and all the samples were placed in darkness to avoid the photolysis of these halogenated aromatic dbps liu et al 2019 2 7 theoretical calculations and statistical analyses for hhbns the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital

in stability tests were analyzed using origin 2018 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection and identification of a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water in this study the full scan in a high resolution uplc esi qtof ms was utilized to determine whether halogenated phenolic nitriles hhbns and hhbans are present in drinking water as dbps as displayed in fig 1 a three new ion clusters with m z 185 9511 187 9483 189 9458 isotopic abundance ratio 9 6 1 229 9008 231 8983 233 8957 isotopic abundance ratio 3 4 1 and 273 8503 275 8482 277 8472 isotopic abundance ratio 1 2 1 were observed in the uplc esi qtof ms full scan spectra of the collected drinking water sample and they were not detected in the collected source water samples the isotopic abundance ratios of these ion clusters implied that there were two cl atoms one cl and br atom each and two br atoms in their individual structures the even numbered m z values supported that they should be members of nitrogenous dbps on this basis the corresponding molecular formulas of these three new ion clusters were determined using peakview software to be c7h3oncl2 m z shift 4 3 ppm c7h3onbrcl m z shift 2 6 ppm and c7h3onbr2 m z shift 2 2 ppm respectively which are consistent with hhbns the suspected ion clusters of hhbans were not detected in the uplc esi qtof ms full scan spectra of the collected drinking water sample thereafter a uplc esi qtrap ms was adopted to fully determine whether these detected ion clusters are hhbns firstly the mrm scan was used to acquire the rts of these newly detected ion clusters as shown in the corresponding chromatograms figs 1b 1d two chromatographic peaks with matching isotopic pattern obviously showed up for each ion cluster rts of 7 43 and 9 09 min for m z 186 188 190 rts of 7 72 and 9 39 min for m z 230 232 234 and rts of 8 04 and 9 78 min for m z 274 276 278 according to a previous study the effective separation of aliphatic and halogenated aromatic dbps using rt 1 80 min as the dividing line in uplc substantiated that the rt of a dbp can serve as the reference to pinpoint whether this dbp is aromatic and the rts of these new dbps supported that they were aromatics the uplc conditions in this study are similar with those in the previous study han et al 2021 secondly the product ion scan was utilized to acquire their individual fragment ions the ion cluster with m z 186 188 190 at rt 7 43 min is selected herein as a representative for detailed elucidation as displayed in figs 1i 1k two sequential losses of 36 38 suggested the presence of two cl atoms and a loss of 28 implied the presence of one hydroxyl group attached to the benzene ring after subtracting one benzene ring two cl atoms and one hydroxyl group from c7h3oncl2 the residual part was cn for which the only reasonable structure should be one nitrile group cn thus the ion cluster with m z 186 188 190 at rt 7 43 min was determined to be a member of dichloro hhbns similarly the same ion cluster at rt 9 09 min was determined to be another dichloro hhbn the ion clusters with m z 230 232 234 at rt 7 72 and 9 39 min were determined to be bromochloro hhbns si text s4 and fig s3 and the ion clusters with m z 274 276 278 at rt 8 04 and 9 78 min were determined to be dibromo hhbns si text s5 and fig s4 as stated above there were two different isomers for each ion cluster that existed in drinking water among the known halogenated phenolic dbps i e hps hhbas hhbds and hnps chlorinated and brominated dbp species with the same isomeric structure usually existed concurrently in drinking water and the brominated phenolic dbps generally showed slightly longer rts than the chlorinated dbp with the same isomeric structure summarized in table s3 pan and zhang 2013 zhai et al 2014 pan et al 2017 huang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 for example in a previous research three hhbas with the same isomeric structure namely 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid were all detected in drinking water with rts of 2 26 2 73 and 3 02 min respectively huang et al 2018 in light of the matching rt pattern of the detected hhbns it is reasonable to speculate that the hhbns with rts of 7 43 7 72 and 8 04 min exhibited identical isomeric structure with different halogen substitutions similarly for those with rts of 9 09 9 39 and 9 78 min to further determine the two isomeric structures of dihalo hhbns in drinking water dichloro hhbns were selected as representatives the determination of two dichloro hhbns from the probable sixteen isomers fig s5 was still challenging due to the lack of standard compounds thus narrowing down the most likely dichloro hhbns was obviously essential dichloro hhbns can be theoretically viewed as the products that derived from hydroxybenzonitriles with chlorine via electrophilic substitutions according to the frontier orbital theory the highest occupied molecular orbital determines the electron transfer process and electrophilic reactions were more likely to occur at the atoms with higher 2fed2 homo values karelson et al 1996 therefore molecular orbital calculations for all the three hydroxybenzonitriles 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 hydroxybenzonitrile and 4 hydroxybenzonitrile were conducted to extrapolate the relatively plausible dichloro hhbns in drinking water fig s6 the two most probable dichloro hhbns formed from 2 hydroxybenzonitrile were 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile and 4 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile those formed from 3 hydroxybenzonitrile were 2 6 dichloro 3 hydroxybenzonitrile and 4 6 dichloro 3 hydroxybenzonitrile and those formed from 4 hydroxybenzonitrile were 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 2 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile the standard compounds of four of the six probable dichloro hhbns including 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 2 6 dichloro 3 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 2 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile were commercially available and their rts in uplc esi qtrap ms mrm chromatograms were 9 10 8 37 7 45 and 8 46 min respectively on the basis of matching chromatographic peaks at rts of 7 43 and 9 09 min in figure 1b plus the confirmation of identical product ion spectra and corresponding peak identification with spiked standard the two dichloro hhbns were identified to be 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile respectively figs 1g 1h 1l 1m and 1n likewise the chromatographic peaks at rts of 7 72 and 9 39 min in fig 1c were fully identified as 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile respectively si text s4 and fig s3 and the chromatographic peaks at rts of 8 04 and 9 78 min in fig 1d were fully identified as 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile respectively si text s5 and fig s4 in addition 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile which was not detected using full scan in uplc esi qtof ms was also successfully detected and fully identified in drinking water when adopting the more sensitive uplc esi qtrap ms mrm scan si text s6 and fig s7 notably these hhbns were not detected in the simulated source water samples while were detected in the chlorinated samples more details are presented in si text s7 further substantiating that hhbns belong to dbps to our knowledge these hhbns including four 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles and three 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles were reported as dbps in drinking water for the first time 3 2 occurrence of new hhbns in drinking water as shown in fig 2 a the seven hhbns existed in the drinking water samples with concentrations ranging from 0 04 2 6 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile in sample j to 36 ng l 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile in sample i 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile were detected in all the samples with concentrations of 0 1 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 1 2 0 1 36 0 1 0 8 0 1 1 4 and 0 04 0 6 ng l respectively according to a previous research some reported halogenated aromatic dbps such as hps hhbas hhbds and hnps were also detected at ng l levels in drinking water zhang et al 2020 it was found that 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles 0 1 36 ng l generally showed higher concentrations in drinking water in comparison to 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles 0 04 1 2 ng l likewise among the hhbas 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzoic acids have been also reported to be of higher concentrations in drinking water than 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzoic acids pan et al 2017 some water quality parameters such as ph and active chlorine are displayed in table s4 no significant correlations were observed between the total concentration of hhbns and the water quality parameters active chlorine p 0 071 and r 0 436 ph p 0 569 and r 0 144 3 3 cytotoxicity of new hhbns in cho k1 cells the cytotoxicity of the seven hhbns was evaluated using cho k1 cells and their cytotoxicity concentration response curves are displayed in fig 3 a table s5 presents the statistical analyses of the cytotoxicity of hhbns such as the lowest concentration that induced a significant cytotoxic response on the basis of their ec50 values the descending rank order of their cytotoxicity was determined to be 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 95 μm 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 158 μm 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 163 μm 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 187 μm 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 193 μm 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 233 μm 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 321 μm where indicates no statistically significant difference between the ec50 values of two hhbns table s6 it was obvious that iodinated hhbns exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity as compared to brominated ones which in turn showed significantly higher cytotoxicity than chlorinated ones such pattern is consistent with the reported cytotoxicity of many other dbp categories such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans and halobenzoquinones plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2008 li et al 2016 wagner and plewa 2017 wei et al 2020 thereafter for comparison purpose the cytotoxicity index cti for the hhbns the regulated dbps and the hans was determined by calculating the reciprocal of the median ec50 value of all individual members of a single dbp category and a larger cti value indicates greater cytotoxicity plewa et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 as summarized in table s7 hhbns showed higher cytotoxicity than regulated thms haas and bromate the cytotoxicity of chlorite has not been reported yet and lower cytotoxicity than hans in cho cells it should be noted that the regulated dbps and hans practically showed significantly higher concentrations μg l level in drinking water than hhbns ng l level richardson et al 2007 li et al 2021 furthermore the structure cytotoxicity relationship for hhbns was examined in this study the values of five structural parameters including log k ow e homo e lumo μ and pk a for each hhbn are listed in table 2 and the results of pearson correlation analysis between the structural parameters and the log ec50 values of hhbns are presented in table s8 significant negative correlations were observed between log ec50 values and log k ow p 0 001 r 0 958 as well as between log ec50 values and e homo p 0 007 r 0 892 which implied that the difference in cytotoxicity of hhbns might be partly contributed by their cellular uptake efficiency and nucleophilicity plewa et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 specifically log k ow is correlated with cell permeability and the hhbn with a higher log k ow value may possess a higher cellular uptake efficiency hence elevating chances to permeate into the cells plewa et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 e homo corresponds to the nucleophilicity of a compound and the hhbn with a higher e homo value may be more inclined to attack the electrophilic sites in biomacromolecules thereby inflicting more harm to the cells karelson et al 1996 wei et al 2020 previously the cytotoxicity of other dbp groups such as haas and halogenated tyrosyl dipeptides in cho cells also demonstrated high correlations with their cellular uptake efficiency or nucleophilicity plewa et al 2004 tian et al 2020 3 4 stability of new hhbns in the presence of chlorine previous studies have reported that halogenated aromatic dbps were not stable and could undergo transformation during chlorination zhai and zhang 2011 huang et al 2018 thus in addition to concentration and toxicity chemical stability in the presence of chlorine is also a non negligible indicator for assessing the risk of halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water in this study the stability of these new hhbn dbps 300 nm in the presence of chlorine 2 mg l as cl2 was examined in darkness the seven hhbns were unstable in the presence of chlorine within 72 h fig 4 a and all the transformations satisfied pseudo first order kinetic equations r2 0 97 fig 4c as displayed in table s9 the apparent rate constant k values of 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile were determined to be 0 011 0 020 0 018 0 026 0 030 0 041 and 0 080 h 1 respectively based on the corresponding half lives the ascending rank order of their stability in the presence of chlorine was 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 9 h 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 17 h 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 23 h 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 27 h 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 35 h 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 39 h 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 63 h these results indicated that chlorinated hhbns were of stronger stability during chlorination than their brominated analogues with the same isomeric structure which in turn exhibited stronger stability than the iodinated ones this trend is parallel with previous report that the stability of total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi during chlorination was in the order of tocl tobr toi hua and reckhow 2012 by comparing 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles and 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles it was found that 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles generally showed higher stability during chlorination than the corresponding 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles with the same halogen substituted species which might be attributed to their electrophilicity and nucleophilicity according to the frontier molecular orbital theory a lower e lumo value indicates a higher electrophilicity and a higher e homo value indicates a higher nucleophilicity karelson et al 1996 as listed in table 2 the e lumo value of 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile i e 1 52 ev is lower than that of 3 5 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 1 36 ev while the e homo value of 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 9 93 ev is higher than that of 3 5 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 9 98 ev similarly for bromochloro hhbns and dibromo hhbns such observation suggested 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles are of lower electrophilicity and nucleophilicity than the corresponding 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles with the same halogen substituted species which is in accordance with their transformation rates in the presence of chlorine notably the concentrations of some hhbns in chlorinated srnom samples firstly increased and then decreased fig s8b substantiating that the transformation of hhbns may practically occur in the distribution systems of drinking water 3 5 comparison between hhbns and hnps on occurrence cytotoxicity and stability in this study six hnps with available standard compounds i e 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were selected as the reference compounds for better substantiating the risks of new hhbns in drinking water and the occurrence cytotoxicity and stability of the six hnps were systematically compared with the seven hhbns fig 2b shows the concentrations of the six hnps in the drinking water samples ranging from 0 04 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol in sample n to 7 8 ng l 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol in sample i 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were detected in all the samples with concentrations of 0 2 7 8 0 4 3 7 and 0 04 0 6 ng l respectively while 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol and 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol were detected in three twelve and nine samples with concentrations in the range of 2 5 6 5 0 1 1 9 and 0 1 0 5 ng l respectively as far as we are aware it was the first study that reported 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol and 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol as dbps in drinking water furthermore the percentage of concentration contributions between the two groups of dbps were calculated for comparison fig 5 a which showed that hhbns and hnps accounted for 61 and 39 of their total mass concentrations respectively fig 3b displays the cytotoxicity concentration response curves of hnps for cho k1 cells based on which the ec50 values of 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were determined to be 130 129 118 96 98 and 89 μm respectively the cytotoxicity rank order of iodinated dbps brominated dbps chlorinated dbps could be likewise applicable to hnps table s10 according to the cti for hhbn and hnp categories hnps presented 1 7 times higher cytotoxicity than hhbns table s7 previously hnps were reported to be 2 3 3 0 and 7 1 times more cytotoxic in cho k1 cells than hps hhbds and hhbas respectively zhang et al 2020 for further comparison purpose the cti value of each dbp species in hhbns and hnps was further calculated in this study fig 5b shows the cti percentage contributions of the two dbp categories and the results revealed that hhbns and hnps accounted for 42 and 58 of the total cti value respectively thereafter the tic tox approach a popular tool for assessing the forcing toxicity drivers in drinking water dbps based on both semi quantitative analysis and toxicity data detailed in si text s8 plewa et al 2017 was further adopted to estimate the concentration cytotoxicity contribution of these two dbp categories as displayed in fig 5c hhbns 50 possessed comparable concentration cytotoxicity contribution to hnps 50 which have been reported to be of almost twice higher concentration cytotoxicity contribution than the sum of hps hhbas and hhbds demonstrating that hhbns were likely to be a new group of toxicity drivers with emerging concern in drinking water fig 4b and 4d show the stability of hnps in the presence of chlorine the transformation of all six hnps in the presence of chlorine also satisfied the pseudo first order kinetic equations r2 0 98 as displayed in table s9 the k values of 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were determined to be 0 007 0 017 0 021 0 010 0 050 and 0 030 h 1 respectively based on which the corresponding half lives were calculated to be 99 41 33 69 14 and 23 h respectively the stability of hnps in the presence of chlorine was ranked in an ascending order of 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol likewise the effects of halogen substituted species and isomeric structures on the stability of hnps are akin to hhbns fig 5d shows the half life contributions of the two dbp categories and the results revealed that hhbns and hnps accounted for 43 and 57 of the total half life value respectively indicating that hhbns are slightly less stable than hnps in the presence of chlorine which might be attributed to the stronger electron withdrawing ability of the nitro group i e no2 than the nitrile group i e cn table s11 hu et al 2018b 4 conclusions in our work seven hhbns including four 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles i e 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and three 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles i e 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile were detected and identified as a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water at ng l levels the successful identification of hhbn species in drinking water verified the applicability of theoretical calculation to the structural speculation of new halogenated dbps our work demonstrated that these new hhbns are significantly higher cytotoxic in cho cells than regulated thms haas and bromate it is particularly worth mentioning that hhbns 50 in drinking water presented comparable concentration toxicity contribution to hnps 50 which have been reported to exhibit significantly higher concentration cytotoxicity contribution among the reported halogenated aromatic dbps furthermore our work also revealed that hhbns 43 are slightly less stable in the presence of chlorine than hnps 57 which have been reported as the most stable category among hps hhbas hhbds and hnps during disinfection thus hhbns should be regarded as a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps of emerging concern in drinking water in addition three new hnp species including 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol and 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol were also reported in drinking water for the first time in future studies the transformation products and pathways of hhbns during chlorination need to be thoroughly clarified which is

15908,halogenated aromatic disinfection byproducts dbps exhibited similar total organic halogen levels in chlorinated drinking water samples as compared with aliphatic ones and they predominantly accounted for the overall toxicity of the samples among the reported halogenated aromatic dbps halonitrophenols hnps have received particular attention in recent years due to the relatively high risk in drinking water in this study a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps were detected and then proposed to be halohydroxybenzonitriles hhbns by employing the ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometers thereafter the specific hhbn species in drinking water were theoretically speculated and then thoroughly identified with standard compounds their occurrence in drinking water was investigated their cytotoxicity was evaluated and their stability in the presence of chlorine was assessed seven newly identified hhbns including 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile showed 100 detection frequency in the collected drinking water samples with concentrations up to 36 ng l hhbns exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity in chinese hamster ovary cells than regulated dbps e g trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids which might be contributed by their cellular uptake efficiency and nucleophilicity the seven hhbns were proved to undergo transformation during chlorination following pseudo first order decay with half lives in the range of 9 63 h more importantly in comparison to hnps which showed relatively high toxicity and strong stability among the halogenated aromatic dbps hhbns presented comparable concentration cytotoxicity contribution 50 and slightly weaker stability 43 suggesting that hhbns should be a new group of dbps of concern in drinking water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts chlorination lc ms ms occurrence toxicity stability 1 introduction as an outstanding public health achievement disinfection has been an essential process in drinking water treatment plants with the aim of preventing waterborne diseases richardson et al 2007 li and mitch 2018 kali et al 2021 however the reactions between disinfectants e g chlorine and natural organic matter nom can give rise to the formation of undesired disinfection byproducts dbps gallard and von gunten 2002 deborde and von gunten 2008 hu et al 2020 richardson and kimura 2020 in previous epidemiological studies drinking water dbps have been verified their association to some health concerns such as bladder cancer and spontaneous abortion nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 villanueva et al 2007 yang et al 2019b thus they have received considerable attention over the past several decades over 700 halogenated dbp species have been identified to this day richardson et al 2007 shah and mitch 2012 dong et al 2019 yang et al 2019a liu et al 2020 but they accounted for only 30 50 of the total organic halogen tox in chlorinated drinking water krasner et al 2006 hua and reckhow 2007 and the dbps responsible for chlorination related health risks remain veiled to a large extent hence pinpointing new drinking water dbps especially toxicity drivers is deemed an important research topic for safeguarding drinking water in recent years the development and application of ultra performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry uplc esi tqms enabled the detection and identification of numerous halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water zhai and zhang 2011 pan and zhang 2013 yang and zhang 2016 li et al 2022 notably halogenated aromatic dbps have been revealed to exhibit comparable tox levels in chlorinated drinking water samples as compared with aliphatic ones and the overall toxicity of the samples was assessed to be predominantly contributed by aromatic fractions han et al 2021 thus attracting extensive attention at present the reported halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water mainly include halonitrophenols hnps halophenols hps halohydroxybenzoic acids hhbas halohydroxybenzaldehydes hhbds and so on zhai and zhang 2011 pan and zhang 2013 yang and zhang 2016 hu et al 2018a yang et al 2019a liu et al 2020 han et al 2021 li et al 2021 li et al 2022 among which pressing concern was accentuated on hnps in recent years due to the following reasons 1 as a group of nitrogenous dbps hnps presented relatively high developmental toxicity to platynereis dumerilii yang and zhang 2013 comparatively high cytotoxicity hu et al 2018b zhang et al 2020 as well as relatively high binding affinity with human transthyretin yang et al 2019b 2 by using the tic tox approach combination of quantitative analysis and toxicity data hnps were determined to present almost twice higher concentration cytotoxicity contribution than the sum of hps hhbas and hhbds zhang et al 2020 3 hnps were also significantly more stable than hps hhbas and hhbds in the presence of disinfectants hu et al 2018b in view of the considerable structural diversity of aromatic halogenated dbps caused by the various functional groups and different halogen species it is reasonable to speculate that there is still a mass of unknown halogenated aromatic dbps awaiting to be discovered in drinking water thus the exploration of unknown halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water especially those with comparable risk to hnps is of great urgency more recently the successful detection of nonhalogenated phenolic nitriles such as 4 hydroxybenzeneacetonitrile during chlorination of tyrosine a known dbp precursor ubiquitously existing in source water caught our attention lu et al 2021 in a previous study the potential of nonhalogenated phenolic dbps to act as intermediates between nom and halogenated phenolic dbps during chlorination was verified e g nom 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid jiang et al 2020 which prompted the research hypothesis that such newly detected nonhalogenated phenolic nitriles may also be the probable precursors of halogenated phenolic nitriles therefore we suspected the presence of halogenated phenolic nitriles including halohydroxybenzonitriles hhbns and halohydroxybenzeneacetonitriles hhbans as a group of dbps in drinking water notably by calculation using quantitative structure activity relationship models both hhbns and hhbans were predicted to be of higher developmental toxicity in marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii than hnps e g 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzeneacetonitrile ec50 33 μm 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol ec50 112 μm fig s1 yang and zhang 2013 in addition in light of the strong electron withdrawing property of the nitrile group e g cn these potential halogenated phenolic nitriles were speculated to be relatively stable in the distribution system of drinking water as compared with the reported halogenated aromatic dbps hu et al 2018b in this regard halogenated phenolic nitriles are likely to be a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps that are of comparable risk to hnps in drinking water the ultra high resolution mass spectrometry has been a commonly used tool for probing unknown dbps in drinking water andersson et al 2019 2020 2021 hu et al 2022 in our initial experiments halogenated phenolic nitriles i e hhbns and hhbans in drinking water were tentatively explored using a high resolution uplc electrospray ionization hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer esi qtof ms and hhbns were successfully detected as a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps to confirm our speculation that these new hhbns are a substantial concern in drinking water this study mainly includes 1 the identification of hhbn species followed by the investigation of their occurrence levels and frequencies in drinking water 2 the determination of the cytotoxicity of hhbns in chinese hamster ovary cho k1 cells 3 the assessment of the stability of hhbns in the presence of chlorine and 4 the comparison on occurrence cytotoxicity and stability between new hhbns and well known hnps 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents 3 5 dichloro 2

simulated drinking water samples a total of eighteen drinking water samples 1 l including six samples from hangzhou labeled a f six samples from shanghai labeled g l and six samples from nanjing labeled m r were collected in june or july 2021 using amber glass bottles without headspace the active chlorine in the samples was instantly measured with a portable photometer hach pocket colorimetertm ii based on which the required amount of ascorbic acid molar ratio 1 1 as quenching agent was added into the samples to prevent further formation or transformation of dbps during the holding time between sample collection and analysis according to previous methods kristiana et al 2014 gong et al 2016 the applicability of ascorbic acid for the analysis of hhbns was evaluated in this study and hhbns showed no significant degradation in the presence of ascorbic acid within 24 h supporting information si text s1 three source water samples were collected from hangzhou in june 2021 using amber glass bottles without headspace the collected samples were transported to our laboratory and then stored in the refrigerator at 4 c to minimize changes in constituents all the twenty

mrm scan was adopted to acquire the rts which served as the reference to pinpoint whether this dbp belongs to aromatic group han et al 2021 and the product ion scan was employed to obtain the fragment information after identifying the structures of unknown hhbns the uplc esi qtrap ms mrm scan was also utilized for the quantitative analysis of hhbns and hnps the reference compounds in water samples

selected to evaluate the cytotoxicity of hhbns and hnps due to the existing large database and the method for cytotoxicity tests was based on a published review with a few modifications wagner and plewa 2017 briefly a total of 200 μl of a test solution containing 3 103 cells one dbp of known concentration and ham s f12 k medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum 1 antibiotics and 1 glutamine was added into each of the inner 60 wells of 96 well flat bottomed microplates 0 5 dmso was also added into each test solution in order to improve the solubility of these analytes for each analyte eight or nine different concentrations were set and ham s f12 k medium containing 0 5 dmso was adopted as the concurrent negative control the 96 well microplates were placed in a humidified atmosphere with 5 co2 at 37 c after an exposure for 72 h the medium in each inner well was aspirated and then 100 μl of fresh medium and 10 μl of cck 8 solution were added to the wells the cells were incubated for 1 h prior to the determination of the relative absorbance at 450 nm for each well using a microplate reader tecan infinite m200 pro when cell metabolism is normal the reagent component wst 8 in cck 8 could be reduced with intracellular dehydrogenase to form highly water soluble orange formazan products and the concentration of formazan was proportional to the number of viable cells xu et al 2021 four replicates were set for each concentration and the experiment was repeated three times more detailed information concerning the cytotoxicity tests is shown in si text s3 2 6 stability tests batch experiments were conducted to examine the stability of hhbns and hnps in the presence of chlorine chlorination of each hhbn or hnp was performed under the conditions of ph 7 0 0 1 and 20 0 0 5 c with different contact times 0 7 12 24 36 48 and 72 h the initial concentrations of hhbn or hnp and chlorine in the sample 200 ml were 300 nm and 2 mg l as cl2 28 2 μm respectively after a given contact time the chlorine residual in each sample was quenched with the requisite stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid duplicate samples were prepared in this study and all the samples were placed in darkness to avoid the photolysis of these halogenated aromatic dbps liu et al 2019 2 7 theoretical calculations and statistical analyses for hhbns the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo and the dipole moment μ were calculated using mopac2016 software the octanol water partition coefficient log k ow was predicted using the kowwin program v 1 69 and the acid dissociation constant pk a was obtained from the scifinder database the frontier electron densities of the highest occupied molecular orbital 2fed2 homo and the atomic charges were calculated using gaussian 09 software at the b3lyp 6 311 g d p level the independent t test and pearson correlation analysis were conducted in this study by employing the spss 22 0 software in cytotoxicity tests a one way analysis of variance anova test followed by holm sidak multiple comparisons were conducted to determine the lowest cytotoxic concentration of each analyte and the statistical difference between the ec50 values of different analytes spss 22 0 software the power of the test statistic 1 β was maintained as 0 8 at α 0 05 the pseudo first order kinetic equations in stability tests were analyzed using origin 2018 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection and identification of a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water in this study the full scan in a high resolution uplc esi qtof ms was utilized to determine whether halogenated phenolic nitriles hhbns and hhbans are present in drinking water as dbps as displayed in fig 1 a three new ion clusters with m z 185 9511 187 9483 189 9458 isotopic abundance ratio 9 6 1 229 9008 231 8983 233 8957 isotopic abundance ratio 3 4 1 and 273 8503 275 8482 277 8472 isotopic abundance ratio 1 2 1 were observed in the uplc esi qtof ms full scan spectra of the collected drinking water sample and they were not detected in the collected source water samples the isotopic abundance ratios of these ion clusters implied that there were two cl atoms one cl and br atom each and two br atoms in their individual structures the even numbered m z values supported that they should be members of nitrogenous dbps on this basis the corresponding molecular formulas of these three new ion clusters were determined using peakview software to be c7h3oncl2 m z shift 4 3 ppm c7h3onbrcl m z shift 2 6 ppm and c7h3onbr2 m z shift 2 2 ppm respectively which are consistent with hhbns the suspected ion clusters of hhbans were not detected in the uplc esi qtof ms full scan spectra of the collected drinking water sample thereafter a uplc esi qtrap ms was adopted to fully determine whether these detected ion clusters are hhbns firstly the mrm scan was used to acquire the rts of these newly detected ion clusters as shown in the corresponding chromatograms figs 1b 1d two chromatographic peaks with matching isotopic pattern obviously showed up for each ion cluster rts of 7 43 and 9 09 min for m z 186 188 190 rts of 7 72 and 9 39 min for m z 230 232 234 and rts of 8 04 and 9 78 min for m z 274 276 278 according to a previous study the effective separation of aliphatic and halogenated aromatic dbps using rt 1 80 min as the dividing line in uplc substantiated that the rt of a dbp can serve as the reference to pinpoint whether this dbp is aromatic and the rts of these new dbps supported that they were aromatics the uplc conditions in this study are similar with those in the previous study han et al 2021 secondly the product ion scan was utilized to acquire their individual fragment ions the ion cluster with m z 186 188 190 at rt 7 43 min is selected herein as a representative for detailed elucidation as displayed in figs 1i 1k two sequential losses of 36 38 suggested the presence of two cl atoms and a loss of 28 implied the presence of one hydroxyl group attached to the benzene ring after subtracting one benzene ring two cl atoms and one hydroxyl group from c7h3oncl2 the residual part was cn for which the only reasonable structure should be one nitrile group cn thus the ion cluster with m z 186 188 190 at rt 7 43 min was determined to be a member of dichloro hhbns similarly the same ion cluster at rt 9 09 min was determined to be another dichloro hhbn the ion clusters with m z 230 232 234 at rt 7 72 and 9 39 min were determined to be bromochloro hhbns si text s4 and fig s3 and the ion clusters with m z 274 276 278 at rt 8 04 and 9 78 min were determined to be dibromo hhbns si text s5 and fig s4 as stated above there were two different isomers for each ion cluster that existed in drinking water among the known halogenated phenolic dbps i e hps hhbas hhbds and hnps chlorinated and brominated dbp species with the same isomeric structure usually existed concurrently in drinking water and the brominated phenolic dbps generally showed slightly longer rts than the chlorinated dbp with the same isomeric structure summarized in table s3 pan and zhang 2013 zhai et al 2014 pan et al 2017 huang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 for example in a previous research three hhbas with the same isomeric structure namely 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid were all detected in drinking water with rts of 2 26 2 73 and 3 02 min respectively huang et al 2018 in light of the matching rt pattern of the detected hhbns it is reasonable to speculate that the hhbns with rts of 7 43 7 72 and 8 04 min exhibited identical isomeric structure with different halogen substitutions similarly for those with rts of 9 09 9 39 and 9 78 min to further determine the two isomeric structures of dihalo hhbns in drinking water dichloro hhbns were selected as representatives the determination of two dichloro hhbns from the probable sixteen isomers fig s5 was still challenging due to the lack of standard compounds thus narrowing down the most likely dichloro hhbns was obviously essential dichloro hhbns can be theoretically viewed as the products that derived from hydroxybenzonitriles with chlorine via electrophilic substitutions according to the frontier orbital theory the highest occupied molecular orbital determines the electron transfer process and electrophilic reactions were more likely to occur at the atoms with higher 2fed2 homo values karelson et al 1996 therefore molecular orbital calculations for all the three hydroxybenzonitriles 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 hydroxybenzonitrile and 4 hydroxybenzonitrile were conducted to extrapolate the relatively plausible dichloro hhbns in drinking water fig s6 the two most probable dichloro hhbns formed from 2 hydroxybenzonitrile were 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile and 4 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile those formed from 3 hydroxybenzonitrile were 2 6 dichloro 3 hydroxybenzonitrile and 4 6 dichloro 3 hydroxybenzonitrile and those formed from 4 hydroxybenzonitrile were 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 2 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile the standard compounds of four of the six probable dichloro hhbns including 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 2 6 dichloro 3 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 2 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile were commercially available and their rts in uplc esi qtrap ms mrm chromatograms were 9 10 8 37 7 45 and 8 46 min respectively on the basis of matching chromatographic peaks at rts of 7 43 and 9 09 min in figure 1b plus the confirmation of identical product ion spectra and corresponding peak identification with spiked standard the two dichloro hhbns were identified to be 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile respectively figs 1g 1h 1l 1m and 1n likewise the chromatographic peaks at rts of 7 72 and 9 39 min in fig 1c were fully identified as 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile respectively si text s4 and fig s3 and the chromatographic peaks at rts of 8 04 and 9 78 min in fig 1d were fully identified as 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile respectively si text s5 and fig s4 in addition 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile which was not detected using full scan in uplc esi qtof ms was also successfully detected and fully identified in drinking water when adopting the more sensitive uplc esi qtrap ms mrm scan si text s6 and fig s7 notably these hhbns were not detected in the simulated source water samples while were detected in the chlorinated samples more details are presented in si text s7 further substantiating that hhbns belong to dbps to our knowledge these hhbns including four 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles and three 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles were reported as dbps in drinking water for the first time 3 2 occurrence of new hhbns in drinking water as shown in fig 2 a the seven hhbns existed in the drinking water samples with concentrations ranging from 0 04 2 6 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile in sample j to 36 ng l 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile in sample i 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile were detected in all the samples with concentrations of 0 1 1 2 0 1 13 0 1 1 2 0 1 36 0 1 0 8 0 1 1 4 and 0 04 0 6 ng l respectively according to a previous research some reported halogenated aromatic dbps such as hps hhbas hhbds and hnps were also detected at ng l levels in drinking water zhang et al 2020 it was found that 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles 0 1 36 ng l generally showed higher concentrations in drinking water in comparison to 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles 0 04 1 2 ng l likewise among the hhbas 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzoic acids have been also reported to be of higher concentrations in drinking water than 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzoic acids pan et al 2017 some water quality parameters such as ph and active chlorine are displayed in table s4 no significant correlations were observed between the total concentration of hhbns and the water quality parameters active chlorine p 0 071 and r 0 436 ph p 0 569 and r 0 144 3 3 cytotoxicity of new hhbns in cho k1 cells the cytotoxicity of the seven hhbns was evaluated using cho k1 cells and their cytotoxicity concentration response curves are displayed in fig 3 a table s5 presents the statistical analyses of the cytotoxicity of hhbns such as the lowest concentration that induced a significant cytotoxic response on the basis of their ec50 values the descending rank order of their cytotoxicity was determined to be 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 95 μm 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 158 μm 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 163 μm 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 187 μm 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 193 μm 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 233 μm 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 321 μm where indicates no statistically significant difference between the ec50 values of two hhbns table s6 it was obvious that iodinated hhbns exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity as compared to brominated ones which in turn showed significantly higher cytotoxicity than chlorinated ones such pattern is consistent with the reported cytotoxicity of many other dbp categories such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans and halobenzoquinones plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2008 li et al 2016 wagner and plewa 2017 wei et al 2020 thereafter for comparison purpose the cytotoxicity index cti for the hhbns the regulated dbps and the hans was determined by calculating the reciprocal of the median ec50 value of all individual members of a single dbp category and a larger cti value indicates greater cytotoxicity plewa et al 2008 wagner and plewa 2017 as summarized in table s7 hhbns showed higher cytotoxicity than regulated thms haas and bromate the cytotoxicity of chlorite has not been reported yet and lower cytotoxicity than hans in cho cells it should be noted that the regulated dbps and hans practically showed significantly higher concentrations μg l level in drinking water than hhbns ng l level richardson et al 2007 li et al 2021 furthermore the structure cytotoxicity relationship for hhbns was examined in this study the values of five structural parameters including log k ow e homo e lumo μ and pk a for each hhbn are listed in table 2 and the results of pearson correlation analysis between the structural parameters and the log ec50 values of hhbns are presented in table s8 significant negative correlations were observed between log ec50 values and log k ow p 0 001 r 0 958 as well as between log ec50 values and e homo p 0 007 r 0 892 which implied that the difference in cytotoxicity of hhbns might be partly contributed by their cellular uptake efficiency and nucleophilicity plewa et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 specifically log k ow is correlated with cell permeability and the hhbn with a higher log k ow value may possess a higher cellular uptake efficiency hence elevating chances to permeate into the cells plewa et al 2008 yang and zhang 2013 e homo corresponds to the nucleophilicity of a compound and the hhbn with a higher e homo value may be more inclined to attack the electrophilic sites in biomacromolecules thereby inflicting more harm to the cells karelson et al 1996 wei et al 2020 previously the cytotoxicity of other dbp groups such as haas and halogenated tyrosyl dipeptides in cho cells also demonstrated high correlations with their cellular uptake efficiency or nucleophilicity plewa et al 2004 tian et al 2020 3 4 stability of new hhbns in the presence of chlorine previous studies have reported that halogenated aromatic dbps were not stable and could undergo transformation during chlorination zhai and zhang 2011 huang et al 2018 thus in addition to concentration and toxicity chemical stability in the presence of chlorine is also a non negligible indicator for assessing the risk of halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water in this study the stability of these new hhbn dbps 300 nm in the presence of chlorine 2 mg l as cl2 was examined in darkness the seven hhbns were unstable in the presence of chlorine within 72 h fig 4 a and all the transformations satisfied pseudo first order kinetic equations r2 0 97 fig 4c as displayed in table s9 the apparent rate constant k values of 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile were determined to be 0 011 0 020 0 018 0 026 0 030 0 041 and 0 080 h 1 respectively based on the corresponding half lives the ascending rank order of their stability in the presence of chlorine was 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 9 h 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 17 h 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 23 h 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 27 h 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 35 h 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 39 h 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 63 h these results indicated that chlorinated hhbns were of stronger stability during chlorination than their brominated analogues with the same isomeric structure which in turn exhibited stronger stability than the iodinated ones this trend is parallel with previous report that the stability of total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi during chlorination was in the order of tocl tobr toi hua and reckhow 2012 by comparing 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles and 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles it was found that 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles generally showed higher stability during chlorination than the corresponding 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles with the same halogen substituted species which might be attributed to their electrophilicity and nucleophilicity according to the frontier molecular orbital theory a lower e lumo value indicates a higher electrophilicity and a higher e homo value indicates a higher nucleophilicity karelson et al 1996 as listed in table 2 the e lumo value of 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile i e 1 52 ev is lower than that of 3 5 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 1 36 ev while the e homo value of 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 9 93 ev is higher than that of 3 5 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 9 98 ev similarly for bromochloro hhbns and dibromo hhbns such observation suggested 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles are of lower electrophilicity and nucleophilicity than the corresponding 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles with the same halogen substituted species which is in accordance with their transformation rates in the presence of chlorine notably the concentrations of some hhbns in chlorinated srnom samples firstly increased and then decreased fig s8b substantiating that the transformation of hhbns may practically occur in the distribution systems of drinking water 3 5 comparison between hhbns and hnps on occurrence cytotoxicity and stability in this study six hnps with available standard compounds i e 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were selected as the reference compounds for better substantiating the risks of new hhbns in drinking water and the occurrence cytotoxicity and stability of the six hnps were systematically compared with the seven hhbns fig 2b shows the concentrations of the six hnps in the drinking water samples ranging from 0 04 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol in sample n to 7 8 ng l 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol in sample i 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were detected in all the samples with concentrations of 0 2 7 8 0 4 3 7 and 0 04 0 6 ng l respectively while 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol and 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol were detected in three twelve and nine samples with concentrations in the range of 2 5 6 5 0 1 1 9 and 0 1 0 5 ng l respectively as far as we are aware it was the first study that reported 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol and 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol as dbps in drinking water furthermore the percentage of concentration contributions between the two groups of dbps were calculated for comparison fig 5 a which showed that hhbns and hnps accounted for 61 and 39 of their total mass concentrations respectively fig 3b displays the cytotoxicity concentration response curves of hnps for cho k1 cells based on which the ec50 values of 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were determined to be 130 129 118 96 98 and 89 μm respectively the cytotoxicity rank order of iodinated dbps brominated dbps chlorinated dbps could be likewise applicable to hnps table s10 according to the cti for hhbn and hnp categories hnps presented 1 7 times higher cytotoxicity than hhbns table s7 previously hnps were reported to be 2 3 3 0 and 7 1 times more cytotoxic in cho k1 cells than hps hhbds and hhbas respectively zhang et al 2020 for further comparison purpose the cti value of each dbp species in hhbns and hnps was further calculated in this study fig 5b shows the cti percentage contributions of the two dbp categories and the results revealed that hhbns and hnps accounted for 42 and 58 of the total cti value respectively thereafter the tic tox approach a popular tool for assessing the forcing toxicity drivers in drinking water dbps based on both semi quantitative analysis and toxicity data detailed in si text s8 plewa et al 2017 was further adopted to estimate the concentration cytotoxicity contribution of these two dbp categories as displayed in fig 5c hhbns 50 possessed comparable concentration cytotoxicity contribution to hnps 50 which have been reported to be of almost twice higher concentration cytotoxicity contribution than the sum of hps hhbas and hhbds demonstrating that hhbns were likely to be a new group of toxicity drivers with emerging concern in drinking water fig 4b and 4d show the stability of hnps in the presence of chlorine the transformation of all six hnps in the presence of chlorine also satisfied the pseudo first order kinetic equations r2 0 98 as displayed in table s9 the k values of 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were determined to be 0 007 0 017 0 021 0 010 0 050 and 0 030 h 1 respectively based on which the corresponding half lives were calculated to be 99 41 33 69 14 and 23 h respectively the stability of hnps in the presence of chlorine was ranked in an ascending order of 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 2 6 dibromo 4 nitrophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol likewise the effects of halogen substituted species and isomeric structures on the stability of hnps are akin to hhbns fig 5d shows the half life contributions of the two dbp categories and the results revealed that hhbns and hnps accounted for 43 and 57 of the total half life value respectively indicating that hhbns are slightly less stable than hnps in the presence of chlorine which might be attributed to the stronger electron withdrawing ability of the nitro group i e no2 than the nitrile group i e cn table s11 hu et al 2018b 4 conclusions in our work seven hhbns including four 3 5 dihalo 4 hydroxybenzonitriles i e 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 4 hydroxybenzonitrile 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile and three 3 5 dihalo 2 hydroxybenzonitriles i e 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile 5 bromo 3 chloro 2 hydroxybenzonitrile and 3 5 dibromo 2 hydroxybenzonitrile were detected and identified as a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps in drinking water at ng l levels the successful identification of hhbn species in drinking water verified the applicability of theoretical calculation to the structural speculation of new halogenated dbps our work demonstrated that these new hhbns are significantly higher cytotoxic in cho cells than regulated thms haas and bromate it is particularly worth mentioning that hhbns 50 in drinking water presented comparable concentration toxicity contribution to hnps 50 which have been reported to exhibit significantly higher concentration cytotoxicity contribution among the reported halogenated aromatic dbps furthermore our work also revealed that hhbns 43 are slightly less stable in the presence of chlorine than hnps 57 which have been reported as the most stable category among hps hhbas hhbds and hnps during disinfection thus hhbns should be regarded as a new group of halogenated aromatic dbps of emerging concern in drinking water in addition three new hnp species including 2 4 dichloro 6 nitrophenol 2 4 dibromo 6 nitrophenol and 4 bromo 2 chloro 6 nitrophenol were also reported in drinking water for the first time in future studies the transformation products and pathways of hhbns during chlorination need to be thoroughly clarified which is

15909,wastewater treatment plants wwtps may represent point sources for microplastic discharge into the environment quantification of microplastic in effluents of wwtps has been targeted by several studies although standardized methods are missing to enable a comparability of results this study discusses theoretical and practical perspectives on best practices for microplastic sampling campaigns of wwtps one focus of the study was the potential for synergies between thermoanalytical and spectroscopic analysis to gain more representative sampling using the complementary information provided by the different analytical techniques samples were obtained before and after sand filtration from two wwtps in germany using cascade filtration with size classes of 5 000 100 µm 100 50 µm and 50 10 µm for spectroscopic methods samples were treated by a fenton process to remove natural organic matter whereas ted gc ms required only sample extraction from the filter cascade µftir spectroscopy was used for the 100 µm and 50 µm basket filters and µraman spectroscopy was applied to analyze particles on the smallest basket filter 10 µm ted gc ms was used for all size classes as it is size independent all techniques showed a similar trend where pe was consistently the most prominent polymer in wwtp effluents based on this insight pe was chosen as surrogate polymer to investigate whether it can describe the total polymer removal efficiency of tertiary sand filters the results revealed no significant difference anova between retention efficiencies of tertiary sand filtration obtained using only pe and by analyzing all possible polymers with µftir and µraman spectroscopy findings from this study provide valuable insights on advantages and limitations of cascade filtration the benefit of complementary analyses a suitable design for future experimental approaches and recommendations for future investigations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics analysis sampling strategies sample preparation analytical synergies ted gc ms µftir spectroscopy µraman spectroscopy surrogate polymer 1 introduction according to plastics europe 2019 plastic production has been steadily increasing since the first introduction of a fully synthetic polymer in 1907 to production rates as high as 359 million tons per year reported for 2018 low global recycling rates for plastics lead to accumulation of plastic waste in the environment ribeiro et al 2019 first studies investigating the presence of microplastics in the environment appeared in the 1970s and the interest has been growing since jambeck et al 2015 microplastics are defined as plastic particles and fibers in the size range 1 µm 1 mm fragments in the size range 1 5 mm can be referred as large microplastics braun et al 2020 despite removing a significant amount of microplastic particles from wastewater various studies show that conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps might still be potential point sources of microplastics to the aquatic environment okoffo et al 2019 however the process of sampling and analyzing microplastics is yet to be standardized despite studies having attempted to harmonize the applied methodologies jung et al 2021 koelmans et al 2019 in most cases the definitions of the processes from the research question to the analysis of microplastics as well as the problems and pitfalls faced during these steps are not being addressed in this study best practices regarding microplastic sampling and analysis are addressed based on field and laboratory experience by the authors in the context of sampling secondary and tertiary treated wastewater effluents from two wwtps with tertiary sand filters analysis was performed with thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy µftir and raman microspectroscopy µraman therefore the strategies challenges pitfalls possible synergies and limitations of the analytical methods in the application to wastewater effluent samples are presented for this purpose the discussion clusters into four main aspects as summarized in fig 1 general considerations research question sampling sample preparation and sample analysis each aspect is treated in further detail in the following chapters 1 1 general considerations studies investigating the release of microplastics from wwtps can utilize spectroscopic analysis methods such as µftir and µraman or thermoanalytical techniques like ted gc ms ben david et al 2021 funck et al 2021 horton et al 2021 however due to time and cost constraints most studies are forced to quantify microplastics using only one of those analytical techniques restricting them to either certain particle size ranges or masses thus limiting the type of information obtained the results obtained by both types of analytical methods differ from each other in the following key areas spectroscopic methods reveal information regarding the morphology particles and fibers can be distinguished size number and identity of the particles but masses cannot be quantified directly mallow et al 2020 thermoanalytical methods provide information only on mass and identity but not about particle morphology size or numbers mallow et al 2020 shortcoming regarding particle size information might be partially alleviated via sieve fractioning using cascade filtration bannick et al 2019 but this should be handled cautiously as it might be prone to error finally different analytical techniques require tailored sample preparation methods thus depending on whether number size morphology polymer type and or mass of microplastic particles need to be determined for answering the specific research question the analytical technique must be selected in advanced as sampling and sample preparation methods need to be adjusted accordingly 1 2 sampling considerations the main challenge when sampling wastewater streams is the ability to sample representative volumes and to simultaneously capture small and large microplastics bannick et al 2019 multiple sampling approaches are reported in literature such as grab sampling using buckets or pumping through a single sieve or a stack of sieves carr et al 2016 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 mason et al 2016 however those methods may lack the ability to sample large representative volumes these volumes are especially required for thermoanalytical methods bucket grab samples are usually limited to a few liters and only suited for dissolved analytes sieves can suffer from cake filtration and rapid pressure drops if the mesh sizes are small enough for capturing smaller particles a possible solution to both problems is the use of pressurized cartridges with a stack of sieves funck et al 2020 lenz and labrenz 2018 pittroff et al 2021 this technique employs a pressurized housing with a cascade of filters or sieves of decreasing sizes for example 100 µm 50 µm and 10 µm a pump then forces wastewater under pressure through the sieves allowing filtration of multiple cubic meters using larger sieves 50 100 µm where cake filtration build up is slower to occur this simultaneously allows processing multiple hundreds of liters over the smallest sieve 10 µm this would still allow a representative volume for the smaller microplastics as they require less sampling volumes hundreds of liters vs thousands of liters for larger fractions due to their abundance compared to larger microplastics braun et al 2020 funck et al 2020 since ted gc ms µftir and µraman require different representative sampling amounts the specific sampling volume for the analytical method is paramount small microplastics despite their abundance have a low mass thereby requiring higher volumes to be concentrated when analyzed via ted gc ms funck et al 2021 in contrast larger microplastics despite their high mass occur less frequently thus spectroscopic methods might require a higher sampling volume to avoid analysis errors such as over or under estimation of the microplastic content in larger size fractions this is exacerbated by the fact that spectroscopic methods can usually only analyze a small aliquot of the sample compared to ted gc ms braun et al 2020 1 3 sample preparation the entire sample preparation process must be carried out in a clean room or in a laminar flow box alongside lab and field blanks to minimize contamination both µftir and µraman are very sensitive to interference from the organic environmental matrix due to similar spectra of microplastics and natural organics thus requiring targeted matrix removal during sample preparation beforehand to avoid analytical artifacts al azzawi et al 2020 an interference for µftir µraman and ted gc ms are stearic acids and fats which could be interpreted as a false positive detection of pe schymanski et al 2021 using a surfactant emulsifier might help remove these compounds from the sample as they can be dissolved and subsequently removed via filtration however the surfactant needs to be thoroughly rinsed to remove any traces as it can lead to interferences with µftir witzig et al 2020 furthermore digestion based sample preparation helps in removing traces of such interferences from the treated samples by digesting the organic compounds multiple methods such as acidic or alkaline digestion and enzymatic methods are employed here a promising method for removing organic matter without adversely affecting polymers from wastewater samples is an oxidative digestion using the fenton reaction al azzawi et al 2020 hurley et al 2018 in contrast to sample treatment for µftir and µraman sample preparation for ted gc ms usually does not require chemical digestion however they still require sample extraction from the filter cascade bannick et al 2019 1 4 sample analysis µftir and µraman both require relative long analysis times whereas ted gc ms is comparatively faster mallow et al 2020 to circumvent long analysis times for spectroscopic methods some studies attempted either scanning a small percentage of the filter or utilizing microscopy for pre screening and only analyzed selected particles via spectroscopy carr et al 2016 renner et al 2020 unfortunately both approaches might reduce the quality of the statistical data obtained elert et al 2017 whereas µftir spectroscopy is not reliable for particles 10 µm in size µraman spectroscopy is able to quantify these particles reliably studies worked out that µraman spectroscopy can detect up to 35 more particles in the range of 500 µm to 50 µm compared to µftir spectroscopy cabernard et al 2018 käppler et al 2016 käppler et al 2016 reported a µraman spectroscopy analysis duration of 38 h which is significantly longer compared to µftir spectroscopy 20 min shortening the µraman spectroscopy analysis time to 90 min by changing scan parameters led to a loss of information and the detected particle number was comparable to µftir spectroscopy käppler et al 2016 therefore the authors recommended that due to lengthy analysis times particles in the size range of 500 µm to 50 µm should be analyzed by µftir while particles in the size range of 50 µm to 1 µm should be analyzed by µraman käppler et al 2016 the proposed size division at 50 µm has been recently applied for µftir and µraman analysis of microplastics down to a size of 3 µm in commercially important mussels ivleva 2021 finally ted gc ms can be used for all size classes with the caveat that a sample of sufficient mass concentration is required especially for smaller sizes it is critical to concentrate the sample to reach the limits of detection and quantification lod and loq of this method funck et al 2021 to benefit from the synergies of these analytical methods while avoiding their shortcomings these three methods may be combined when analyzing a sample which has been subdivided via size fractioning as recommended by käppler et al 2016 and adequately processed in sample preparation however due to cost and time constraints or lack of access to all analytical methods a combination has not always been feasible thus for the first time best practices for µftir µraman and ted gc ms are presented in literature based on real world samples and analysis alongside novel findings from these analyses such as the feasibility of using surrogate polymers during evaluation of process efficiency a focus on the synergies among the methods are presented 2 materials and methods of the case study microplastics in tertiary sand filter effluents 2 1 general considerations the study s objective was to assess synergies between thermoanalytic and spectroscopic analytical methods in real samples this comparison was performed by co analyzing samples using ted gc ms µftir and µraman spectroscopy however due to time constraints not all samples were analyzed via µftir and µraman when compared to ted gc ms samples for more information on aliquots see si section 2 as discussed in the results despite this limitation the synergies between the three analytical methods could be clearly elucidated 2 2 sampling protocol two wwtps were investigated by performing sampling campaigns from 2019 until 2021 sampling was performed for the secondary treated effluents and the tertiary sand filter effluents the detailed information regarding the wwtp the configuration and removal efficiency of the sand filters were published as part of a separate study by the authors funck et al 2021 the sampling unit consisted of a high volume pump sg 40 victor pumpen gmbh munich germany and three basket filters krone filter gmbh oyten germany configured in a cascade with different cut off values 100 µm 50 µm 10 µm the sampling unit is further described in funck et al 2020 a schematic as well as a photo of the cascade system can be seen in fig 2 cake filtration was avoided by monitoring pressure changes at the sieve inlets approximately 200 400 l of wastewater effluent could be filtered through the smallest 10 µm sieve at an inlet pressure of 0 8 bar the 10 µm sieve was removed from its modular housing and the larger two sieves 100 µm 50 µm could resume sampling and processing volumes of up to 7 m3 funck et al 2020 a method for in situ rinsing of the cascade filtration system was also investigated and the following protocol was developed 1 the empty cascade filtration system was rinsed by pumping through 150 200 l of feed stream this ensured that only the feed stream was present and homogenized inside of the sealed system washing was always done at the maximum performance of the pump up to 18 m3 h to flush all contamination and debris from the system 2 the pump was stopped the module for the 100 µm filter sieve was opened and the filter was placed inside the system was then rinsed again with 20 30 l this allowed the positioning of the 50 µm sieve into the effluent of the 100 µm sieve which is upstream from it without danger of contamination with larger particles 3 the same process was then repeated for the 10 µm sieve as it was inserted into its corresponding module downstream of the 50 µm filter sieve and sampling could be started three types of blank samples were investigated to ensure contamination free processing of collected samples 1 laboratory blanks were investigated by applying the fenton protocol to ultrapure water upw samples as described by al azzawi et al 2020 2 process blanks were investigated by cleaning and rinsing the sieves after sampling then immediately performing a sample extraction on those clean sieves as is described in the next section the purpose of this was to measure the effect of potential contamination from sieves on the next sampling event 3 field blanks were also investigated where a sieve was placed in a parallel blank sampling unit for the duration of the sampling to quantify air contamination at the sampling site 2 3 sample preparation sieves were wrapped in aluminum foils before and after sampling all rinsing and filtration steps took place inside a laminar flow box laminar flow module fms series susi spetec germany to avoid airborne contamination particles were rinsed from each filter into a glass beaker using upw and a metal brush funck et al 2020 aliquots were then filtered via whatmantm cellulose nitrate membrane filter 45 mm diameter 0 2 µm pore size ge healthcare life sciences chalfont st giles gb the filtered material was transferred into another glass beaker with 1 ml of a 0 1 v v tween 20 surfactant solution merck kgaa darmstadt germany to aid in removing particles from the filter subsequent sample preparation for spectroscopic analysis was then conducted using a slightly modified version of the fenton protocol which was described by al azzawi et al 2020 for details see si section 3 thermoanalytical analysis via ted gc ms did not require fenton treatment because the low amount of organic matter 1 mg total mass did not interfere with quantification and identification of the polymers a possible exception could be fats and stearic acid which can cause interference in ted gc ms but those were not observed in the samples further studies concerning this topic are required for finding a threshold value in dependence of the sample samples were filtered via cellulose nitrate membrane filter and then transferred into glass vials via 600 µl of a 1 g l 1 solution of 0 1 v v tween 20 the technique used is described in funck et al 2021 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 µftir spectroscopy analysis fenton treated aliquots 10 30 of the total sample volume from the 100 µm and 50 µm sieves were filtered on 25 mm anodiscstm whatman pp supported 0 2 µm pore size and subsequently analyzed via focal plane array fpa µftir spectroscopy further details of the analytical method are described in si section 4 2 4 2 µraman spectroscopy analysis fenton treated aliquots 10 20 of the total sample volume from the 10 µm sieves were measured via raman microspectroscopy according to the protocol brought forward by von der esch et al 2020 the morphological characterization software tum particletyper kohles et al 2020 von der esch et al 2020 von der esch et al 2020 was used the method is described in detail within si section 5 2 4 3 ted gc ms analysis the analytical method was published previously by funck et al 2021 for each wwtp sample an aliquot 30 100 of the total sample volume was taken details including quality control samples are in si sections 6 to 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 general considerations using the data from multiple methods coupled with cascade filtration allowed for a complementary understanding of their synergies and limitations further a validation of workarounds was possible like the use of cascade fractioning to estimate size fractions utilizing only thermoanalytical methods finally it enabled using a common surrogate polymer to assess the removal efficiency of microplastics in sand filter rather than relying on the total polymers according to each method s identification library 3 2 sampling best practices based on lessons learnt from literature and field experiences this section conveys the lessons and best practices learnt from literature reviews as well as two years of investigations made during the sampling campaigns conducted by the authors sampling was performed using the cascade filtration system and the sampling protocol presented in section 2 2 this represented an optimized method established by the authors to prepare the system in the field and minimize contamination in situ due to its practicality and cost effectiveness when compared to rinsing the system with filtered upw this sampling protocol allowed at the same time to remove any previous contaminations from the system and to ensure that every filter sieve receives the correct size fraction of the particles the process was fast requiring only 5 minutes and it can be applied to any cascade filtration system for any aquatic sample as recommended by previous studies braun et al 2020 koelmans et al 2019 initially field blanks were prepared in parallel by using a clean sieve that was exposed to the air this may not be fully representative however the authors hypothesized that such open air blanks dealt only with airborne contamination whereas the sampling system used in this study was enclosed and samples were taken from one meter below the water surface from an effluent discharge trench where the nature of light airborne particles makes them unlikely to sink to 1 m depth and to be sucked into the cascade filtration system results obtained during the open air blank field sampling agreed with this observation all field blanks were measured using all three methods whereas spectroscopic analyses showed a large number of particle pollution in most of the field blank samples ted gc ms could not detect polymers in any field blank samples this indicated that indeed the particles detected via spectroscopic analyses were indeed very light and possessed little mass so that they could not be detected by ted gc ms despite high nominal particle counts therefore open air field blanks might not be suitable as a field blank when working with sealed systems and sampling from at least one meter below the surface 3 3 sample preparation using the surfactant tween 20 solution 0 1 v v to suspend the samples during extraction from the sieves aimed to reduce particle agglomeration and increase suspendability additionally the surfactant aids the homogeneity when the sample is subdivided into aliquots tests on ps particles 90 125 µm showed 97 uniformity in suspension when dividing tap water samples mixed with 0 1 v v tween 20 solution further for spectroscopic analysis fenton reaction was used and little to no interference from residual natural organic matter particles for both µftir as well as µraman was observed 3 4 analysis 3 4 1 synergies between the analytical methods with the main three analytical methods for microplastic analysis employed for the evaluation of the wwtp samples the respective results can be compared and synergies pointed out an overall positive outcome is the general tendency that measurements from ted gc ms and µftir µraman showed an agreement samples with higher microplastic content secondary effluents show an elevated microplastic content across all three methods when compared to the tertiary effluents of the sand filters furthermore all three methods agreed in that pe was by far the most abundant polymer in all samples both before and after sand filtration possibly the most compelling proof was provided by the identification of an outlier in the sampling campaign at one time point all three methods agreed that there was a larger amount of pe in the tertiary effluent compared to the secondary effluents see fig 3 in this case using multiple methods provided the assurance that the outlier was not from the analytical methods used due to artifacts but rather an abnormality in the operation of the investigated wwtp indeed upon investigation the wwtp reported an issue on that day with the flow feeding the sand filters although the effects of this flow irregularity remained a mystery as to why only pe was affected and not the rest of the polymers nevertheless the event served to test the synergies between the three analytical techniques in the case of an outlier this is an exemplifying case of using the synergies of different analysis methods to achieve higher reliability another indication of synergies was pp which was detected in some spectroscopic samples where ted gc ms was not able to detect it this also included several of the process blanks demonstrating that spectroscopic analysis can detect small light weight particles that are below the detection limits for mass based approaches in the case of the process blanks it is suspected that the lining of the hydrogen peroxide bottle cap used in the fenton reaction was the source of the pp particles in some of the samples since spectroscopic analyses could detect pp in the process blanks pp was considered as a false positive only for spectroscopic samples in this study however it is worth mentioning that while the general trend is clear for all three types of methods the degree of the increase observed by each analytical method varied substantially for the example of fig 3 and pe µraman samples exhibited an increase by a factor of 266 5 whereas µftir results increased by a factor of 7 4 and ted gc ms results revealed only an increase by a factor of 1 2 this can be explained by the fact that smaller particles are more prevalent in the samples as a rule explaining the generally much larger number of particles detected by µraman compared to µftir spectroscopy as µftir spectroscopy is measuring only the particles down to 50 µm whereas µraman spectroscopy is used in this study to analyze only the smallest fraction 10 µm 50 µm käppler et al 2016 furthermore due to the cubic law the smaller particles do not possess high mass which can explain the modest increase in the mass determined by ted gc ms measurements comparing the results of fig 3 to literature where the same methods were used for quantifying the mp effluent from sand filters further indicates that the abnormality of the wwtp during operation is most likely responsible for the unexpected results in a previous study by the authors funck et al 2021 the same wwtp exhibited lower amounts of all polymers in the sand filter effluent in multiple sampling campaigns analysis was conducted with ted gc ms only but regardless of the method the results in fig 3 differ significantly in three sampling campaigns the average retentions of pe were 94 3 whereas the presented results show an increase of pe in the sand filter effluent additionally ben david et al 2021 conducted an analysis of mp at a wwtp with a sand filter as tertiary treatment with µraman here also a significant retardation of polymers was observed after the sand filter thus proving the results as non representative for wwtp s the phenomenon of smaller particles not possessing a high mass as previously described was observed during an 8 hour flow proportional sample where the flow of the inlet pump to the filter cascade was restricted to achieve volumes similar to the normal grab samples 1 3 hours this changed flow regime during sampling caused a change in the type of sampled microplastic particles the sample included particles which were clearly detected via µftir but no mass was detected when using ted gc ms indicating that those particles might be exclusively lighter thinner because of the changed flow parameters to the cascade filter the results for the 8 hour volume proportional sample are shown in fig 4 this additionally indicates that the resulting mixed and grab samples might not be comparable due to the different flow conditions required this fact was proven by further sampling campaigns analyzed by ted gc ms these results are shown in si section 12 based on this and as shown in the workflow of fig 1 it is recommended to cross check between analyses when a result does not follow expectations based on previous experiences from the sampling point similar points or show interferences 3 4 2 validating the estimation of size classification using cascade filtration and thermoanalytical analysis the sampling system used consisted of three filters with decreasing sieve sizes 100 µm 50 µm 10 µm this has been suggested to help in obtaining size fractions when using thermoanalytical methods elert et al 2017 the size distribution measurements via spectroscopic analysis after categorizing them by cascade filter and effluent type can be seen in fig 5 it can be observed that for the 100 µm sieve on average only 57 26 and 32 18 of the detected particles in the influent and effluent of the sand filter respectively were in the expected ideal size range i e 100 µm this can be attributed to cake filtration occurring where particles including algae in the wastewater stream are clogging the filters a picture of a sample extracted from the 100 µm basket filter is depicted in si section 11 from the particles detected on the 50 µm sieve only 34 3 and 30 12 of the particles detected in the influent and effluent of the sand filter respectively were in the ideal size range 50 µm 100 µm finally the smallest sieve 10 µm was analyzed via µraman spectroscopy it showed 87 sand filter influent single sample and 94 6 sand filter effluent of the particles detected were in the ideal size range 10 µm 50 µm however it was not possible to know if particles smaller than 10 µm were also present on the 10 µm filter since those are below the reliable detection range of the applied µraman analysis this can be attributed to irregularities in pore sizes in the utilized steel filter meshes this was investigated using optical microscopy and the results showed a damage si section 10 in the mesh already after three uses with tears in the mesh corresponding to much larger sizes than the nominal pore size this explains the presence of larger particles on the smaller filters unfortunately it is difficult to completely avoid this effect as the filters in a cascade are under pressure for multiple hours during sample filtration and afterwards the microplastic must be extracted from those filters with the use of brushes furthermore the technique from funck et al 2020 was employed where a metal wire brush was used to extract the samples from the filters with recovery rates of 80 to avoid filter damage a soft shoe brush made of horsehair instead of the established metal brush was investigated for sample extraction to reduce the damage to the filters without compromising the microplastic extraction efficiency si section 10 in the light of these precautions however it is recommended to consider the particle size related information obtained via thermoanalytical methods and cascade filters only as very rough estimate additionally the basket filters should be thoroughly investigated for damages after sample extraction a more detailed investigation of size fractions requires the use of spectroscopic analysis such as µfitr and µraman spectroscopy nevertheless the use of such a modular cascade filtration system instead of a single sieve is recommended due to the combination of large volume sampling for the larger sieves with the ability to capture smaller particles either via the small sieves early on or via cake filtration on the larger sieves at later stages 3 4 3 feasibility of using surrogate polymers during evaluation of process efficiency when discussing the total amount of microplastic emissions it is important to analyze as many polymer types as possible or at least most of the common polymers despite the effort and time required to establish identification libraries for example both thermoanalytical and spectroscopic techniques utilize either commercial open source or self created identification libraries however when attempting to evaluate the efficiency of various processes in wwtps it could be advantageous if there was a single polymer that can be used as a surrogate to represent the behavior of all other microplastics inside a defined system boundary results in this study suggest that if a study s objective is to evaluate the efficiency of microplastic removal inside of sand filters then utilizing pe might achieve a representative result compared to taking all available polymers into account table 1 this may indicate that the behavior of pe during tertiary sand filtration at a wwtp seems to mimic well that of other polymers pe was selected as it was the polymer found in the majority of collected samples and represented the single largest fraction of the polymers 25 13 pe on average in all effluent and influent samples one way analysis of variance anova showed no significant difference p 0 05 when the retention efficiencies obtained by analyzing all possible polymers excluding pp due to the aforementioned blank issue 10 polymers for µftir spectroscopy and 7 polymers for µraman spectroscopy was compared to the retention of the surrogate pe this indicated that pe could be a viable surrogate candidate in such similar cases i e process evaluation in wastewater treatment even though it makes up only a quarter of the total polymer fraction these results represent first insights into the usage of surrogates to assess process efficiency the topic is not yet discussed in literature to the best knowledge of the authors this is surprising as surrogate parameters are often used in water and wastewater engineering to simplify process evaluations even when dealing with trace pollutants dittmar et al 2018 however this topic would require a dedicated study to further validate these results and ensure statistical significance as the amount of data especially for µraman spectroscopy cannot be used for any definite statements as can be seen in table 1 for example raman analyses for the determination of removal efficiency were conducted by taking samples at the influent and effluent of the tertiary sand filters this was not possible to do at exactly the same time with the equipment available and was in fact done 24 hours apart which might explain the increase of the number of particles 50 µm in the effluent making these results non representative of the actual wwtp performance the same situation holds true for ted gc ms samples while having a large number of samples the analysis only included four polymers pe ps pp and pet and thus not enough to make a statement about total polymers vs pe it is worth stressing again that such an approach might only be applicable for a process evaluation like removal efficiencies as this depends on the general behavior of microplastics across both sides of a process boundary sand filter in this case this surrogate method is not yet intended for use as a general estimator for the total amount of microplastic in a certain system 4 conclusion the presented process flow chart for microplastic sampling and analysis fig 1 allows to establish a workflow based on thermoanalytical and or spectroscopic methods the study presented pitfalls and considerations regarding sampling and analysis for example the need to harmonize sampling methods including representative volumes as well as sampling flow speeds since otherwise there can be no comparability between studies furthermore due to high volume sampling combined with simultaneous capturing of large and small particles the use of cascade filtration is highly recommended for microplastic grab samples at wwtp effluents however this recommendation does not extend to the use of cascade filtration to estimate the size distribution of microplastics when using a thermoanalytical analysis method the study highlighted the potential role of synergies between various analytical approaches to gain more complete information on the sample to determine outliers and interferences for example however even though the combination of analytical techniques helped to verify the observation of an operational outlier event the reason behind the event could not be identified or explained this study was aimed at wwtp effluents however the considerations and procedures are transferrable to other sample types or matrices provided that the necessary adjustments to the sampling and sample preparation are to be made finally the study recommends further investigations of the use of surrogate polymers for determining retention

15909,wastewater treatment plants wwtps may represent point sources for microplastic discharge into the environment quantification of microplastic in effluents of wwtps has been targeted by several studies although standardized methods are missing to enable a comparability of results this study discusses theoretical and practical perspectives on best practices for microplastic sampling campaigns of wwtps one focus of the study was the potential for synergies between thermoanalytical and spectroscopic analysis to gain more representative sampling using the complementary information provided by the different analytical techniques samples were obtained before and after sand filtration from two wwtps in germany using cascade filtration with size classes of 5 000 100 µm 100 50 µm and 50 10 µm for spectroscopic methods samples were treated by a fenton process to remove natural organic matter whereas ted gc ms required only sample extraction from the filter cascade µftir spectroscopy was used for the 100 µm and 50 µm basket filters and µraman spectroscopy was applied to analyze particles on the smallest basket filter 10 µm ted gc ms was used for all size classes as it is size independent all techniques showed a similar trend where pe was consistently the most prominent polymer in wwtp effluents based on this insight pe was chosen as surrogate polymer to investigate whether it can describe the total polymer removal efficiency of tertiary sand filters the results revealed no significant difference anova between retention efficiencies of tertiary sand filtration obtained using only pe and by analyzing all possible polymers with µftir and µraman spectroscopy findings from this study provide valuable insights on advantages and limitations of cascade filtration the benefit of complementary analyses a suitable design for future experimental approaches and recommendations for future investigations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics analysis sampling strategies sample preparation analytical synergies ted gc ms µftir spectroscopy µraman spectroscopy surrogate polymer 1 introduction according to plastics europe 2019 plastic production has been steadily increasing since the first introduction of a fully synthetic polymer in 1907 to production rates as high as 359 million tons per year reported for 2018 low global recycling rates for plastics lead to accumulation of plastic waste in the environment ribeiro et al 2019 first studies investigating the presence of microplastics in the environment appeared in the 1970s and the interest has been growing since jambeck et al 2015 microplastics are defined as plastic particles and fibers in the size range 1 µm 1 mm fragments in the size range 1 5 mm can be referred as large microplastics braun et al 2020 despite removing a significant amount of microplastic particles from wastewater various studies show that conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps might still be potential point sources of microplastics to the aquatic environment okoffo et al 2019 however the process of sampling and analyzing microplastics is yet to be standardized despite studies having attempted to harmonize the applied methodologies jung et al 2021 koelmans et al 2019 in most cases the definitions of the processes from the research question to the analysis of microplastics as well as the problems and pitfalls faced during these steps are not being addressed in this study best practices regarding microplastic sampling and analysis are addressed based on field and laboratory experience by the authors in the context of sampling secondary and tertiary treated wastewater effluents from two wwtps with tertiary sand filters analysis was performed with thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy µftir and raman microspectroscopy µraman therefore the strategies challenges pitfalls possible synergies and limitations of the analytical methods in the application to wastewater effluent samples are presented for this purpose the discussion clusters into four main aspects as summarized in fig 1 general considerations research question sampling sample preparation and sample analysis each aspect is treated in further detail in the following chapters 1 1 general considerations studies investigating the release of microplastics from wwtps can utilize spectroscopic analysis methods such as µftir and µraman or thermoanalytical techniques like ted gc ms ben david et al 2021 funck et al 2021 horton et al 2021 however due to time and cost constraints most studies are forced to quantify microplastics using only one of those analytical techniques restricting them to either certain particle size ranges or masses thus limiting the type of information obtained the results obtained by both types of analytical methods differ from each other in the following key areas spectroscopic methods reveal information regarding the morphology particles and fibers can be distinguished size number and identity of the particles but masses cannot be quantified directly mallow et al 2020 thermoanalytical methods provide information only on mass and identity but not about particle morphology size or numbers mallow et al 2020 shortcoming regarding particle size information might be partially alleviated via sieve fractioning using cascade filtration bannick et al 2019 but this should be handled cautiously as it might be prone to error finally different analytical techniques require tailored sample preparation methods thus depending on whether number size morphology polymer type and or mass of microplastic particles need to be determined for answering the specific research question the analytical technique must be selected in advanced as sampling and sample preparation methods need to be adjusted accordingly 1 2 sampling considerations the main challenge when sampling wastewater streams is the ability to sample representative volumes and to simultaneously capture small and large microplastics bannick et al 2019 multiple sampling approaches are reported in literature such as grab sampling using buckets or pumping through a single sieve or a stack of sieves carr et al 2016 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 mason et al 2016 however those methods may lack the ability to sample large representative volumes these volumes are especially required for thermoanalytical methods bucket grab samples are usually limited to a few liters and only suited for dissolved analytes sieves can suffer from cake filtration and rapid pressure drops if the mesh sizes are small enough for capturing smaller particles a possible solution to both problems is the use of pressurized cartridges with a stack of sieves funck et al 2020 lenz and labrenz 2018 pittroff et al 2021 this technique employs a pressurized housing with a cascade of filters or sieves of decreasing sizes for example 100 µm 50 µm and 10 µm a pump then forces wastewater under pressure through the sieves allowing filtration of multiple cubic meters using larger sieves 50 100 µm where cake filtration build up is slower to occur this simultaneously allows processing multiple hundreds of liters over the smallest sieve 10 µm this would still allow a representative volume for the smaller microplastics as they require less sampling volumes hundreds of liters vs thousands of liters for larger fractions due to their abundance compared to larger microplastics braun et al 2020 funck et al 2020 since ted gc ms µftir and µraman require different representative sampling amounts the specific sampling volume for the analytical method is paramount small microplastics despite their abundance have a low mass thereby requiring higher volumes to be concentrated when analyzed via ted gc ms funck et al 2021 in contrast larger microplastics despite their high mass occur less frequently thus spectroscopic methods might require a higher sampling volume to avoid analysis errors such as over or under estimation of the microplastic content in larger size fractions this is exacerbated by the fact that spectroscopic methods can usually only analyze a small aliquot of the sample compared to ted gc ms braun et al 2020 1 3 sample preparation the entire sample preparation process must be carried out in a clean room or in a laminar flow box alongside lab and field blanks to minimize contamination both µftir and µraman are very sensitive to interference from the organic environmental matrix due to similar spectra of microplastics and natural organics thus requiring targeted matrix removal during sample preparation beforehand to avoid analytical artifacts al azzawi et al 2020 an interference for µftir µraman and ted gc ms are stearic acids and fats which could be interpreted as a false positive detection of pe schymanski et al 2021 using a surfactant emulsifier might help remove these compounds from the sample as they can be dissolved and subsequently removed via filtration however the surfactant needs to be thoroughly rinsed to remove any traces as it can lead to interferences with µftir witzig et al 2020 furthermore digestion based sample preparation helps in removing traces of such interferences from the treated samples by digesting the organic compounds multiple methods such as acidic or alkaline digestion and enzymatic methods are employed here a promising method for removing organic matter without adversely affecting polymers from wastewater samples is an oxidative digestion using the fenton reaction al azzawi et al 2020 hurley et al 2018 in contrast to sample treatment for µftir and µraman sample preparation for ted gc ms usually does not require chemical digestion however they still require sample extraction from the filter cascade bannick et al 2019 1 4 sample analysis µftir and µraman both require relative long analysis times whereas ted gc ms is comparatively faster mallow et al 2020 to circumvent long analysis times for spectroscopic methods some studies attempted either scanning a small percentage of the filter or utilizing microscopy for pre screening and only analyzed selected particles via spectroscopy carr et al 2016 renner et al 2020 unfortunately both approaches might reduce the quality of the statistical data obtained elert et al 2017 whereas µftir spectroscopy is not reliable for particles 10 µm in size µraman spectroscopy is able to quantify these particles reliably studies worked out that µraman spectroscopy can detect up to 35 more particles in the range of 500 µm to 50 µm compared to µftir spectroscopy cabernard et al 2018 käppler et al 2016 käppler et al 2016 reported a µraman spectroscopy analysis duration of 38 h which is significantly longer compared to µftir spectroscopy 20 min shortening the µraman spectroscopy analysis time to 90 min by changing scan parameters led to a loss of information and the detected particle number was comparable to µftir spectroscopy käppler et al 2016 therefore the authors recommended that due to lengthy analysis times particles in the size range of 500 µm to 50 µm should be analyzed by µftir while particles in the size range of 50 µm to 1 µm should be analyzed by µraman käppler et al 2016 the proposed size division at 50 µm has been recently applied for µftir and µraman analysis of microplastics down to a size of 3 µm in commercially important mussels ivleva 2021 finally ted gc ms can be used for all size classes with the caveat that a sample of sufficient mass concentration is required especially for smaller sizes it is critical to concentrate the sample to reach the limits of detection and quantification lod and loq of this method funck et al 2021 to benefit from the synergies of these analytical methods while avoiding their shortcomings these three methods may be combined when analyzing a sample which has been subdivided via size fractioning as recommended by käppler et al 2016 and adequately processed in sample preparation however due to cost and time constraints or lack of access to all analytical methods a combination has not always been feasible thus for the first time best practices for µftir µraman and ted gc ms are presented in literature based on real world samples and analysis alongside novel findings from these analyses such as the feasibility of using surrogate polymers during evaluation of process efficiency a focus on the synergies among the methods are presented 2 materials and methods of the case study microplastics in tertiary sand filter effluents 2 1 general considerations the study s objective was to assess synergies between thermoanalytic and spectroscopic analytical methods in real samples this comparison was performed by co analyzing samples using ted gc ms µftir and µraman spectroscopy however due to time constraints not all samples were analyzed via µftir and µraman when compared to ted gc ms samples for more information on aliquots see si section 2 as discussed in the results despite this limitation the synergies between the three analytical methods could be clearly elucidated 2 2 sampling protocol two wwtps were investigated by performing sampling campaigns from 2019 until 2021 sampling was performed for the secondary treated effluents and the tertiary sand filter effluents the detailed information regarding the wwtp the configuration and removal efficiency of the sand filters were published as part of a separate study by the authors funck et al 2021 the sampling unit consisted of a high volume pump sg 40 victor pumpen gmbh munich germany and three basket filters krone filter gmbh oyten germany configured in a cascade with different cut off values 100 µm 50 µm 10 µm the sampling unit is further described in funck et al 2020 a schematic as well as a photo of the cascade system can be seen in fig 2 cake filtration was avoided by monitoring pressure changes at the sieve inlets approximately 200 400 l of wastewater effluent could be filtered through the smallest 10 µm sieve at an inlet pressure of 0 8 bar the 10 µm sieve was removed from its modular housing and the larger two sieves 100 µm 50 µm could resume sampling and processing volumes of up to 7 m3 funck et al 2020 a method for in situ rinsing of the cascade filtration system was also investigated and the following protocol was developed 1 the empty cascade filtration system was rinsed by pumping through 150 200 l of feed stream this ensured that only the feed stream was present and homogenized inside of the sealed system washing was always done at the maximum performance of the pump up to 18 m3 h to flush all contamination and debris from the system 2 the pump was stopped the module for the 100 µm filter sieve was opened and the filter was placed inside the system was then rinsed again with 20 30 l this allowed the positioning of the 50 µm sieve into the effluent of the 100 µm sieve which is upstream from it without danger of contamination with larger particles 3 the same process was then repeated for the 10 µm sieve as it was inserted into its corresponding module downstream of the 50 µm filter sieve and sampling could be started three types of blank samples were investigated to ensure contamination free processing of collected samples 1 laboratory blanks were investigated by applying the fenton protocol to ultrapure water upw samples as described by al azzawi et al 2020 2 process blanks were investigated by cleaning and rinsing the sieves after sampling then immediately performing a sample extraction on those clean sieves as is described in the next section the purpose of this was to measure the effect of potential contamination from sieves on the next sampling event 3 field blanks were also investigated where a sieve was placed in a parallel blank sampling unit for the duration of the sampling to quantify air contamination at the sampling site 2 3 sample preparation sieves were wrapped in aluminum foils before and after sampling all rinsing and filtration steps took place inside a laminar flow box laminar flow module fms series susi spetec germany to avoid airborne contamination particles were rinsed from each filter into a glass beaker using upw and a metal brush funck et al 2020 aliquots were then filtered via whatmantm cellulose nitrate membrane filter 45 mm diameter 0 2 µm pore size ge healthcare life sciences chalfont st giles gb the filtered material was transferred into another glass beaker with 1 ml of a 0 1 v v tween 20 surfactant solution merck kgaa darmstadt germany to aid in removing particles from the filter subsequent sample preparation for spectroscopic analysis was then conducted using a slightly modified version of the fenton protocol which was described by al azzawi et al 2020 for details see si section 3 thermoanalytical analysis via ted gc ms did not require fenton treatment because the low amount of organic matter 1 mg total mass did not interfere with quantification and identification of the polymers a possible exception could be fats and stearic acid which can cause interference in ted gc ms but those were not observed in the samples further studies concerning this topic are required for finding a threshold value in dependence of the sample samples were filtered via cellulose nitrate membrane filter and then transferred into glass vials via 600 µl of a 1 g l 1 solution of 0 1 v v tween 20 the technique used is described in funck et al 2021 2 4 analysis 2 4 1 µftir spectroscopy analysis fenton treated aliquots 10 30 of the total sample volume from the 100 µm and 50 µm sieves were filtered on 25 mm anodiscstm whatman pp supported 0 2 µm pore size and subsequently analyzed via focal plane array fpa µftir spectroscopy further details of the analytical method are described in si section 4 2 4 2 µraman spectroscopy analysis fenton treated aliquots 10 20 of the total sample volume from the 10 µm sieves were measured via raman microspectroscopy according to the protocol brought forward by von der esch et al 2020 the morphological characterization software tum particletyper kohles et al 2020 von der esch et al 2020 von der esch et al 2020 was used the method is described in detail within si section 5 2 4 3 ted gc ms analysis the analytical method was published previously by funck et al 2021 for each wwtp sample an aliquot 30 100 of the total sample volume was taken details including quality control samples are in si sections 6 to 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 general considerations using the data from multiple methods coupled with cascade filtration allowed for a complementary understanding of their synergies and limitations further a validation of workarounds was possible like the use of cascade fractioning to estimate size fractions utilizing only thermoanalytical methods finally it enabled using a common surrogate polymer to assess the removal efficiency of microplastics in sand filter rather than relying on the total polymers according to each method s identification library 3 2 sampling best practices based on lessons learnt from literature and field experiences this section conveys the lessons and best practices learnt from literature reviews as well as two years of investigations made during the sampling campaigns conducted by the authors sampling was performed using the cascade filtration system and the sampling protocol presented in section 2 2 this represented an optimized method established by the authors to prepare the system in the field and minimize contamination in situ due to its practicality and cost effectiveness when compared to rinsing the system with filtered upw this sampling protocol allowed at the same time to remove any previous contaminations from the system and to ensure that every filter sieve receives the correct size fraction of the particles the process was fast requiring only 5 minutes and it can be applied to any cascade filtration system for any aquatic sample as recommended by previous studies braun et al 2020 koelmans et al 2019 initially field blanks were prepared in parallel by using a clean sieve that was exposed to the air this may not be fully representative however the authors hypothesized that such open air blanks dealt only with airborne contamination whereas the sampling system used in this study was enclosed and samples were taken from one meter below the water surface from an effluent discharge trench where the nature of light airborne particles makes them unlikely to sink to 1 m depth and to be sucked into the cascade filtration system results obtained during the open air blank field sampling agreed with this observation all field blanks were measured using all three methods whereas spectroscopic analyses showed a large number of particle pollution in most of the field blank samples ted gc ms could not detect polymers in any field blank samples this indicated that indeed the particles detected via spectroscopic analyses were indeed very light and possessed little mass so that they could not be detected by ted gc ms despite high nominal particle counts therefore open air field blanks might not be suitable as a field blank when working with sealed systems and sampling from at least one meter below the surface 3 3 sample preparation using the surfactant tween 20 solution 0 1 v v to suspend the samples during extraction from the sieves aimed to reduce particle agglomeration and increase suspendability additionally the surfactant aids the homogeneity when the sample is subdivided into aliquots tests on ps particles 90 125 µm showed 97 uniformity in suspension when dividing tap water samples mixed with 0 1 v v tween 20 solution further for spectroscopic analysis fenton reaction was used and little to no interference from residual natural organic matter particles for both µftir as well as µraman was observed 3 4 analysis 3 4 1 synergies between the analytical methods with the main three analytical methods for microplastic analysis employed for the evaluation of the wwtp samples the respective results can be compared and synergies pointed out an overall positive outcome is the general tendency that measurements from ted gc ms and µftir µraman showed an agreement samples with higher microplastic content secondary effluents show an elevated microplastic content across all three methods when compared to the tertiary effluents of the sand filters furthermore all three methods agreed in that pe was by far the most abundant polymer in all samples both before and after sand filtration possibly the most compelling proof was provided by the identification of an outlier in the sampling campaign at one time point all three methods agreed that there was a larger amount of pe in the tertiary effluent compared to the secondary effluents see fig 3 in this case using multiple methods provided the assurance that the outlier was not from the analytical methods used due to artifacts but rather an abnormality in the operation of the investigated wwtp indeed upon investigation the wwtp reported an issue on that day with the flow feeding the sand filters although the effects of this flow irregularity remained a mystery as to why only pe was affected and not the rest of the polymers nevertheless the event served to test the synergies between the three analytical techniques in the case of an outlier this is an exemplifying case of using the synergies of different analysis methods to achieve higher reliability another indication of synergies was pp which was detected in some spectroscopic samples where ted gc ms was not able to detect it this also included several of the process blanks demonstrating that spectroscopic analysis can detect small light weight particles that are below the detection limits for mass based approaches in the case of the process blanks it is suspected that the lining of the hydrogen peroxide bottle cap used in the fenton reaction was the source of the pp particles in some of the samples since spectroscopic analyses could detect pp in the process blanks pp was considered as a false positive only for spectroscopic samples in this study however it is worth mentioning that while the general trend is clear for all three types of methods the degree of the increase observed by each analytical method varied substantially for the example of fig 3 and pe µraman samples exhibited an increase by a factor of 266 5 whereas µftir results increased by a factor of 7 4 and ted gc ms results revealed only an increase by a factor of 1 2 this can be explained by the fact that smaller particles are more prevalent in the samples as a rule explaining the generally much larger number of particles detected by µraman compared to µftir spectroscopy as µftir spectroscopy is measuring only the particles down to 50 µm whereas µraman spectroscopy is used in this study to analyze only the smallest fraction 10 µm 50 µm käppler et al 2016 furthermore due to the cubic law the smaller particles do not possess high mass which can explain the modest increase in the mass determined by ted gc ms measurements comparing the results of fig 3 to literature where the same methods were used for quantifying the mp effluent from sand filters further indicates that the abnormality of the wwtp during operation is most likely responsible for the unexpected results in a previous study by the authors funck et al 2021 the same wwtp exhibited lower amounts of all polymers in the sand filter effluent in multiple sampling campaigns analysis was conducted with ted gc ms only but regardless of the method the results in fig 3 differ significantly in three sampling campaigns the average retentions of pe were 94 3 whereas the presented results show an increase of pe in the sand filter effluent additionally ben david et al 2021 conducted an analysis of mp at a wwtp with a sand filter as tertiary treatment with µraman here also a significant retardation of polymers was observed after the sand filter thus proving the results as non representative for wwtp s the phenomenon of smaller particles not possessing a high mass as previously described was observed during an 8 hour flow proportional sample where the flow of the inlet pump to the filter cascade was restricted to achieve volumes similar to the normal grab samples 1 3 hours this changed flow regime during sampling caused a change in the type of sampled microplastic particles the sample included particles which were clearly detected via µftir but no mass was detected when using ted gc ms indicating that those particles might be exclusively lighter thinner because of the changed flow parameters to the cascade filter the results for the 8 hour volume proportional sample are shown in fig 4 this additionally indicates that the resulting mixed and grab samples might not be comparable due to the different flow conditions required this fact was proven by further sampling campaigns analyzed by ted gc ms these results are shown in si section 12 based on this and as shown in the workflow of fig 1 it is recommended to cross check between analyses when a result does not follow expectations based on previous experiences from the sampling point similar points or show interferences 3 4 2 validating the estimation of size classification using cascade filtration and thermoanalytical analysis the sampling system used consisted of three filters with decreasing sieve sizes 100 µm 50 µm 10 µm this has been suggested to help in obtaining size fractions when using thermoanalytical methods elert et al 2017 the size distribution measurements via spectroscopic analysis after categorizing them by cascade filter and effluent type can be seen in fig 5 it can be observed that for the 100 µm sieve on average only 57 26 and 32 18 of the detected particles in the influent and effluent of the sand filter respectively were in the expected ideal size range i e 100 µm this can be attributed to cake filtration occurring where particles including algae in the wastewater stream are clogging the filters a picture of a sample extracted from the 100 µm basket filter is depicted in si section 11 from the particles detected on the 50 µm sieve only 34 3 and 30 12 of the particles detected in the influent and effluent of the sand filter respectively were in the ideal size range 50 µm 100 µm finally the smallest sieve 10 µm was analyzed via µraman spectroscopy it showed 87 sand filter influent single sample and 94 6 sand filter effluent of the particles detected were in the ideal size range 10 µm 50 µm however it was not possible to know if particles smaller than 10 µm were also present on the 10 µm filter since those are below the reliable detection range of the applied µraman analysis this can be attributed to irregularities in pore sizes in the utilized steel filter meshes this was investigated using optical microscopy and the results showed a damage si section 10 in the mesh already after three uses with tears in the mesh corresponding to much larger sizes than the nominal pore size this explains the presence of larger particles on the smaller filters unfortunately it is difficult to completely avoid this effect as the filters in a cascade are under pressure for multiple hours during sample filtration and afterwards the microplastic must be extracted from those filters with the use of brushes furthermore the technique from funck et al 2020 was employed where a metal wire brush was used to extract the samples from the filters with recovery rates of 80 to avoid filter damage a soft shoe brush made of horsehair instead of the established metal brush was investigated for sample extraction to reduce the damage to the filters without compromising the microplastic extraction efficiency si section 10 in the light of these precautions however it is recommended to consider the particle size related information obtained via thermoanalytical methods and cascade filters only as very rough estimate additionally the basket filters should be thoroughly investigated for damages after sample extraction a more detailed investigation of size fractions requires the use of spectroscopic analysis such as µfitr and µraman spectroscopy nevertheless the use of such a modular cascade filtration system instead of a single sieve is recommended due to the combination of large volume sampling for the larger sieves with the ability to capture smaller particles either via the small sieves early on or via cake filtration on the larger sieves at later stages 3 4 3 feasibility of using surrogate polymers during evaluation of process efficiency when discussing the total amount of microplastic emissions it is important to analyze as many polymer types as possible or at least most of the common polymers despite the effort and time required to establish identification libraries for example both thermoanalytical and spectroscopic techniques utilize either commercial open source or self created identification libraries however when attempting to evaluate the efficiency of various processes in wwtps it could be advantageous if there was a single polymer that can be used as a surrogate to represent the behavior of all other microplastics inside a defined system boundary results in this study suggest that if a study s objective is to evaluate the efficiency of microplastic removal inside of sand filters then utilizing pe might achieve a representative result compared to taking all available polymers into account table 1 this may indicate that the behavior of pe during tertiary sand filtration at a wwtp seems to mimic well that of other polymers pe was selected as it was the polymer found in the majority of collected samples and represented the single largest fraction of the polymers 25 13 pe on average in all effluent and influent samples one way analysis of variance anova showed no significant difference p 0 05 when the retention efficiencies obtained by analyzing all possible polymers excluding pp due to the aforementioned blank issue 10 polymers for µftir spectroscopy and 7 polymers for µraman spectroscopy was compared to the retention of the surrogate pe this indicated that pe could be a viable surrogate candidate in such similar cases i e process evaluation in wastewater treatment even though it makes up only a quarter of the total polymer fraction these results represent first insights into the usage of surrogates to assess process efficiency the topic is not yet discussed in literature to the best knowledge of the authors this is surprising as surrogate parameters are often used in water and wastewater engineering to simplify process evaluations even when dealing with trace pollutants dittmar et al 2018 however this topic would require a dedicated study to further validate these results and ensure statistical significance as the amount of data especially for µraman spectroscopy cannot be used for any definite statements as can be seen in table 1 for example raman analyses for the determination of removal efficiency were conducted by taking samples at the influent and effluent of the tertiary sand filters this was not possible to do at exactly the same time with the equipment available and was in fact done 24 hours apart which might explain the increase of the number of particles 50 µm in the effluent making these results non representative of the actual wwtp performance the same situation holds true for ted gc ms samples while having a large number of samples the analysis only included four polymers pe ps pp and pet and thus not enough to make a statement about total polymers vs pe it is worth stressing again that such an approach might only be applicable for a process evaluation like removal efficiencies as this depends on the general behavior of microplastics across both sides of a process boundary sand filter in this case this surrogate method is not yet intended for use as a general estimator for the total amount of microplastic in a certain system 4 conclusion the presented process flow chart for microplastic sampling and analysis fig 1 allows to establish a workflow based on thermoanalytical and or spectroscopic methods the study presented pitfalls and considerations regarding sampling and analysis for example the need to harmonize sampling methods including representative volumes as well as sampling flow speeds since otherwise there can be no comparability between studies furthermore due to high volume sampling combined with simultaneous capturing of large and small particles the use of cascade filtration is highly recommended for microplastic grab samples at wwtp effluents however this recommendation does not extend to the use of cascade filtration to estimate the size distribution of microplastics when using a thermoanalytical analysis method the study highlighted the potential role of synergies between various analytical approaches to gain more complete information on the sample to determine outliers and interferences for example however even though the combination of analytical techniques helped to verify the observation of an operational outlier event the reason behind the event could not be identified or explained this study was aimed at wwtp effluents however the considerations and procedures are transferrable to other sample types or matrices provided that the necessary adjustments to the sampling and sample preparation are to be made finally the study recommends further investigations of the use of surrogate polymers for determining retention
